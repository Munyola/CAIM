At very high centre-of-mass energies, the interacting objects in $p+p$ collisions are quarks and
gluons (partons). It is believed that there are multiple interactions between the partons in a single
$p+p$ event. Now-a-days the multiplicity dependent study in $p+p$ collisions has gathered considerable
interest in the scientific community. According to several theoretical calculations, high gluon
participation in the the hadronic collisions is the cause for high-multiplicity particle production.
If the interaction is hard enough (large $p_{T}$ transfer), the multiple interactions of partons
lead to production of heavy particles like J/$\psi$. Recently, a linear increase of the relative
J/$\psi$ yield with charged particle multiplicity is observed in $p+p$ collisions in different
experimental results. In the present work, we have studied the contribution of quarks and gluons
to the multiplicity dependence of J/$\psi$ production using pQCD inspired model, PYTHIA8 tune
4C at $\sqrt{s} =$13 TeV by measuring relative J/$\psi$ yield and relative $<p_{T}>$ of J/$\psi$
as a function of charged particle multiplicity for different hard-QCD processes. We have estimated
a newly defined ratio, $r_{pp} = \frac{{<p_{T}^{2}>}_{i^{th} bin}}{{<p_{T}^{2}>}_{MB}}$ to
understand the J/$\psi$ production in high-multiplicity $p+p$ collisions. For the first time
we attempt to measure the nuclear modification factor like observables ($R_{pp}$ and $R_{cp}$)
in $p+p$ collisions to understand the possibility of a system formation in high-multiplicity $p+p$
collisions.
