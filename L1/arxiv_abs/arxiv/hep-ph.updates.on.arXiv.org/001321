In characterizing the yields and ratios various of well identified particles in the ALICE experiment,
we utilize extensive {\it additive} thermal approaches, to which various missing states of the
hadron resonances are taken into consideration, as well. Despite some non-equilibrium conditions
that are slightly driving this statistical approach away from equilibrium, the approaches are
and remain additive and extensive. Besides van der Waals repulsive interactions (assuming that
the gas constituents are no longer point-like, i.e. finite-volume corrections taken into consideration),
finite pion chemical potentials as well as perturbations to the light and strange quark occupation
factors are taken into account. When confronting our calculations to the ALICE measurements, we
conclude that the proposed conditions for various aspects deriving the system out of equilibrium
notably improve the reproduction of the experimental results, i.e. improving the statistical
fits, especially the finite pion chemical potential. This points out to the great role that the non-equilibrium
pion production would play, and the contributions that the hadron resonance missing states come
up with, even when the principles of statistical extensivity and additivity aren't violated. These
results seem to propose revising the conclusions propagated by most of the field, that the produced
particles quickly reach a state of local equilibrium leading to a collective expansion often described
by fluid dynamics. This situation seems not remaining restrictively valid, at very large collision
energies.
