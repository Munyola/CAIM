We develop an extension of the basic inverse seesaw model which addresses simultaneously two of
its drawbacks, namely, the lack of explanation of the tiny Majorana mass term $\mu$ for the TeV-scale
singlet fermions and the difficulty in achieving successful leptogenesis. Firstly, we investigate
systematically leptogenesis within the inverse (and the related linear) seesaw models and show
that a successful scenario requires either small Yukawa couplings, implying loss of experimental
signals, and/or quasi-degeneracy among singlets mass of different generations, suggesting extra
structure must be invoked. Then we move to the analysis of our new framework, which we refer to as hybrid
seesaw. This combines the TeV degrees of freedom of the inverse seesaw with those of a high-scale
($M_N\gg$ TeV) seesaw module in such a way as to retain the main features of both pictures: naturally
small neutrino masses, successful leptogenesis, and accessible experimental signatures. We
show how the required structure can arise from a more fundamental theory with a gauge symmetry or
from warped extra dimensions/composite Higgs. We provide a detailed derivation of all the analytical
formulae necessary to analyze leptogenesis in this new framework, and discuss the entire gamut
of possibilities our scenario encompasses: including scenarios with singlet masses in the enlarged
range $M_N \sim 10^6 - 10^{16}$ GeV. The idea of hybrid seesaw was proposed by us in arXiv:1804.06847;
here, we substantially elaborate upon and extend earlier results.
