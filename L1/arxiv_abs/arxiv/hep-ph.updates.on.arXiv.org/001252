Light moduli fields in string compactifications can have interesting implications for particle
physics and cosmology. Fifth force bounds impose stringent constraints on the interactions of
such moduli with the visible sector. To be consistent with the bounds, they need to be part of hidden
sectors which interact with the Standard Model with weaker-than-Planck suppressed interactions.
We consider scenarios in which the visible sector degrees of freedom are localised in the compactification
and light moduli arise as closed string degrees of freedom associated with hidden sectors which
are geometrically separated (in the extra-dimensions) from the Standard Model. Kinetic mixings
lead to interactions between the moduli and the visible sector - we compute these using Kaehler potentials
of string/M-theory compactifications. We argue that in general these interactions provide a lower
bound on the strength of the interactions between the moduli and the visible sector. The interactions
scale with inverse powers of the volume of the compactification, thus fifth force bounds can be translated
to lower bounds on the volume of the extra-dimensions. We find that compactification volumes have
to be large to evade the bounds. This imposes interesting constraints on quintessence model building
in string theory. Our results for the strength of the interactions can also be used to quantify the
fine-tuning necessary for the stability of the potential of a light modulus against quantum corrections
involving visible sector loops.
