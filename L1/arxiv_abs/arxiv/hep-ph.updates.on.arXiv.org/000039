The discovery of the Higgs particle at around 126 GeV has given us a big hint towards the origin of the
Higgs potential. The running quartic self-coupling decreases and crosses zero somewhere in the
very high energy scale. It is usually considered as a signal of the instability of the standard model
(SM) vacuum, but it can also indicate a link between the physics in the electroweak scale and the Planck
scale. Furthermore, the LHC experiments as well as the flavor physics experiments give strong constraints
on the physics beyond the SM. It urges us to reconsider the widely taken approach to the physics beyond
the SM (BSM), namely the approach based on the gauge unification below the Planck scale and the resulting
hierarchy problem. Motivated by the recent experiments, we first revisit the hierarchy problem
and consider an alternative appoach based on a classical conformality of the SM without the Higgs
mass term. In this talk, I review our recent proposal of a B-L extension of the SM with a flat Higgs potential
at the Planck scale. This model can be an alternative solution to the hierarchy problem as well as
being phenomenologically viable to explain the neutrino oscillations and the baryon asymmetry
of the universe. With an assumption that the Higgs has a flat potential at the Planck scale, we show
that the B-L symmetry is radiatively broken at the TeV scale via the Coleman-Weinberg mechanism,
and it triggers the electroweak symmetry breaking through a radiatively generated scalar mixing.
The ratio of these two breaking scales is dynamically determined by the B-L gauge coupling.
