Prompt double-$J/\psi$ production at high-energy hadron colliders can be considered as a golden
channel to probe double parton scatterings (DPS) --in particular to study gluon-gluon correlations
inside the proton-- and, at the same time, to measure the distribution of linearly-polarised gluons
inside the proton. Such studies however require a good control of both single and DPS in the respective
regions where they are carried out. In this context, we have critically examined two mechanisms
of single parton scatterings (SPS) that may be kinematically enhanced where DPS are thought to be
dominant, even though they are either at higher orders in the strong-coupling or velocity expansion.
First, we have considered a gauge-invariant and infrared-safe subset of the loop-induced contribution
via Colour-Singlet (CS) transitions. We have found it to become the leading CS SPS contributions
at large rapidity separation, yet too small to account for the data without invoking the presence
of DPS yields. Second, we have surveyed the possible Colour-Octet (CO) contributions using both
old and up-to-date non-perturbative long distance matrix elements (LDMEs). We have found that
the pure CO yields crucially depend on the LDMEs. Among all the LDMEs we used, only two result into
a visible modification of the NRQCD (CS+CO) yield, but only in two kinematical distributions measured
by ATLAS, those of the rapidity separation and of the pair invariant mass. These modifications however
do not impact the control region used for their DPS study.
