To derive a structure revealing expression of the neutrino oscillation probability in matter with
non-unitarity, we formulate a perturbative framework with the expansion parameters, the ratio
$\epsilon$ of the solar $\Delta m^2_{sol}$ to the atmospheric $\Delta m^2_{atm}$ and the parameters
which describe unitarity violation (UV). Using the $\alpha$ parametrization for non-unitary
mixing matrix and to first order in our perturbation theory, we show that there is a universal correlation
between the $\nu$SM CP phase $\delta$ and the three UV complex $\alpha$ parameter phases. Using
a phase convention of the mixing matrix $U_{\text{\tiny MNS}}$ in which $e^{ \pm i \delta }$ is attached
to $\sin \theta_{23}$, it is expressed as $[e^{- i \delta } \alpha_{\mu e}$, $\alpha_{\tau e}$,
$e^{i \delta} \alpha_{\tau \mu}]$, always the same combination in all the oscillation channels.
The generation mechanism of the phase correlation and the reason for its stability is elucidated.
However, thanks to the $U_{\text{\tiny MNS}}$ convention dependence, we can eliminate $e^{ \pm
i \delta }$ attached to the $\alpha$ parameters in a different convention with $e^{ \pm i \delta }$
attached to $\sin \theta_{12}$. While it casts doubt on physical nature of the correlation, we describe
the way of resolving this issue and the results emerged are briefly reported. Finally, we have clarified
how unitary evolution of three active neutrinos can be reconciled with the non-unitarity of the
whole system in the presence of non-unitary flavor mixing.
