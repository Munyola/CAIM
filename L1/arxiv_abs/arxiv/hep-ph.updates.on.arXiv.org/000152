This paper continues arXiV: 1205.0410 , 1211.1487 [hep-th]. We also consider here the N=1 SQCD -
like theories (and their Seiberg's dual) with N_c colors and N_F flavors of quarks and with N_F^2
additional colorless fields \Phi, but now with N_F in the range 2N_c<N_F<3N_c. The multiplicities
of various vacua and quark condensates in these vacua are found. The mass spectra of the direct and
dual theories in various vacua are calculated within the dynamical scenario which assumes that
quarks in such N=1 SQCD-like theories can be in two standard phases only. These are either the heavy
quark phase where they are confined or the Higgs phase. Besides, this scenario implied that, unlike
e.g. N=2 SQCD, no additional parametrically light particles (like magnetic monopoles or dyons)
appear in these N=1 SQCD- like theories without adjoint colored scalar fields. The calculated mass
spectra of these direct and dual theories were found to be different, in general. Besides, the mass
spectrum of the dual theory with N_F-N_c colors and N_c+1<N_F<3N_c/2 dual quark flavors
was calculated. And finally, the mass spectrum in the direct N=2 SQCD with N_c colors, N_c+1<N_F<3N_c/2
flavors of quarks with the mass term m{\bar Q}Q in the superpotential, broken down to N=1 by the mass
term \mu_x(X^2) of the adjoint field X, m<<\mu_x<<\Lambda_2, was calculated in vacua
of the baryonic branch and compared with those in two different Seiberg's dual theories. Our conclusions
for this case disagree with those in the recent paper arXiv:1304.0822 of Shifman and Yung.
