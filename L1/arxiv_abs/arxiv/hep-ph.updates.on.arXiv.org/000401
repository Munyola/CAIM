QCD vacuum instantons induce very strong interactions between light quarks, which generate large
dynamical light quark mass M for initially almost massless quarks and can bound these quarks to produce
almost massless pions in accordance with the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry ($S\chi$SB).
On the other hand, the QCD vacuum instantons generate heavy-light quark interactions terms, which
are responsible for the effects of $S\chi$SB in a heavy-light quark system. Summing the re-scattering
series that lead to the total light quark propagator and making few further steps, we get the fermionized
representation of low-frequencies light quark determinant in the presence of the quark sources,
which is relevant for our problems. The next important step in the line of this strategy is to derive
the equation and calculate the heavy quark propagator in the instanton media and in the presence
of light quarks. This one provide finally the heavy and N_f light quark interaction term. As an example,
we derive heavy-light quark meson interaction term for the N_f=2 case. If we take the average instanton
size \rho=0.35 fm, and average inter-instanton distance R=0.856 fm from our previous estimates,
we obtain at LO on 1/N_c expansion dynamical light quark mass M = 570 MeV and instanton media contribution
to heavy quark mass \Delta M=148 MeV. These factors define the coupling between heavy and light quarks
and, certainly, between heavy quarks and light mesons. We will apply this approach to heavy quark
and heavy-light quark systems.
