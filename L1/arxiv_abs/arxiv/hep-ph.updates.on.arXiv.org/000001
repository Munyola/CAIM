Recent Cosmic Microwave Background measurements at high multipoles from the South Pole Telescope
and from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope seem to disagree in their conclusions for the neutrino
and dark radiation properties. In this paper we set new bounds on the dark radiation and neutrino
properties in different cosmological scenarios combining the ACT and SPT data with the nine year
data release of the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP9), Baryon Acoustic Oscillation
data, Hubble Telescope measurements of the Hubble constant, and Supernovae Ia luminosity distance
data. In the standard three massive neutrino case, the two high multipole probes give similar results
if Baryon Acoustic Oscillation data are removed from the analyses and Hubble Telescope measurements
are also exploited. A similar result is obtained within a standard cosmology with Neff massless
neutrinos, although in this case the agreement between these two measurements is also improved
when considering simultaneously Baryon Acoustic Oscillation data and Hubble Space Telescope
measurements. In the Neff massive neutrino case the two high multipole probes give very different
results regardless of the external data sets used in the combined analyses. In the case in which a
dark radiation background with unknown clustering properties is also considered, SPT data seem
to exclude the standard value for the dark radiation viscosity cvis=1/3 at the 2 sigma CL, finding
evidence for massive neutrinos only when combining SPT data with BAO measurements.
