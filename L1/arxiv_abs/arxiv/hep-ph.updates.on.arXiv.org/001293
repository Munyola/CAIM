Dual superconductor picture is one of the most promising scenarios for quark confinement. We have
proposed a new formulation of Yang-Mills theory on the lattice so that the so-called restricted
field obtained from the gauge-covariant decomposition plays the dominant role in quark confinement.
This framework improves the Abelian projection in the gauge-independent manner. For quarks in
the fundamental representation, we have demonstrated some numerical evidences for the dual superconductivity.
However, it is known that the expected behavior of the Wilson loop in higher representations cannot
be reproduced if the restricted part of the Wilson loop is extracted by adopting the Abelian projection
or the field decomposition naively in the same way as in the fundamental representation. In this
talk, therefore, we focus on confinement of quarks in higher representations. By virtue of the non-Abelian
Stokes theorem for the Wilson loop operator, we propose suitable operators constructed from the
restricted field only in the fundamental representation to reproduce the correct behavior of the
original Wilson loop in higher representations. Moreover, we perform lattice simulations to measure
the static potential for quarks in higher representations using the proposed operators. We find
that the proposed operators well reproduce the expected behavior of the original Wilson loop average,
which overcomes the problem that occurs in naively applying Abelian-projection to the Wilson loop
operator for higher representations.
