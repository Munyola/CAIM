High-energy neutrino-nucleus interactions are discussed by considering neutrino-oscillation
experiments and ultra-high-energy cosmic neutrino interactions. The largest systematic error
for the current neutrino oscillation measurements comes from the neutrino-nucleus interaction
part, and its accurate understanding is essential for high-precision neutrino physics, namely
for studying CP violation in the lepton sector. Depending on neutrino beam energies, quasi-elastic,
resonance, Regge, or/and deep inelastic scattering (DIS) processes contribute to the neutrino
cross section. It is desirable to have a code to calculate the neutrino-nucleus cross section in
any kinematical range by combining various theoretical descriptions. On the other hand, the IceCube
collaboration started obtaining cross section data up to the $10^{15}$ eV range, so that it became
necessary to understand ultra-high-energy neutrino interactions beyond the artificial lepton-accelerator
energy range. For future precise neutrino physics including the CP measurement, it is also necessary
to understand accurate nuclear corrections. The current status is explained for nuclear corrections
in DIS structure functions. The possibility is also discussed to find gravitational sources within
nucleons and nuclei, namely matrix elements of quark-gluon energy-momentum tensor. They could
be probed by neutrino interactions without replying on direct ultra-weak "gravitational interactions"
with high-intensity neutrino beams, possibly at a future neutrino factory, by using techniques
of hadron tomography.
