We study the sensitivity of the squark flavor mixing to the CP violating phenomena of $K$, $B^0$ and
$B_s$ mesons in the framework of the split-family scenario, where the first and second family squarks
are very heavy, ${\cal O}(10)$TeV, on the other hand, the third family squark masses are at ${\cal
O}(1)$TeV. In order to constrain the gluino-sbottom-quark mixing parameters, we input the experimental
data of the CP violations of $K$, $B^0$, and $B_s$ mesons, that is $\epsilon_K$, $\phi_d$, and $\phi_s$.
The experimental upper bound of the chromo-EDM of the strange quark is also input. In addition, we
take account of the observed values $\Delta M_{B^0}$, $\Delta M_{B_s}$, the CKM mixing $|V_{ub}|$,
and the branching ratio of $b\to s\gamma$. The allowed region of the mixing parameters are obtained
as $|\delta_{13}^{dL(dR)}|=0\sim 0.01$ and $|\delta_{23}^{dL(dR)}|=0\sim 0.04$. By using
these values, the deviations from the SM are estimated in the CP violations of the $B^0$ and $B_s$
decays. The deviation from the SM one is tiny in the CP asymmetries of $B^0\to \phi K_S$ and $B^0\to
\eta 'K^0$ due to the chromo-EDM of the strange quark. On the other hand, the CP asymmetries $B_s \to
\phi \phi$ and $B_s \to \phi \eta '$ could be largely deviated from the SM predictions. We also predict
the time dependent CP asymmetry of $B^0\to K^0\bar K^0$ and the semi-leptonic CP asymmetries of
$B^0 \to \mu ^-X$ and $B_s \to \mu ^-X$. We expect those precise measurements at Belle II, which will
provide us interesting tests for the squark flavor mixing.
