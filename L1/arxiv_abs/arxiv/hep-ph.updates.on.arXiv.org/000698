Left-Right symmetric model (LRSM) has been an attractive extension of the Standard Model (SM) which
can address the origin of parity violation in the SM electroweak (EW) interactions, generate tiny
neutrino masses, accommodate dark matter (DM) candidates and provide a natural framework for baryogenesis
through leptogenesis. In this work we utilize the minimal LRSM to study the recently reported DAMPE
results of cosmic $e^+e^-$ spectrum which exhibits a tentative peak around 1.4 TeV, while satisfying
the current neutrino data. We propose to explain the DAMPE peak with scalar DM $m_\chi\sim$ 3 TeV
in two scenarios: 1) $\chi\chi \to H_1^{++}H_1^{--} \to \ell_i^+\ell_i^+\ell_j^-\ell_j^-$;
2) $\chi\chi \to H_{k}^{++}H_{k}^{--} \to \ell_i^+\ell_i^+\ell_j^-\ell_j^-$ accompanied
by $\chi\chi \to H_1^+ H_1^- \to \ell_i^+ \nu_{\ell_i} \ell_j^- \nu_{\ell_j}$ with $\ell_{i,j}=e,\mu,\tau$
and $k=1,2$. We impose various experimental constraints such as accommodation of a SM-like Higgs,
the observed DM relic abundance, DM direct detection bounds, lepton flavor violation measurements
and EW precision observables. We also fit the theoretical prediction on $e^+e^-$ spectrum to relevant
experimental data to determine the scalar mass spectrum favored by the DAMPE excess. We find that
there are ample parameter space which can interpret the DAMPE data while passing the above constraints.
Our explanations, on the other hand, usually imply the existence of other new physics at the energy
scale ranging from $10^8 {\rm GeV}$ to $10^{12} {\rm GeV}$. Collider tests of our explanations are
also discussed.
