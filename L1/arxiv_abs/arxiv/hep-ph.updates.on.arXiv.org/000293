The nonlinear Breit-Wheeler process of electron-positron pair production off a probe photon colliding
with a low-frequency and a high-frequency electromagnetic wave that propagate in the same direction
is analyzed. We calculate the pair-production probability and the spectra of the created pair in
the nonlinear Breit-Wheeler processes of pair production off a probe photon colliding with two
plane waves or one of these two plane waves. The differences of these two cases are discussed. We evidently
show, in the two-wave case, the possibility of Breit-Wheeler pair production with simultaneous
photon emission into the low-frequency wave and the highly multi photon phenomena: (i) Breit-Wheeler
pair production by absorption of the probe photon and a large number of photons from the low-frequency
wave, in addition to the absorption of one photon from the high-frequency wave; (ii) Breit-Wheeler
pair production by absorption of the probe photon and one photon from the high-frequency wave with
simultaneous emission of a large number of photons into the low-frequency wave. The phenomenon
of photon emission into the wave can not happen in the one-wave case. Compared with the one-wave case,
the contributions from highly multi-photon processes are largely enhanced in the two-wave case.
The result presented in this article shows a possible way to access to the observation of these photon
emission into the wave and highly multi-photon phenomena in Breit-Wheeler pair production even
with the laser-beam intensity of order $10^{18}~\rm{W/cm^2}$.
