Recent observations by PAMELA, Fermi-LAT, and AMS-02 have conclusively indicated a rise in the
cosmic-ray positron fraction above 10 GeV, a feature which is impossible to mimic under the paradigm
of secondary positron production with self-consistent Galactic cosmic-ray propagation models.
A leading explanation for the rising positron fraction is an additional source of electron-positron
pairs, for example one or more mature, energetic, and relatively nearby pulsars. We point out that
any one of two well-known nearby pulsars, Geminga and Monogem, can satisfactorily provide enough
positrons to reproduce AMS-02 observations. A smoking-gun signature of this scenario is an anisotropy
in the arrival direction of the cosmic-ray electrons and positrons, which may be detectable by existing,
or future, telescopes. The predicted anisotropy level is, at present, consistent with limits from
Fermi-LAT and AMS-02. We argue that the large collecting area of Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes
(ACTs) makes them optimal tools for detecting such an anisotropy. Specifically, we show that much
of the proton and gamma-ray background, which affects measurements of the cosmic-ray electron-positron
spectrum with ACTs, may be controlled in the search for anisotropies. We conclude that observations
using archival ACT data could already constrain or substantiate the pulsar origin of the positron
anomaly, while upcoming instruments (such as the Cherenkov Telescope Array) will provide strong
constraints on the source of the rising positron fraction.
