We analyze the constraints from direct and indirect detection on fermionic Majorana Dark Matter
(DM). Because the interaction with the Standard Model (SM) particles is spin-dependent, a priori
the constraints that one gets from neutrino telescopes, the LHC, direct and indirect detection
experiments are comparable. We study the complementarity of these searches in a particular example,
in which a heavy $Z'$ mediates the interactions between the SM and the DM. We find that for heavy dark
matter indirect detection provides the strongest bounds on this scenario, while IceCube bounds
are typically stronger than those from direct detection. The LHC constraints are dominant for smaller
dark matter masses. These light masses are less motivated by thermal relic abundance considerations.
We show that the dominant annihilation channels of the light DM in the Sun and the Galactic Center
are either $b\bar b$ or $t\bar t$, while the heavy DM annihilation is completely dominated by $Zh$
channel. The latter produces a hard neutrino spectrum which has not been previously analyzed. We
study the neutrino spectrum yielded by DM and recast IceCube constraints to allow proper comparison
with constraints from direct and indirect detection experiments and LHC exclusions. Note that
the original version of the paper contains an important error: the contribution of the $Z$-mediated
processes was overlooked. This changes some of the results of the paper. For the details and the correct
results please see the erratum attached to this file as an appendix.
