We develop a general field-covariant approach to quantum gauge theories. Extending the usual set
of integrated fields and external sources to "proper" fields and sources, which include partners
of the composite fields, we define the master functional Omega, which collects one-particle irreducible
diagrams and upgrades the usual Gamma-functional in several respects. The functional Omega is
determined from its classical limit applying the usual diagrammatic rules to the proper fields.
Moreover, it behaves as a scalar under the most general perturbative field redefinitions, which
can be expressed as linear transformations of the proper fields. We extend the Batalin-Vilkovisky
formalism and the master equation. The master functional satisfies the extended master equation
and behaves as a scalar under canonical transformations. The most general perturbative field redefinitions
and changes of gauge-fixing can be encoded in proper canonical transformations, which are linear
and do not mix integrated fields and external sources. Therefore, they can be applied as true changes
of variables in the functional integral, instead of mere replacements of integrands. This property
overcomes a major difficulty of the functional Gamma. Finally, the new approach allows us to prove
the renormalizability of gauge theories in a general field-covariant setting. We generalize known
cohomological theorems to the master functional and show that when there are no gauge anomalies
all divergences can be subtracted by means of parameter redefinitions and proper canonical transformations.
