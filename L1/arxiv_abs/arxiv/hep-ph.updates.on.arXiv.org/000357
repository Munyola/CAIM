Gauge boson self-couplings are exactly determined by the non-Abelian gauge nature of the Standard
Model (SM), thus precision measurements of these couplings at the LHC provides an important opportunity
to test the gauge structure of the SM and the spontaneously symmetry breaking mechanism. It is a common
way to examine the physics of anomalous quartic gauge boson couplings via effective Lagrangian
method. In this work, we investigate the potential of the process $pp\rightarrow p\gamma p\rightarrow
p W Z q X$ to analyze anomalous quartic $WWZ\gamma$ couplings by two different CP-violating and CP-conserving
effective Lagrangians at the LHC. We calculate $95\%$ confidence level limits on the anomalous
coupling parameters with various values of the integrated luminosity. Our numerical results show
that the best limits obtained on the anomalous couplings $\frac{k_{0}^{W}}{\Lambda^{2}}$, $\frac{k_{c}^{W}}{\Lambda^{2}}$,
$\frac{k_{2}^{m}}{\Lambda^{2}}$ and $\frac{a_{n}}{\Lambda^{2}}$ at $\sqrt{s}=14$ TeV and
an integrated luminosity of $L_{int}=200$ fb$^{-1}$ are $[-1.05;\, 1.05]\times 10^{-6}$ GeV$^{-2}$,
$[-1.44; \, 1.44]\times 10^{-6}$ GeV$^{-2}$, $[-5.09; \, 5.09]\times 10^{-7}$ GeV$^{-2}$ and
$[-1.95;\,1.49]\times 10^{-6}$ GeV$^{-2}$, respectively. Thus, $\gamma p$ mode of photon-induced
reactions at the LHC highly improve the sensitivity limits of the anomalous coupling parameters
$\frac{k_{0}^{W}}{\Lambda^{2}}$, $\frac{k_{c}^{W}}{\Lambda^{2}}$, $\frac{k_{2}^{m}}{\Lambda^{2}}$
and $\frac{a_{n}}{\Lambda^{2}}$.
