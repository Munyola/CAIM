Muon electron scattering experiments such as the proposed MUonE experiment, offer an opportunity
for an improved measurement of the Leading Order hadronic running of $\alpha$, denoted $\Delta
\alpha_{\rm{had}}$. Such a measurement could be utilized to reduce the theoretical uncertainty
on the prediction of the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon, $g-2$. Currently there is a discrepancy
between theory and data for this observable which could potentially be explained by Beyond the Standard
Model (BSM) physics. Here we investigate the possible impact of missing Standard Model (SM) higher
order corrections and BSM physics on the proposed measurement of $\Delta \alpha_{\rm{had}}$.
In principle either could be indirectly fitted into $\Delta \alpha_{\rm{had}}$, causing inconsistencies
if used in a $g-2$ application. The literature suggests a target of 10 ppm on the cross section for
the theoretical accuracy. We assess the validity of this target in detail using a variety of methods,
finding that a 1 ppm target is a more conservative estimate to ensure missing higher orders do not
dominate the theoretical uncertainty. For the potential BSM contributions we study various models
which contribute first at tree- and loop-level. Of particular interest is the impact from dark photon
models, which can potentially affect the measurement of $\Delta \alpha_{\rm{had}}$ at the desired
accuracy. At loop-level there exists in general a kinematic suppression adequate to reduce the
BSM contributions to a level which can be neglected for the extraction of $\Delta \alpha_{\rm{had}}$.
