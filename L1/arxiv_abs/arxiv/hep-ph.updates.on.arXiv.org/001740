We reconsider the problem of the hyperon puzzle and its suggested solution by quark deconfinement
within the two-phase approach to hybrid compact stars with recently obtained hadronic and quark
matter equations of state. For the hadronic phase we employ the hypernuclear equation of state from
the lowest order constrained variational method and the quark matter phase is described by a sufficiently
stiff equation of state based on a color superconducting nonlocal Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model with
constant (model A) and with density-dependent (model B) coefficients. We study the model dependence
of phase transition obtained by a Maxwell construction. Our study confirms that also with the present
set of modern equations of state the quark deconfinement presents a viable solution of the hyperon
puzzle even for the new constraint on the lower limit of the maximum mass from PSR J0740+6620. In this
work we provide with model B for the first time a hybrid star EoS with an intermediate hypernuclear
matter phase between the nuclear and color superconducting quark matter phases, for which the maximum
mass of the compact star reaches $2.2~M_\odot$, in accordance with most recent constraints. In
model A such a phase cannot be realised because the phase transition onset is at low densities, before
the hyperon threshold density is passed. We discuss possible consequences of the hybrid equation
of state for the deconfinement phase transition in symmetric matter as it will be probed in future
heavy-ion collisions at FAIR, NICA and corresponding energy scan programs at the CERN and RHIC facilities.
