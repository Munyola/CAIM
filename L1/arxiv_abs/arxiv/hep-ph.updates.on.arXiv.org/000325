In recent years the search for dark matter has intensified with competitive bounds coming from collider
searches, direct detection, and indirect detection. Collider searches at the Large Hadron Collider
(LHC) lack the necessary center-of-mass energy to probe TeV-scale dark matter. It is TeV-scale
dark matter, however, that remains viable for many models of supersymmetry. In this paper, we study
the reach of a 100 TeV proton-proton collider for neutralino dark matter and compare to 14 TeV LHC
projections. We employ a supersymmetric simplified model approach and present reach estimates
from monojet searches, soft lepton searches, and disappearing track searches. The searches are
applied to pure neutralino spectra, compressed neutralino spectra, and coannihilating spectra.
We find a factor of 4-5 improvement in mass reach in going from 14 TeV to 100 TeV. More specifically,
we find that given a 1% systematic uncertainty, a 100 TeV collider could exclude winos up to 1.4 TeV
and higgsinos up to 850 GeV in the monojet channel. Coannihilation scenarios with gluinos can be
excluded with neutralino masses of 6.2 TeV, with stops at 2.8 TeV, and with squarks at 4.0 TeV. Using
a soft lepton search, compressed spectra with a chargino-neutralino splitting of $\Delta m = 20
- 30$ GeV can exclude neutralinos at $\sim$ 1 TeV. Given a sufficiently long chargino lifetime, the
disappearing track search is very effective and we extrapolate current experimental bounds to
estimate that a $\sim$ 2 TeV wino could be discovered and a $\sim$ 3 TeV wino could be excluded.
