This report is the summary of the Eighth International Conference on Quarks and Nuclear Physics
(QNP2018). Hadron and nuclear physics is the field to investigate ultimate high-density quantum
many-body systems bound by strong interactions. It is intended to clarify matter generation of
universe and properties of quark-hadron many-body systems. The QNP is an international conference
which covers a wide range of hadron and nuclear physics, including quark and gluon structure of hadrons,
hadron spectroscopy, hadron interactions and nuclear structure, hot and cold dense matter, and
experimental facilities. First, I introduce the current status of the hadron and nuclear physics
field related to this conference. Next, the organization of the conference is explained, and a brief
overview of major recent developments is discussed by selecting topics from discussions at the
plenary sessions. They include rapidly-developing field of gravitational waves and nuclear physics,
hadron interactions and nuclear structure with strangeness, lattice QCD, hadron spectroscopy,
nucleon structure, heavy-ion physics, hadrons in nuclear medium, and experimental facilities
of EIC, GSI-FAIR, JLab, J-PARC, Super-KEKB, and others. Nuclear physics is at a fortunate time to
push various projects at these facilities. However, we should note that the projects need to be developed
together with related studies in other fields such as gravitational physics, astrophysics, condensed-matter
physics, particle physics, and fundamental quantum physics.
