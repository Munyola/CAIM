The anomalous magnetic moment of the electron is determined experimentally with an accuracy of
$2.8\times 10^{-13}$ and the uncertainty may decrease by an order of magnitude in the future. While
the current data is in excellent agreement with the standard model, the possible future improvement
in the error in $\Delta a_e= a_e^{\text{exp}}- a_e^{\text{theory}}$ has recently drawn interest
in the electron anomalous magnetic moment as a possible probe of new physics beyond the standard
model. In this work we give an analysis of such physics in an extension of the minimal supersymmetric
standard model with a vector multiplet. In the extended model the electroweak contribution to the
anomalous magnetic moment of the electron include loop diagrams involving in addition to the exchange
of W and Z, the exchange of charginos, sneutrinos and mirror sneutrinos, and the exchange of neutralinos,
sleptons and mirror sleptons. The analysis shows that a contribution to the electron magnetic moment
much larger than expected by $m_e^2/m_\mu^2$ scaling of the deviation of the muon anomalous magnetic
moment over the standard model prediction, i.e., $\Delta a_\mu = 3 \times 10^{-9}$ as given by the
Brookhaven experiment, can be gotten within the MSSM extension. Effects of CP violating phases
in the extended MSSM model on the corrections to the supersymmetric electroweak contributions
to $a_e$ are also investigated. The analysis points to the possibility of detection of new physics
effects with modest improvement on the error in $\Delta a_e= a_e^{\text{exp}} - a_e^{\text{theory}}$.
