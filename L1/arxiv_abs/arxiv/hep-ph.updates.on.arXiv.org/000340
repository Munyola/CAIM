We present SUSY_FLAVOR version 2.5 - a Fortran 77 program that calculates low-energy flavor observables
in the general $R$-parity conserving MSSM. For a set of MSSM parameters as input, the code gives predictions
for: 1. Electric dipole moments of the leptons and the neutron. 2. Anomalous magnetic moments (i.e.
$g-2$) of the leptons. 3. Radiative lepton decays ($\mu\to e\gamma$ and $\tau\to \mu\gamma, e\gamma$).
4. Rare Kaon decays ($K^0_L\to \pi^0\bar\nu\nu$ and $K^+\to \pi^+ \bar\nu\nu$). 5. Leptonic $B$
decays ($B_{s,d}\to l^+ l^-$, $B\to \tau \nu$, $B\to D \tau \nu$ and $B\to D^\star \tau \nu$). 6.
Radiative $B$ decays ($B\to\bar X_s \gamma$). 7. Rare decays of top quark to Higgs boson ($t\to ch,uh$).
8. $\Delta F=2$ processes ($\bar K^0-K^0$, $\bar D-D$, $\bar B_d-B_d$ and $\bar B_s-B_s$ mixing).
SUSY_FLAVOR performs the resummation of all chirally enhanced corrections, i.e. takes into account
the effects enhanced by $\tan\beta$ and/or large trilinear soft mixing terms to all orders in perturbation
theory. All calculations are done using exact diagonalization of the sfermion mass matrices. Comparing
to previous versions, in SUSY_FLAVOR v2.5 parameter initialization in SLHA2 format has been significantly
generalized and simplified, so that program accepts without modifications most of the output files
produced by other codes calculating MSSM spectra and processes. In addition, the routine calculating
branching ratios for rare decays of top quark to Higgs boson has been included. The program can be
obtained from www.fuw.edu.pl/susy_flavor.
