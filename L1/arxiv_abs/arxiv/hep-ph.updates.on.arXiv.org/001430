We explore the discovery prospect of the doubly-charged component of an $SU(2)_L$-triplet scalar
at the future $e^- p$ collider FCC-eh, proposed to operate with an electron beam energy of 60 GeV and
a proton beam energy of 50 TeV. We consider the associated production of the doubly-charged Higgs
boson along with leptons and jet(s), and its subsequent prompt decay to same-sign lepton pair. This
occurs for ${\cal O}(1)$ Yukawa coupling of the scalar triplet with charged leptons, which is expected
for reasonably small vacuum expectation values of the neutral component of the triplet field that
governs the neutrino mass generation in the type-II seesaw. We present our analysis for two different
final states, $3l+\ge1j$ and an inclusive $\ge2l+\ge1j$ channel. Considering its decay to electrons
only, we find that the doubly-charged Higgs with mass around a TeV could be observed at $3\sigma$
confidence level with $\mathcal{O}(200)\, \rm{fb}^{-1}$ of integrated luminosity, while masses
up to 2 TeV could be probed within a few years of data accumulation. The signal proposed here becomes
essentially background-free, if it is triggered in the $\mu\mu$ mode and a $5\sigma$ discovery
is achievable in this channel for a TeV-scale doubly-charged Higgs with an integrated luminosity
as low as $\mathcal{O} (50)\, \rm{fb}^{-1}$. We also highlight the sensitivity of FCC-eh to the
Yukawa coupling responsible for production of the doubly-charged Higgs boson as a function of its
mass in both the $ee$ and $\mu\mu$ channels.
