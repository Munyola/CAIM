We discuss the effective field theory description of bound states composed of a heavy baryon and
antibaryon. This framework is a variation of the ones already developed for heavy meson-antimeson
states to describe the $X(3872)$ or the $Z_c$ and $Z_b$ resonances. We consider the case of heavy
baryons for which the light quark pair is in S-wave and we explore how heavy quark spin symmetry constrains
the heavy baryon-antibaryon potential. The one pion exchange potential mediates the low energy
dynamics of this system. We determine the relative importance of pion exchanges, in particular
the tensor force. We find that in general pion exchanges are probably non-perturbative for the $\Sigma_Q
\bar{\Sigma}_Q$, $\Sigma_Q^* \bar{\Sigma}_Q$ and $\Sigma_Q^* \bar{\Sigma}_Q^*$ systems,
while for the $\Xi_Q' \bar{\Xi}_Q'$, $\Xi_Q^* \bar{\Xi}_Q'$ and $\Xi_Q^* \bar{\Xi}_Q^*$ cases
they are perturbative If we assume that the contact-range couplings of the effective field theory
are saturated by the exchange of vector mesons, we can estimate for which quantum numbers it is more
probable to find a heavy baryonium state. The most probable candidates to form bound states are the
isoscalar $\Lambda_Q \bar{\Lambda}_Q$, $\Sigma_Q \bar{\Sigma}_Q$, $\Sigma_Q^* \bar{\Sigma}_Q$
and $\Sigma_Q^* \bar{\Sigma}_Q^*$ and the isovector $\Lambda_Q \bar{\Sigma}_Q$ and $\Lambda_Q
\bar{\Sigma}_Q^*$ systems, both in the hidden-charm and hidden-bottom sectors. Their doubly-charmed
and -bottom counterparts ($\Lambda_Q {\Lambda}_Q$, $\Lambda_Q {\Sigma}_Q^{(*)}$, $\Sigma_Q^{(*)}
{\Sigma}_Q^{(*)}$) are also good candidates for binding.
