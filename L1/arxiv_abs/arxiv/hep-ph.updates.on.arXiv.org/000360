We consider a local $U(1)_{B-L}$ extension of Zee-Babu model to explain the recently observed 3.5
keV X-ray line signal. The model has three Standard model (SM)-singlet Dirac fermions with different
$U(1)_{B-L}$ charges. A complex scalar field charged under $U(1)_{B-L}$ is introduced to break
the $U(1)_{B-L}$ symmetry. After $U(1)_{B-L}$ symmetry breaking a remnant discrete symmetry
stabilizes the lightest state of the Dirac fermions, which can be a stable dark matter (DM). The second
lightest state, if mass splitting with the stable DM is about 3.5 keV, decays dominantly to the stable
DM and 3.5 keV photon through two-loop diagrams, explaining the X-ray line signal. Two-loop suppression
of the decay amplitude makes its lifetime much longer than the age of the universe and it can be a decaying
DM candidate in large parameter region. We also introduce a real scalar field which is singlet under
both the SM and $U(1)_{B-L}$ and can explain the current relic abundance of the Dirac fermionic DMs.
If the mixing with the SM Higgs boson is small, it does not contribute to DM direct detection. The main
contribution to the scattering of DM off atomic nuclei comes from the exchange of $U(1)_{B-L}$ gauge
boson, $Z'$, and is suppressed below current experimental bound when $Z'$ mass is heavy ($\gtrsim
10$ TeV). If the singlet scalar mass is about 0.1-10 MeV, the DM self-interaction can be large enough
to solve small scale structure problems in simulations with the cold DM, such as, the core-vs-cusp
problem and too-big-to-fail problem.
