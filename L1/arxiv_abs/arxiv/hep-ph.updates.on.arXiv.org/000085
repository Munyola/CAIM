The one-loop level mediated $t-> c\gamma$ decay is analyzed in the framework of 331 models, which
are based on the SU_L(3)XU_X(1) gauge symmetry and require that the quark families transform differently
in order to cancel anomalies, thereby inducing three-level flavor-changing neutral currents
mediated by an extra neutral gauge boson Z' and a neutral scalar boson \phi. These models also predict
new charged gauge and scalar bosons, together with three new quarks, which can be exotic (with charge
-4/3e and 5/3e) or standard model like. Apart from the contribution of the W boson, the $t-> c\gamma$
decay receives contributions induced by the Z' gauge boson and the neutral scalar boson, which are
generic for 331 models. On the other hand, in the so-called minimal 331 model, there are contributions
from the new charged gauge and scalar bosons accompanied by the exotic quarks. We present analytical
results for the most general $t-> c\gamma$ amplitude in terms of dilogarithms and other transcendental
functions. The current bounds on the model parameters are examined and a particular scenario is
discussed in which the corresponding branching ratio could be of the order of 10^{-6}, with the dominant
contributions arising from the charged gauge bosons and the lightest neutral scalar boson, whereas
the Z' contribution would be of the order of 10^{-9} for m_{Z'}>2 TeV. Thus, in 331 models without
exotic quarks, the $t-> c\gamma$ branching ratio would receive the main contribution from the
neutral scalar boson, which could be of the order of 10^{-7} for a Higgs mass of a few hundreds of GeVs.
