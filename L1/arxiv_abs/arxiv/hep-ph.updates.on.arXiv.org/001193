Indirect detection strategies of particle Dark Matter (DM) in Dwarf spheroidal satellite galaxies
(dSphs) typically entail searching for annihilation signals above the astrophysical background.
To robustly compare model predictions with the observed fluxes of product particles, most analyses
of astrophysical data -- which are generally frequentist -- rely on estimating the abundance of
DM by calculating the so-called $\textit{J-factor}$. This quantity is usually inferred from the
kinematic properties of the stellar population of a dSph using Jeans equation, commonly by means
of Bayesian techniques which entail the presence (and additional systematic uncertainty) of prior
choice. Here, extending earlier work, we develop a scheme to derive the profile likelihood for $J$-factors
of dwarf spheroidals for models with five or more free parameters. We validate our method on a publicly
available simulation suite, released by the Gaia Challenge, finding satisfactory statistical
properties for coverage and bias. We present the profile likelihood function and maximum likelihood
estimates for the $J$-factor of ten dSphs . As an illustration, we apply these profiles likelihood
to recently published analyses of gamma-ray data with the Fermi Large Area Telescope to derive new,
consistent upper limits on the DM annihilation cross-section. We do this for a subset of systems,
generally referred to as $\textit{classical dwarfs}$. The implications of these findings for
DM searches are discussed, together with future improvements and extensions of this technique.
