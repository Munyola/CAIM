We investigate dark matter (DM) in the context of the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard
model (MSSM). We scan through the MSSM parameter space and search for solutions that (a) are consistent
with the Higgs discovery and other collider searches; (b) satisfy the flavor constraints from B
physics; (c) give a DM candidate with the correct thermal relic density; and (d) are allowed by the
DM direct detection experiments. For the surviving models with our parameter scan, we find the following
features: (1) The DM candidate is largely a Bino-like neutralino with non-zero but less than 20%
Wino and Higgsino fractions; (2) Constraints from the Higgs sector and rare b decay measurements
exclude the low mass region favored by the DAMA, CoGeNT, and CRESST experiments; (3) The relic density
requirement clearly pins down the solutions from the Z and Higgs resonances (Z,h,H,A funnels) and
co-annihilations; (4) Future direct search experiments will likely fully cover the Z,h funnel
regions, and H,A funnel regions as well except for the "blind spots"; (5) Future indirect search
experiments will be more sensitive to the CP-odd Higgs exchange due to its s-wave nature; (6) The
branching fraction for the SM-like Higgs decay to DM can be as high as 8%, while those from heavier
Higgs decays to neutralinos and charginos can be as high as 20%. We show that collider searches provide
valuable information complementary to what may be obtained from direct detections and astroparticle
observations, and that the Higgs bosons may play an essential role.
