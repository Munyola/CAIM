For a long time doubts have existed on the existence of the f0(1370) meson as an individual object
distinct and separated from the sigma meson. Decays into two charged pions of the f0(1370) are the
main source of an isolated structure localized between 1.2 and 1.5 GeV in the two charged pions mass
spectrum measured in pp Central Exclusive Production (CEP) at 200 GeV at very low four momentum transfer
squared ltl. These data confirm in the two charged pions decay channel the existence of the f0(1370)
as an isolated well identified structure that was previously observed in K+K-, KsKs, 4 neutral pions,
two neutral pions-two charged pions and 4 charged pions decays measured in pbar annihilations at
rest. The decay branching ratios of f0(1370) into sigma-sigma, rho-rho, pion-pion, KKbar, eta-eta
relative to pion-pion decays obtained in analysis of data of pbar annihilations at rest which treat
separately f0(1370) and sigma are respectively 5.6, 3, 1, 1, 0.02. The decay and production properties
of f0(1370) point to a large gg content. CEP interactions at very high energies favour production
of 0++ and 2++ mesons. Selection of events with low ltl at both proton vertices suppresses 2++ structures.
LHC runs dedicated to pp CEP measurements at low ltl could then provide a unique clean source of all
the low energy scalars, cross check the pbar annihilation results and make it clear if and where scalar
gluonium is resident and the nature (composition in terms of qqbar, qqqbarqbar, qqbar-qqbar and
gg) of f0(500), f0(980), f0(1370), f0(1500) and f0(1710).
