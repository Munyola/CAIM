The so-called matrix-element method (MEM) has long been used successfully as a classification
tool in particle physics searches. In the presence of invisible final state particles, the traditional
MEM typically assigns probabilities to an event -- based on whether it is more signal or background-like
-- through a phase space integration over all degrees of freedom of the invisible particles in the
process(es). One inherent shortcoming of the traditional MEM is that the phase space integration
can be slow, and therefore impractical for high multiplicity final states and/or large data sets.
The recent alternative of matrix-element maximisation has recently been introduced to circumvent
this problem, since maximising a highly-dimensional function can be a far more CPU-efficient task
than that of integration. In this work, matrix-element maximisation is applied to the process of
fully-leptonic top associated Higgs production, where the Higgs boson decays to two $b$-quarks.
A variety of optimisation algorithms are tested in terms of their performance and speed, and it is
explicitly found that the maximisation technique is far more CPU-efficient than the traditional
MEM at the cost of a slight reduction in performance. An interesting consequence of using matrix-element
maximisation is that the result of the procedure gives an estimate of the four-momenta for the invisible
particles in the event. As a result, the idea of using these estimates as input information for more
complicated tools is discussed with potential prospects for future developments of the method.
