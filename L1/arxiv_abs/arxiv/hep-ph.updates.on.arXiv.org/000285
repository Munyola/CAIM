Nuclear double $\beta$-decay with two neutrinos is a rare and important process for natural radioactivity
of unstable nuclei. The experimental data of nuclear double $\beta^{-}$-decay with two neutrinos
are analyzed and a systematic law to calculate the half-lives of this rare process is proposed. It
is the first analytical and simple formula for double $\beta$-decay half-lives where the leading
effect from both the Coulomb potential and nuclear structure is included. The systematic law shows
that the logarithms of the half-lives are inversely proportional to the decay energies for the ground
state transitions between parent nuclei and daughter nuclei. The calculated half-lives are in
agreement with the experimental data of all known eleven nuclei with an average factor of 3.06. The
half-lives of other possible double $\beta$-decay candidates with two neutrinos are predicted
and these can be useful for future experiments. The law, without introducing any extra adjustment,
is also generalized to the calculations of double $\beta $-decay half-lives from the ground states
of parent nuclei to the first $0^+$ excited states of daughter nuclei and the calculated half-lives
agree very well with the available data. Some calculated half-lives are the first theoretical results
of double $\beta $-decay half-lives from the ground states of parent nuclei to the first $0^+$ excited
states of daughter nuclei. The similarity and difference between the law of $\alpha$-decay and
that of double $\beta^{-}$-decay are also analyzed and discussed.
