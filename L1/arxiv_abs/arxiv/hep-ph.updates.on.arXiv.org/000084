The search for evidence of extended electroweak symmetry breaking has entered a new phase with the
discovery of a Standard Model (SM)-like Higgs at the LHC. The measurement of Higgs couplings and
direct searches for additional scalars provide complementary avenues for the discovery of new
degrees of freedom. This complementarity is particularly sharp in two Higgs doublet models (2HDMs)
where the couplings of the SM-like Higgs may be directly related to the LHC signals of additional
scalars. In this work we develop a strategy for searching for the second Higgs doublet given the LHC
signals of the recently discovered SM-like Higgs. We focus on a motivated parameter space of flavor-
and CP-conserving 2HDMs in which the couplings of all scalars to SM states are controlled by two parameters.
We construct fits in this parameter space to the signals of the SM-like Higgs and translate these
fits into signal expectations for future measurements of both the SM-like Higgs and additional
scalars, identifying the most promising search channels for discovery or exclusion of new physics.
When kinematically accessible, decays of the heavy neutral scalar Higgs to two light Higgs scalars,
$H \to hh$, and decays of the pseudoscalar Higgs to a light Higgs scalar and $Z$ boson, $A \to Zh$, provide
promising avenues for discovery even when the couplings of the light Higgs are within a few percent
of SM predictions. When the couplings of the light Higgs are exceptionally close to those of the SM,
decays of heavier neutral scalars to $\gamma \gamma$ and $\tau^+ \tau^-$ become particularly important
for discovery.
