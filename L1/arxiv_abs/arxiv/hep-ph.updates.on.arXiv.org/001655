We have studied the meson-baryon $S-$wave interaction, using coupled channels, in the isoscalar
hidden-charm strange sector and $J^P = 1/2^-,3/2^-$ and $5/2^-$. We impose constraints of heavy
quark spin symmetry in the interaction and obtain the non vanishing matrix elements from an extension
of the local hidden gauge approach to the charm sector. The ultraviolet divergences are renormalized
using the same meson-baryon-loops regulator previously employed in the non-strange hidden charm
sector, where a good reproduction of the properties of the newly discovered pentaquark states is
obtained. We obtain five states of $1/2^-$, four of $3/2^-$ and one of $5/2^-$, which could be compared
in the near future with forthcoming LHCb experiments. The $5/2^-$, three of the $3/2^-$ and another
three of the $1/2^-$ resonances are originated from isoscalar $\bar D^{(*)}\Xi_c^\prime$ and
$\bar D^{(*)}\Xi_c^*$ interactions. They should be located just few MeV below the corresponding
thresholds (4446, 4513, 4588 and 4655 MeV), and would be SU(3)-siblings of the isospin 1/2 $\bar
D^{(*)} \Sigma_c^{(*)}$ quasi-bound states previously found, and that provided a robust theoretical
description of the $P_c(4440)$, $P_c(4457)$ and $P_c(4312)$ LHCb exotic states. The another two
$1/2^-$ and $3/2^-$ states obtained in this work are result of the $\bar D^{(*)}\Xi_c-D^{(*)}_s\Lambda_c$
coupled-channels isoscalar interaction, are significantly broader than the others, with widths
of the order of 15 MeV, being $\bar D^{(*)}_s\Lambda_c$ the dominant decay channel.
