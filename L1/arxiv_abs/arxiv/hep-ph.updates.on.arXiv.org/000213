As experimental constraints on the parameter space of the MSSM and close variations thereof become
stronger, the motivation to explore supersymmetric models that challenge some of the standard
assumptions of the MSSM also become stronger. For example, models where the gauginos are Dirac instead
of Majorana have recently received more attention. Beside allowing for a supersoft SUSY breaking
mechanism where the gauginos only provide finite threshold corrections to scalar masses, the cross
section for the production of a squark pairs is reduced. In addition, Dirac gauginos can be used to
build models that possess a U(1)R symmetry. This symmetry can then be identified with a lepton number,
leading to models that are quite different from conventional scenarios. The sneutrinos in these
models can acquire a vev and give mass to the leptons and the down-type squark. The phenomenology
is novel, combining signatures that are typical of R-parity violating scenarios with signatures
arising from leptoquarks. Correspondingly the constraints from electroweak precision data are
also different. In these models, one of the leptons mixes with gauginos and superpotential Yukawa
couplings can contribute to EWPM at tree level. In addition, lepton universality is broken. In this
paper we adapt the operators analysis of Han and Skiba [1] to include the relevant violation of lepton
universality, and do a global fit of the model to electroweak precision data, including all relevant
tree-level and loop-level effects. We obtain bounds on the vev of the sneutrino and on the superpotential
couplings of the model.
