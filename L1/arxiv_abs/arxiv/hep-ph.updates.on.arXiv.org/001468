We have studied the nucleon structure functions $F_{iN}^{EM} (x,Q^2);~i=1,2$, by including contributions
due to the higher order perturbative QCD effect up to NNLO and the non-perturbative effects due to
the kinematical and dynamical higher twist (HT) effects. The numerical results for $F_{iN}^{EM}(x,Q^2)$
are obtained using Martin, Motylinski, Harland-Lang, Thorne (MMHT) 2014 NLO and NNLO nucleon parton
distribution functions (PDFs). The dynamical HT correction has been included following the renormalon
approach as well as the phenomenological approach and the kinematical HT effect is incorporated
using the works of Schienbein et al. These nucleon structure functions have been used as an input
to calculate the nuclear structure functions $F_{iA}^{EM} (x,Q^2)$. In a nucleus, the nuclear
corrections arise because of the Fermi motion, binding energy, nucleon correlations, mesonic
contribution, shadowing and antishadowing effects. These nuclear corrections are taken into
account in the numerical calculations to obtain the nuclear structure functions $F_{iA}^{EM}
(x,Q^2)$, for the various nuclear targets like $^{12}C$, $^{27}Al$, $^{56}Fe$, $^{64}Cu$, $^{118}Sn$,
$^{197}Au$ and $^{208}Pb$ which are of experimental interest. The effect of isoscalarity correction
for nonisoscalar nuclear targets has also been studied. The results for the $F_{iA}^{EM} (x,Q^2)$
are compared with nCTEQ nuclear PDFs parameterization as well as with the experimental results
from JLab, SLAC and NMC in the kinematic region of $0.1 \le x \le 0.8$ for several nuclei.
