We present the physics program of the Belle II experiment, located on the intensity frontier SuperKEKB
e+e- collider. Belle II collected its first collisions in 2018, and is expected to operate for the
next decade. It is anticipated to collect 50/ab of collision data over its lifetime. This book is
the outcome of a joint effort of Belle II collaborators and theorists through the Belle II theory
interface platform (B2TiP), an effort that commenced in 2014. The aim of B2TiP was to elucidate the
potential impacts of the Belle II program, which includes a wide scope of physics topics: B physics,
charm, tau, quarkonium, electroweak precision measurements and dark sector searches. It is composed
of nine working groups (WGs), which are coordinated by teams of theorist and experimentalists conveners:
Semileptonic and leptonic B decays, Radiative and Electroweak penguins, phi_1 and phi_2 (time-dependent
CP violation) measurements, phi_3 measurements, Charmless hadronic B decay, Charm, Quarkonium(like),
tau and low-multiplicity processes, new physics and global fit analyses. This book highlights
"golden- and silver-channels", i.e. those that would have the highest potential impact in the field.
Theorists scrutinised the role of those measurements and estimated the respective theoretical
uncertainties, achievable now as well as prospects for the future. Experimentalists investigated
the expected improvements with the large dataset expected from Belle II, taking into account improved
performance from the upgraded detector.
