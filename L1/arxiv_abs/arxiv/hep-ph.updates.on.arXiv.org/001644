Based on a pQCD inspired dynamical model of jet-medium interactions, Jewel, we have studied possible
modifications to inclusive jet yields and a set of jet shape observables, namely, the fragmentation
functions and radial momentum distributions when jets propagate through a deconfined partonic
medium created in collisions of heavy nuclei at Large Hadron Collider (LHC) energies. Jets are reconstructed
with anti-k T algorithm in the pseudorapidity range $|\eta_{\rm jet} | < 2.1$ for resolution parameter
R= 0.2, 0.3 and 0.4. For background subtraction, a Jewel-compatible 4-Momenta subtraction technique
(4MomSub) have been used. The modification of inclusive jet-yields in Pb-Pb collisions relative
to proton-proton interactions, quantified by $R^{\rm jet}_{AA}$, are seen to be in reasonable
agreement with ALICE, ATLAS and CMS data over a broad transverse momentum range. Jewel is able to
capture the qualitative features of the modifications to the fragmentation functions and radial
momentum distributions in data but not always quantitatively. This quantitative discrepancy
may be related to the simplified treatment of recoil partons in the background model and partly due
to background subtraction procedure itself. Nevertheless, observed modification of jet shape
variables in Jewel corroborates the fact that in-medium fragmentation is harder and more collimated
than the fragmentation in vacuum. We further observe that these modifications depend on the transverse
momentum of jets and it seems that medium resolves the core structure of low momentum jets below 100
GeV/c at LHC energies.
