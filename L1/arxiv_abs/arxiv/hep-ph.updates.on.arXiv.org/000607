We study finite volume effects within the Polyakov loop Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model for two light
and one heavy quarks at vanishing baryon chemical potential and finite temperatures. Finite size
effects are taken into account by means of the Multiple Reflection Expansion formalism. We analyze
several thermodynamic quantities including the equation of state, the interaction measure, the
speed of sound, the surface tension, and the curvature energy for different system sizes, and compare
our results with lattice QCD data. We find that the system undergoes a smooth crossover for all sizes.
In general, the chiral critical temperature depends on the system's size, decreasing around $10
\% $ when the radius goes from infinity to 2 fm, but the critical deconfinement temperature is almost
constant for different radii. Thus, as the drop's size decreases, both critical temperatures become
closer. Many thermodynamic quantities are sensitive to finite volume effects, specially for systems
with radii below $\sim 10$ fm, and for temperatures around and below the crossover one. We find that
the surface tension is largely dominated by the contribution of strange quarks and the curvature
energy is controlled mainly by the behavior of $u$ and $d$ quarks. At large temperatures both quantities
grow proportionally to $T^{3/2}$ but at very low temperatures they saturate to a constant value.
Between these two regimes they have a minimum associated with the chiral transition of up and down
quarks in the case of the curvature energy and of strange quarks in the case of the surface tension.
