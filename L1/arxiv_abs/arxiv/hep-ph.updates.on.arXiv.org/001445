We propose an unprecedented search channel for boosted dark matter (BDM) signals coming from the
present universe, which are distinct from simple neutrino signals including those coming from
the decay or pair-annihilation of dark matter. The signal process is initiated by the scattering
of high-energetic BDM off either an electron or a nucleon. If the dark matter is dark-sector U(1)-charged,
the scattered BDM may radiate a dark gauge boson (dubbed "dark-strahlung") which subsequently
decays to a Standard Model fermion pair. We, for the first time, point out that the existence of this
channel may allow for the interpretation that the associated signal stems from BDM, not from the
dark-matter-origin neutrinos. Although the dark-strahlung process is generally subleading
compared to the lowest-order simple elastic scattering of BDM, we find that the BDM with a significant
boost factor may induce an O(10-20 %) event rate in the parameter regions unreachable by typical
beam-produced dark-matter. We further find that the dark-strahlung channel may even outperform
the leading-order channel in the search for BDM, especially when the latter is plagued by substantial
background contamination. We argue that cosmogenic BDM searches readily fall in such a case, hence
taking full advantage of dark-strahlung. As a practical application, experimental sensitivities
expected in the leading-order and dark-strahlung channels are contrasted in dark gauge boson parameter
space, under the environment of DUNE far detectors, revealing remarkable usefulness of dark-strahlung.
