We update QCD calculations of $B \to \pi, K$ form factors at large hadronic recoil by including the
subleading-power corrections from the higher-twist $B$-meson light-cone distribution amplitudes
(LCDAs) up to the twist-six accuracy and the strange-quark mass effects at leading-power in $\Lambda/m_b$
from the twist-two $B$-meson LCDA $\phi_B^{+}(\omega, \mu)$. The higher-twist corrections from
both the two-particle and three-particle $B$-meson LCDAs are computed from the light-cone QCD
sum rules (LCSR) at tree level. In particular, we construct the local duality model for the twist-five
and -six $B$-meson LCDAs, in agreement with the corresponding asymptotic behaviours at small quark
and gluon momenta, employing the QCD sum rules in heavy quark effective theory at leading order in
$\alpha_s$. The strange quark mass effects in semileptonic $B \to K$ form factors yield the leading-power
contribution in the heavy quark expansion, consistent with the power-counting analysis in soft-collinear
effective theory, and they are also computed from the LCSR approach due to the appearance of the rapidity
singularities. We further explore the phenomenological aspects of the semileptonic $B \to \pi
\ell \nu$ decays and the rare exclusive processes $B \to K \nu \nu$, including the determination
of the CKM matrix element $|V_{ub}|$, the normalized differential $q^2$ distributions and precision
observables defined by the ratios of branching fractions for the above-mentioned two channels
in the same intervals of $q^2$.
