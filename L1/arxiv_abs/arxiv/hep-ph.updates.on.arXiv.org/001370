We discuss $B_c \to \eta_c$ and $B_c \to J/\psi$ semileptonic decays within the Standard Model (SM)
and beyond. The relevant transition form factors, being the main source of theoretical uncertainties
are calculated in the light-cone sum rules approach taking into account all the uncertainties of
the model and are provided in a full $q^2$ range. We calculate the semileptonic branching fractions
and find for the ratios, $R_{\eta_c}|_{\rm SM}= 0.32 \pm 0.02$, $R_{J/\psi}|_{\rm SM} = 0.23 \pm
0.01$. Both predictions are in agreement with other existing calculations and support the current
tension in $R_{J/\psi}$ at 2$\sigma$ level with the experiment. The SM is extended by assuming the
most general effective Hamiltonian describing the $b\rightarrow c\tau\nu$ transition, using
the constraints on the new physics couplings from the recent combined analysis of BaBar, Belle and
LHCb data on semileptonic $B \to D^{(\ast)}$ decays, where the effects of new physics could be visible.
We find that these different new physics scenarios are not able to explain the current experimental
value of $R_{J/\psi}$. To extend the potential of testing the SM in the semileptonic $B_c$ decays,
we consider the forward-backward asymmetry and polarization observables. We also study the 4-fold
differential distributions of $B_c \to J/\psi (J/\psi \to \tilde{\ell}^-\tilde{\ell}^+ ) \ell^-
\bar{\nu}_\ell$, where $\tilde{\ell} = e, \mu$, in the presence of different new physics scenarios
and find that the new physics effects can significantly modify the angular observables and can also
produce effects which do not exist in the SM.
