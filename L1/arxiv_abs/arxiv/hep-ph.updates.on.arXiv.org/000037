Several key processes at the LHC in the standard model and beyond that involve $b$ quarks, such as
single-top, Higgs, and weak vector boson associated production, can be described in QCD either
in a 4-flavor or 5-flavor scheme. In the former, $b$ quarks appear only in the final state and are typically
considered massive. In 5-flavor schemes, calculations include $b$ quarks in the initial state,
are simpler and allow the resummation of possibly large initial state logarithms of the type $\log
\frac{{\cal Q}^2}{m_b^2}$ into the $b$ parton distribution function (PDF), ${\cal Q}$ being the
typical scale of the hard process. In this work we critically reconsider the rationale for using
5-flavor improved schemes at the LHC. Our motivation stems from the observation that the effects
of initial state logs are rarely very large in hadron collisions: 4-flavor computations are pertubatively
well behaved and a substantial agreement between predictions in the two schemes is found. We identify
two distinct reasons that explain this behaviour, i.e., the resummation of the initial state logarithms
into the $b$-PDF is relevant only at large Bjorken $x$ and the possibly large ratios ${\cal Q}^2/m_b^2$'s
are always accompanied by universal phase space suppression factors. Our study paves the way to
using both schemes for the same process so to exploit their complementary advantages for different
observables, such as employing a 5-flavor scheme to accurately predict the total cross section
at NNLO and the corresponding 4-flavor computation at NLO for fully exclusive studies.
