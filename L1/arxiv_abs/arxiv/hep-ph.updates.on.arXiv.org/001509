This perturbative Quantum Chromo Dynamics (pQCD) analysis attempts to present a simultaneous
determination of parton distribution functions (PDFs) and the strong coupling $\alpha_s(M^2_Z)$
from inclusion of inclusive H1 and ZEUS jet, DiJets and TriJets production cross sections data on
the HERA I and II combined data, as the central data sets for probing the internal structure of proton.
To present an accurate pQCD analysis, we separate the role and influence of inclusion jet production
cross sections data from inclusion of the strong coupling $\alpha_s(M^2_Z)$ as an extra fit parameter
parameter on the gluon distribution. We show inclusion of jet, DiJets and TriJets production cross
sections data improves the consistency between experiment and theory of cross sections for neutral
current (NC) and charged current (CC) interactions of deep inelastic ${e^\pm}p$ scattering on
proton up to $\sim 2.8$~\%. In addition, we show inclusion of jet production cross section data and
considering $\alpha_s(M^2_Z)$ as a pQCD free parameter not only reduce dramatically the uncertainty
band of gluon distribution but also improve the consistency between experiment and theory of NC
and CC deep inelastic ${e^\pm}p$ scattering cross sections up to $\sim 3.6$~\%. Our simultaneous
determination of PDFs and the strong coupling $\alpha_s(M^2_Z)$ with inclusion of jet production
cross sections data leads to $\alpha_s^{{\rm NLO}}(M^2_Z) = 0.12041 \pm 0.00086$, which is in a
good agreement with world average and other individual measurements.
