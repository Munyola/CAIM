Assuming a standard Maxwellian for the WIMP velocity distribution, we obtain the bounds from null
WIMP search results of 59.5 days of COSINE-100 data on the DAMA/LIBRA-phase2 modulation effect
within the context of the non-relativistic effective theory of WIMP-nucleus scattering. Here,
we systematically assume that one of the effective operators allowed by Galilean invariance dominates
in the effective Hamiltonian of a spin-1/2 dark matter (DM) particle. We find that, although DAMA/LIBRA
and COSINE-100 use the same sodium-iodide target, the comparison of the two results still depends
on the particle-physics model. This is mainly due to two reasons: i) the WIMP signal spectral shape;
ii) the expected modulation fractions, when the upper bound on the time-averaged rate in COSINE-100
is converted into a constraint on the annual modulation component in DAMA/LIBRA. We find that the
latter effect is the dominant one. For several effective operators the expected modulation fractions
are larger than in the standard spin-independent or spin-dependent interaction cases. As a consequence,
compatibility between the modulation effect observed in DAMA/LIBRA and the null result from COSINE-100
is still possible for several non-relativistic operators. At low WIMP masses such relatively high
values of the modulation fractions arise because COSINE-100 is mainly sensitive to WIMP-sodium
scattering events, due to the higher threshold compared to DAMA/LIBRA. A next COSINE analysis is
expected to have a full sensitivity for the 5$\sigma$ region of DAMA/LIBRA.
