The non-supersymmetric alternative renormalizable minimal $SO(10)$ grand unified model is composed
of the Yukawa couplings with $\textbf{10} \oplus \textbf{120}$ Higgs fields, whereas the right-handed
neutrino Majorana masses are generated via the Witten mechanism. The gauge coupling unification
is achieved with additional contributions of vector-like quarks to the standard model renormalization
group equations. We perform the fitting of the model to the experimental data of charged fermion
masses and the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix. The best fit point is obtained with large pulls
for $m_c$, $m_s$, $m_b$, and $m_\tau$. The modifications to the minimal model by adding either $\textbf{10}'$
or $\textbf{120}'$ are also considered. With more degrees of freedom, the best fit points of these
models are improved. However, the severe tension between the pulls for $m_b$ and $m_\tau$ still
persists due to the specific mass relation between down-type quarks and charged leptons at the unification
scale. We have found that a large deviation of about $7.3 \sigma$ for the tau mass rules out all these
models. In the case with the bottom and vector-like quark mixing, we have found that, although the
minimal alternative models can be well fitted to the charged fermion sector, the bound on the light
neutrino mass scale plays an essential role in excluding this scenario. Therefore, we conclude
that, in the context of the $SO(10)$ grand unification, the Higgs structure of $\textbf{10} \oplus
\overline{\textbf{126}}$ is much more favorable.
