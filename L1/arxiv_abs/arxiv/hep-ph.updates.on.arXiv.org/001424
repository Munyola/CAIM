The goal of this study is to determine a set of diffractive parton distribution function (diffractive
PDFs) from a QCD analysis of all available and up-to-date diffractive deep inelastic scattering
(diffractive DIS) data sets from HERA $ep$ collider, including the most recent H1 and ZUES combined
inclusive diffractive cross section measurements. This extraction of diffractive PDFs, referred
to as {\tt HK19-DPDF}, is performed at next-to-leading (NLO) and next-to-next-to-leading (NNLO)
in perturbative QCD. This new determination of diffractive PDFs is based on the fracture functions
methodology, a QCD framework designed to provide a statistically sound representation of diffractive
DIS processes. Heavy quark contributions to the diffractive DIS are considered within the framework
of the FONLL general mass variable flavor number scheme (GM-VFNS) and the "Hessian approach" is
used to determine the uncertainties of diffractive PDFs. We discuss the novel aspects of the approach
used in the present analysis, namely an optimized and flexible parametrization of the diffractive
PDFs as well as a strategy based on the fully factorization theorem for diffractive hard processes.
We then present the diffractive PDFs, and discuss the fit quality and the stability upon variations
of the kinematic cuts and the fitted data sets. We find that the systematic inclusion of higher-order
QCD corrections could improves the description of the data. We compare the extracted sets of diffractive
PDFs based on the fracture functions approach to other recent sets of diffractive PDFs, finding
in general very good agreements.
