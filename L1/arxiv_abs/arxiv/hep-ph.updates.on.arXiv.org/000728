The magnetic moment of free fermions in the curved spacetime has been studied based on the general
relativity. Adopting the Schwarzschild metric for the background spacetime, the effective value
of the magnetic moment has been calculated up to the post-Newtonian order $O(1/c^2)$ for three cases
(A) Dirac particles with g=2, (B) neutral fermions with g$\ne$2 and e=0 and (C) charged fermions
with g$\ne$2 and e$\ne$0. The result shows their gravity dependence is given as $\mu_{\rm m}^{\rm
eff}= (1\!+\!3\phi/c^2) \,\mu_{\rm m} $ for all of these cases in which the coupling between fermions
and the electromagnetic field is essentially different. It implies that the magnetic moment is
influenced by the spacetime curvature on the basis of the general relativity commonly for point-like
fermions, composite fermions and spread fermions dressed with the vacuum fluctuation. The gravitational
effect affects the gyro-magnetic ratio and the anomalous magnetic moment as ${\rm g}^{\rm eff}
\!\simeq\! (1 \!+\! 3\phi/c^2)\,{\rm g} $, ${a}^{\rm eff} \!\simeq\! a \!+\! 3(1\!+\!a)\,\phi/c^2
$. Consequently, the anomalous magnetic moment of fermions with g$\simeq$2 measured on the Earth's
surface contains the gravitational effect as $|a^{\rm eff}| \simeq 3|\phi|/c^2 \simeq 2.1\!\times\!
10^{-9}$, which implies that the gravitational anomaly of $2.1\!\times\! 10^{-9}$ is induced
by the curvature of the spacetime on the basis of the general relativity in addition to the quantum
radiative corrections for all fermions including electrons and muons.
