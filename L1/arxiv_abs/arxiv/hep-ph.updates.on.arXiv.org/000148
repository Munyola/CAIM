There exists a need to address and resolve the growing evidence for short-baseline neutrino oscillations
and the possible existence of sterile neutrinos. Such non-standard particles require a mass of
$\sim 1$ eV/c$^2$, far above the mass scale associated with active neutrinos, and were first invoked
to explain the LSND $\bar \nu_\mu \rightarrow \bar \nu_e$ appearance signal. More recently, the
MiniBooNE experiment has reported a $2.8 \sigma$ excess of events in antineutrino mode consistent
with neutrino oscillations and with the LSND antineutrino appearance signal. MiniBooNE also observed
a $3.4 \sigma$ excess of events in their neutrino mode data. Lower than expected neutrino-induced
event rates using calibrated radioactive sources and nuclear reactors can also be explained by
the existence of sterile neutrinos. Fits to the world's neutrino and antineutrino data are consistent
with sterile neutrinos at this $\sim 1$ eV/c$^2$ mass scale, although there is some tension between
measurements from disappearance and appearance experiments. In addition to resolving this potential
major extension of the Standard Model, the existence of sterile neutrinos will impact design and
planning for all future neutrino experiments. It should be an extremely high priority to conclusively
establish if such unexpected light sterile neutrinos exist. The Spallation Neutron Source (SNS)
at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, built to usher in a new era in neutron research, provides a unique
opportunity for US science to perform a definitive world-class search for sterile neutrinos.
