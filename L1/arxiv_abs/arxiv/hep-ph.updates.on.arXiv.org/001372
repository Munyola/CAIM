Fundamental symmetry tests of baryon number violation in low-energy experiments can probe beyond
the Standard Model (BSM) explanations of the matter-antimatter asymmetry of the universe. Neutron-antineutron
oscillations are predicted to be a signature of many baryogenesis mechanisms involving low-scale
baryon number violation. This work presents a pioneering first-principles calculation of neutron-antineutron
matrix elements of the six-quark operators needed to accurately connect measurements of the neutron-antineutron
oscillation rate to constraints on $|\Delta B|=2$ baryon number violation in BSM theories. Our
calculation is performed with state-of-the-art chirally symmetric QCD discretization with physical
quark masses and robust control over the majority of lattice systematic uncertainties, including
nonperturbative renormalization of the six-quark operators to the $\overline{\text{MS}}$ scheme.
We find that our results based on realistic QCD predict at least an order of magnitude more events
in neutron-antineutron oscillation experiments compared to previous estimates based on the MIT
bag model for the same BSM parameters. Phenomenological implications are highlighted by comparing
expected bounds from proposed neutron-antineutron oscillation experiments to predictions of
a specific model of post-sphaleron baryogenesis, thus demonstrating the impact future experiments
can make in searches for new physics. Lattice artifacts and other systematic uncertainties that
are not controlled in this pioneering calculation are not expected to significantly change this
conclusion.
