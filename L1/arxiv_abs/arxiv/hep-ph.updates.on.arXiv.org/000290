New experimental data about proton-proton collisions obtained at the LHC allow to widen strongly
the energy interval where one gets some knowledge about the structure of their interaction region.
Using the data about the elastic scattering, it is shown how the shape and the darkness of the interaction
region of colliding protons change with increase of their energies. In particular, the collisions
become fully absorptive at small impact parameters at LHC energies that results in some special
features of inelastic processes as well. Possible evolution of the shape from the dark core at the
LHC to the fully transparent one is discussed that implies the terminology of the black disk would
be replaced by the black torus. The parameter which determines the opacity of central collisions
also plays a crucial role in the behavior of the differential cross section of elastic scattering
outside the diffraction cone where the predictions of all phenomenological models failed at LHC
energies. The role of the ratio of real to imaginary part of the elastic scattering amplitude at non-forward
scattering becomes decisive there as seen from the unitarity condition. The obtained results allow
to estimate this ratio outside the diffraction cone for the first time by comparison with experiment
at LHC energies which happens to be drastically different from its values measured at forward scattering.
Moreover, the behaviours of the real and imaginary parts separately differ in different phenomenological
models and in the approach based on the unitarity condition. This problem is still waiting for its
resolution.
