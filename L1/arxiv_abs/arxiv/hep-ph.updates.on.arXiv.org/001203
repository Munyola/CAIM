Extending the Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model by an $\mathbb{A}_{4}\times \boldsymbol{Z}_{3}$
flavor symmetry and three right-handed neutrinos, we first consider the trimaximal neutrino mixing
realized by introducing only two flavons with the prediction of non zero $\theta _{13}$ and nearly
maximal $\theta _{23}$ mixing angles. Then, by using the global fit $3\sigma $ ranges of the neutrino
oscillation parameters, we study the phenomenological implications of the model for both normal
and inverted mass hierarchies. In particular, we numerically evaluated the three light neutrino
masses and their sum $\sum m_{i}$, the effective Majorana mass $m_{\beta \beta }$, the electron
neutrino mass $m_{\nu _{e}}$, and the $CP$ violating phase $\delta _{CP}$. We find that the obtained
ranges of $m_{\beta \beta }$\ and $m_{\nu _{e}}$ are accessible by current and future experiments
while the obtained ranges of $\sum m_{i}$ and $\delta _{CP}$ lie within the current experimental
data. We also discuss the domain walls induced by the spontaneous breaking of the $\mathbb{A}_{4}\times
\boldsymbol{Z}_{3}$ discrete symmetry in both charged and chargeless lepton sectors. The domain
walls in the charged lepton sector occurs at high energy scale leading to unproblematic domain walls,
while in the neutrino sector they are inevitable. To solve this problem, we reconsidered the well-known
approach that relies on the explicit breaking of the discrete symmetry through the insertion of
Planck-suppressed operators induced by supergravity. \keywords{Neutrino physics, Trimaximal
