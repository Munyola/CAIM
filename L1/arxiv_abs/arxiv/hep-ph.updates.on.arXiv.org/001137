In this paper, we test the self-consistencies of the standard and the covariant light-front quark
model and study the zero-mode issue via the decay constants of pseudoscalar ($P$), vector ($V$)
and axial-vector ($A$) mesons, as well as the $P\to P$ weak transition form factors. With the traditional
type-I correspondence between the manifestly covariant and the light-front approach, the resulting
$f_{V}$ as well as $f_{^1\!A}$ and $f_{^3\!A}$ obtained with the $\lbd=0$ and $\lbd=\pm$ polarization
states are different from each other, which presents a challenge to the self-consistency of the
covariant light-front quark model. However, such a self-consistency problem can be "resolved"
within the type-II scheme, which requires an additional replacement $M\to M_0$ relative to the
type-I case. Moreover, the replacement $M\to M_0$ is also essential for the self-consistency of
the standard light-front quark model. In the type-II scheme, the valence contributions to the physical
quantities~(${\cal Q}$) considered in this paper are alway the same as that obtained in the standard
light-front quark model, $[{\cal Q}]_{\rm val.}=[{\cal Q}]_{\rm SLF}$, and the zero-mode contributions
to $f_{V,^1\!A,^3\!A}$ and $f_-(q^2)$ exist only formally but vanish numerically, which implies
further that $[{\cal Q}]_{\rm val.}\dot{=} [{\cal Q}]_{\rm full}$. In addition, the manifest
covariance of the covariant light-front quark model is violated in the traditional type-I scheme,
but can be recovered by taking the type-II scheme.
