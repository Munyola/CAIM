In the QCD evolution of transverse momentum dependent parton distribution and fragmentation functions,
the Collins-Soper evolution kernel includes both a perturbative short-distance contribution
as well as a large-distance non-perturbative, but strongly universal, contribution. In the past,
global fits, based mainly on larger $Q$ Drell-Yan-like processes, have found substantial contributions
from non-perturbative regions in the Collins-Soper evolution kernel. In this article, we investigate
semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering measurements in the region of relatively small $Q$,
of the order of a few GeV, where sensitivity to non-perturbative transverse momentum dependence
may become more important or even dominate the evolution. Using recently available deep inelastic
scattering data from the COMPASS experiment, we provide estimates of the regions of coordinate
space that dominate in TMD processes when the hard scale is of the order of only a few GeV. We find that
distance scales that are much larger than those commonly probed in large $Q$ measurements become
important, suggesting that the details of non-perturbative effects in TMD evolution are especially
significant in the region of intermediate $Q$. We highlight the strongly universal nature of the
non-perturbative component of evolution, and its potential to be tightly constrained by fits from
a wide variety of observables that include both large and moderate $Q$. On this basis, we recommend
detailed treatments of the non-perturbative component of the Collins-Soper evolution kernel
for future TMD studies.
