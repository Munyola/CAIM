We study simultaneous evolution of large scale hypermagnetic fields and the asymmetries of quarks,
leptons and Higgs boson in the temperature range from 10TeV to 100GeV. Above 10TeV, we identify all
of the major fast interactions and use the associated conservation laws as constraints on the initial
conditions at 10TeV. Below 10TeV, we identify the major processes which fall out of equilibrium
or emerge as non-negligible processes and derive the relevant evolution equations. These include
the Abelian anomalies which violate fermion numbers, direct and inverse Higgs decays that change
the chiralities of fermions, and weak sphalerons which violate the left-handed fermion numbers.
We also consider the contributions of all fermionic chemical potentials to the UY(1) Chern-Simons
term which affects the evolution through the AMHD equations. Thus, we present a minimal set of self-consistent
initial conditions and evolution equations which respect all constraints coming from conservation
laws, fast processes and charge neutrality of the plasma. We solve the coupled evolution equations
and find that initial large hypermagnetic field can produce matter asymmetries starting from zero
initial value, and vice versa provided an initial seed of hypermagnetic field is present and the
rate of the electron Yukawa processes is lower. We find that our model yields acceptable values for
baryon asymmetry and magnetic field. However, the scale of the magnetic field obtained is much smaller
than the observational data, even when the turbulence driven inverse cascade mechanism in the broken
phase is taken into account.
