All real and virtual infrared singularities in the standard analysis of the perturbative Quantum
Electrodynamics (like that of Yennie-Frautschi-Suura) are associated with photon emissions
from the external legs in the scattering process. External particles are stable, with the zero decay
width. Such singularities are well understood at any perturbative order and are resummed. The case
of production and decay of the semi-stable {\em neutral} particles like $Z$ boson or $\tau$ lepton,
with the narrow decay width, $\Gamma/M \ll 1$, is also well understood at any perturbative order
and soft photon resummation can be done. For the absent or loose upper cut-off on the total photon
energy $\omega$ the production and decay process of the semi-stable (neutral) particles decouples
approximately and can be considered quasi-independently. In particular soft photon resummation
can be done separately for the production and decay process treating semi-stable (neutral) particle
as stable. So far, consistent treatment of the soft photon resummation for semi-stable {\em charged}
particles like $W^\pm$ boson is not available in the literature and the aim of this work is to present
a solution for this problem. Generally, it should be feasible because the underlying physics is
the same as in the case of the neutral semi-stable resonances -- in the limit $\Gamma/M \ll 1$ production
and decay processes for charged particles also necessarily decouple due to long lifetime of the
particles. The technical problems to be solved in this work are related to the fact that semi-stable
charged particle are able to emit photons.
