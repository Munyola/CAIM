We examine the prospects of using two alternative and complementary ways to explore the regions
that are favored by global constraints in two simple unified supersymmetric models: the CMSSM and
the NUHM. First, we consider BR(Bs->\mu\mu), which has recently been for the first time measured
by LHCb. In the CMSSM we show that ultimate, but realistic, improvement in the determination of the
observable to about 5-10% around the Standard Model value would strongly disfavor the A-funnel
region, while not affecting much the other favored regions. Second, we show that all the favored
regions of the CMSSM will be, for the most part, sensitive to direct dark matter searches in future
one-tonne detectors. A signal at low WIMP mass (<=450 GeV) and low spin-independent cross section
would then strongly favor the stau coannihilation region while a signal at higher WIMP mass (~800
GeV to ~1.2 TeV) would clearly point to the region where the neutralino is higgsino-like with mass
~1 TeV. A nearly complete experimental testing of the CMSSM over multi-TeV ranges of superpartner
masses, far beyond the reach of direct SUSY searches at the LHC, can therefore be achievable. In the
NUHM, in contrast, similar favored regions exist but a sample study reveals that even a precise determination
of BR(Bs->\mu\mu) would have a much less constraining power on the model, including the A-funnel
region. On the other hand, this could allow one to, by detecting in one-tonne detectors a signal for
500 GeV<m_{\chi}<800 GeV, strongly disfavor the CMSSM.
