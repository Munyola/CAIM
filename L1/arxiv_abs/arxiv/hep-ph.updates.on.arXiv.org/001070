The type-II seesaw mechanism with an isospin-triplet scalar $\Delta_L$ provides one of the most
compelling explanations for the observed smallness of neutrino masses. The triplet contains a
doubly-charged component $H_L^{\pm\pm}$, which dominantly decays to either same-sign dileptons
or to a pair of $W$ bosons, depending on the size of the triplet vacuum expectation value. However,
there exists a range of Yukawa couplings $f_L$ of the triplet to the charged leptons, wherein a relatively
light $H_L^{\pm\pm}$ tends to be long-lived, giving rise to distinct displaced-vertex signatures
at the high-energy colliders. We find that the displaced vertex signals from the leptonic decays
$H_L^{\pm\pm} \to \ell_\alpha^\pm \ell_\beta^\pm$ could probe a broad parameter space with $10^{-10}
\lesssim |f_L| \lesssim 10^{-6}$ and 45.6 GeV $< M_{H_L^{\pm\pm}} \lesssim 200$ GeV at the high-luminosity
LHC. Similar sensitivity can also be achieved at a future 1 TeV $e^+e^-$ collider. The mass reach
can be extended to about 500 GeV at a future 100 TeV proton-proton collider. Similar conclusions
apply for the right-handed triplet $H_R^{\pm\pm}$ in the TeV-scale left-right symmetric models,
which provide a natural embedding of the type-II seesaw. We show that the displaced vertex signals
are largely complementary to the prompt same-sign dilepton pair searches at the LHC and the low-energy,
high-intensity/precision measurements, such as neutrinoless double beta decay, charged lepton
flavor violation, electron and muon anomalous magnetic moments, muonium oscillation and M{\o}ller
scattering.
