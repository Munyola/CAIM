Modified interactions in the electroweak sector may lead to scattering amplitudes that grow with
energy compared to their Standard Model (SM) counterparts. We present a detailed study of all $2\to2$
scattering amplitudes involving at least one top quark and a pair of EW bosons. We analyse the high
energy behaviour of the amplitudes using the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) to parametrise
the departures from the SM. We discuss the origin of the energy growth that arise from effective contact
interactions by appealing to the Goldstone equivalence theorem and find that the amplitudes obey
expected patterns of (non-)interference. The results are connected to unitary-violating behaviour
in the framework of anomalous SM interactions. Therein, we identify the appearance of additional
growth due to the violation of $SU(2)$ gauge symmetry that leads to substantial differences between
the SMEFT and the anomalous couplings approaches. We also discuss the embeddings of the scattering
amplitudes into physical collider processes, presenting the parametric SMEFT sensitivity to
relevant top quark operators and paying special attention to the extent to which the high energy
behaviour of the $2\to2$ amplitude is retained in the actual processes accessible at colliders.
The effective $W$ approximation is exploited to gain analytical insight into the embeddings of
the $2\to2$ helicity amplitudes. Finally, we provide a compendium of processes detailing numerous
directions in which the SMEFT parameter space can be accessed through high energy top quark processes
in current and future colliders.
