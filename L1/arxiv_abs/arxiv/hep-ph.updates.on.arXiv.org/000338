In a large class of models for Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs), the WIMP mass $M$ lies
far above the weak scale $m_W$. This work identifies universal Sudakov-type logarithms $\sim \alpha
\log^2 (2\,M/m_W)$ that spoil the naive convergence of perturbation theory for annihilation processes.
An effective field theory (EFT) framework is presented, allowing the systematic resummation of
these logarithms. Another impact of the large separation of scales is that a long-distance wave-function
distortion from electroweak boson exchange leads to observable modifications of the cross section.
Careful accounting of momentum regions in the EFT allows the rigorously disentanglement of this
so-called Sommerfeld enhancement from the short distance hard annihilation process. The WIMP
is modeled as a heavy-particle field, while the light, energetic, final-state electroweak gauge
bosons are treated as soft and collinear fields. Hard matching coefficients are computed at renormalization
scale $\mu \sim 2\,M$, then evolved down to $\mu \sim m_W$, where electroweak symmetry breaking
is incorporated and the matching onto the relevant quantum mechanical Hamiltonian is performed.
The example of an $SU(2)_W$ triplet scalar dark matter candidate annihilating to line photons is
used for concreteness, allowing the numerical exploration of the impact of next-to-leading order
corrections and log resummation. For $M \simeq 3$ TeV, the resummed Sommerfeld enhanced cross section
is reduced by a factor of $\sim 3$ with respect to the tree-level fixed order result.
