Inclusive hadron production in $e^+e^-$ annihilation has long been used to study both single hadron
fragmentation functions (FF) and dihadron fragmentation functions (DiFF). In particular, the
polarized DiFFs can be accessed in electron-positron annihilation by measuring azimuthal correlations
between two back-to-back pairs of hadrons in the center of mass system, where the relevant structure
functions can be expressed as convolutions of two (polarized) DiFFs. Here we explore the advantages
of measuring the inclusive back-to-back production of a single hadron on one side against a hadron
pair on the opposite side of the detector in two jet events. The leading twist cross section for this
process contains convolutions of the corresponding single hadron FFs on one side and the DiFFs for
the hadron pair on the other side, which furnishes several interesting new opportunities. A measurement
of the unpolarized cross section with a number of different types of observed hadrons will help in
untangling the quark flavor dependence of the unpolarized DiFFs, when the results are analyzed
together with the inclusive measurements of dihadron pairs, such as those recently performed by
the $\texttt{BELLE}$ collaboration. Even more interesting, with a polarized hyperon on one side
we can study the quark spin-dependent DiFFs of an unpolarized hadron pair on the other side. This,
in turn, will allow us to test the universality of the spin-dependent DiFFs entering the cross sections
of electron-positron annihilation and semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering processes.
