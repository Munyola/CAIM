The $\bar{B}\to D^{*+} l^-\bar{\nu}_{l}$ branching fraction ratio $R(D^{*})$ has shown intriguing
discrepancies between the Standard Model prediction and measurements performed at BaBar, Belle
and LHCb experiments, a possible sign of beyond the Standard Model physics. Theoretical studies
prove how observables related to the $\bar{B}\to D^{*+} l^-\bar{\nu}_{l}$ differential decay
distribution can be used to further constrain New Physics contributions, but their experimental
measurements is lacking to date. This article presents the attainable precision on the measurement
of $\bar{B}\to D^{*+} l^-\bar{\nu}_{l}$ angular and CP-violating observables by exploiting
approximate reconstruction algorithms using information from detectable final-state particles
only, a case of special interest for hadron collider experiments. The resolution on the phase space
variables is studied using $\bar{B}\to D^{*+} l^-\bar{\nu}_{l}$ decays simulated in a forward
detector geometry like LHCb. A novel method to correct the observable values for the reconstruction
inaccuracies based on detector simulation is successfully tested on simulated data and the decrease
in precision with respect to a perfect reconstruction is evaluated. The $D^{*+}$ longitudinal
polarization fraction and one of the CP-violating observables can be measured losing a factor 2
and 5 in precision, respectively. The extraction of phase space distributions from the template
fit selecting $\bar{B}\to D^{*+} l^-\bar{\nu}_{l}$ decays and associated systematic uncertainties
are also discussed.
