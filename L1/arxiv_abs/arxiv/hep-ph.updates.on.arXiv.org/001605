We build a highly predictive 3-3-1 model, where the field content is extended by including several
$SU(3)_{L}$ scalar singlets and six right handed Majorana neutrinos. In our model the $SU(3)_{C}\times
SU\left( 3\right) _{L}\times U\left( 1\right) _{X}$ gauge symmetry is supplemented by the $A_{4}\times
Z_{4}\times Z_{6}\times Z_{16}\times Z_{16}^{\prime }$ discrete group, which allows to get a
very good description of the low energy fermion flavor data. In the model under consideration, the
$A_{4}\times Z_{4}\times Z_{6}\times Z_{16}\times Z_{16}^{\prime }$ discrete group is broken
at very high energy scale down to the preserved $Z_{2}$ discrete symmetry, thus generating the observed
pattern of SM fermion masses and mixing angles and allowing the implementation of the loop level
inverse seesaw mechanism for the generation of the light active neutrino masses, respectively.
The obtained values for the physical observables in the quark sector agree with the experimental
data, whereas those ones for the lepton sector also do, only for the case of inverted neutrino mass
spectrum. The normal neutrino mass hierarchy scenario of the model is ruled out by the neutrino oscillation
experimental data. We find an effective Majorana neutrino mass parameter of neutrinoless double
beta decay of $% m_{ee}=46.9$ meV, a leptonic Dirac CP violating phase of $-81.37^{\circ}$ and a
Jarlskog invariant of about $10^{-2}$ for the inverted neutrino mass hierarchy. The preserved
$Z_{2}$ symmetry allows for a stable scalar dark matter candidate.
