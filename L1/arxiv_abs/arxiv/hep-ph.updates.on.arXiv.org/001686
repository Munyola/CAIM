The recent discovery of three pentaquark peaks --- the $P_c(4312)$, $P_c(4440)$ and $P_c(4457)$
--- by the LHCb collaboration has a series of interesting consequences for hadron spectroscopy.
If these hidden-charm objects are indeed hadronic molecules, as suspected, they will be constrained
by heavy-flavor and SU(3)-flavor symmetries. The combination of these two symmetries will imply
the existence of a series of five-flavor pentaquarks with quark content $\bar{b} c s d u$ and $b \bar{c}
s d u$, that is, pentaquarks that contain each of the five quark flavors that hadronize. In addition,
from SU(3)-flavor symmetry alone we expect the existence of light-flavor partners of the three
$P_c$'s pentaquarks with strangeness $S=-1$ and $S=-2$. The resulting structure for the molecular
pentaquarks is analog to the light-baryon octet: we can denote the pentaquarks as $P_{Q' \bar{Q}}^N$,
$P_{Q' \bar{Q}}^{\Lambda}$, $P_{Q' \bar{Q}}^{\Sigma}$, $P_{Q' \bar{Q}}^{\Xi}$ depending
on the heavy- and light-quark content (with $N$, $\Lambda$, $\Sigma$, $\Xi$ the member of the light-baryon
octet to which the light-quark structure resembles and $Q'$, $\bar Q$ the heavy quark-antiquark
pair). In total we predict $45$ new pentaquarks, but there could be up to $109$ undiscovered states
if we also consider heavy-quark spin symmetry. If an isoquartet ($I=\tfrac{3}{2}$) hidden-charm
pentaquark is ever observed, this will in turn imply a second multiplet structure resembling the
light-baryon decuplet: $P_{Q' \bar{Q}}^{\Delta}$, $P_{Q' \bar{Q}}^{\Sigma^*}$, $P_{Q' \bar{Q}}^{\Xi^*}$,
$P_{Q' \bar{Q}}^{\Omega}$.
