New neutral vector bosons $Z'$ decaying to charged gauge boson pairs $W^+W^-$ are predicted in many
scenarios of new physics, including models with an extended gauge sector such as $E_6$, left-right
symmetric $Z^\prime_{\rm LRS}$ and the sequential standard model $Z'_{\rm SSM}$. For these benchmark
models we calculate and present theoretical expectations for different values of the $Z^\prime$
mass $M_2$ and mixing parameter $\xi$. Our results are based on the narrow width approximation which
allows to make a convenient comparison of experiment to theoretical benchmark models. The diboson
production allows to place stringent constraints on the $Z$-$Z'$ mixing angle and the $Z'$ mass,
which we determine by using data from $pp$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV recorded by the ATLAS
detector at the CERN LHC, with integrated luminosity of $\sim$ 36 fb$^{-1}$. By comparing the experimental
limits to the theoretical predictions for the total cross section of $Z'$ resonant production and
its subsequent decay into $W^+W^-$ pairs, we show that the derived constraints on the mixing angle
for the benchmark models are of the order of a few $\times 10^{-4}$, i.e., greatly improved with respect
to those derived from the global analysis of electroweak data. We combine the limits derived from
diboson production data with those obtained from the Drell--Yan process in order to significantly
extend the exclusion region in the $M_{2}$-$\xi$ parameter plane. Also, we demonstrate that further
improvement on the constraining of this mixing can be achieved through analysis of the full set of
Run~II data.
