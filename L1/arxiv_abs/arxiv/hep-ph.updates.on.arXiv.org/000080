Within the framework of the non-relativistic QCD, we make a detailed discussion on the heavy quarkonium
production at a $e^+ e^-$ collider with high luminosity up to ${\cal L}\propto 10^{34-36}{\rm cm}^{-2}
{\rm s}^{-1}$ and with the collision energy around the $Z^0$ peak. They are produced through the
semi-exclusive channels $e^{+}e^{-} \rightarrow |H_{Q\bar{Q}}\ > +X$ with $X=Q\bar{Q}$
or $gg$. Here the heavy quark $Q=b$ or $c$ respectively. It is noted that in addition to the color-singlet
1S-level quarkonium states, the color-singlet quarkonium states at the 2S-level and the 1P-level,
and the color-octet quarkonium state $|(Q\bar{Q})[1^3S_1^{({\bf 8})}]g\ >$ can also provide
sizable contributions. The heavy quarkonium transverse momentum and rapidity distributions
for the $e^+ e^-$ collision energy $E_{cm}=m_Z$ are presented. For the charmonium or bottomonium
production via the $Z^0$ propagator, there is approximate "spin degeneracy" for the spin-triplet
and spin-singlet quarkonium states. Furthermore, uncertainties for the total cross sections
are predicted by taking $m_c=1.50\pm0.15$ GeV and $m_b=4.90\pm0.15$ GeV. Around $E_{cm}=m_{Z}$,
due to the $Z^0$-boson resonance effect, total cross sections for the channels via the $Z^0$-propagator
become much larger than the channels via the photon propagator. Then, in addition to the $B$ factories
as BABAR and Belle and the hadronic colliders as Tevatron and LHC, such a super $Z$-factory will provide
an excellent platform for studying the heavy quarkonium properties.
