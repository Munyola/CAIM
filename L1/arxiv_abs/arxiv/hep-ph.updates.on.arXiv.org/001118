The muon anomaly $a_\mu=(g_\mu-2)/2$ showing a persisting 3 to 4 $\sigma$ deviation between the
SM prediction and the experiment is one of the most promising signals for physics beyond the SM. As
is well known, the hadronic uncertainties are limiting the accuracy of the Standard Model prediction.
Therefore a big effort is going on to improve the evaluations of hadronic effects in order to keep
up with the 4-fold improved precision expected from the new Fermilab measurement in the near future.
A novel complementary type experiment planned at J-PARC in Japan, operating with ultra cold muons,
is expected to be able to achieve the same accuracy but with completely different systematics. So
exciting times in searching for New Physics are under way. I discuss the role of meson physics in calculations
of the hadronic part of the muon g-2. The improvement is expected to substantiate the present deviation
$\Delta a_\mu^{\rm New \ Physics}=\Delta a_\mu^{\rm Experiment}- \Delta a_\mu^{\rm Standard
\ Model}$ to a 6 to 10 standard deviation effect, provided hadronic uncertainties can be reduce by
a factor two. This concerns the hadronic vacuum polarization as well as the hadronic light-by-light
scattering contributions, both to a large extent determined by the low lying meson spectrum. Better
meson production data and progress in modeling meson form factors could greatly help to improve
the precision and reliability of the SM prediction of $a_\mu$ and thereby provide more information
on what is missing in the SM.
