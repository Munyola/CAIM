We explore the possibility of formation of $\Delta$ baryons (1232 MeV) in neutron star matter in
an effective chiral model within the relativistic mean-field framework. With variation in delta-meson
couplings, consistent with the constraints imposed on them, the resulting equation of state is
obtained and the neutron star properties are calculated for static and spherical configuration.
Within the framework of our model the critical densities of formation of $\Delta$s and the properties
of neutron stars are found to be very sensitive to the iso-vector coupling compared to the scalar
or vector couplings. We revisit the $\Delta$ puzzle and look for the possibility of phase transition
from non-strange hadronic matter (including nucleons and $\Delta$s) to deconfined quark matter,
based on QCD theories. The resultant hybrid star configurations satisfy the observational constraints
on mass from the most massive pulsars PSR J1614-2230 and PSR J0348+0432 in static condition obtained
with the general hydrostatic equilibrium based on GTR. Our radius estimates are well within the
limits imposed from observational analysis of QLMBXs. The obtained values of $R_{1.4}$ are in agreement
with the recent bounds specified from the observation of gravitational wave (GW170817)from binary
neutron star merger. The constraint on baryonic mass from study of binary system PSR J0737-3039
is also satisfied with our hybrid equation of state. \noindent{Keywords: Delta baryons, Quark
