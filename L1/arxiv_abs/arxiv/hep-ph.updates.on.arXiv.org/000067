Unitary evolution law describes isolated particle scattering processes in an empty Minkowski
spacetime. We put forward a hypothesis that the physical Universe includes a quantum environment
that interacts with particle scattering processes. While the scattering process is governed by
the S-matrix the interaction evolves the produced state rho_f(S) to observed state rho_f(O). To
be consistent with the Standard Model this new interaction must be a pure dephasing interaction
governed by a non-unitary evolution law modifying the phases of the amplitudes. We present the first
test of the unitary evolution law in particle scattering. The unitary evolution law evolves pure
initial states into pure final states in exclusive processes. This fact leads to 9 independent constraints
on 16 components of angular intensities in piN->pipiN processes. When expressed in terms of
P-parity conserving transversity amplitudes all 9 constraints are identities provided a single
constrain on the transversity amplitudes holds true. The constraint implies that the relative
phases between transverity amplitudes of the same naturality and transversity must be 0 or +/- pi.
All previous amplitude analyses of the piN->pipiN processes found non-unitary relative phases
in an apparent violation of the unitary evolution law. The contrast between the predicted and the
observed relative phases presents an unambigous evidence for the existence of the quantum environment
and its pure dephasing interaction with particle scattering processes.
