After the discovery of the Higgs boson at the LHC, it is natural to start the research program on the
precision study of the Higgs-boson couplings to various standard model (SM) particles. We provide
a generic framework for the deviations of the couplings from their SM values by introducing a number
of parameters. We show that a large number of models beyond the SM can be covered, including two-Higgs-doublet
models, supersymmetric models, little-Higgs models, extended Higgs sectors with singlets, and
fourth generation models. We perform global fits to the most updated data from CMS, ATLAS, and Tevatron
under various initial conditions of the parameter set. In particular, we have made explicit comparisons
between the fitting results BEFORE and AFTER the Moriond 2013 meetings. Highlights of the results
include: (i) the nonstandard decay branching ratio of the Higgs boson is less than 22%; (ii) the most
efficient way to achieve the best fit for the data before the Moriond update is to introduce additional
particle contributions to the triangular-loop functions of H\gamma\gamma and Hgg vertices; (iii)
the 1\sigma allowed range of the relative coupling of HVV is 1.01 +0.13 -0.14, which means that the
electroweak-symmetry breaking contribution from the observed Higgs boson leaves only a small
room for other Higgs bosons; (iv) the current data do not rule out pseudoscalar couplings nor pseudoscalar
contributions to the H\gamma\gamma and Hgg vertices; and (v) the SM Higgs boson provides the best
fit to all the current Higgs data.
