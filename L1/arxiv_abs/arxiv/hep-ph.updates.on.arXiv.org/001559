We have proposed recently a framework for inflation driven by supersymmetry breaking with the inflaton
being a superpartner of the goldstino, that avoids the main problems of supergravity inflation,
allowing for: naturally small slow-roll parameters, small field initial conditions, absence
of a (pseudo)scalar companion of the inflation, and a nearby minimum with tuneable cosmological
constant. It contains a chiral multiplet charged under a gauged R-symmetry which is restored at
the maximum of the scalar potential with a plateau where inflation takes place. The effective field
theory relies on two phenomenological parameters corresponding to corrections to the K\"ahler
potential up to second order around the origin. The first guarantees the maximum at the origin and
the second allows the tuning of the vacuum energy between the F- and D-term contributions. Here,
we provide a microscopic model leading to the required effective theory. It is a Fayet-Iliopoulos
model with two charged chiral multiplets under a second U(1) R-symmetry coupled to supergravity.
In the Brout-Englert-Higgs phase of this U(1), the gauge field becomes massive and can be integrated
out in the limit of small supersymmetry breaking scale. In this work, we perform this integration
and we show that there is a region of parameter space where the effective supergravity realises our
proposal of small field inflation from supersymmetry breaking consistently with observations
and with a minimum of tuneable energy that can describe the present phase of our Universe.
