We present a study at next-to-leading-order (NLO) of the process $pp \to W^\pm Z \to \ell \nu_l \ell'^+
\ell'^-$, where $\ell,\ell' =e, \mu$, at the Large Hadron Collider. We include the full NLO QCD corrections
and the NLO electroweak (EW) corrections in the double-pole approximation. We define eight fiducial
polarization coefficients directly constructed from the polar-azimuthal angular distribution
of the decay leptons. These coefficients differ from the true polarization coefficients as they
depend strongly on the kinematical cuts on the transverse momentum or rapidity of the individual
leptons while the latter do not. Similarly, fiducial polarization fractions are also defined and
they can be directly related to the fiducial coefficients. We perform a detailed analysis of the
NLO QCD+EW fiducial polarization observables including theoretical uncertainties stemming
from the scale variation and parton distribution function uncertainties, using the fiducial phase
space defined by the ATLAS and CMS experiments. We provide results in the helicity coordinate system
and in the Collins-Soper coordinate system, at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. Our results show
that the fiducial polarization fractions in the helicity coordinate system have similarities
to the physical fractions, while those in the Collins-Soper coordinate system do not. The EW corrections
are found to be important in two of the angular coefficients related to the $Z$ boson, irrespective
of the kinematical cuts or the coordinate system. Meanwhile, those EW corrections are very small
for the $W^\pm$ bosons.
