We perform a global effective-field-theory analysis to assess the combined precision on Higgs
couplings, triple gauge-boson couplings, and top-quark couplings, at future circular $e^+e^-$
colliders, with a focus on runs below the $t\bar t$ production threshold. Deviations in the top-quark
sector entering as one-loop corrections are consistently taken into account in Higgs and diboson
processes. We find that future lepton colliders running at center-of-mass energies below the $t\bar
t$ production threshold can still provide useful information on top-quark couplings, by measuring
virtual top-quark effects. With rate and differential measurements, the indirect individual
sensitivity achievable is better than at the high-luminosity LHC. However, strong correlations
between the extracted top-quark and Higgs couplings are also present and lead to much weaker global
constraints on top-quark couplings. This implies that a direct probe of top-quark couplings above
the $t\bar t$ production threshold is helpful also for the determination of Higgs and triple-gauge-boson
couplings. In addition, we find that below the $e^+e^-\to t\bar th$ production threshold, the top-quark
Yukawa coupling can be determined by its loop corrections to all Higgs production and decay channels.
Degeneracy with the $ggh$ coupling can be resolved, and even a global limit is competitive with the
prospects of a linear collider above the threshold. This provides an additional means of determining
the top-quark Yukawa coupling indirectly at lepton colliders.
