We study luminous dark matter signals in models with inelastic scattering. Dark matter $\chi_1$
that scatters inelastically off elements in the Earth is kicked into an excited state $\chi_2$ that
can subsequently decay into a monoenergetic photon inside a detector. The photon signal exhibits
large sidereal-daily modulation due to the daily rotation of the Earth and anisotropies in the problem:
the dark matter wind comes from the direction of Cygnus due to the Sun's motion relative to the galaxy,
and the rock overburden is anisotropic, as is the dark matter scattering angle. This allows outstanding
separation of signal from backgrounds. We investigate the sensitivity of two classes of large underground
detectors to this modulating photon line signal: large liquid scintillator neutrino experiments,
including Borexino and JUNO, and the proposed large gaseous scintillator directional detection
experiment CYGNUS. Borexino's (JUNO's) sensitivity exceeds the bounds from xenon experiments
on inelastic nuclear recoil for mass splittings $\delta \gtrsim 240 (180)$ keV, and is the only probe
of inelastic dark matter for ${350 \text{ keV} \lesssim \delta \lesssim 600 \text{ keV}}$. CYGNUS's
sensitivity is at least comparable to xenon experiments with $\sim 10 \; {\rm m}^3$ volume detector
for $\delta \lesssim 150$ keV, and could be substantially better with larger volumes and improved
background rejection. Such improvements lead to the unusual situation that the inelastic signal
becomes the superior way to search for dark matter even if the elastic and inelastic scattering cross
sections are comparable.
