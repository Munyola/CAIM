We develop a general and consistent model of neutrino oscillation based on the quantum field theoretical
description of the neutrino production and detection processes. Emphasis is placed on the locality
of the interactions of these processes, where on top of the usual application of the four fermion
local Hamiltonian, we assume that weak interactions switched on only when the wave functions of
the particles involved are overlapping and switched off upon their separation. A key assumption
in our treatment is that the wave packet sizes of the particles, in particular, the neutrino producing
source particles and the neutrino absorbing detector particles, are taken to be negligible compared
with their mean free path in their respective medium. With this assumption, and taking into considerations
of the finite time of neutrino production, neutrino wave packets with well-defined edges are generated.
This fact, together with the locality of weak interactions, enable us to relate the propagation
time to the propagation distance, thus doing away with the ad hoc time averaging procedure normally
employing in derivations of neutrino oscillation formula. No assumptions on the particular forms
of particle wave functions; for example, Gaussians, need to be made. A good feature of our approach
is that the neutrino oscillation formula is automatically normalised if the in-going states of
the production and detection processes are normalised. We also show that causality and unitarity
cannot both be satisfied in virtual neutrino models.
