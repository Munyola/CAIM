We consider the central exclusive production of the $p\bar{p}$ in the continuum and via resonances
in proton-proton collisions at high energies. We discuss the diffractive mechanism calculated
within the tensor-pomeron approach including both pomeron and reggeon exchanges. The theoretical
results are compared with existing WA102 and ISR experimental data and predictions for planned
or current experiments at RHIC and the LHC are presented. The distribution in ${\rm y}_{diff}$,
the rapidity distance between proton and antiproton, is particularly interesting. We find a dip
at ${\rm y}_{diff} = 0$ for the $p \bar{p}$ production, in contrast to the $\pi^{+}\pi^{-}$ and $K^{+}K^{-}$
production. We predict also the $p \bar{p}$ invariant mass distribution to be less steep than for
the pseudoscalar dimeson pairs. We argue that these specific differences for the $p \bar{p}$ production
with respect to the pseudoscalar meson pair production can be attributed to the proper treatment
of the spin of produced particles. We discuss asymmetries which are due to interference of $C=+1$
and $C=-1$ amplitudes of $p \bar{p}$ production. We have also calculated the cross section for the
$pp \to pp \Lambda \overline{\Lambda}$ reaction. Here, the cross section is smaller but the characteristic
feature for $d\sigma/d{\rm y}_{diff}$ is predicted to be similar to $p \bar{p}$ production. The
presence of resonances in the $p \bar p$ channel may destroy the dip at ${\rm y}_{diff} = 0$. This opens
a possibility to study diffractively produced resonances. We discuss the observables suited for
this purpose.
