We discuss the parameter spaces of supersymmetry (SUSY) scenarios taking into account the improved
Higgs-mass prediction provided by FeynHiggs 2.14.1. Among other improvements, this prediction
incorporates three-loop renormalization-group effects and two-loop threshold corrections,
and can accommodate three separate mass scales: m_{\tilde q} (for squarks), m_{\tilde g} (for gluinos)
and m_{\tilde\chi} (for electroweakinos). Furthermore, it contains an improved treatment of
the DRbar scalar top parameters avoiding problems with the conversion to on-shell parameters,
that yields more accurate results for large SUSY-breaking scales. We first consider the CMSSM,
in which the soft SUSY-breaking parameters m_0 and m_{1/2} are universal at the GUT scale, and then
sub-GUT models in which universality is imposed at some lower scale. In both cases, we consider the
constraints from the Higgs-boson mass M_h in the bulk of the (m_0, m_{1/2}) plane and also along stop
coannihilation strips where sparticle masses may extend into the multi-TeV range. We then consider
the minimal anomaly-mediated SUSY-breaking (mAMSB) scenario, in which large sparticle masses
are generic. In all these scenarios the substantial improvements between the calculations of M_h
in FeynHiggs 2.14.1 and FeynHiggs 2.10.0, which was used in an earlier study, change significantly
the preferred portions of the models' parameter spaces. Finally, we consider the pMSSM11, in which
sparticle masses may be significantly smaller and we find only small changes in the preferred regions
of parameter space.
