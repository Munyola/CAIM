The secluded dark matter resides within a hidden sector and self-annihilates into lighter mediators
which subsequently decay to the Standard Model (SM) particles. Depending on the coupling strength
of the mediator to the SM, the hidden sector can be kinetically decoupled from the SM bath when the
temperature drops below the mediator's mass, and the dark matter annihilation cross section at
freeze-out is thus possible to be boosted above the conventional value of weak interacting massive
particles. We present a comprehensive study on thermodynamic evolution of the hidden sector from
the first principle, using the simplest secluded vector dark matter model. Motivated by the observation
of Galactic center gamma-ray excess, we take two mass sets $\sim{\cal O}(80\, \text{GeV})$ for
the dark matter and mediator as examples to illustrate the thermodynamics. The coupled Boltzmann
moment equations for number densities and temperature evolutions of the hidden sector are numerically
solved. The formalism can be easily extended to a general secluded dark matter model. We show that
a long-lived mediator can result in a boosted dark matter annihilation cross section to account
for the relic abundance. We further show the parameter space which provides a good fit to the Galactic
center excess data and is compatible with the current bounds and LUX-ZEPLIN projected sensitivity.
We find that the future observations of dwarf spheroidal galaxies offer promising reach to probe
the most relic allowed parameter space relevant to the boosted dark matter annihilation cross section.
