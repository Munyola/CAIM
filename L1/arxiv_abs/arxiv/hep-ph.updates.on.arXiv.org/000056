We consider the performance of the ATLAS and CMS searches for events with missing transverse energy,
which were originally motivated by supersymmetry, in constraining extensions of the Standard
Model based on extra dimensions, in which the mass differences between recurrences at the same level
are generically smaller than the mass hierarchies in typical supersymmetric models. We consider
first a toy model with pair-production of a single vector-like quark U1 decaying into a spin-zero
stable particle A1 and jet, exploring the sensitivity of the CMS alphaT and ATLAS meff analysis to
U1 mass and the U1-A1 mass difference. For this purpose we use versions of the Delphes generic detector
simulation with CMS and ATLAS cards, which have been shown to reproduce the published results of
CMS and ATLAS searches for supersymmetry. We then explore the sensitivity of these searches to a
specific model with two universal extra dimensions, whose signal is dominated by the pair production
of quark recurrences, including searches with leptons. We find that the LHC searches have greater
sensitivity to this more realistic model, due partly to the contributions of signatures with leptons,
and partly to events with large missing transverse energy generated by the decays of higher-level
Kaluza-Klein recurrences. We find that the CMS alphaT analysis with ~5/fb of data at 7 TeV excludes
a recurrence scale of 600 GeV at a confidence level above 99%, increasing to 99.9% when combined with
the CMS single-lepton search, whereas a recurrence scale of 700 GeV is disfavoured at the 72% confidence
level.
