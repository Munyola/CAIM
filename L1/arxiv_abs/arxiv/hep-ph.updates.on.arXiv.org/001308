We calculate the sensitivity of next generation neutrino telescopes to the 28 (isoscalar and isovector)
coupling constants defining the non-relativistic effective theory of (spin 1/2) dark matter (DM)-nucleon
interactions. We take as a benchmark detector the proposed Precision IceCube Next Generation Upgrade
(PINGU), although our results are valid for any other neutrino telescope of similar effective volume.
We express PINGU's sensitivity in terms of $5\sigma$ sensitivity contours in the DM-mass - coupling
constant plane, and compare our sensitivity contours with the 90% C.L. exclusion limits on the same
coupling constants that we obtain from a reanalysis of the null result of current DM searches at IceCube/DeepCore.
We find that PINGU can effectively probe not only the canonical spin-independent and spin-dependent
DM-nucleon interactions, but also velocity-dependent or momentum-dependent interactions that
generate coherently enhanced DM-nucleus scattering cross sections. We also find that PINGU's
$5\sigma$ sensitivity contours are significantly below current IceCube/DeepCore 90% C.L. exclusion
limits when $b\bar{b}$ is the leading DM annihilation channel. This result shows the importance
of lowering the experimental energy threshold when probing models that generate soft neutrino
energy spectra, and holds true independently of the assumed DM-nucleon interaction and for all
DM masses tested here. When DM primarily annihilates into $\tau\bar{\tau}$, a PINGU-like detector
will improve upon current exclusion limits for DM masses below $35$ GeV, independently of the assumed
DM-nucleon interaction.
