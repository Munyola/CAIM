Cosmic-ray (CR) antihelium is an important observable for dark matter (DM) indirect searches due
to extremely low secondary backgrounds towards low energies. In a given DM model, the predicted
CR antihelium flux is expected to be strongly correlated with that of CR antiprotons. In this work,
we use the AMS-02 $\bar p/p$ data to constrain the DM annihilation cross section, and the ALICE data
on the $^3\overline{\text{He}}$ and $\overline{\text{T}}$ productions to determine the parameters
in the coalescence model for anti-nucleus formation. The hadronic cross sections are estimated
using Monte-Carlo event generators including $\texttt{EPOS-LHC}$ and $\texttt{DPMJET}$. Based
on these constraints, we make predictions for the maximal antihelium flux for typical DM annihilation
final states, and perform a detailed analysis on the uncertainties due to the DM density profiles
and CR propagation models. We find that the results are highly insensitive to both of them, but still
significantly depends on the hadronization models in event generators. The prospects of detecting
antihelium for the AMS-02 experiment is discussed. We show that with very optimistic assumptions,
CR $^3\overline{\text{He}}$ is within the reach of the AMS-02 experiment. The $^3\overline{\text{He}}$
events which can be detected by AMS-02 are likely to have kinetic energy $T \gtrsim 30$~GeV, which
is consistent with the preliminary AMS-02 search results. The events which can be observed by AMS-02
are likely to arise dominantly from secondary backgrounds rather than DM interactions.
