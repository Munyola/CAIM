We propose a low-cost and movable setup to probe minicharged particles (or milli-charged particles,
MCP) using high-intensity proton fixed-target facilities. Directly inspired by the dedicated
searches at SLAC, LHC, and a recent MCP analysis based on neutrino-detector sensitivities, we propose
to place a milliQan-type multi-part (nominally, three) detector requiring multi-coincident
(nominally, triple-coincident) scintillation signatures within a small time window downstream
of the proton target of a neutrino experiment. We explore several alternative designs, including
the modifications of the nominal detector to increase signal yield, and combining this detector
technology with existing and planned neutrino detectors to better search for MCP. During the collisions
of a large number of protons on target, intense minicharged particle beams may be produced via meson
photo-decays and Drell-Yan production. We take advantage of the high statistics, shielding, and
potential neutrino-detector-related background reduction to search for the minicharged particles
in two potential sites: the MINOS near detector hall and the proposed DUNE near detector hall, both
at Fermilab. The CERN SPS beam and associated experimental structure also provide a similar alternative.
This proposal, named FerMINI for convenience, can achieve unprecedented sensitivity for minicharged
particles in the MeV to few GeV regime with fractional charge $\varepsilon=Q_{\chi}/e $ between
$10^{-4}$ (potentially saturating the detector limitation) and $10^{-1}$.
