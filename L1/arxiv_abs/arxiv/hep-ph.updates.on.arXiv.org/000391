Particles and fields are standard components in numerical simulations like transport simulations
in nuclear physics and have very well understood dynamics. Still, a common problem is the interaction
between particles and fields due to their different formal description. Particle interactions
are discrete, point-like events while fields have purely continuous equations of motion. A workaround
is the use of effective theories like the Langevin equation with the drawback of energy conservation
violation. We present a new method, which allows to model non-continuous interactions between
particles and scalar fields, allowing us to simulate scattering-like interactions which exchange
energy and momentum quanta between fields and particles obeying full energy and momentum conservation
and control over interaction strengths and times. In this paper we apply this method to different
model systems, starting with a simple scalar harmonic oscillator which is damped by losing discrete
energy quanta. The second and third system is a scalar oscillator and a one dimensional field which
are both damped by discrete energy loss and which are coupled to a stochastic force, leading to equilibrium
states which correspond to statistical Langevin-like systems. The last example is a scalar field
in 3D which is coupled to a microcanonical ensemble of particles by incorporating particle production
and annihilation processes. Obeying the detailed-balance principle, the system equilibrates
to thermal and chemical equilibrium with dynamical fluctuations on the fields, generated dynamically
by the discrete interactions.
