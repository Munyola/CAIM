Multi-particle correlation observables in the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider small system scan
are computed in a framework that contains both initial state momentum anisotropies from the Color
Glass Condensate effective theory and final state hydrodynamic evolution. The initial state is
computed using the IP-Glasma model and coupled to viscous relativistic hydrodynamic simulations,
which are followed by microscopic hadronic transport. All parameters of the calculation were previously
constrained using experimental data on Au+Au collisions at the same center of mass energy. We find
that the qualitative features of the experimental data, such as the system and centrality dependence
of the charged hadron momentum anisotropy, can only be reproduced when final state interactions
are present. On the other hand, we also demonstrate that the details of the initial state are crucially
important for the quantitative description of observables in the studied small systems, as neglecting
the initial transverse flow profile or the initial shear stress tensor, which contain information
on the momentum anisotropy from the Color Glass Condensate, has dramatic effects on the produced
final state anisotropy. We further show that the initial state momentum anisotropy is correlated
with the observed elliptic flow in all small systems, with the effect increasing with decreasing
multiplicity. We identify the precise measurement of $v_2$ in d+Au and Au+Au collisions at RHIC
energy at the same multiplicity as a means to reveal effects of the initial state momentum anisotropy.
