We evaluate the spin-$3/2 \to$ spin-$1/2$ electromagnetic transitions of the doubly charmed baryons
on 2+1 flavor, $32^3 \times 64$ PACS-CS lattices with a pion mass of $156(9)$ MeV/c$^2$. A relativistic
heavy quark action is employed to minimize the associated systematic errors on charm-quark observables.
We extract the magnetic dipole, $M1$, and the electric quadrupole, $E2$, transition form factors.
In order to make a reliable estimate of the $M1$ form factor, we carry out an analysis by including
the effect of excited-state contributions. We find that the $M1$ transition is dominant and light
degrees of freedom ($u/d$- or $s$-quark) play the leading role. $E2$ form factors, on the other hand,
are found to be negligibly small, which in turn, have minimal effect on the helicity and transition
amplitudes. We predict the decay widths and lifetimes of $\Xi_{cc}^{\ast +,++}$ and $\Omega_{cc}^{\ast
+}$ based on our results. Finite size effects on these ensembles are expected to be around 1\%. Differences
in kinematical and dynamical factors with respect to the $N\gamma\to\Delta$ transition are discussed
and compared to non-lattice determinations as well keeping possible systematic artifacts in mind.
A comparison to $\Omega_c \gamma \rightarrow \Omega_c^\ast$ transition and a discussion on systematic
errors related to the choice of heavy quark action are also given. Results we present here are particularly
suggestive for experimental facilities such as LHCb, PANDA, Belle II and BESIII to search for further
states.
