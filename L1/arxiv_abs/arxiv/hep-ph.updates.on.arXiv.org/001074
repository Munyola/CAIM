The Standard Model (SM)-like couplings of the observed Higgs boson impose strong constraints on
the structure of any extended Higgs sector. We consider the theoretical properties and the phenomenological
implications of a generic two Higgs doublet model (2HDM) in the so-called Higgs alignment limit.
In this limit, the neutral scalar field $H_1$, with the properties of the SM Higgs boson, is a mass
eigenstate that is aligned in field space with the direction of the Higgs vacuum expectation value.
The properties of the two other heavier neutral Higgs scalars, $H_2$ and $H_3$, in the alignment
limit of the 2HDM are also elucidated. It is shown that the couplings of $H_2$ and $H_3$ in the alignment
limit are tightly constrained and correlated. For example, in the exact alignment limit at tree
level, for bosonic final states BR($H_{2,3} \to W^+W^-, ZZ, H_1 Z) = 0$ and BR($H^\pm \to W^\pm H_1)
= 0$, whereas for fermionic final states $\Gamma(H_2 \to f\bar f)/\Gamma(H_3 \to f\bar f) \sim M_2/M_3$
(where $M_k$ is the mass of $H_k$). In some cases, the results of the alignment limit differ depending
on whether or not alignment is achieved via the decoupling of heavy scalar states. In particular,
in the exact alignment limit without decoupling BR($H_{2,3}\to H_1 H_1)=0$, whereas these branching
ratios are nonzero in the decoupling regime. Observables that could be used to test the alignment
scenario at the LHC are defined and discussed. The couplings of the Higgs bosons away from their exact
alignment values are determined to leading order, and some consequences are discussed.
