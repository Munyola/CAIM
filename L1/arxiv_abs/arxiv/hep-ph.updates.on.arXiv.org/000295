Given the proliferation of bouncing models in recent years, we gather and critically assess these
proposals in a comprehensive review. The PLANCK data shows an unmistakably red, quasi scale-invariant,
purely adiabatic primordial power spectrum and no primary non-Gaussianities. While observations
are consistent with inflationary predictions, bouncing cosmologies aspire to provide an alternative
framework to explain them. Such models face many problems, both, of the purely theoretical kind,
such as the necessity of violating the NEC and instabilities, and at the cosmological application
level, as exemplified by the possible presence of shear. We provide a pedagogical introduction
to these problems and assess the fitness of different proposals. For example, many models predict
a slightly blue spectrum and must be fine-tuned to generate a red spectral index; as a side effect,
large non-Gaussianities often result. We highlight several promising attempts to violate the
NEC without introducing fatal instabilities at the classical and/or quantum level. However, gravitational
waves at the level indicated by BICEP2 cannot be achieved in almost all bouncing models in which they
have been calculated, with the exception of models in string gas cosmology, which are problematic
for other reasons. We conclude that, while most bouncing cosmologies are far from providing an alternative
to the inflationary paradigm, a handful of interesting proposals have surfaced, which warrant
further research. The constraints and lessons learned as laid out in this review might guide future
model builders.
