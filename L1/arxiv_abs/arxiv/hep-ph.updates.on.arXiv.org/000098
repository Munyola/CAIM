We discuss the uniqueness or non-uniqueness problem of the decomposition of the gluon field into
the physical and pure-gauge components, which is the basis of the recently proposed two physically
inequivalent gauge-invariant decompositions of the nucleon spin. It is crucialy important to
recognize the fact that the standard gauge fixing procedure is essentially a process of projecting
out the physical components of the massless gauge field. A complexity of the nonabelian gauge theory
as compared with the abelian case is that a closed expression for the physical component can be given
only with use of the non-local Wilson line, which is generally path-dependent. It is known that,
by choosing an infinitely long straight-line path in space and time, the direction of which is characterized
by a constant 4-vector $n^\mu$, one can cover a class of gauge called the general axial gauge, containing
three popular gauges, i.e. the temporal, the light-cone, and the spatial axial gauge. Within this
general axial gauge, we have calculated the 1-loop evolution matrix for the quark and gluon longitudinal
spins in the nucleon. We found that the final answer is exactly the same independently of the choices
of $n^\mu$, which amounts to proving the gauge-independence and path-independence simultaneously,
although within a restricted class of gauges and paths. By drawing on all of these findings together
with well-established knowledge from gauge theories, we argue against the rapidly spreading view
in the community that there are infinitely many decompositions of the nucleon spin.
