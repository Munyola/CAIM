We study simultaneous evolution of large scale hypermagnetic fields and the asymmetries of quarks,
leptons and Higgs boson in the temperature range from 10TeV to 100GeV. Above 10TeV, we identify all
of the major fast interactions and use the associated conservation laws as constraints on the initial
conditions at 10TeV. Below 10TeV, we identify the major processes which fall out of equilibrium
or emerge as non-negligible processes and derive the relevant evolution equations. These include
the Abelian anomalies which violate fermion numbers, direct and inverse Higgs decays that change
the chiralities of fermions, and weak sphalerons which violate the left-handed fermion numbers.
We also consider the contributions of all fermionic chemical potentials to the UY(1) Chern-Simons
term which affects the evolution through the AMHD equations. We solve the coupled differential
equations for the matter asymmetries and the hypermagnetic field to obtain their evolution as well
as their values at the electroweak phase transition for various ranges of initial values satisfying
the constraints mentioned. In particular, we find that initial large hypermagnetic field can produce
matter asymmetries starting from zero initial value, and vice versa provided an initial seed of
hypermagnetic field is also present. We find that our model yields acceptable values for baryon
asymmetry and magnetic field. However, the scale of the magnetic field obtained is much smaller
than the observational data, even when the turbulence driven inverse cascade mechanism in the broken
phase is taken into account.
