We interpret the recent discovery of a 125 GeV Higgs-like state in the context of a two Higgs doublets
model with a heavy 4th sequential generation of fermions, in which one Higgs doublet couples only
to the 4th generation fermions, while the second doublet couples to the lighter fermions of the 1st-3rd
families. This model is designed to accommodate the apparent heaviness of the 4th generation fermions
and to effectively address the low-energy phenomenology of a dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking
scenario. The physical Higgs states of the model are, therefore, viewed as composites primarily
of the 4th generation fermions. We find that the lightest Higgs, h, is a good candidate for the recently
discovered 125 GeV spin-zero particle, when tan\beta ~ O(1), for typical 4th generation fermion
masses of M_{4G} = 400 -600 GeV, and with a large t - t' mixing in the right-handed quarks sector. This,
in turn, leads to BR(t' -> t h) ~ O(1), which drastically changes the t' decay pattern. We also find
that, based on the current Higgs data, this two Higgs doublet model generically predicts an enhanced
production rate (compared to the SM) in the pp -> h -> tau tau channel and a reduced VV -> h
-> gamma gamma and pp -> V -> Vh -> Vbb ones. Finally, the heavier CP-even Higgs is excluded
by the current data up to m_H ~ 500 GeV, while the pseudoscalar state, A, can be as light as 130 GeV. These
heavier Higgs states and the expected deviations from the SM in some of the Higgs production channels
can be further excluded or discovered with more data.
