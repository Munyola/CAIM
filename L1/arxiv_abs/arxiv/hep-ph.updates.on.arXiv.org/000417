We analyze relevant signals expected at the LHC for a left sneutrino as the lightest supersymmetric
particle. The discussion is carried out in the `$\mu$ from $\nu$' supersymmetric standard model
($\mu \nu$SSM), where the presence of $R$-parity breaking couplings involving right-handed neutrinos
solves the $\mu$ problem and reproduces neutrino data. From the decay of a pair of sneutrinos of any
generation, a diphoton signal plus missing transverse energy (MET) from neutrinos can be present.
In addition, in the case of a pair of tau sneutrinos, since the tau Yukawa coupling is large, other
type of signals can also be present: diphoton plus leptons, and multileptons. The dominant pair
production channels are the direct production via a $Z$ boson, or through a $W^{\pm}$ decaying into
a sneutrino and a left slepton next-to-lightest supersymmetric particle, with the latter decaying
into another sneutrino plus a very soft $W^{\pm}$. We find that the number of expected events for
the multilepton signal is sufficient to give a significant evidence for a tau sneutrino mass in the
range $130-310$ GeV, even with the luminosity of 20 fb$^{-1}$. In the case of the signal producing
diphoton plus leptons, a luminosity of 100 fb$^{-1}$ is needed to give a significant evidence in
the mass range of the tau sneutrino of about $95-145$ GeV. For sneutrinos of any generation producing
a significant diphoton plus MET signal, the mass range is $118-132$ GeV. Finally, we also discuss
briefly the presence of displaced vertices and the associated range of masses.
