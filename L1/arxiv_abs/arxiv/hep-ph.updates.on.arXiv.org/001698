In this work, we investigate what extent the cosmological parameters can be constrained to when
the redshift drift data of Square Kilometre Array (SKA) are used alone and what will happen when the
European Extremely Large Telescope (E-ELT) and SKA mock data are combined. The $\Lambda$CDM model
is chosen as a reference model to reach our aims. We find that using the SKA1-only mock data, the $\Lambda$CDM
model can be loosely constrained, while the model can be well constrained when the SKA2-only mock
data are used. When the combination of SKA and E-ELT mock data are considered, the constraints can
be significantly improved almost as good as the data combination of the type Ia supernovae observation,
the cosmic microwave background observation, and the baryon acoustic oscillations observation.
Furthermore, we also investigate in the future what role the redshift drift data of SKA will play
in the cosmological parameter estimation. We use four dark energy models, namely, the $\Lambda$CDM
model, the $w$CDM model, the CPL model, and the HDE model, as examples to make the analysis. These
models are favored by the current observations well. we find that the redshift drift measurement
of SKA could help to significantly improve the constraint on dark energy and could break the degeneracy
existing between the cosmological parameters. Therefore, we conclude that redshift-drift observation
of SKA would provide a good improvement in the cosmological parameter estimation in the future and
have the enormous potential to be one of the most competitive cosmological probes in constraining
dark energy.
