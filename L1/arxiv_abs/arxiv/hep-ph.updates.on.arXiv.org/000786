We present a detailed analysis of the beam energy dependence of the mechanisms for generation of
directed and elliptic flows in Au+Au collisions focusing on the role of hadronic rescattering and
spectator shadowing within a microscopic transport model JAM with different equation of state.
A systematic study of the beam energy dependence is performed for Au+Au collisions at $2 \leq \sqrt{s_{NN}}\leq
62.4$ GeV. Transition of the dynamical origin of directed flow is observed. We found that initial
Galuber type nucleon-nucleon collisions generate negative $v_1$ for nucleons at mid-rapidity
due to the presence of spectator matter, and this negative nucleon $v_1$ is turned to be positive
by the meson-baryon interactions at the beam energy region of $\sqrt{s_{NN}} < 30$ GeV. In contrast,
above 30 GeV, there is no spectator shadowing at mid-rapidity, and initial nucleon-nucleon collisions
does not generate directed flow, but subsequent rescatterings among produced particles generate
negative $v_1$ for nucleons. It is demonstrated that negative pion directed flows are mostly generated
by the interaction with the spectator matter. It is also shown that squeeze-out effect is largely
suppressed in the case of softening, which leads to the enhancement of elliptic flow around $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=5-7$
GeV. Elliptic flow at mid-rapidity above 10 GeV is not influenced by the squeeze-out due to spectator
matter, while its effect is seen at the forward rapidity range of $y/y_\mathrm{cm}>0.5$, which
decreases as beam energy increases.
