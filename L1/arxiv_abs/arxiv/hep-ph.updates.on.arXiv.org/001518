We evaluate the impact of one-loop electroweak corrections to the spin-independent dark matter
(DM) scattering cross-section with nucleons ($\sigma_{\rm SI}$), in models with a so-called blind
spot for direct detection, where the leading-order prediction for the relevant DM coupling to the
Higgs boson, and therefore $\sigma_{\rm SI}$, are vanishingly small. Adopting a simple illustrative
scenario in which the DM state results from the mixing of electroweak singlet and doublet fermions,
we compute the relevant higher order corrections to the scalar effective operator contributions
to $\sigma_{\rm SI}$, stemming from both triangle and box diagrams involving the SM and dark sector
fields. It is observed that in a significant region of the singlet-doublet model-space, the one-loop
corrections ``unblind'' the tree-level blind spots and lead to detectable SI scattering rates
at future multi-ton scale liquid Xenon experiments, with $\sigma_{\rm SI}$ reaching values up
to a few times $10^{-47} {~\rm cm}^2$, for a weak scale DM with $\mathcal{O}(1)$ Yukawa couplings.
Furthermore, we find that there always exists a new SI blind spot at the next-to-leading order, which
is perturbatively shifted from the leading order one in the singlet-doublet mass parameters. For
comparison, we also present the tree-level spin-dependent scattering cross-sections near the
SI blind-spot region, that could lead to a larger signal. Our results can be mapped to the blind-spot
scenario for bino-Higgsino DM in the MSSM, with other sfermions, the heavier Higgs boson, and the
wino decoupled.
