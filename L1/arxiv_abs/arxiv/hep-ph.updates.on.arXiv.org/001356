In experimental proposals published in the last two decades, a so called frozen spin storage ring
concept was proposed for setting upper experimental bounds to electric dipole moment (EDM) of elementary
particles. In a recent paper of ours, a fully covariant general relativistic (GR) calculation was
presented on the Earth's gravitational modification effect in such mixed magnetic-electric frozen
spin storage ring on the spin transport, which could contribute to such measurement. It was shown
that similarly to an EDM signal, GR causes a spin precession out of the orbital plane, under the frozen
spin condition. The rate of the vertical polarization buildup is predicted to be -a*beta*gamma*g/c,
where g is the gravitational acceleration on the surface of the Earth, c is the speed of light, beta*gamma
is the particle momentum over mass, and 'a' is its magnetic moment anomaly. It is seen that the effect
increases unboundedly with the Lorentz factor gamma. Moreover, it is proportional to the magnetic
moment anomaly 'a'. This paper mainly addresses the experimental perspectives to detect this effect
in a realistic frozen spin storage ring configuration. Such a measurement would provide a novel
test of GR, sampling the tensorial nature of GR at a microscopic level, as acting on the spin vector
of elementary particles. The conclusion is that the pertinent GR experiment seems to be realistic
with large magnetic moment anomaly particles, such as tritons, helion3 or protons, whereas it is
not realistic with small magnetic moment anomaly particles, such as deuterons, muons or electrons.
