We discuss production of $c \bar c$-pairs within $k_T$-factorization approach (off-shell initial
partons) with unintegrated parton distribution functions (uPDFs). We present a consistent prescription
which merges the standard leading-order (LO) $k_T$-factorization calculations for this process
with tree-level next-to-leading order (NLO) and next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) matrix
elements. For the first time we include in this framework 2 $\to$ 3 and 2 $\to$ 4 processes with extra
partonic emissions for single particle distributions as well as for correlation observables.
The use of the KMR uPDF leads to a good description of the existing charm ($D$-meson) data already
at the leading-order. On the other hand, a new Parton-Branching (PB) uPDF strongly underestimates
the same experimental data. A direct inclusion of the higher-orders at tree-level leads to an overestimation
of the data, especially for the KMR uPDF. This suggests a significant double-counting. We propose
a simple method how to avoid the double-counting. Our procedure leads to a much better description
of the experimental data when including the higher-order contributions. Then with the KMR uPDF
we get similar results (both for single particle and correlation observables) as for the standard
calculations of the 2 $\to$ 2 processes. For the PB uPDF inclusion of the higher-orders considerably
improves description of the experimental data. We conclude that the LO calculation with the KMR
uPDF effectively includes the higher-orders which is not the case for the PB uPDF.
