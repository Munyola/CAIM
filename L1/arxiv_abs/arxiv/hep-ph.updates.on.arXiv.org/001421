The Galileon model is a tensor-scalar theory of gravity which explains the late acceleration of
the Universe expansion with no instabilities and recovers General Relativity in the strong field
limit. Most constraints obtained so far on Galileon model parameters from cosmological data were
derived for the limited subset of tracker solutions and reported tensions between the model and
data. This paper presents the first exploration of the general solution of the Galileon model, which
is confronted against recent cosmological data for both background observables and linear perturbations,
using Monte-Carlo Markov chains. As representative scenarios of the Galileon models, we study
the full Galileon model with disformal coupling to matter and the uncoupled cubic Galileon model.
We find that the general solution of the full Galileon model provides a good fit to CMB spectra, while
the cubic Galileon model does not. When extending the comparison to BAO and SNIa data, even the general
solution of the full Galileon model fails at providing a good fit to all datasets simultaneously.
Tensions remain if the models are extended with an additional free parameter, such as the sum of active
neutrino masses or the normalization of the CMB lensing spectrum. Finally, the multi-messenger
observation of GW170817 is also discussed in the framework of the scenarios considered. The time
delay between the gravitational signal and its electromagnetic counterpart was computed \textit{a
posteriori} in every scenario of the full Galileon model cosmological fit chains and found to be
ruled out by this observation.
