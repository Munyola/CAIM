The standard model coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (CE$\nu$NS) cross section is
subject to nuclear form factor uncertainties, mainly driven by the root-mean-square radius of
the neutron density distribution. Motivated by COHERENT phases I-III and future multi-ton direct
detection dark matter searches, we evaluate these uncertainties in cesium iodide, germanium,
xenon and argon detectors. We find that the uncertainties become relevant for momentum transfers
$q\gtrsim 20$ MeV and are essentially independent of the form factor parameterization. Consequently,
form factor uncertainties are not important for CE$\nu$NS induced by reactor or solar neutrinos.
Taking into account these uncertainties, we then evaluate their impact on measurements of CE$\nu$NS
at COHERENT, the diffuse supernova background (DSNB) neutrinos and sub-GeV atmospheric neutrinos.
We also calculate the relative uncertainties in the number of COHERENT events for different nuclei
as a function of recoil energy. For DSNB and atmospheric neutrinos, event rates at a liquid argon
detector can be uncertain to more than 5%. Finally, we consider the impact of form factor uncertainties
on searches for nonstandard neutrino interactions, sterile neutrinos and neutrino generalized
interactions. We point out that studies of new physics using CE$\nu$NS data are affected by neutron
form factor uncertainties, which if not properly taken into account may lead to the misidentification
of new physics signals. The uncertainties quantified here are also relevant for dark matter direct
detection searches.
