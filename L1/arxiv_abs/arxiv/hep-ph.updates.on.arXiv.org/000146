This is a master's thesis and it is written in Lithuanian language. The goal of this thesis is to predict
the polarization of a \tau-particle produced at the LHC and coming from a real W boson. This is achieved
by calculating the projection of the expectation value of the polarization vector of the \tau-particle.
Calculations are done in the frame of the Standard Model. In this model only left-chiral currents
couple to W bosons. The mass of the \tau-particle is left non-zero, therefore one can see the influence
of helicity mixing on polarization. The initial colliding particles at the LHC are protons and the
most important channels for W production are quark fusion: $q\bar{q} -> W^+ -> \tau^+ \nu_{\tau}$.
Calculation for \tau-lepton production from Z bosons and photons, $q\bar{q} -> Z^0, A^\gamma
-> \tau^+ \tau^-$, are also included for investigation of possible background events. Because
quarks are confined in a proton, this thesis presents a thorough treatment on discribing proton's
inner structure with Parton distribution functions. The results section shows plots of differential
cross sections for \tau-lepton production from different quark flavours and different energy
intervals of the \tau-particle. A projection of the expectation value of the polarization vector
depends on the chosen energy intervals. The vector on which it is projected is chosed to be the direction
of the \tau-particle's motion. The influence of the mass is best seen for low energy particles, because
then the helicity mixing is higher. PACS numbers: 13.88.+e, 14.60.Fg
