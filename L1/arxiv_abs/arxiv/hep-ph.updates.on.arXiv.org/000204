The observation of two PeV-scale neutrino events reported by Ice Cube can, in principle, allows
one to place constraints on Lorentz invariance violation (LIV) in the neutrino sector. After first
arguing that at least one of the IceCube events was of extragalactic origin, I derive an upper limit
for {\it the difference} between putative superluminal neutrino and electron velocities of $\le
\sim 5.6 \times 10^{-19}$ in units where $c = 1$, confirming that the observed PeV neutrinos could
have reached Earth from extragalactic sources. I further derive a new constraint on the superluminal
electron velocity, obtained from the observation of synchrotron radiation in the Crab Nebula flare
of September, 2010. The inference that the $>$ 1 GeV $\gamma$-rays from synchrotron emission
in the flare were produced by electrons of energy up to $\sim 5.1$ PeV indicates the non-occurrence
of vacuum \'{C}erenkov radiation by these electrons. This implies a new, strong constraint on superluminal
electron velocities $\delta_e \le \sim 5 \times 10^{-21}$. It immediately follows that one then
obtains an upper limit on the superluminal neutrino velocity {\it alone} of $\delta_{\nu} \le \sim
5.6 \times 10^{-19}$, many orders of magnitude better than the time-of-flight constraint from
the SN1987A neutrino burst. However, if the electrons are {\it subluminal} the constraint on $|\delta_e|
\le \sim 8 \times 10^{-17}$, obtained from the Crab Nebula $\gamma$-ray spectrum, places a weaker
constraint on superluminal neutrino velocity of $\delta_{\nu} \le \sim 8 \times 10^{-17}$.
