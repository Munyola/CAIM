The significance of new physics appearing in the loop-induced decays of neutral Higgs bosons into
pairs of di-bosons $\gamma\gamma$ and $Z\gamma$ will be discussed in the framework of the 3-3-1
models based on a recent work [arXiv:1604.01948] where the Higgs sector were considered as an extension
of that from the well-known Two Higgs Doublet models (2HDM). For large $SU(3)_L$ scale $v_3\simeq10$
TeV, dominant one-loop contributions to the amplitudes of the two decays arise from only the single
charged Higgs boson predicted by the 2HDM, leading to that experimental constraint on the signal
strength $\mu^{331}_{\gamma\gamma}$ of the Standard model like Higgs boson decay $h\rightarrow
\gamma\gamma$ will result in a strict upper bound on the signal strength $\mu^{331}_{Z\gamma}$
of the decay $h\rightarrow\, Z\gamma$. For a particular model with lower $v_3$ around 3 TeV, contributions
from heavy charged gauge and Higgs bosons may have the same order. Therefore, their destructive
or constructive correlations may affect significantly on the two signal strengths. In particularly,
a deviation from the SM prediction $|\mu^{331}_{\gamma\gamma}-1| \le 0.04$ still allows $|\mu^{331}_{Z\gamma}-1|$
to reach values near 0.1. We also show that there exists an CP-even neutral Higgs boson $h^0_3$ predicted
by the 3-3-1 models, but beyond the 2HDM, has an interesting property that the branching ratio Br$(h^0_3\rightarrow
\gamma\gamma)$ is very sensitive to the parameter $\beta$ used to distinguish different 3-3-1
models.
