We point out that the recently increased value of the angle $\gamma$ in the Unitarity Triangle (UT),
determined in tree-level decays to be $\gamma=(74.0^{+5.0}_{-5.8})^\circ$ by the LHCb collaboration,
combined with the most recent value of $|V_{cb}|$ implies an enhancement of $\Delta M_{d}$ over
the data in the ballpark of $30\%$. This is roughly by a factor of two larger than the enhancement of
$\Delta M_{s}$ that is independent of $\gamma$. This disparity of enhancements is problematic
for models with Constrained Minimal Flavour Violation (CMFV) and also for $U(2)^3$ models. In view
of the prospects of measuring $\gamma$ with the precision of $\pm 1^\circ$ by Belle II and LHCb in
the coming years, we propose to use the angles $\gamma$ and $\beta$ together with $|V_{cb}|$ and
$|V_{us}|$ as the fundamental parameters of the CKM matrix until $|V_{ub}|$ from tree-level decays
will be known precisely. Displaying $\Delta M_{s,d}$ as functions of $\gamma$ clearly demonstrates
the tension between the value of $\gamma$ from tree-level decays, free from new physics (NP) contributions,
and $\Delta M_{s,d}$ calculated in CMFV and $U(2)^3$ models and thus exhibits the presence of NP
contributions to $\Delta M_{s,d}$ beyond these frameworks. We calculate the values of $|V_{ub}|$
and $|V_{td}|$ as functions of $\gamma$ and $|V_{cb}|$ and discuss the implications of our results
for $\varepsilon_K$ and rare $K$ and $B$ decays. We also briefly discuss a future strategy in which
$\beta$, possibly affected by NP, is replaced by $|V_{ub}|$.
