In this note, we introduce the new tool reSolve, a Monte Carlo differential cross-section and parton-level
event generator whose main purpose is to add transverse momentum resummation to a general class
of inclusive processes at hadron colliders, namely all those which do not involve hadrons or jets
in the measured final state. This documentation refers to our beta version release, which is still
very much a work in progress and only has a partial implementation of the features we ultimately plan
to include in the final release. Whilst highlighting key aspects of the resummation formalism applied,
this article acts as a manual for the program; describing in detail its use, structure and validation.
A main concept behind the development of the tool is that it is meant to be a hands-on white box for the
user: a lot of effort was made into giving the program a modular structure, making the various parts
which comprise it as much as possible independent of each other, transparently documented, customizable
and, in principle, completely replaceable with something that may serve better the user's needs.
reSolve is a new C++ program, based on an evolution of the private Fortran code 2gres, previously
used for the calculations in refs. [1] and [2]. This initial version calculates the low transverse
momentum contribution to the fully differential cross-section for the inclusive production of
two photons, including resummation up Next-to-Next- to-Leading Logarithm (NNLL). We aim to extend
the program to several more processes in the near future. The program is made publicly available
on Github.
