There are compelling evidences for the existence of a fourth degree of freedom of neutrinos i.e.
sterile neutrino. In the recent studies the role of sterile component of neutrinos has been found
to be crucial, not only in particle physics, but also in astrophysics and cosmology. This has been
proposed to be one of the potential candidates of dark matter. In this work we investigate the updated
solar neutrino data available from all the relevant experiments including Borexino and KamLAND
solar phase in a model independent way, and obtain bounds on the sterile neutrino component present
in the solar neutrino flux. The mystery of the missing neutrinos is further deepening as subsequent
experiments are coming up with their results. The energy spectrum of solar neutrinos, as predicted
by Standard Solar Models (SSM), is seen by neutrino experiments at different parts as they are sensitive
to various neutrino energy ranges. It is interesting to note that more than $98\%$ of the calculated
standard model solar neutrino flux lies below $1MeV$. Therefore, the study of low energy neutrinos
can give us better understanding and the possibility to know about the presence of antineutrino
and sterile neutrino components in solar neutrino flux. As such, this work becomes interesting
as we include the data from medium energy ($\sim 1MeV$) experiments i.e. Borexino and KamLAND solar
phase. In our study we retrieve the bounds existing in literature, and rather provide more stringent
limits on sterile neutrino($\nu_{s}$) flux available in solar neutrino data.
