The trilinear Higgs self-coupling has a central role in the understanding of electroweak symmetry
breaking as it determines the shape of the Higgs potential. The future electron-positron collider
CLIC will provide the opportunity to measure the trilinear Higgs self-coupling directly in double
Higgs boson events produced at its high-energy stages with collision energies of $\sqrt{s}$ = 1.5
and 3 TeV. The main channel is double Higgs boson production through W-boson fusion where the Higgs
bosons decay to bottom-quark pairs. Its cross section and the kinematics of the di-Higgs system
are dependent on the trilinear Higgs self-coupling as well as the quartic HHWW coupling. The sensitivity
is driven by the measurements of the HH${\nu_e}{\nu_e}$ cross section and of the invariant mass
of the Higgs boson pair. It is enhanced by including the cross-section measurement of ZHH production
at 1.5 TeV. The expected sensitivity of CLIC for Higgs pair production through W-boson fusion is
studied for the decay channels bbbb and bbWW using full detector simulation including all relevant
backgrounds. The energy stage at $\sqrt{s}$ = 1.5 TeV with $\mathcal{L}$ = 2.5 ab$^{-1}$ integrated
luminosity allows the observation of the Higgsstrahlung process ZHH and provides evidence for
the W-boson fusion process $e^+e^- \to $HH${\nu_e}{\nu_e}$. With an integrated luminosity of
$\mathcal{L}$ = 5 ab$^{-1}$ at $\sqrt{s}$ = 3 TeV, CLIC will be able to measure the trilinear Higgs
self-coupling with a relative uncertainty of -7 % and +11 % at 68 % C.L., assuming the Standard Model.
