We present Standard Model predictions for the complete set of phenomenologically relevant electroweak
precision pseudo-observables related to the Z-boson: the leptonic and bottom-quark effective
weak mixing angles $\sin^2\theta_{\rm eff}^\ell$, $\sin^2\theta_{\rm eff}^b$, the Z-boson
partial decay widths $\Gamma_f$, where $f$ indicates any charged lepton, neutrino and quark flavor
(except for the top quark), as well as the total Z decay width $\Gamma_Z$, the branching ratios $R_\ell$,
$R_c$, $R_b$, and the hadronic cross section $\sigma_{\rm had}^0$. The input parameters are the
masses $M_Z$, $M_H$ and $m_t$, and the couplings $\alpha_s$, $\alpha$. The scheme dependence due
to the choice of $M_W$ or its alternative $G_\mu$ as a last input parameter is also discussed. Recent
substantial technical progress in the calculation of Minkowskian massive higher-order Feynman
integrals allows the calculation of the complete electroweak two-loop radiative corrections
to all the observables mentioned. QCD contributions are included appropriately. Results are provided
in terms of simple and convenient parameterization formulae whose coefficients have been determined
from the full numerical multi-loop calculation. The size of the missing electroweak three-loop
or QCD higher-order corrections is estimated. We briefly comment on the prospects for their calculation.
Finally, direct predictions for the $Z{\bar f}f$ vector and axial-vector form-factors are given,
including a discussion of separate order-by-order contributions.
