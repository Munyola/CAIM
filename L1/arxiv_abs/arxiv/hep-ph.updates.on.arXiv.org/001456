We study CP-conserving non-minimal flavour violation in $A_4 \times SU(5)$ inspired Supersymmetric
Grand Unified Theories (GUTs), focussing on the regions of parameter space where dark matter is
successfully accommodated due to a light right-handed smuon a few GeV heavier than the lightest
neutralino. In this region of parameter space we find that some of the flavour-violating parameters
are constrained by the requirement of the dark matter relic density, due to the delicate interplay
between the smuon and neutralino masses. By scanning over GUT scale flavour violating parameters,
constrained by low-energy quark and lepton flavour violating observables, we find a striking difference
in the results in which individual parameters are varied to those where multiple parameters are
varied simultaneously, where the latter relaxes the constraints on flavour violating parameters
due to cancellations and/or correlations. Since charged lepton-flavour violation provides the
strongest constraints within a GUT framework, due to relations between quark and lepton flavour
violation, we examine in detail a prominent correlation between some of the flavour violating parameters
at the GUT scale consistent with the stringent lepton flavour violating process $\mu \rightarrow
e \gamma$. We also examine the relation between GUT scale and low scale flavour violating parameters,
for both quarks and leptons, and show how the usual expectations may be violated due to the correlations
when multiple parameters are varied simultaneously.
