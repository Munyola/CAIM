The production of light anti- and hyper-nuclei provides unique observables to characterise the
system created in high energy proton-proton (pp), proton-nucleus (pA) and nucleus-nucleus (AA)
collisions. In particular, nuclei and hyper-nuclei are special objects with respect to non-composite
hadrons (such as pions, kaons, protons, etc.), because their size is comparable to a fraction or
the whole system created in the collision. Their formation is typically described within the framework
of coalescence and thermal-statistical production models. In order to distinguish between the
two production scenarios, we propose to measure the coalescence parameter B$_{A}$ for different
anti- and hyper-nuclei (that differ by mass, size and internal wave-function) as a function of the
size of the particle emitting source. The latter can be controlled by performing systematic measurements
of light (anti-)(hyper-)nuclei in different collision systems (pp, pA, AA) and as a function of
the multiplicity of particles created in the collision. While it is often argued that the coalescence
and the thermal model approach give very similar predictions for the production of light nuclei
in heavy-ion collisions, our study shows that large differences can be expected for hyper-nuclei
with extended wave-functions, as the hyper-triton. We compare the model predictions with data
from the ALICE experiment and we discuss perspectives for future measurements with the upgraded
detectors during the High-Luminosity LHC phase in the next decade.
