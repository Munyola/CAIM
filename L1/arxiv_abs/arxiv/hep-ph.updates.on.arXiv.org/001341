Transverse momentum dependent parton distributions (TMDPDFs) which appear in factorized cross
sections involve infinite Wilson lines with edges on or close to the light-cone. Since these TMDPDFs
are not directly calculable with a Euclidean path integral in lattice QCD, we study the construction
of quasi-TMDPDFs with finite-length spacelike Wilson lines that are amenable to such calculations.
We define an infrared consistency test to determine which quasi-TMDPDF definitions are related
to the TMDPDF, by carrying out a one-loop study of infrared logarithms of transverse position $b_T\sim
\Lambda_{\rm QCD}^{-1}$, which must agree between them. This agreement is a necessary condition
for the two quantities to be related by perturbative matching. TMDPDFs necessarily involve combining
a hadron matrix element, which nominally depends on a single light-cone direction, with soft matrix
elements that necessarily depend on two light-cone directions. We show at one loop that the simplest
definitions of the quasi hadron matrix element, the quasi soft matrix element, and the resulting
quasi-TMDPDF all fail the infrared consistency test. Ratios of impact parameter quasi-TMDPDFs
still provide nontrivial information about the TMDPDFs, and are more robust since the soft matrix
elements cancel. We show at one loop that such quasi ratios can be matched to ratios of the corresponding
TMDPDFs. We also introduce a modified "bent" quasi soft matrix element which yields a quasi-TMDPDF
that passes the consistency test with the TMDPDF at one loop, and discuss potential issues at higher
orders.
