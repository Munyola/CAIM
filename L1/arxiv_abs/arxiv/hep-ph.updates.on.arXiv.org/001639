A gauged $U(1)_X$ extension of the Standard Model is a simple and consistent framework to naturally
incorporate three right-handed neutrinos (RHNs) for generating the observed light neutrino masses
and mixing by the type-I seesaw mechanism. We examine the collider testability of the $U(1)_X$ model,
both in its minimal form with the conventional charges, as well as with an alternative charge assignment,
via the resonant production of the $U(1)_X$ gauge boson ($Z^\prime$) and its subsequent decay into
a pair of RHNs. We first derive an updated upper limit on the new gauge coupling $g_X$ as a function
of the $Z'$-boson mass from the latest LHC dilepton searches. Then we identify the maximum possible
cross section for the RHN pair-production under these constraints. Finally, we investigate the
possibility of having one of the RHNs long-lived, even for a TeV-scale mass. Employing the general
parametrization for the light neutrino mass matrix to reproduce the observed neutrino oscillation
data, we perform a parameter scan and find a simple formula for the maximum RHN lifetime as a function
of the lightest neutrino mass eigenvalue ($m_{\rm lightest}$). We find that for $m_{\rm lightest}\lesssim
10^{-5}$ eV, one of the RHNs in the minimal $U(1)_X$ scenario can be long-lived with a displaced-vertex
signature which can be searched for at the LHC and/or with a dedicated long-lived particle detector,
such as MATHUSLA. In other words, once a long-lived RHN is observed, we can set an upper bound on the
lightest neutrino mass in this model.
