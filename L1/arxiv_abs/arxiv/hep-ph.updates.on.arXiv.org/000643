Left-Right symmetric model (LRSM) has been an attractive extension of the Standard Model (SM) which
can address the parity violation in the SM electroweak (EW) interaction, generate tiny neutrino
masses, accommodate dark matter (DM) candidates and generate baryogenesis through leptogenesis.
In this work we utilize the minimal LRSM to study the recently reported DAMPE results of cosmic $e^+e^-$
measurement which exhibits a tentative peak around 1.4 TeV, while satisfying the current neutrino
data. The minimal LRSM predicts 10 physical Higgs bosons: four CP-even $H_{1,2,3,4}$, two CP-odd
$A_{1,2}$, two singly charged $H^\pm_{1,2}$ and two doubly charged $H^{\pm\pm}_{1,2}$, all with
increasing masses in the ascending order. We propose to explain the DAMPE peak with scalar DM $m_\chi\sim$
3 TeV in two scenarios: 1) $\chi\chi \to H_1^{++}H_1^{--} \to \ell_i^+\ell_i^+\ell_j^-\ell_j^-$;
2) $\chi\chi \to H_{\{k,l\}}^{++}H_{\{k,l\}}^{--} \to \ell_i^+\ell_i^+\ell_j^-\ell_j^-$
accompanied by $\chi\chi \to H_1^+ H_1^- \to \ell_i^+ \nu_{\ell_i} \ell_j^- \nu_{\ell_j}$ with
$\ell_{i,j}=e,\mu,\tau,\, H_{\{k,l\}}^{\pm\pm}=H_{\{1,2\}}^{\pm\pm}$. We impose various
experimental constraints such as accommodation of a SM-like Higgs, the observed DM relic abundance,
DM direct detection bounds, lepton flavor violation measurements and EW precision observables.
We found that there are ample parameter space which can interpret the DAMPE data while passing the
above constraints. We also discuss the collider signals for benchmark model points.
