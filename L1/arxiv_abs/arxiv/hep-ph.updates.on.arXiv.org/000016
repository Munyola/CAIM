We study single jet production in electron-nucleus collisions e^- + N_A -> J + X, using the 1-jettiness
(\tau_1) global event shape. It inclusively quantifies the pattern of radiation in the final state,
gives enhanced sensitivity to soft radiation at wide angles from the nuclear beam and final-state
jet, and facilitates the resummation of large Sudakov logarithms associated with the veto on additional
jets. Through their effect on the observed pattern of radiation, 1-jettiness can be a useful probe
of nuclear PDFs and power corrections from dynamical effects in the nuclear medium. This formalism
allows for the standard jet shape analysis while simultaneously providing sensitivity to soft
radiation at wide angles from the jet. We use a factorization framework for cross-sections differential
in $\tau_1$ and the transverse momentum (P_{J_T}) and rapidity (y) of the jet, in the region \tau_1<<
P_{J_T}. The restriction $\tau_1 << P_{J_T}$ allows only soft radiation between the nuclear
beam and jet directions, thereby acting as a veto on additional jets. This region is also insensitive
to the details of the jet algorithm, allowing for better theoretical control over resummation,
while providing enhanced sensitivity to nuclear medium effects. We give numerical results at leading
twist, with resummation at the next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic (NNLL) level of accuracy,
for a variety of nuclear targets. Such studies would be ideal for the EIC and the LHeC proposals for
a future electron-ion collider, where a range of nuclear targets are planned.
