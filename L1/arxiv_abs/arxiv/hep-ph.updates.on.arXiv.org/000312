Using ratios of the inverse Laplace transform sum rules within stability criteria for the subtraction
point \mu in addition to the ones of the usual tau spectral sum rule variable and continuum threshold
t_c, we extract the \pi(1300) and K(1460) decay constants to order \alpha_s^4 of perturbative QCD
by including power corrections up to dimension-six condensates, tachyonic gluon mass, instanton
and finite width corrections. Using these inputs with enlarged generous errors, we extract, in
a model-independent and conservative ways, the sum of the scale-independent renormalization
group invariant (RGI) quark masses (m_u+ m_q):q\equiv d,s and the corresponding running masses
(m_u+m_q) evaluated at 2 GeV. By giving the value of the ratio m_u/m_d, we deduce the running quark
masses m_{u,d,s} and condensate <\bar uu> and the scale-independent mass ratios : 2m_s/(m_u+m_d)
and m_s/m_d. Using the positivity of the QCD continuum contribution to the spectral function, we
also deduce, from the inverse Laplace transform sum rules, for the first time to order \alpha_s^4,
new lower bounds on the RGI masses which are translated into the running masses at 2 GeV and into upper
bounds on the running quark condensate <\bar uu>. Our results summarized in Table 2 and compared
with our previous results and with recent lattice averages suggest that precise phenomenological
determinations of the sum of light quark masses require improved experimental measurements of
the \pi(1.3) and K(1.46) hadronic widths and/or decay constants which are the dominant sources
of errors in the analysis.
