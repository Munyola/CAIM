We compute the $n_h$ terms to the massive three loop vector-, axialvector-, scalar- and pseudoscalar
form factors in a direct analytic calculation using the method of large moments. This method has
the advantage, that the master integrals have to be dealt with only in their moment representation,
allowing to also consider quantities which obey differential equations, which are not first order
factorizable (elliptic and higher), already at this level. To obtain all the associated recursions,
up to 8000 moments had to be calculated. A new technique has been applied to solve the associated differential
equation systems. Here the decoupling is performed such, that only minimal depth $\epsilon$--expansions
had to be performed for non--first-order factorizing systems, minimizing the calculation of initial
values. The pole terms in the dimensional parameter $\epsilon$ can be completely predicted using
renormalization group methods, as confirmed by the present results. A series of contributions
at $O(\epsilon^0)$ have first order factorizable representations. For a smaller number of color--zeta
projections this is not the case. All first order factorizing terms can be represented by harmonic
polylogarithms. We also obtain analytic results for the non--first-order factorizing terms by
Taylor series in a variable $x$, for which we have calculated at least 2000 expansion coefficients,
in an approximation. Based on this representation the form factors can be given in the Euclidean
region and in the region $q^2 \approx 0$. Numerical results are presented.
