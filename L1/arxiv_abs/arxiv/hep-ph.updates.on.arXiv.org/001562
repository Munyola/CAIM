Taking a comprehensive view, including a full range of boundary conditions, we reexamine QCD axion
star solutions based on the relativistic Klein-Gordon equation (using the Ruffini-Bonazzola
approach) and its non-relativistic limit, the Gross-Pit\"aevskii equation. A single free parameter,
conveniently chosen as the central value of the wave function with range $0 < Z(0)< \infty$, or alternatively
the chemical potential with range $-m<\mu< 0$ (where $m$ is the axion mass), uniquely determines
a spherically-symmetric ground state solution, the axion condensate. We clarify how the interplay
of various terms of the Klein-Gordon equation determines the properties of solutions in three separate
regions: the structurally stable dilute and dense regions, and the intermediate, structurally
unstable transition region. From the Klein-Gordon equation, one can derive alternative equations
of motion including the Gross-Pit\"aevskii and Sine-Gordon equations, which have been used previously
to describe axion stars in the dense region. In this work, we clarify precisely how and why such methods
break down as the binding energy increases, emphasizing the necessity of using the full relativistic
Klein-Gordon approach. Finally, we point out that, even after including perturbative axion number
violating corrections, solutions to the equations of motion, which assume approximate conservation
of axion number, break down completely in the strong coupling regime where the magnitude of the chemical
potential approaches the axion mass.
