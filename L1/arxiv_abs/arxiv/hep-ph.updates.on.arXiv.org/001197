Infrared divergences have long been heralded to cancel in sufficiently inclusive cross-sections,
according to the famous Kinoshita-Lee-Nauenberg theorem which mandates an initial and final state
sum. While well-motivated, this theorem is much weaker than necessary: for finiteness, one need
only sum over initial $\textit{or}$ final states. Moreover, the cancellation generically requires
the inclusion of the forward scattering process. We provide a number of examples showing the importance
of this revised understanding: in $e^+e^- \to Z$ at next-to-leading order, one can sum over certain
initial and final states with an arbitrary number of extra photons, or only over final states with
a finite number of photons, if forward scattering is included. For Compton scattering, infrared
finiteness requires the indistinguishability of hard forward-scattered electrons and photons.
This implies that in addition to experimental limits on the energy and angular resolution, there
must also be an experimental limit on the momentum at which electric charge can be observed. Similar
considerations are required to explain why the rate for $\gamma \gamma$ to scatter into photons
alone is infrared divergent but the rate for $\gamma \gamma$ to scatter into photons or charged particles
is finite. This new understanding sheds light on the importance of including degenerate initial
states in physical predictions, the relevance of disconnected Feynman diagrams, the importance
of dressing initial or final-state charged particles, and the quest to properly define the $S$ matrix.
