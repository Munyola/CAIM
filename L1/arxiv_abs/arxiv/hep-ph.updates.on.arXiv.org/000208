We construct empirical models of the diffuse gamma-ray background toward the Galactic Center.
Including all known point sources and a template of emission associated with interactions of cosmic
rays with molecular gas, we show that the extended emission observed previously in the Fermi Large
Area Telescope data toward the Galactic Center is detected at high significance for all permutations
of the diffuse model components. However, we find that the fluxes and spectra of the sources in our
model change significantly depending on the background model. In particular, the spectrum of the
central Sgr A$^\ast$ source is less steep than in previous works and the recovered spectrum of the
extended emission has large systematic uncertainties, especially at lower energies. If the extended
emission is interpreted to be due to dark matter annihilation, we find annihilation into pure $b$-quark
and $\tau$-lepton channels to be statistically equivalent goodness-of-fits. In the case of the
pure $b$-quark channel, we find a dark matter mass of $39.4\left(^{+3.7}_{-2.9}\rm\ stat.\right)\left(\pm
7.9\rm\ sys.\right)\rm\ GeV$, while a pure $\tau^{+} \tau^{-}$ channel case has an estimated dark
matter mass of $9.43\left(^{+0.63}_{-0.52}\rm\ stat.\right)(\pm 1.2\rm\ sys.)\ GeV$. Alternatively,
if the extended emission is interpreted to be astrophysical in origin such as due to unresolved millisecond
pulsars, we obtain strong bounds on dark matter annihilation, although systematic uncertainties
due to the dependence on the background models are significant.
