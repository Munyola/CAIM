Massive dwarf galaxies that merge with the Milky Way on prograde orbits can be dragged into the disk
plane before being completely disrupted. Such mergers can contribute to an accreted stellar disk
and a dark matter disk. We present evidence for Nyx, a vast new stellar stream in the vicinity of the
Sun, that may provide the first indication that such an event occurred in the Milky Way. We identify
about 500 stars that have coherent radial and prograde motion in this stream using a catalog of accreted
stars built by applying deep learning methods to the second Gaia data release. Nyx is concentrated
within $\pm 2$ kpc of the Galactic midplane and spans the full radial range studied (6.5-9.5 kpc).
The kinematics of Nyx stars are distinct from those of both the thin and thick disk. In particular,
its rotational speed lags the disk by $\sim 80$ km/s and its stars follow more eccentric orbits. A
small number of Nyx stars have chemical abundances or inferred ages; from these, we deduce that Nyx
stars have a peak metallicity of [Fe/H] $\sim -0.5$ and ages $\sim $10-13 Gyr. Taken together with
the kinematic observations, these results strongly favor the interpretation that Nyx is the remnant
of a disrupted dwarf galaxy. To further justify this interpretation, we explicitly demonstrate
that metal-rich, prograde streams like Nyx can be found in the disk plane of Milky Way-like galaxies
using the FIRE hydrodynamic simulations. Future spectroscopic studies will be able to validate
whether Nyx stars originate from a single progenitor.
