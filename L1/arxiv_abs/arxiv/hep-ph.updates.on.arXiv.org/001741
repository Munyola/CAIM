To perform leptonic unitarity test, understanding the system with the three-flavor active neutrinos
with non-unitary mixing is required, in particular, on its evolution in matter and the general features
of parameter correlations. In this paper, we discuss the nature of correlation between $\nu$SM
CP phase $\delta$ and the $\alpha$ parameters, where $\alpha$'s are to quantify the effect of non-unitarity.
A question arose on whether it is real and physical when the same authors uncovered, in a previous
paper, the $\delta - \alpha$ parameter correlation of the form $[ e^{- i \delta } \bar{\alpha}_{\mu
e}, e^{ - i \delta} \bar{\alpha}_{\tau e}, \bar{\alpha}_{\tau \mu} ]$ using the PDG convention
of the flavor mixing matrix $U_{\text{\tiny MNS}}$. This analysis utilizes a perturbative framework
which is valid at around the atmospheric MSW enhancement. In fact, the phase correlation depends
on the convention of $U_{\text{\tiny MNS}}$, and the existence of the SOL convention ($e^{ \pm i
\delta}$ attached to $s_{12}$) in which the correlation is absent triggered a doubt that it may not
be physical. We resolve the controversy of whether the phase correlation is physical by examining
the correlation in completely different kinematical phase space, at around the solar-scale enhancement.
It reveals a dynamical $\delta-$(blob of $\alpha$ parameter) correlation in the SOL convention
which prevails in the other conventions of $U_{\text{\tiny MNS}}$. It indicates that the phase
correlation seen in this and the previous papers is physical and cannot be an artifact of $U_{\text{\tiny
MNS}}$ convention.
