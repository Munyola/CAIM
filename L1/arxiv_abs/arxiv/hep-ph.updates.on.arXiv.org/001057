We carry out an analysis of $\pi\pi$ scattering in the $IJ=00$, $11$ and $20$ channels in configuration
space up to a maximal center-of-mass energy $\sqrt{s}=1.4$ GeV. We separate the interaction into
two regions marked by an elementarity radius of the system; namely, a long distance region above
which pions can be assumed to interact as elementary particles and a short distance region where
many physical effects cannot be disentangled. The long distance interaction is described by chiral
dynamics, where a two-pion-exchange potential is identified, computed and compared to lattice
calculations. The short distance piece corresponds to a coarse grained description exemplified
by a superposition of delta-shell potentials sampling the interaction with the minimal wavelength.
We show how the so constructed non-perturbative scattering amplitude complies with the proper
analytic structure, allowing for an explicit N/D type decomposition in terms of the corresponding
Jost functions and fulfilling dispersion relations without subtractions. We also address renormalization
issues in coordinate space and investigate the role of crossing when fitting the scattering amplitudes
above and below threshold to Roy-equation results. At higher energies, we show how inelasticities
can be described by one single complex and energy dependent parameter. A successful description
of the data can be achieved with a minimal number of fitting parameters, suggesting that coarse graining
is a viable approach to analyze hadronic processes.
