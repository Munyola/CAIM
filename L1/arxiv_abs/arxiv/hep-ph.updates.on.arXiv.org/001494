The combined analysis of the BaBar, Belle, and LHCb data on $B\to D\tau\nu$, $B\to D^*\tau\nu$ and
$B_c\to J/\Psi\tau\nu$ decay observables shows evidence of physics beyond the Standard Model
(SM). In this article, we study all the one- and two-dimensional scenarios which can be generated
by adding a single new particle to the SM. We put special emphasis on the model-discriminating power
of $F_L(D^*)$ and of the $\tau$ polarizations, and especially on the constraint from the branching
fraction ${\rm BR}(B_c\to\tau\nu)$. We critically review this constraint and do not support the
aggressive limit of ${\rm BR}(B_c\to\tau\nu)<10\%$ used in some analyses. While the impact of
$F_L(D^*)$ is currently still limited, the ${\rm BR}(B_c\to\tau\nu)$ constraint has a significant
impact: depending on whether one uses a limit of $60\%$, $30\%$ or $10\%$, the pull for new physics
(NP) in scalar operators changes drastically. More specifically, for a conservative $60\%$ limit
a scenario with scalar operators gives the best fit to data, while for an aggressive $10\%$ limit
this scenario is strongly disfavored and the best fit is obtained in a scenario in which only a left-handed
vector operator is generated. We find a sum rule for the branching ratios of $B\to D\tau\nu$, $B\to
D^*\tau\nu$ and $\Lambda_b\to \Lambda_c\tau\nu$ which holds for any NP contribution to the Wilson
coefficients. This sum rule entails an enhancement of ${\rm BR}(\Lambda_b\to \Lambda_c\tau\nu)$
over its SM prediction by $(24\pm 6)\%$ for the current $\mathcal{R}(D^{(*)})$ data.
