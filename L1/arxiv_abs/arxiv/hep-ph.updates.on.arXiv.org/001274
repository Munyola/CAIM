We address the problem of reconstructing the phase-space distribution function for an extended
collisionless system, with known density profile and in equilibrium within an axisymmetric gravitational
potential. Assuming that it depends on only two integrals of motion, namely the energy and the component
of the angular momentum along the axis of symmetry $L_z$, there is a one-to-one correspondence between
the density profile and the component of the distribution function that is even in $L_z$, as well
as between the weighted azimuthal velocity profile and the odd component. This inversion procedure
was originally proposed by Lynden-Bell and later refined in its numerical implementation by Hunter
\& Qian; after overcoming a technical difficulty, we apply it here for the first time in presence
of a strongly flattened component, as a novel approach of extracting the phase-space distribution
function for dark matter particles in the halo of spiral galaxies. We compare results obtained for
realistic axisymmetric models to those in the spherical symmetric limit as assumed in previous
analyses, showing the rather severe shortcomings in the latter. We then apply the scheme to the Milky
Way and discuss the implications for the direct dark matter searches. In particular, we reinterpret
the null results of the Xenon1T experiment for spin-(in)dependent interactions and make predictions
for the annual modulation of the signal for a set of axisymmetric models, including a self-consistently
defined co-rotating halo.
