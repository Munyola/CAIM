In this letter, taking the Nambu--Jona--Lasinio model as an example, we propose a new self-consistent
mean field approximation method by means of Fierz transformation. This new self-consistent mean
field approximation introduces a new free parameter $\alpha$ to be determined by experiments and
when $\alpha$ takes 0.5, it reduces to the mean field approximation that was commonly used in the
past. Then based on this self-consistent mean field approximation, we study the influence of the
undetermined parameter $\alpha$ on the phase diagram of the two-flavor strong interaction matter.
It is found that the value of $\alpha$ plays an extremely important role in the study of strong interaction
phase diagram. It not only changes the position of the phase transition point of strong interaction
matter, but also affects the order of phase transition, for example, when $\alpha$ is greater than
the critical value $\alpha_c = 0.71$, then the strong interaction matter phase diagram no longer
exists critical end point. In addition, in the case of zero temperature and finite density, we also
found that when $\alpha$ is greater than 1.044, the pseudo-critical chemical potential is about
4$\sim$5 times the saturation density of the nuclear matter, which agrees with the expected results
from the image of hadrons degree of freedom. The resulting equations of state of strong interaction
matter at low temperatures and high densities will have an important impact on the study of the mass
radius relationship of neutron stars and the merging process of binary neutron stars.
