We propose a new version of the scalar Weak Gravity Conjecture (WGC) which would apply to any scalar
field coupled to quantum gravity. For a single scalar it is given by the differential constraint
$V''\leq (2V'''^2/V''-V'''')M_{\text{p}}^2$. It corresponds to the statement that self-interactions
of a scalar must be stronger than gravity for any value of the scalar field. We find that the solutions
which saturate the bound correspond to towers of extremal states with mass $m^2(\phi)=m_0^2/((R/m)^2+1/(nR)^2)$,
with $R^2=e^\phi$, consistent with the emergence of an extra dimension at large or small $R$ and
the existence of extended objects (strings). These states act as WGC states for the scalar $\phi$.
It is also consistent with the distance swampland conjecture with a built-in duality symmetry.
From this constraint one can derive several swampland conjectures. In particular one finds that
an axion potential is only consistent if $f\leq M_{\text{p}}$. The conjecture has far reaching
consequences and applies to several interesting physical systems: i) Among chaotic inflation
potentials only those asymptotically linear may survive. ii) If applied to the radion of the circle
compactification of the Standard Model to 3D, the constraint implies that the 4D cosmological constant
scale must be larger than the mass of the lightest neutrino, which must be Dirac and in normal hierarchy.
iii) It also constraints simplest moduli fixing string models. The simplest KKLT model is compatible
with the constraints but the latter may be relevant for some choices of parameters.
