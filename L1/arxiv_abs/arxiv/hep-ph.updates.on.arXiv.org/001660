The lifetime of the neutron, although being a fundamental quantity in particle physics, is to date
still associated with a puzzle: different techniques of measurements find values of the lifetime
which are mutually incompatible. While methods based on beams of neutrons find a (average) value
$\tau_{n}^{\text{beam}} =888.1\pm2.0$ s, methods based on traps obtain a shorter lifetime $\tau_{n}
^{\text{trap}}=879.37\pm0.58$ s, i.e. a $\sim 4\sigma$ mismatch. This is the so-called neutron
decay anomaly. We propose here a novel interpretation of this puzzle based solely on quantum mechanics
(no need of physics beyond the standard model): if the measurement apparatus and the surrounding
environment are able to observe the unstable system at very short (but not too short) times after
the preparation of it, the so called inverse quantum Zeno (IZE) effect can take place: the IZE corresponds
an increase of the decay rate through the interaction of the system with the environment. We argue
that such a quantum phenomenon can be realized in the case of trap experiments but not in the case of
beam experiments. There are mainly two reasons behind our interpretation of the neutron decay anomaly:
(i) the intrinsic dependence of the 3-body weak decay rate on the Q value of the decay (the Sargent
rule); (ii) the very peculiar setup of neutron traps, in which up to $\sim 10^{8}$ ultra cold neutrons
are confined together. This feature can help to increase the frequency of dephasing of the wave function
(equivalent to the `collapse'), necessary to obtain the inverse quantum Zeno effect.
