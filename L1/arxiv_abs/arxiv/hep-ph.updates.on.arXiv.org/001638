The production of the hidden-charm pentaquarks $P_{c}$ via pion-induced reaction on a proton target
is investigated within an effective Lagrangian approach. Three experimentally observed states,
$P_c(4312)$, $P_c(4440)$, and $P_c(4457)$, are considered in the calculation, and the Reggeized
$t$-channel meson exchange is considered as main background for the reaction $\pi ^{-}p\rightarrow
J/\psi n$. The numerical results show that the experimental data of the total cross section of the
reaction $\pi^{-}p\rightarrow J/\psi n$ at $W\simeq 5$ GeV can be well explained by contribution
of the Reggeized $t$ channel with reasonable cutoff. If the branching ratios $Br[P_{c}\rightarrow
J/\psi N]\simeq 3\%$ and $Br[P_{c}\rightarrow \pi N]\simeq 0.05\%$ are taken, the average value
of the cross section from the $P_{c}(4312)$ contribution is about 1.2 nb/100 MeV, which is consistent
with existing rude data at near-threshold energies. The results indicate that the branching ratios
of the $P_{c}$ states to the $J/\psi N$ and $\pi N$ should be small. The shape of differential cross
sections shows that the Reggeized $t$-channel provides a sharp increase at extreme forward angles,
while the differential cross sections from the $P_{c}$ states contributions are relatively flat.
High-precision experimental measurements on the reaction $\pi ^{-}p\rightarrow J/\psi n$ at
near-threshold energies are suggested to confirm the LHCb hidden-charm pentaquarks as genuine
states, and such experiments are also helpful to understand the origin of these resonance structures.
