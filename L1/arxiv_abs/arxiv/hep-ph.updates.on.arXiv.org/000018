The intrinsic flux of very high energy (VHE, Energy > 100 GeV) gamma-rays from extragalactic
sources is attenuated due to pair production in the interaction with photons of the extragalactic
background light (EBL). Depending on the distance of the source, the Universe should be opaque to
VHE photons above a certain energy. However, indications exist that the Universe is more transparent
than previously thought. A recent statistical analysis of a large sample of VHE spectra shows that
the correction for absorption with current EBL models is too strong for the data points with the highest
attenuation. An explanation might be the oscillation of VHE photons into hypothetical axion-like
particles (ALPs) in ambient magnetic fields. This mechanism would decrease the opacity as ALPs
propagate unimpeded over cosmological distances. Here, a large sample of VHE gamma-ray spectra
obtained with imaging air Cherenkov telescopes is used to set, for the first time, lower limits on
the photon-ALP coupling constant over a large range of ALP masses. The conversion in different magnetic
field configurations, including intra-cluster and intergalactic magnetic fields together with
the magnetic field of the Milky Way, is investigated taking into account the energy dependence of
the oscillations. For optimistic scenarios of the intervening magnetic fields, a lower limit on
the photon-ALP coupling of the order of $10^{-12}\mathrm{GeV}^{-1}$ is obtained whereas more
conservative model assumptions result in $2\times10^{-11}\mathrm{GeV}^{-1}$. The latter value
is within reach of future dedicated ALP searches.
