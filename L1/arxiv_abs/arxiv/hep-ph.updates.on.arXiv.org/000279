We initiate the study of novel thermal dark matter (DM) scenarios where present-day annihilation
of DM in the galactic center produces boosted stable particles in the dark sector. These stable particles
are typically a subdominant DM component, but because they are produced with a large Lorentz boost
in this process, they can be detected in large volume terrestrial experiments via neutral-current-like
interactions with electrons or nuclei. This novel DM signal thus combines the production mechanism
associated with indirect detection experiments (i.e. galactic DM annihilation) with the detection
mechanism associated with direct detection experiments (i.e. DM scattering off terrestrial targets).
Such processes are generically present in multi-component DM scenarios or those with non-minimal
DM stabilization symmetries. As a proof of concept, we present a model of two-component thermal
relic DM, where the dominant heavy DM species has no tree-level interactions with the standard model
and thus largely evades direct and indirect DM bounds. Instead, its thermal relic abundance is set
by annihilation into a subdominant lighter DM species, and the latter can be detected in the boosted
channel via the same annihilation process occurring today. Especially for dark sector masses in
the 10 MeV-10 GeV range, we find potentially promising signals in experiments designed for detecting
neutrinos or proton decay, in particular Super-K and its upgrade Hyper-K, as well as the PINGU/MICA
extensions of IceCube. This boosted DM phenomenon highlights the distinctive signatures possible
from non-minimal dark sectors.
