Experimentally, jet physics studies face an unavoidable task: distinguishing, at the detector
level, the particles produced in the hard partonic scattering from the ones created in unrelated
soft processes such as pileup interactions in high-luminosity proton-proton scattering or the
underlying event in heavy-ion collisions. The fluctuating nature of the background constitutes
the main source of uncertainty for any subtraction algorithm. Aiming at mitigating the effect of
such fluctuations, we present a new method to estimate the background contribution to the transverse
momentum on a jet-by-jet basis. Our approach is based on estimating the median background momentum
density stored above a $p_{\rm T}$-cut applied at the constituent level and an experimentally accessible
correction term related to the signal contribution below the cut. This allows to trade part of the
uncertainty due to background contamination for that of the signal below the cut, similarly to SoftKiller
method. We propose to reduce the fluctuations of the latter by exploiting intrinsic correlations
among the soft and hard sectors of QCD jets. Our data-driven approach is tested against PYTHIA8 and
JEWEL di-jet events embedded in a thermal background and compared to the area-median and SoftKiller
methods. The main result of this study is a $\sim 5\!-\!40\%$ improvement on the resolution of the
reconstructed jet $p_T$ compared to previous methods in a high-luminosity proton-proton scenario.
Its applicability in a heavy-ion context is also discussed.
