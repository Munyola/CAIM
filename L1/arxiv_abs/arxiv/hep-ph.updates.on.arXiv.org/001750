The present calculations in perturbative QCD reach the order $\alpha_s^4$ for several correlators
calculated to five loops, and the huge computational difficulties make unlikely the full six-loop
calculation in the near future. This situation has practical consequences, in particular the treatment
of the higher orders of the perturbation series for the current-current correlator of light quarks
is one of the main sources of errors in the extraction of the strong coupling from hadronic $\tau$
decays. Several approximate estimates of the next coefficients of the corresponding Adler function
have been proposed, using various arguments. In the present paper we exploit the analytic structure
of the Adler function in the Borel plane, which allows the definition of an improved perturbative
expansion in powers of a conformal variable which maps the cut Borel plane onto the unit disk. The
new expansions converge in a larger domain of the Borel plane and, when reexpanded in powers of the
strong coupling, yield definite values for the higher perturbative coefficients. We apply the
method to the Adler function in the $\overline{\rm MS}$ scheme and to a suitable weighted integral
of this function in the complex $s$ plane, chosen such as to avoid model-dependent assumptions on
analyticity. Our results $c_{5,1}=287 \pm 40$, $c_{6,1}=2948 \pm 208$ and $c_{7,1}=(1.89 \pm
0.75)\times 10^4$, for the six, seven and eigth-loop coefficients, respectively, agree with a
recent determination from Pad\'e approximants applied to the perturbative expansion of the hadronic
$\tau$ decay rate.
