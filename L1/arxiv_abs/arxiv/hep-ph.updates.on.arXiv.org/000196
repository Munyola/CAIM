The Fermi-LAT data appear to have an excess of gamma-rays from the inner 150 pc of the Galactic Center.
The main explanations proposed for this are: an unresolved population of millisecond pulsars (MSPs),
dark matter (DM) annihilation, and nonthermal bremsstrahlung produced by a population of electrons
interacting with neutral gas in molecular clouds. The first two options have spatial templates
well fitted by the square of a generalized Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profile with inner slope $\gamma=1.2$.
We model the third option with a 20 cm continuum emission Galactic Ridge template. A template based
on the HESS residuals is shown to give similar results. The gamma-ray excess is found to be best fit
by a combination of the generalized NFW squared template and a Galactic Ridge template. We also find
the spectra of each template is not significantly affected in the combined fit and is consistent
with previous single template fits. That is the generalized NFW squared spectrum can be fit by either
of order 1000 unresolved MSPs or DM with mass around 30 GeV, a thermal cross-section, and mainly annihilating
to $b \bar{b}$ quarks. While the Galactic Ridge continues to have a spectrum consistent with a population
of nonthermal electrons whose spectrum also provides a good fit to synchrotron emission measurements.
We also show that the current DM fit may be hard to test, even with 10 years of Fermi-LAT data, especially
if there is a mixture of DM and MSPs contributing to the signal, in which case the implied DM cross-section
will be suppressed.
