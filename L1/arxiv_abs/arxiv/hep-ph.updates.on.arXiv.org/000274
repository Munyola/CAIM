We study LHC signatures of displaced vertices and long-lived charged particles within the context
of the Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model with right-handed (RH) sneutrinos. In this
construction the RH neutrino can be produced directly from Higgs decays or in association with a
RH sneutrino when the latter is the lightest supersymmetric particle. The RH neutrino is generally
long-lived, since its decay width is proportional to the neutrino Yukawa, a parameter which is predicted
to be small. The RH neutrino late decay can therefore give rise to displaced vertices at the LHC, which
can be identified through the decay products, which involve two leptons (2l+ MET) or a lepton with
two jets (ljj). We simulate this signal for the current LHC configuration (a centre of mass of 8 TeV
and an integrated luminosity of L=20 fb^-1), and a future one (13 TeV and L=100 fb^-1). We show that
a region of the parameter space of this model can be probed and that the RH neutrino mass can be reconstructed
from the end-point of the two-lepton invariant mass distribution or the central value of the mass
distribution for two jets plus one lepton. Another exotic signature of this construction is the
production of a long-lived stau. If the stau is the next-to-lightest supersymmetric particle,
it can decay through diagrams involving the small neutrino Yukawa, and would escape the detector
leaving a characteristic trail. We also simulate this signal for various benchmark points and show
that the model can be within the reach of the future run of the LHC.
