The observation of radial flow like behaviors in pp collisions at LHC energy can be qualitatively
explained by both hydro based models (e.g. EPOS 3) and other mechanisms like multi-parton interactions
(MPI) with color reconnection (CR) as implemented in PYTHIA 8 - making it difficult to pinpoint the
underlying mechanism responsible for the observed flow like effects in high multiplicity pp collisions.
In this paper, using the two particle correlation technique, we have demonstrated that the multiplicity
evolution of the near side jet-like yield associated with pion and proton triggers selected from
intermediate $p_{T}$ (where inclusive baryon to meson enhancement has been observed) can disentangle
the effect of hydrodynamical flow from the effect of MPI based color reconnection in a straightforward
way. Both EPOS 3 and PYTHIA 8 (with colcor reconnection) can qualitatively generate the observed
baryon to meson ehancement at intermediate $p_{T}$. In EPOS 3, the proton triggered yield decreases
at a larger rate with multiplicity compared to the pion triggered case creating trigger dilution.
However, no such trigger species dependence of the near side jet-like yield has been observed in
case of PYTHIA 8 which indicates that inclusive baryon to meson enhancement at intermediate $p_{T}$
does not necessarily lead to the trigger dilution. Thus, this observable can be used as an useful
tool to disentangle the real hydrodynamical effects from color reconnection in small collision
systems where hydrodynamical collectivity is not so intuitive.
