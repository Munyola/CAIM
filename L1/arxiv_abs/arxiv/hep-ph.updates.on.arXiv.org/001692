The LHCb collaboration have recently updated their analysis of the resonant $J/\psi p$ mass spectrum
in the decay $\Lambda_b^0 \to J/\psi p K^-$, making use of their combined Run 1 and Run 2 data. In the
updated analysis, three narrow states, $P_c (4440)^+$, $P_c (4457)^+$,and $P_c (4312)^+$, are
observed. The spin-parity assignments of these states are not yet known. We interpret these narrow
resonances as compact hidden-charm diquark-diquark-antiquark pentaquarks. Using an effective
Hamiltonian, based on constituent quarks and diquarks, we calculate the pentaquark mass spectrum
for the complete $SU (3)_F$ lowest $S$- and $P$-wave multiplets, taking into account dominant spin-spin,
spin-orbit, orbital and tensor interactions. The resulting spectrum is very rich and we work out
the quark flavor compositions, masses, and $J^P$ quantum numbers of the pentaquarks. However,
heavy quark symmetry restricts the observable states in $\Lambda_b$-baryon, as well as in the decays
of the other weakly-decaying $b$-baryons, $\Xi_b$ and $\Omega_b$. In addition, some of the pentaquark
states are estimated to lie below the $J/\psi p$ threshold in $\Lambda_b$-decays (and corresponding
thresholds in $\Xi_b$- and $\Omega_b$-decays). They decay via $c \bar c$ annihilation into light
hadrons or a dilepton pair, and are expected to be narrower than the $P_c$-states observed. We anticipate
their discovery, as well as of the other pentaquark states present in the spectrum at the LHC, and
in the long-term future at a Tera-$Z$ factory.
