We provide a quantitative analysis of the halo model in the context of massive neutrino cosmologies.
We discuss all the ingredients necessary to model the non-linear matter and cold dark matter power
spectra and compare with the results of N-body simulations that incorporate massive neutrinos.
Our neutrino halo model is able to capture the non-linear behavior of matter clustering with a $\sim
20\%$ accuracy up to very non-linear scales of $k=10~h/$Mpc (which would be affected by baryon physics).
The largest discrepancies arise in the range $k=0.5-1~h/$Mpc where the 1-halo and 2-halo terms
are comparable and are present also in a massless neutrino cosmology. However, at scales $k<0.2~h/$Mpc
our neutrino halo model agrees with the results of N-body simulations at the level of 8\% for total
neutrino masses of $<0.3$ eV. We also model the neutrino non-linear density field as a sum of a
linear and clustered component and predict the neutrino power spectrum and the cold dark matter-neutrino
cross-power spectrum up to $k=1~h/$Mpc with $\sim$ 30\% accuracy. For masses below 0.15 eV the neutrino
halo model captures the neutrino induced suppression, casted in terms of matter power ratios between
massive and massless scenarios, with a 2\% agreement with the results of N-body/neutrino simulations.
Finally, we provide a simple application of the halo model: the computation of the clustering of
galaxies, in massless and massive neutrinos cosmologies, using a simple Halo Occupation Distribution
scheme and our halo model extension.
