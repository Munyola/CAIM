The neutral current non-standard interactions (NSI's) of neutrino with matter fermions while
propagating through long distances inside the Earth matter can give rise to the extra matter potentials
apart from the standard MSW potential due to the $W$-mediated interactions in matter. In this paper,
we explore the impact of flavor violating neutral current NSI parameter $\varepsilon_{\mu\tau}$
in the oscillation of atmospheric neutrino and antineutrino using the 50 kt magnetized ICAL detector
at INO. We find that due to non-zero $\varepsilon_{\mu\tau}$, $\nu_\mu\rightarrow\nu_\mu$ and
$\bar\nu_\mu\rightarrow\bar\nu_\mu$ transition probabilities get modified substantially
at higher energies and longer baselines, where vacuum oscillation dominates. We estimate the sensitivity
of the ICAL detector for various choices of binning schemes and observables. The most optimistic
bound on $\varepsilon_{\mu\tau}$ that we obtain is $-0.01 < \varepsilon_{\mu\tau} < 0.01 $ at 90$\%$
C.L. using 500 kt$\cdot$yr exposure and considering $E_\mu,\, \cos\theta_\mu,\,E'_{\rm had}$
as observables in their ranges [1, 21] GeV, [-1, 1], and [0, 25] GeV respectively. For the first time
we show that the charge identification capability of the ICAL detector is crucial to set stringent
constraints on $\varepsilon_{\mu\tau}$. We also show that when we marginalize over $\varepsilon_{\mu\tau}$
in fit in its range of -0.1 to 0.1, the mass hierarchy sensitivity deteriorates by 10$\%$ to 20$\%$
depending on the analysis mode, and the precision measurements of atmospheric parameters remain
quite robust at the ICAL detector.
