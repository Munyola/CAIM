In order for neutralino dark matter to avoid being overproduced in the early universe, these particles
must annihilate (or coannihilate) rather efficiently. Neutralinos with sufficiently large couplings
to annihilate at such high a rate (such as those resulting from gaugino-higgsino mixing, as in "well-tempered"
or "focus point" scenarios), however, have become increasingly disfavored by the null results
of XENON100 and other direct detection experiments. One of the few remaining ways that neutralinos
could potentially evade such constraints is if they annihilate through a resonance, as can occur
if 2$m_{\chi^0}$ falls within about $\sim$10% of either $m_{A/H}$, $m_h$, or $m_Z$. If no signal
is observed from upcoming direct detection experiments, the degree to which such a resonance must
be tuned will increase significantly. In this paper, we quantify the degree to which such a resonance
must be tuned in order to evade current and projected constraints from direct detection experiments.
Assuming a future rate of progress among direct detection experiments that is similar to that obtained
over the past decade, we project that within 7 years the light Higgs and $Z$ pole regions will be entirely
closed, while the remaining parameter space near the $A/H$ resonance will require that $2m_{\chi^0}$
be matched to the central value (near $m_A$) to within less than 4%. At this rate of progress, it will
be a little over a decade before multi-ton direct detection experiments will be able to close the
remaining, highly-tuned, regions of the $A/H$ resonance parameter space.
