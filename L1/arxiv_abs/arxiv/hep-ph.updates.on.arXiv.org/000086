The idea of left-right symmetry with mirror fermions is very appealing from the symmetry point of
view. In this picture, unlike the Standard Model, the symmetry is not only left-right symmetric,
but each left handed fermion multiplet is accompanied by new right handed fermion multiplet of opposite
chirality. In this work, we consider a gauge symmetry, $SU(3)_c \otimes SU(2)_L\otimes SU(2)_R
\otimes U(1)_{Y^\prime}$ supplemented by a discrete $Z_2$ symmetry. Instead of having right handed
multiplets for each left handed multiplets of the same fermions as in the usual left-right model,
the mirror model include right handed doublets involving new fermions (called mirrors), and similarly
for each right handed singlet, there are corresponding mirror singlets. Thus the gauge anomaly
is naturally absent in this model, and the model also provide a solution for the strong CP problem
because of parity conservation. The first stage of symmetry breaking is achieved by a doublet mirror
Higgs with a vacuum expectation value $\simeq 10^7$ GeV, needed to explain the neutrino mass $\simeq
10^{-11}$ GeV. The mirror fermions can mix with the ordinary fermions via a scalar which is singlet
under the gauge symmetry. In this model, only light mirror particles, having masses in the few hundred
GeV range are $\hat{e}, \hat{u}, \hat{d}$ with well-defined spectrum. $\hat{u}$ and $\hat{d}$
can be pair produced at the LHC, and can be detected as ($u Z$) and ($d Z$) resonances. We discuss the
signals of these mirror fermions at the LHC, and find that the reach at the LHC can be as large as $m_{\hat
q}\simeq 800$ GeV.
