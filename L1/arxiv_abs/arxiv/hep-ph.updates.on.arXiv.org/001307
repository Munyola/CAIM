Studies of the hadron formation in hard processes on nuclei were focusing on hadrons in the current
fragmentation region. Little is known about the space-time picture of formation of hadrons in the
nucleus fragmentation region, in particular, in deep inelastic scattering (DIS). Study of the
nucleus decay via emission of neutrons provides a rare opportunity to probe this domain at collider
energies. This paper reports on the hybrid dynamical+statistical (GiBUU+SMM) calculations of
neutron production in proton-, muon- and virtual photon-induced collisions with nuclei. We confirm
the conclusion that the E665 data on neutron production in $\mu^-$ + Pb DIS indicate a strong suppression
of the final state interaction for hadrons with momenta above a value as low as $\sim 1$ GeV/c. This
is well below the momentum range for which formation time and color transparency effects become
important. In a short-run perspective, the ultraperipheral heavy-ion collisions at the LHC and
RHIC can be used to test this suppression. We focus on the direct photon process in which a photon coherently
emitted by one nucleus interacts with a gluon from another nucleus producing a pair of jets. We present
our predictions for the neutron multiplicity distributions and $p_t$-spectra in photon - nucleus
collisions at the energies accessible at the LHC and RHIC for direct photon kinematics for several
models of hadron formation. We argue that ultimately studies of the neutron production in $\gamma
A$ collisions would open a new window on the small $x$ dynamics and hadron component of the photon
wave function.
