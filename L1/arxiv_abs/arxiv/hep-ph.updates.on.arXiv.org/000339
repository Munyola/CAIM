The shape of the electron is studied using lowest-order perturbation theory. Quantities used to
probe the structure of the proton: form factors, generalized parton distributions, transverse
densities, Wigner distributions and the angular momentum content are computed for the electron-photon
component of the electron wave function. The influence of longitudinally polarized photons, demanded
by the need for infrared regularization via a non-zero photon mass, is included. The appropriate
value of the photon mass depends on experimental conditions, and consequently the size of the electron
(as defined by the slope of its Dirac form factor) bound in a hydrogen atom is found to be about four
times larger than when the electron is free. The shape of the electron, as determined from the transverse
density and generalized parton distributions is shown to not be round, and the free electron is shown
to be far less round than the bound electron. An electron distribution function (analogous to the
quark distribution function) is defined, and that of the bound electron is shown to be suppressed
compared to that of the free electron. If the relative transverse momentum of the virtual electron
and photon is large compared with the electron mass, the virtual electron and photon each carry nearly
the total angular momentum of the physical electron (1/2), with the orbital angular momentum being
nearly (-1/2). Including the non-zero photon mass leads to the suppression of end-point contributions
to form factors. Implications for proton structure and color transparency are discussed.
