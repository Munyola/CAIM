The event GW170817/GRB 170817A, discovered via the successful joint observation of its gravitational
wave radiation and its multi-wavelength electromagnetic counterparts, was the first definite
"smoking-gun" from the merger of two neutron stars (NSs). However, the remnant of the merger remains
unknown. Piro et al. recently claimed that a low-significance X-ray variability in GRB 170817A.
By systematically comparing the properties of variability in the afterglow of GRB 170817A and X-ray
flares in GRB afterglows, we find that this X-ray variability seems to share similar statistical
correlations with X-ray flares in GRB afterglows. We further investigate several possible merger
product scenarios to see whether they can produce the observed X-ray variability in GRB 170817A.
The first scenario invokes a stable magnetar as the central engine producing the later X-ray variability
via differential rotation or fall-back accretion onto the NS. The second scenario invokes a black
hole as the central engine with a fall-back accretion process. The final scenario is a central engine
with a long-lived supra-massive NS. We find that the first two scenarios have difficulty producing
the later X-ray variability, which requires either an impractical NS magnetic field or an extraordinarily
large stellar envelope and an extremely long accretion timescale. However, the third scenario
seems to be consistent with observations, and the later X-ray variability can be produced by the
magnetosphere which is expelled following the collapse of the NS with a $B_p\in(3.6, 13.5)\times10^{13}$
