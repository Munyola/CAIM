We analyze vacuum tunneling in quantum field theory in a general formalism by using the Wigner representation.
In the standard instanton formalism, one usually approximates the initial false vacuum state by
an eigenstate of the field operator, imposes Dirichlet boundary conditions on the initial field
value, and evolves in imaginary time. This approach does not have an obvious physical interpretation.
However, an alternative approach does have a physical interpretation: in quantum field theory,
tunneling can happen via classical dynamics, seeded by initial quantum fluctuations in both the
field and its momentum conjugate, which was recently implemented in Ref. [1]. We show that the Wigner
representation is a useful framework to calculate and understand the relationship between these
two approaches. We find there are two, related, saddle point approximations for the path integral
of the tunneling process: one corresponds to the instanton solution in imaginary time and the other
one corresponds to classical dynamics from initial quantum fluctuations in real time. The classical
approximation for the dynamics of the latter process is justified only in a system with many degrees
of freedom, as can appear in field theory due to high occupancy of nucleated bubbles, while it is not
justified in single particle quantum mechanics, as we explain. We mention possible applications
of the real time formalism, including tunneling when the instanton vanishes, or when the imaginary
time contour deformation is not possible, which may occur in cosmological settings.
