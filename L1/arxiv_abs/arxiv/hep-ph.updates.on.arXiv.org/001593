We develop an effective field theory (EFT) framework to perform an analytic calculation for energy
correlator observables computed on groomed heavy-quark jets. A soft-drop grooming algorithm
is applied to a jet initiated by a massive quark to minimize soft contamination effects such as pile-up
and multi-parton interactions. We specifically consider the two-particle energy correlator
as an initial application of this EFT framework to compute heavy quark jet substructure. We find
that there are different regimes for the event shapes, depending on the size of the measured correlator
observable, that require the use of different EFT formulations, in which the quark mass and grooming
parameters may be relevant or not. We use the EFT to resum large logarithms in the energy correlator
observable in terms of the momentum of a reconstructed heavy hadron to NLL$'$ accuracy and subsequently
match it to a full QCD $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s)$ cross section, which we also compute. We compare
our predictions to simulations in PYTHIA for $e^+e^-$ collisions. We find a good agreement with
partonic simulations, as well as hadronic ones with an appropriate shape function used to describe
nonperturbative effects and the heavy quark hadron decay turned off. We also predict the scaling
behavior for the leading nonperturbative power correction due to hadronization. Consequently,
we can give a prediction for the energy correlator distribution at the level of the reconstructed
heavy hadron. This work provides a general framework for the analysis of heavy quark jet substructure
observables.
