The $f_{1}(1420)$ productions via pion and kaon induced reactions on a proton target are investigated
in an effective Lagrangian approach. Two treatments of the $t$-channel Born term, the Feynman model
and the Regge model, are introduced to calculate the total and differential cross sections of the
$\pi^{-}p\rightarrow f_{1}(1420)n$ and $K^{-}p\rightarrow f_{1}(1420)\Lambda $ reactions.
The numerical results indicate that the experimental data of the total cross section of the $\pi
^{-}p\rightarrow f_{1}(1420)n$ reaction can be reproduced in both the Feynman and the Regge models.
Based on the parameters determined in the pion induced reaction, the cross sections of the $K^{-}p\rightarrow
f_{1}(1420)\Lambda $ reaction, about which there is little data found in the literature, are predicted
in the same beam momentum range. It is found that the line shapes of the total cross section obtained
in a kaon induced reaction with two treatments are quite different. The cross sections for both reactions
are at an order of magnitude of $\mu$b, or larger, at a beam momenta up to 10 GeV/c. The differential
cross sections for both pion and kaon induced reactions are also present. It is found that in the Regge
model, the $t$ channel provides a sharp increase at extreme forward angles. The results suggest
that the experimental study of the $f_1(1420)$ in the kaon induced reaction on a proton target is
as promising as in the pion induced reaction. Such an experimental measurement is also very helpful
to clarify the production mechanism of the $f_1(1420)$.
