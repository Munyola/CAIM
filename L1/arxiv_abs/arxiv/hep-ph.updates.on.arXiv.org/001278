The asymmetry of baryon/antibaryon production has been measured in many proton-proton, pion-proton
and electron-proton experiments. In the framework of Quark-Gluon String Model (MQGS) the energy
dependence of asymmetry tells us about the value of $\alpha_{SJ}$(0), the intercept of String Junction
Regge trajectory. In previous MQGS study the value of intercept has been estimated as 0.5 < $\alpha_{SJ}$
< 0.9. Now, SJ behaviors are accumulated in the model based on topological symmetry in order to build
an object with zero baryon charge. The baryon junctions are easily combinable with antibaryon ones
in hexagons. Topologically, hexagon net can coherently cover only the torus surface. The net on
the torus has discrete number of baryon/antibaryon junctions. This single parameter reveals the
mass or energy of this object. It looks like DM particle, is not it? In high energy collisions this
pomeron loops are to be produced approximately in 1.2 percent of inelastic events. Furthermore,
the torus configurations of matter, which have been revealed in many bright events in space, for
an example, by Chandra experiment near the event horizon of Super Massive Black Hole, are such dense
"doughnuts" that X-rays from SMBH are screened on 40 percent's. QCD mass falling under BH event horizon
should be symmetric, or in other words, have no charge information. This topological symmetry model
seems rather realistic and can help us to deal with an "arm wrestling" between the stiffness of toroid
structure of QCD matter and the pressure of gravitational singularity at extremely heavy masses.
