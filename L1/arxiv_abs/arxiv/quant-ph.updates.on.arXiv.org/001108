What is the physical principle that singles out the quantum correlations for Bell and contextuality
scenarios? Here we show that, if we restrict our attention to correlations that, as is the case for
all correlations in classical and quantum physics, can be produced by measurements that: (i) yield
the same outcome when repeated, (ii) only disturb measurements that are not jointly measurable,
and (iii) all their coarse-grainings have realizations that satisfy (i) and (ii), then the question
has a surprising answer. The set of quantum correlations is singled out by the following principle:
There is no law governing the outcomes of the measurements; for any scenario made of these measurements,
every not inconsistent behavior does take place. "Inconsistent" behaviors are those that violate
a condition that holds for measurements satisfying (i)-(iii), namely, that the sum of the probabilities
of any set of pairwise exclusive events is bounded by one. Two events are exclusive if they correspond
to different outcomes of the same measurement. To prove the result, we begin by characterizing the
sets of not inconsistent probability assignments for each "graph of exclusivity," without referring
to any particular scenario, but treating all Bell and contextuality scenarios at once. The restrictions
of each scenario are introduced at the end of the proof and then we obtain the set of behaviors that
satisfies the above principle for each scenario. Each of these sets is equal to the corresponding
set in quantum theory.
