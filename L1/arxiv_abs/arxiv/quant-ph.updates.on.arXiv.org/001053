Following detailed analysis of data the domain of applicability of Non-Relativistic QED (NRQED)
with static nuclei is described for ground state energy of helium-like (and lithium-like) ions
for $Z \leq 20$. It is demonstrated that finite nuclear mass effects do not change 4-5 significant
digits (s.d.) and the leading relativistic and QED effects leave unchanged 3-4 s.d. for $Z \leq 20$
in ground state energy for both helium and lithium-like ions. It is shown that the non-relativistic
ground state energy can be easily interpolated in full physics range of nuclear charge $Z$ with accuracy
of not less than 6 decimal digits (d.d.) (or 7-8 s.d.) for $Z \leq 50$ for helium-like ions and for $Z
\leq 20$ for lithium-like ions using a meromorphic function in variable ${\lambda}=\sqrt{Z-{Z_B}}$
(here $Z_B$ is the 2nd critical charge \cite{TLO:2016}), which is well inside the domain of applicability
of non-relativistic QED. In turn, it is found a fourth degree polynomial in ${\lambda}$ which reproduces
the ground state energy of the helium-like and lithium-like ions for $Z \leq 20$ in the domain of applicability
of NRQED with static nuclei, thus, 3 s.d. It is noted that $\sim 99.9\%$ of the ground state energy
(and some expectation values) is given by the variational energy for properly optimized trial function
of the form of (anti)-symmetrized product of three (six) Coulomb orbitals for two-(three) electron
system with 3 (7) free parameters for $Z \leq 20$, respectively. It implies that these trial functions
are, in fact, the {\it exact} wavefunctions for non-relativistic QED.
