Noise is the central obstacle to building large-scale quantum computers. Quantum systems with
sufficiently uncorrelated and weak noise could be used to solve computational problems that are
intractable with current digital computers. There has been substantial progress towards engineering
such systems. However, continued progress depends on the ability to characterize quantum noise
reliably and efficiently with high precision. Here we introduce a protocol that completely and
efficiently characterizes the error rates of quantum noise and we experimentally implement it
on a 14-qubit superconducting quantum architecture. The method returns an estimate of the effective
noise with relative precision and detects all correlated errors. We show how to construct a quantum
noise correlation matrix allowing the easy visualization of all pairwise correlated errors, enabling
the discovery of long-range two-qubit correlations in the 14 qubit device that had not previously
been detected. These properties of the protocol make it exceptionally well suited for high-precision
noise metrology in quantum information processors. Our results are the first implementation of
a provably rigorous, full diagnostic protocol capable of being run on state of the art devices and
beyond. These results pave the way for noise metrology in next-generation quantum devices, calibration
in the presence of crosstalk, bespoke quantum error-correcting codes, and customized fault-tolerance
protocols that can greatly reduce the overhead in a quantum computation.
