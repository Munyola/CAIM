The behavior of classical monochromatic waves in stationary media is shown to be ruled by a frequency
dependent function, which we call Wave Potential, encoded in the structure of the Helmholtz equation.
Contrary to the common belief that the very concept of "ray trajectory" is reserved to the eikonal
approximation, a general and exact ray-based Hamiltonian treatment, reducing to the eikonal approximation
in the absence of Wave Potential, shows that its presence induces a mutual, perpendicular ray-coupling,
which is the one and only cause of any typically wave-like phenomenon, such as diffraction and interference.
Recalling, then, that the time-independent Schroedinger and Klein-Gordon equations (associating
mono-energetic particles with stationary matter waves) are themselves Helmholtz-like equations,
the exact, ray-based treatment developed in the classical case may be extended - without resorting
to statistical concepts - to the exact, trajectory-based Hamiltonian dynamics of mono-energetic
point-like particles. The trajectories turn out to be mutually coupled, once more, by an exact,
energy-dependent Wave Potential, coinciding in the form, but not in the physical meaning, with
the statistical, energy-independent "Quantum Potential" of Bohm's theory (where particles are
represented by means of wave-packets, moving along probability flux lines). These results, together
with the connections shown to exist between Wave Potential and Uncertainty Principle, suggest
a novel, classical-looking, non-probabilistic interpretation of Wave Mechanics.
