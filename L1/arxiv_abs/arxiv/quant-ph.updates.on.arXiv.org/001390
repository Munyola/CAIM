We investigate the estimation technique called quantum state smoothing introduced by Guevara
and Wiseman [Phys.~Rev.~Lett.~{\bf 115}, 180407 (2015)], which offers a valid quantum state estimate
for a partially monitored system, conditioned on the observed record both prior and posterior to
an estimation time. Partial monitoring by an observer implies that there may exist records unobserved
by that observer. It was shown that, given only the observed record, the observer can better estimate
the underlying true quantum states, by inferring the unobserved record and using quantum state
smoothing, rather than the usual quantum filtering approach. However, the improvement in estimation
fidelity, originally examined for a resonantly driven qubit coupled to two vacuum baths, was also
shown to vary depending on the types of detection used for the qubit's fluorescence. In this work,
we analyse this variation in a systematic way for the first time. We first define smoothing power
using an average purity recovery and a relative average purity recovery, of smoothing over filtering.
Then, we explore the power for various combinations of fluorescence detection for both observed
and unobserved channels. We next propose a method to explain the variation of the smoothing power,
based on multi-time correlation strength between fluorescence detection records. The method
gives a prediction of smoothing power for different combinations, which is remarkably successful
in comparison with numerically simulated qubit trajectories.
