The glued-trees problem is the only example known to date for which quantum annealing provides an
exponential speedup, albeit by partly using excited state evolution, in an oracular setting. How
robust is this speedup to noise on the oracle? To answer this, we construct phenomenological short-range
and long-range noise models, and noise models that break or preserve the reflection symmetry of
the spectrum. We show that under the long-range noise models an exponential quantum speedup is retained.
However, we argue that a classical algorithm with an equivalent long-range noise model also exhibits
an exponential speedup over the noiseless model. In the quantum setting the long-range noise is
able to lift the spectral gap of the problem so that the evolution changes from diabatic to adiabatic.
In the classical setting, long-range noise creates a significant probability of the walker landing
directly on the EXIT vertex. Under short-range noise the exponential speedup is lost, but a polynomial
quantum speedup is retained for sufficiently weak noise. In contrast to noise range, we find that
breaking of spectral symmetry by the noise has no significant impact on the performance of the noisy
algorithms. Our results about the long-range models highlight that care must be taken in selecting
phenomenological noise models so as not to change the nature of the computational problem. We conclude
from the short-range noise model results that the exponential speedup in the glued-trees problem
is not robust to noise, but a polynomial quantum speedup is still possible.
