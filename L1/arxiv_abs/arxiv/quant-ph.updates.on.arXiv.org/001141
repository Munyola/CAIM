We construct a three-dimensional quantum cellular automaton (QCA), an automorphism of the local
operator algebra on a lattice of qubits, which disentangles the ground state of the Walker-Wang
three fermion model. We show that if this QCA can be realized by a quantum circuit of constant depth,
then there exists a two-dimensional commuting projector Hamiltonian which realizes the three
fermion topological order which is widely believed not to be possible. We conjecture in accordance
with this belief that this QCA is not a quantum circuit of constant depth, and we provide two further
pieces of evidence to support the conjecture. We show that this QCA maps every local Pauli operator
to a local Pauli operator, but is not a Clifford circuit of constant depth. Further, we show that if
the three-dimensional QCA can be realized by a quantum circuit of constant depth, then there exists
a two-dimensional QCA acting on fermionic degrees of freedom which cannot be realized by a quantum
circuit of constant depth; i.e., we prove the existence of a nontrivial QCA in either three or two
dimensions. The square of our three-dimensional QCA can be realized by a quantum circuit of constant
depth, and this suggests the existence of a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant of a QCA in higher dimensions,
totally distinct from the classification by positive rationals (i.e., by one integer index for
each prime) in one dimension. In an appendix, unrelated to the main body of this paper, we give a fermionic
generalization of a result of Bravyi and Vyalyi on ground states of 2-local commuting Hamiltonians.
