The Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) is an NP-optimization problem (NPO) that has been
of great interest for decades for both, science and industry. The CVRP is a variant of the vehicle
routing problem characterized by capacity constrained vehicles. The aim is to plan tours for vehicles
to supply a given number of customers as efficiently as possible. The problem is the combinatorial
explosion of possible solutions, which increases superexponentially with the number of customers.
Classical solutions provide good approximations to the globally optimal solution. D-Wave's quantum
annealer is a machine designed to solve optimization problems. This machine uses quantum effects
to speed up computation time compared to classic computers. The problem on solving the CVRP on the
quantum annealer is the particular formulation of the optimization problem. For this, it has to
be mapped onto a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problem. Complex optimization
problems such as the CVRP can be translated to smaller subproblems and thus enable a sequential solution
of the partitioned problem. This work presents a quantum-classic hybrid solution method for the
CVRP. It clarifies whether the implemenation of such a method pays off in comparison to existing
classical solution methods regarding computation time and solution quality. Several approaches
to solving the CVRP are elaborated, the arising problems are discussed, and the results are evaluated
in terms of solution quality and computation time.
