Recent work has explored using the stabilizer formalism to classically simulate quantum circuits
containing a few non-Clifford gates. The computational cost of such methods is directly related
to the notion of stabilizer rank, which for a pure state $\psi$ is defined to be the smallest integer
$\chi$ such that $\psi$ is a superposition of $\chi$ stabilizer states. Here we develop a comprehensive
mathematical theory of the stabilizer rank and the related approximate stabilizer rank. We also
present a suite of classical simulation algorithms with broader applicability and significantly
improved performance over the previous state-of-the-art. A new feature is the capability to simulate
circuits composed of Clifford gates and arbitrary diagonal gates, extending the reach of a previous
algorithm specialized to the Clifford+T gate set. We implemented the new simulation methods and
used them to simulate quantum algorithms with 40-50 qubits and over 60 non-Clifford gates, without
resorting to high-performance computers. We report a simulation of the Quantum Approximate Optimization
Algorithm in which we process superpositions of $\chi\sim10^6$ stabilizer states and sample from
the full n-bit output distribution, improving on previous simulations which used $\sim 10^3$ stabilizer
states and sampled only from single-qubit marginals. We also simulated instances of the Hidden
Shift algorithm with circuits including up to 64 T gates or 16 CCZ gates; these simulations showcase
the performance gains available by optimizing the decomposition of a circuit's non-Clifford components.
