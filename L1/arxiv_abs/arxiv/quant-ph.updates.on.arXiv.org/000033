The detection of electron spins associated with single defects in solids is a critical operation
for a range of quantum information and measurement applications currently under development.
To date, it has only been accomplished for two centres in crystalline solids: phosphorus in silicon
using electrical readout based on a single electron transistor (SET) and nitrogen-vacancy centres
in diamond using optical readout. A spin readout fidelity of about 90% has been demonstrated with
both electrical readout and optical readout, however, the thermal limitations of the electrical
readout and the poor photon collection efficiency of the optical readout hinder achieving the high
fidelity required for quantum information applications. Here we demonstrate a hybrid approach
using optical excitation to change the charge state of the defect centre in a silicon-based SET,
conditional on its spin state, and then detecting this change electrically. The optical frequency
addressing in high spectral resolution conquers the thermal broadening limitation of the previous
electrical readout and charge sensing avoids the difficulties of efficient photon collection.
This is done with erbium in silicon and has the potential to enable new architectures for quantum
information processing devices and to dramatically increase the range of defect centres that can
be exploited. Further, the efficient electrical detection of the optical excitation of single
sites in silicon is a major step in developing an interconnect between silicon and optical based
quantum computing technologies.
