Fault tolerant quantum computers will require efficient co-processors for real-time decoding
of their adopted quantum error correction protocols. In this work we examine the possibility of
using specialised Ising model hardware to perform this decoding task. Examples of Ising model hardware
include quantum annealers such as those produced by D-Wave Systems Inc., as well as classical devices
such as those produced by Hitatchi and Fujitsu and optical devices known as coherent Ising machines.
We use the coherent parity check (CPC) framework to derive an Ising model mapping of the quantum error
correction decoding problem for an uncorrelated quantum error model. A specific advantage of our
Ising model mapping is that it is compatible with maximum entropy inference techniques which can
outperform maximum likelihood decoding in some circumstances. We use numerical calculations
within our framework to demonstrate that maximum entropy decoding can not only lead to improved
error suppression, but can also shift threshold values for simple codes. As a high value problem
for which a small advantage can lead to major gains, we argue that decoding quantum codes is an ideal
use case for quantum annealers. In addition, the structure of quantum error correction codes allows
application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) annealing hardware to reduce embedding costs,
a major bottleneck in quantum annealing. Finally, we also propose a way in which a quantum annealer
could be optimally used as part of a hybrid quantum-classical decoding scheme.
