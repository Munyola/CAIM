In-vacuo cryogenic environments are ideal for applications requiring both low temperatures and
extremely low particle densities. This enables reaching long storage and coherence times for example
in ion traps, essential requirements for experiments with highly charged ions, quantum computation,
and optical clocks. We have developed a novel cryostat continuously refrigerated with a pulse-tube
cryocooler and providing the lowest vibration level reported for such a closed-cycle system with
1 W cooling power for a <5 K experiment. A decoupling system suppresses vibrations from the cryocooler
by three orders of magnitude down to a level of 10 nm peak amplitudes in the horizontal plane. Heat
loads of about 40 W (at 45 K) and 1 W (at 4 K) are transferred from an experimental chamber, mounted on
an optical table, to the cryocooler through a vacuum-insulated massive 120 kg inertial copper pendulum.
The 1.4 m long pendulum allows installation of the cryocooler in a separate, acoustically isolated
machine room. In the laser laboratory, we measured the residual vibrations using an interferometric
setup. The positioning of the 4 K elements is reproduced to better than a few micrometer after a full
thermal cycle to room temperature. Extreme high vacuum on the $10^{-15}$ mbar level is achieved.
In collaboration with the Max-Planck-Intitut f\"ur Kernphysik (MPIK), such a setup is now in operation
at the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB) for a next-generation optical clock experiment
using highly charged ions.
