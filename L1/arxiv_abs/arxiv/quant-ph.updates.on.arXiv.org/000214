Photonic devices involving many optical modes promise major advances in quantum technologies,
with applications ranging from quantum metrology over quantum computing to quantum simulations.
A significant current roadblock for the development of such devices, however, is the lack of practical
reliable certification tools. Here, we present one such tool. We start by carefully defining different
notions of quantum-state certification tests. Then, we introduce an experimentally friendly,
yet mathematically rigorous, certification test for experimental preparations of arbitrary
m-mode pure Gaussian states as well as a class of pure non-Gaussian states common in linear-optical
experiments, including those given by a Gaussian unitary acting on Fock basis states with n bosons.
The protocol is efficient for all Gaussian states and all mentioned non-Gaussian states with constant
n. We follow the formal mindset of an untrusted prover, who prepares the state, and a skeptic certifier,
equipped only with classical computing and single-mode measurement capabilities. No assumptions
are made on the type of quantum noise or experimental capabilities of the prover. We build upon an
extremality property that leads to a practical fidelity lower bound, interesting in its own right.
Experimentally, our technique relies on single-mode homodyne detection. With this method, the
efficient and reliable certification of large-scale photonic networks, with a constant number
of input photons, as those used for photonic quantum simulations, boson samplers, and quantum metrology
is within reach.
