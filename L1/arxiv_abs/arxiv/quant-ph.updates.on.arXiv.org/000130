We address the characterization of classical random fields via quantum probes. In particular,
we focus on estimation and discrimination problems involving the fractal dimension of the trajectories
of a system subject to fractional Brownian noise. We assume that the classical degree of freedom
exposed to the environmental noise is coupled to a quantum degree of freedom of the same system, e.g.
its spin, and exploit quantum limited measurements on the spin part to characterize the classical
fractional noise. In order to assess the performances of quantum probes we evaluate the Bures metric,
as well as the Helstrom and the Chernoff bound, and optimize their values over the interaction time.
We find that quantum probes may be generally employed to obtain a reliable characterization of fractional
Gaussian process when the coupling with the environment is weak, such that decoherence is not much
detrimental and for long interaction times the probe acquires information about the environmental
parameters without being too much mixed, or strong, when information is quickly impinged on the
quantum probe and can effectively retrieved by measurements performed in the early stage of the
evolution. In the intermediate situation, none of the two above effects take place: information
is flowing from the environment to the probe too slowly compared to decoherence, and no measurements
can be effectively employed to extract it from the quantum probe. The two regimes of weak and strong
coupling are defined in terms of a threshold value of the coupling, which itself increases with the
fractional dimension.
