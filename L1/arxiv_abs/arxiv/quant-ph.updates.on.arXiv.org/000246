How to define a proper relativistic spin operator, as a long-standing problem, has by now become
a central task for providing proper concepts and applications of spin in relativistic and non-relativistic
quantum mechanics as well as solving emergent inconsistencies in rapidly developing research
areas. We rigorously {\it derive} a relativistic spin operator for an arbitrary spin massive particle
on the two requirements that a proper spin operator should satisfy (i) the $\mathfrak{su}(2)$ algebra
and (ii) the Lorentz-transformation properties as a second-rank spin tensor. These requirements
lead to two spin operators, properly giving the second Casimir invariant operator in the Poincar\'e
(inhomogeneous Lorentz) group, that provide the two inequivalent representations of Poincar\'e
group. We find that the two inequivalent representations are the left-handed and the right-handed
representations. Each of the two spin operators generates a Wigner little group whose representation
space is composed of spin-$s$ spin states. In the case that the Poincar\'e group is extended by parity,
only nonchiral $(s,s)$ representations and direct-sum $(s,s') \oplus (s',s)$ representations
are allowed. In the $(1/2,0)\oplus (0,1/2)$ representation, we redrive the covariant Dirac equation
by using the covariant parity operator defined by the two spin operators. This derivation deepens
our understanding how the Dirac equation describes the spin-$1/2$ massive relativistic particle
successfully. We have also discussed some important properties of our relativistic spin operators
with arbitrary spin.
