Engineering multiphoton states is an outstanding challenge with applications in multiple fields,
such as quan- tum metrology, quantum lithography or even biological systems. State-of-the-art
methods to obtain them rely on post-selection, multi-level systems or Rydberg atomic ensembles.
Recently, it was shown that a strongly driven two-level system interacting with a detuned cavity
mode can be engineered to continuously emit n-photon states. In the present work, we show that spectral
filtering of its emission relaxes considerably the requirements on the system parameters even
to the more accessible bad-cavity situation, opening up the possibility of implementing this protocol
in a much wider landscape of different platforms. This improvement is based on a key observation:
in the imperfect case where only a certain fraction of emission is composed of n-photon states, these
have a well defined energy separated from the rest of the signal, which allows to reveal and purify
multiphoton emission just by frequency filtering. We demonstrate these results by obtaining analytical
expressions for relevant figures of merit of multiphoton emission, such as the n-photon coupling
rate between cavity and emitter, the fraction of light emitted as n-photon states, and n-photon
emission rates. This allows us to make a systematic study of such figures of merit as a function of
the system parameters and demonstrate the viability of the protocol in several relevant types of
cavity QED setups, where we take into account the impact of their respective experimental limitations.
