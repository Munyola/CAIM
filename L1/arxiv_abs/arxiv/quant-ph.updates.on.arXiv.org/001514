The laws of physics place many restrictions on the operations that we can perform. Many of these restrictions
require some ``resource'' as a cost to realize the desired operation. For example, the Wigner-Araki-Yanase
theorem, a remarkable theorem on quantum measurement, can be understood as an argument that to measure
the spontaneous value of time-varying physical quantities accurately, large amount of energy
fluctuations is required as a resource. Determining the amount of resource required to implement
the desired operation is crucial in physics. One of the most important issues in this class of problems
is what and how much resources are required to implement unitary dynamics under conservation laws.
This problem is a long standing open problem initially proposed by Ozawa approximately two decades
ago, with the motivation to clarify the limits imposed by conservation laws on quantum computation.
In this article, we provide a complete solution to this open problem. We derive an asymptotically
exact equality that clarifies the necessary and sufficient amount of quantum coherence cost to
implement arbitrary unitary dynamics within the desired error. According to the equality, the
asymptotic form of coherence cost is expressed with only two quantities: one is the implementation
error, and the other is the degree of violation of conservation law in the desired unitary. Furthermore,
we discuss the underlying physics in several physical situations from the viewpoint of coherence
cost based on the present theory.
