We define the idea of {\it real path quantum theory}, a realist generalisation of quantum theory
in which it is postulated that the configuration space path actually followed by a closed quantum
system is probabilistically chosen. This is done a postulate defining probabilities for paths,
which we propose are determined by an expression involving path amplitudes and a distance function
that quantifies path separation. We suggest a possible form for a path probability postulate and
explore possible choices of distance function, including choices suitable for Lorentz or generally
covariant versions of real path quantum theory. We set out toy models of quantum interferometry
and show that in these models the probability postulate and specific distance functions do indeed
give a physically sensible path ontology. These functions can be chosen so as to predict quantum
interference for interference of microscopic quantum systems and the failure of interference
for macroscopic quantum systems. More generally, they predict interference when the beams are
close, and its failure when they are far apart, as determined by the distance function. If taken seriously
in its present relatively unconstrained form, real path quantum theory thus motivates experimental
tests of quantum interference in all unexplored regimes defined by potentially physically interesting
parameters, including the mass of the beam object, the beam separation distance, the beam separation
time, and many others. We discuss open questions raised by these ideas.
