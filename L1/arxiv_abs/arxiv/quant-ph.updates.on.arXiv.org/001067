In the present work, we give a phenomenological theory of the monolayer graphene where two worlds
quantum and classical meet together and complete each other in the most natural way. It appears that
the graphene is the unique material where this complementarity could be explained in an effective
way due to its exceptional band structure properties. We introduce the electron mass-vortex representation
and we define surface tension excitation states in the monolayer graphene. By abstracting from
the usual band energy dispersion we calculate the band mass of the electrons at the Dirac point by
introducing the mathematical mass-dispersion relation. As a result, we obtain the Dirac energy
dispersion in monolayer graphene from the classical Newton law. Within the semiclassical theory,
we show the presence of the surface spin tension vectorial field which, possibly, closely relates
the surface tension and spin tension states on the helical surface. We calculate the surface tension
related with the electron band mass-vortex formation at the Dirac's point and we predict accurately
the surface tension value related to the excitonic binding at the Dirac point as being formed from
the electron and hole band mass-vortices. Moreover, we give the solution to a long-standing problem
in the spin group theory and we construct an example which shows, phenomenologically, that the manifolds
on $\rm S^{(6)}$ are not integrable. The principal reason for this is attributed to the irreducibility
of the spinorial group $\rm Spin(6)^{\rm R}$ at the Dirac's point, due to the band mass formation
via gravitational field.
