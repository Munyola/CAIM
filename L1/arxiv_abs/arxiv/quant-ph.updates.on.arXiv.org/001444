At its core a $t$-design is a method for sampling from a set of unitaries in a way which mimics sampling
randomly from the Haar measure on the unitary group, with applications across quantum information
processing and physics. We construct new families of quantum circuits on $n$-qubits giving rise
to $\varepsilon$-approximate unitary $t$-designs efficiently in $O(n^3t^2)$ depth. These quantum
circuits are based on a relaxation of technical requirements in previous constructions. In particular,
the construction of circuits which give efficient approximate $t$-designs by Brandao, Harrow,
and Horodecki (F.G.S.L Brandao, A.W Harrow, and M. Horodecki, Commun. Math. Phys. (2016).) required
choosing gates from ensembles which contained inverses for all elements, and that the entries of
the unitaries are algebraic. We reduce these requirements, to sets that contain elements without
inverses in the set, and non-algebraic entries, which we dub partially invertible universal sets.
We then adapt this circuit construction to the framework of measurement based quantum computation(MBQC)
and give new explicit examples of $n$-qubit graph states with fixed assignments of measurements
(graph gadgets) giving rise to unitary $t$-designs based on partially invertible universal sets,
in a natural way. We further show that these graph gadgets demonstrate a quantum speedup, up to standard
complexity theoretic conjectures. We provide numerical and analytical evidence that almost any
assignment of fixed measurement angles on an $n$-qubit cluster state give efficient $t$-designs
and demonstrate a quantum speedup.
