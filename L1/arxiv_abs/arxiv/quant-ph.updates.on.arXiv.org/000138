The equilibrium properties of a single quantum particle (qp) interacting with a classical gas for
a wide range of temperatures that explore the system's behavior in the classical as well as in the
quantum regime is investigated. Both the quantum particle and atoms are restricted to the sites
of a one-dimensional lattice. A path-integral formalism is developed within the context of the
canonical ensemble in which the quantum particle is represented by a closed, variable-step random
walk on the lattice. Monte Carlo methods are employed to determine the system's properties. For
the case of a free particle, analytical expressions for the energy, its fluctuations, and the qp-qp
correlation function are derived and compared with the Monte Carlo simulations. To test the usefulness
of the path integral formalism, the Metropolis algorithm is employed to determine the equilibrium
properties of the qp for a periodic interaction potential, forcing the qp to occupy extended states.
We consider a striped potential in one dimension, where every other lattice site is occupied by an
atom with potential $\epsilon$, and every other lattice site is empty. This potential serves as
a stress test for the path integral formalism because of its rapid site-to-site variation. An analytical
solution was determined in this case by utilizing Bloch's theorem due to the periodicity of the potential.
Comparisons of the potential energy, the total energy, the energy fluctuations and the correlation
function are made between the results of the Monte Carlo simulations and the analytical calculations.
