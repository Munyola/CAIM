The seminal idea of quantum money due to Stephen Wiesner, the money not forgeable due to laws of Quantum
Mechanics, has laid foundations for the Quantum Information Theory in early '70s. As quantum technology
develops, in parallel to crypto-currencies entering market, various other schemes for quantum
currencies are being proposed nowadays. The schemes put forward so far relay on assumption that
the mint does not cooperate with the counterfeiter who may use malicious terminal for verification.
Here we introduce a semi-device independent scheme for money partially relaxing this assumption.
We prove that it is protected against forgery under qubit by qubit copying in case when the banknote
is verified at the Bank by untrusted terminal. In case of verification by classical communication,
protection against a forgery cheating independently on each qubit is also provided. The scheme
bases on the preamble of semi-device independent protocol of Paw\l{}owski nad Brunner [Phys. Rev.
A 84, 010302 (2011)] with more restrictive condition for acceptance. This is in correspondence
with more complex proof of security originating from a two-party cryptographic nature of the money
schemes. The lower bound on the size of the banknote is ruled only by the law of large numbers as the
secure key is not physically generated during the protocol. Due to the current burst out of the new
quantum-crypto currencies, on the basis of the presented protocol we finally introduce and discuss
possible quantum analogue of the Oresme-Copernicus-Gresham's law of economy.
