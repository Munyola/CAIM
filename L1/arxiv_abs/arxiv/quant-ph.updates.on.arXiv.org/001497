We develop a method for computing the evolution of a Klein-Gordon field in a globally hyperbolic
spacetime. The method is both of general applicability and particularly useful in certain problems
of interest, such as the study of confined quantum fields under small perturbations. Instead of
solving the Klein-Gordon equation, we define and formally compute Bogoliubov transformations
between spacelike hypersurfaces at different times, which contain themselves the evolution of
the field. The method can be applied to classical and quantum fields, both real and complex, although
for the most interesting case of quantum fields some discussion on the physical interpretation
and unitarily equivalence of quantizations at different regions is required, which we approach
on the ground of physical arguments. In the case of fields confined inside cavities, the method allows
to easily make quantitative precise predictions on their behaviour under small perturbations
of the background geometry and/or the boundary conditions. Therefore, the method provides a crucial
tool in the recently growing research area of confined quantum fields in table-top experiments.
We also prove its utility in addressing other problems, such as particle creation in a cosmological
expansion, thus giving an example of its more general applicability. This article is the first of
two articles introducing the method, dedicated to the particular case of spacetimes with static
boundaries. A second article will handle the more general case of moving boundaries.
