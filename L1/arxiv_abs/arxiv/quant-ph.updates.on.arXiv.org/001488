Geometric phase is insensitive to certain local disturbances due to the global properties accumulated
through a closed loop in the parameter space. It can be utilized to realize high-fidelity logic gates
for geometric quantum computing. Moveover in the degenerate subspace, non-Abelian geometric
phase leads to quantum holonomic gates. In this work, we propose a novel scheme for holonomic gates
using Rydberg atoms under the detuning-controllable drivings, which can be considerably improved
by the counterdiabatic method. In particular, we introduce a controllable variable, the detuning
between the driving frequency and the atomic energy spacing, to modify the traditional scheme for
holonomic gates. Subsequently we can have two instantaneous eigenstates with opposite eigenvalues
constituting a closed loop in the parameter space. The accumulated dynamical phase is exactly cancelled
when the loop is completed, which is out of the parallel-transport restriction. The counterdiabatic
term in our proposal can be used to enhance the speed and the fidelity of holonomic transformation,
rendering revisions in both amplitudes and phases of the driving fields. Then in a shorter time we
can realize a universal set of single-qubit gates and nontrivial double-qubit gates within the
Rydberg blockade regime. We also estimate the gate fidelity under both dephasing and dissipation
processes. In addition, beyond the Rydberg blockade regime, we propose an alternative realization
for the double-qubit gates, in which a qubit (two-level system) is used to mediate two detuning-driven
three-level Rydberg atoms.
