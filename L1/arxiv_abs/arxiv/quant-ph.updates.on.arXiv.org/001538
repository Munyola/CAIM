Single nuclear spins in the solid state have long been envisaged as a platform for quantum computing,
due to their long coherence times and excellent controllability. Measurements can be performed
via localised electrons, for example those in single atom dopants or crystal defects. However,
establishing long-range interactions between multiple dopants or defects is challenging. Conversely,
in lithographically-defined quantum dots, tuneable interdot electron tunnelling allows direct
coupling of electron spin-based qubits in neighbouring dots. Moreover, compatibility with semiconductor
fabrication techniques provides a compelling route to scaling to large numbers of qubits. Unfortunately,
hyperfine interactions are typically too weak to address single nuclei. Here we show that for electrons
in silicon metal-oxide-semiconductor quantum dots the hyperfine interaction is sufficient to
initialise, read-out and control single silicon-29 nuclear spins, yielding a combination of the
long coherence times of nuclear spins with the flexibility and scalability of quantum dot systems.
We demonstrate high-fidelity projective readout and control of the nuclear spin qubit, as well
as entanglement between the nuclear and electron spins. Crucially, we find that both the nuclear
spin and electron spin retain their coherence while moving the electron between quantum dots, paving
the way to long range nuclear-nuclear entanglement via electron shuttling. Our results establish
nuclear spins in quantum dots as a powerful new resource for quantum processing.
