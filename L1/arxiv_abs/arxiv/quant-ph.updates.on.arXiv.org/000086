The realization of a quantum interface between a propagating photon used for transmission of quantum
information, and a stationary qubit used for storage and manipulation, has long been an outstanding
goal in quantum information science. A method for implementing such an interface between dissimilar
qubits is quantum teleportation, which has attracted considerable interest not only as a versatile
quantum-state-transfer method but also as a quantum computational primitive. Here, we experimentally
demonstrate transfer of quantum information carried by a photonic qubit to a quantum dot spin qubit
using quantum teleportation. In our experiment, a single photon in a superposition state of two
colors -- a photonic qubit is generated using selective resonant excitation of a neutral quantum
dot. We achieve an unprecedented degree of indistinguishability of single photons from different
quantum dots by using local electric and magnetic field control. To teleport a photonic qubit, we
generate an entangled spin-photon state in a second quantum dot located 5 meters away from the first
and interfere the photons from the two dots in a Hong-Ou-Mandel set-up. A coincidence detection
at the output of the interferometer heralds successful teleportation, which we verify by measuring
the resulting spin state after its coherence time is prolonged by an optical spin-echo pulse sequence.
The demonstration of successful inter-conversion of photonic and semiconductor spin qubits constitute
a major step towards the realization of on-chip quantum networks based on semiconductor nano-structures.
