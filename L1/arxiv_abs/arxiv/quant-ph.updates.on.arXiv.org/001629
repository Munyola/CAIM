When a quantum system is distributed to spatially separated parties, it is natural to consider how
the system evolves when the parties perform local quantum operations with classical communication
(LOCC). However, the structure of LOCC channels is exceedingly complex leaving many important
physical problems unsolved. In this paper we consider generalized resource theories of entanglement
based on different relaxations to the class of LOCC. The behavior of various entanglement measures
is studied under non-entangling channels, as well as the newly introduced classes of dually non-entangling
and PPT-preserving channels. In an effort to better understand the nature of LOCC bound entanglement,
we study the problem of entanglement distillation in these generalized resource theories. We first
show that unlike LOCC, general non-entangling maps can be superactivated, in the sense that two
copies of the same non-entangling map can nevertheless be entangling. On the single-copy level,
we demonstrate that every NPT entangled state can be converted into an LOCC-distillable state using
channels that are both dually non-entangling and having a PPT Choi representation and that every
state can be converted into an LOCC-distillable state using operations belonging to any family
of polytopes that approximate LOCC. We then turn to the stochastic convertibility of multipartite
pure states and show that any two states can be interconverted by any polytope approximation to the
set of separable channels. Finally, as an analog to $k$-positive maps, we introduce and analyze
the set of $k$-non-entangling channels.
