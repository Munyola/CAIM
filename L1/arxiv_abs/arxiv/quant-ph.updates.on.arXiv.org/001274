WavePacket is an open-source program package for numerical simulations in quantum dynamics. Building
on the previous Part I [Comp. Phys. Comm. 213, 223-234 (2017)] and Part II [Comp. Phys. Comm. 228,
229-244 (2018)] which dealt with quantum dynamics of closed and open systems, respectively, the
present Part III adds fully classical and mixed quantum-classical propagations to WavePacket.
In those simulations classical phase-space densities are sampled by trajectories which follow
(diabatic or adiabatic) potential energy surfaces. In the vicinity of (genuine or avoided) intersections
of those surfaces trajectories may switch between surfaces. To model these transitions, two classes
of stochastic algorithms have been implemented: (1) J. C. Tully's fewest switches surface hopping
and (2) Landau-Zener based single switch surface hopping. The latter one offers the advantage of
being based on adiabatic energy gaps only, thus not requiring non-adiabatic coupling information
any more. The present work describes the MATLAB version of WavePacket 6.0 which is essentially an
object-oriented rewrite of previous versions, allowing to perform fully classical, quantum--classical
and quantum-mechanical simulations on an equal footing, i.~e., for the same physical system described
by the same WavePacket input. The software package is hosted and further developed at the Sourceforge
platform, where also extensive Wiki-documentation as well as numerous worked-out demonstration
examples with animated graphics are available.
