Much of the richness in nature emerges because the same simple constituents can form an endless variety
of ordered states. While many such states are fully characterized by their symmetries, interacting
quantum systems can also exhibit topological order, which is instead characterized by intricate
patterns of entanglement. A paradigmatic example of such topological order is the Laughlin state,
which minimizes the interaction energy of charged particles in a magnetic field and underlies the
fractional quantum Hall effect. Broad efforts have arisen to enhance our understanding of these
orders by forming Laughlin states in synthetic quantum systems, such as those composed of ultracold
atoms or photons. In spite of these efforts, electron gases remain essentially the only physical
system in which topological order has appeared. Here, we present the first observation of optical
photon pairs in the Laughlin state. These pairs emerge from a photonic analog of a fractional quantum
Hall system, which combines strong, Rydberg-mediated interactions between photons and synthetic
magnetic fields for light, induced by twisting an optical resonator. Photons entering this system
undergo collisions to form pairs in an angular momentum superposition consistent with the Laughlin
state. Characterizing the same pairs in real space reveals that the photons avoid each other, a hallmark
of the Laughlin state. This work heralds a new era of quantum many-body optics, where strongly interacting
and topological photons enable exploration of quantum matter with wholly new properties and unique
probes.
