Qubit measurements are central to quantum information processing. In the field of superconducting
qubits, standard readout techniques are not only limited by the signal-to-noise ratio, but also
by state relaxation during the measurement. In this work, we demonstrate that the limitation due
to relaxation can be suppressed by using the many-level Hilbert space of superconducting circuits:
in a multilevel encoding, the measurement is only corrupted when multiple errors occur. Employing
this technique, we show that we can directly resolve transmon gate errors at the level of one part
in $10^3.$ Extending this idea, we apply the same principles to the measurement of a logical qubit
encoded in a bosonic mode and detected with a transmon ancilla, implementing a proposal by Hann et
al. [Phys. Rev. A \textbf{98} 022305 (2018)]. Qubit state assignments are made based on a sequence
of repeated readouts, further reducing the overall infidelity. This approach is quite general
and several encodings are studied; the codewords are more distinguishable when the distance between
them is increased with respect to photon loss. The tradeoff between multiple readouts and state
relaxation is explored and shown to be consistent with the photon-loss model. We report a logical
assignment infidelity of $5.8\times 10^{-5}$ for a Fock-based encoding and $4.2\times 10^{-3}$
for a QEC code (the $S=2,N=1$ binomial code). Our results will not only improve the fidelity of quantum
information applications, but also enable more precise characterization of process or gate errors.
