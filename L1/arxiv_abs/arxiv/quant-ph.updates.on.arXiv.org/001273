We consider quantum quenches in the integrable $SU(3)$-invariant spin chain (Lai-Sutherland
model) which admits a Bethe ansatz description in terms of two different quasiparticle species,
providing a prototypical example of a model solvable by nested Bethe ansatz. We identify infinite
families of integrable initial states for which analytic results can be obtained. We show that they
include special families of two-site product states which can be related to integrable ``soliton
non-preserving'' boundary conditions in an appropriate rotated channel. We present a complete
analytical result for the quasiparticle rapidity distribution functions corresponding to the
stationary state reached at large times after the quench from the integrable initial states. Our
results are obtained within a Quantum Transfer Matrix (QTM) approach, which does not rely on the
knowledge of the quasilocal conservation laws or of the overlaps between the initial states and
the eigenstates of the Hamiltonian. Furthermore, based on an analogy with previous works, we conjecture
analytic expressions for such overlaps: this allows us to employ the Quench Action method to derive
a set of integral equations characterizing the quasi-particle distribution functions of the post-quench
steady state. We verify that the solution to the latter coincides with our analytic result found
using the QTM approach. Finally, we present a direct physical application of our results by providing
predictions for the propagation of entanglement after the quench from such integrable states.
