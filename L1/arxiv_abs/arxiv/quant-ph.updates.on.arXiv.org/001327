We consider identical quantum bosons with weak contact interactions in a two-dimensional isotropic
harmonic trap. When the interactions are turned off, the energy levels are equidistant and highly
degenerate. At linear order in the coupling parameter, these degenerate levels split, and we study
the patterns of this splitting. It turns out that the problem is mathematically identical to diagonalizing
the quantum resonant system of the two-dimensional Gross-Pitaevskii equation, whose classical
counterpart has been previously studied in the mathematical literature on turbulence. Enhanced
symmetry structures are known for this resonant system, and our purpose is to report on powerful
implications these symmetries have for the level splitting in the quantum case. In particular,
the symmetries relate energy shifts of different unperturbed levels so that infinitely many exactly
integer energy differences survive at linear order in the interaction strength. The highest energy
state emanating from each unperturbed level is explicitly described by our analytics. Considerable
simplifications in computing the spectrum numerically result from exploiting the symmetries.
We furthermore discuss the energy level spacing distributions in the spirit of quantum chaos theory.
After separating the eigenvalues into blocks with respect to the known conservation laws, we observe
the Wigner-Dyson statistics within such individual blocks, which suggests that no integrable
structures beyond the symmetries we display should be expected in the problem.
