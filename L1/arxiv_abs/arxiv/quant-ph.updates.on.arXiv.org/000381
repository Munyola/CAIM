Single-photon sources based on optical parametric processes have been used extensively for quantum
information applications due to their flexibility, room-temperature operation and potential
for photonic integration. However, the intrinsically probabilistic nature of these sources is
a major limitation for realizing large-scale quantum networks. Active feedforward switching
of photons from multiple probabilistic sources is a promising approach that can be used to build
a deterministic source. However, previous implementations of this approach that utilize spatial
and/or temporal multiplexing suffer from rapidly increasing switching losses when scaled to a
large number of modes. Here, we break this limitation via frequency multiplexing in which the switching
losses remain fixed irrespective of the number of modes. We use the third-order nonlinear process
of Bragg scattering four-wave mixing as an efficient ultra-low noise frequency switch and demonstrate
multiplexing of three frequency modes. We achieve a record generation rate of $4.6\times10^4$
multiplexed photons per second with an ultra-low $g^{2}(0)$ = 0.07, indicating high single-photon
purity. Our scalable, all-fiber multiplexing system has a total loss of just 1.3 dB independent
of the number of multiplexed modes, such that the 4.8 dB enhancement from multiplexing three frequency
modes markedly overcomes switching loss. Our approach offers a highly promising path to creating
a deterministic photon source that can be integrated on a chip-based platform.
