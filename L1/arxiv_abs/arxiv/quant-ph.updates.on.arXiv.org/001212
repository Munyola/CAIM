The most general and versatile defining feature of quantum chaotic systems is that they possess
an energy spectrum with correlations universally described by random matrix theory (RMT). This
feature can be exhibited by systems with a well defined classical limit as well as by systems with
no classical correspondence, such as locally interacting spins or fermions. Despite great phenomenological
success, a general mechanism explaining the emergence of RMT without reference to semiclassical
concepts is still missing. Here we provide the example of a quantum many-body system with no semiclassical
limit (no large parameter) where the emergence of RMT spectral correlations is proven exactly.
Specifically, we consider a periodically driven Ising model and write the Fourier transform of
spectral density's two-point function, the spectral form factor, in terms of a partition function
of a two-dimensional classical Ising model featuring a space-time duality. We show that the self-dual
cases provide a minimal model of many-body quantum chaos, where the spectral form factor is demonstrated
to match RMT for all values of the integer time variable $t$ in the thermodynamic limit. In particular,
we rigorously prove RMT form factor for odd $t$, while we formulate a precise conjecture for even
$t$. The results imply ergodicity for any finite amount of disorder in the longitudinal field, rigorously
excluding the possibility of many-body localization. Our method provides a novel route for obtaining
exact nonperturbative results in non-integrable systems.
