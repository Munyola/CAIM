The idea of the out-of-time-order correlator (OTOC) has recently emerged in the study of both condensed
matter systems and gravitational systems. It not only plays a key role in investigating the holographic
duality between a strongly interacting quantum system and a gravitational system, but also diagnoses
the chaotic behavior of many-body quantum systems and characterizes the information scrambling.
Based on the OTOCs, three different concepts -- quantum chaos, holographic duality, and information
scrambling -- are found to be intimately related to each other. Despite of its theoretical importance,
the experimental measurement of the OTOC is quite challenging and so far there is no experimental
measurement of the OTOC for local operators. Here we report the measurement of OTOCs of local operators
for an Ising spin chain on a nuclear magnetic resonance quantum simulator. We observe that the OTOC
behaves differently in the integrable and non-integrable cases. Based on the recent discovered
relationship between OTOCs and the growth of entanglement entropy in the many-body system, we extract
the entanglement entropy from the measured OTOCs, which clearly shows that the information entropy
oscillates in time for integrable models and scrambles for non-intgrable models. With the measured
OTOCs, we also obtain the experimental result of the butterfly velocity, which measures the speed
of correlation propagation. Our experiment paves a way for experimentally studying quantum chaos,
holographic duality, and information scrambling in many-body quantum systems with quantum simulators.
