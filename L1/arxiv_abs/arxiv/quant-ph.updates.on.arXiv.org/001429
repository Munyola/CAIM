Quantum teleportation provides a way to transmit unknown quantum states from one location to another
via previously shared quantum entanglement and classical communications. Discrete variable
states and continuous variable states in one degree of freedom have been transported. Recent work
has also demonstrated the capability of teleporting multiple degrees of freedom of a single photon
[13]. These advances enable the quantum teleportation technique to transport the states of quantum
systems reliably. However, in the quantum world, multi-level systems such as the single atom of
quantized energy and the single photon of orbital angular momentum are more prevalent. Therefore,
to completely rebuild the quantum states of a single particle remotely, one needs to teleport multi-level
states. However, performing a deterministic multi-level Bell state measurement, a key step in
quantum teleportation, remains a challenge. Here, we demonstrate the teleportation of multi-level
states of a single photon in a three-dimensional six-photon system. We exploit the path mode of a
single photon as the multilevel system, use two auxiliary entangled photons to realize a deterministic
three-dimensional Bell state measurement. Therefore we can teleport three-level states to another
photon assisted by pre-shared entangled two-photon three-level states and classical communications.
The teleportation fidelities are all above 0.630, and obviously exceed the classical limit 0.5.
Our work paves the way to rebuild complex quantum systems remotely and to construct complex quantum
networks.
