The problem of quantum state reduction in the process of measurement has attracted attention of
almost everyone who created, developed or explained quantum physics to the students. Absence of
a solution is the basis for the statement that the physical laws alone are not enough to describe the
reduction of state of the measured particle. In the presented study, it is taken into account that
the measurement of all properties of quantum particles can not be carried out in one physical process
(the no-cloning theorem). For such a measurement several series of incompatible observations
are needed, each series is to be carried out by means of a separate measuring instrument. Each event
of measurement is a separate physical process; combination of different measurement events is
performed by the Measurer - a subject capable of recognizing or not recognizing different events
as similar depending on the purpose of the measurement, and capable as well of planning the measurements,
of obtaining results and making conclusions. Several strategies for measuring the quantum state
of photon polarization are considered; it is shown that modeling of a mixed state by a set of photon
pure states is possible only if for this set in all the measurements the same measuring devices are
used. It is also shown that the reduction of the quantum state is determined by the parameters of interaction
of the measuring device with the measured particle. This fact removes the restrictions on the magnitudes
of correlations of different observables, known as Bell's inequalities.
