We study multi-partite entanglement, the generation of EPR states and quantum steering in a three-mode
optomechanical system composed of an atomic ensemble located inside a single-mode cavity with
a movable mirror. The cavity mode is driven by a short laser pulse, has a nonlinear parametric-type
interaction with the mirror and a linear beamsplitter-type interaction with the atomic ensemble.
There is no direct interaction of the mirror with the atomic ensemble. A threshold effect for the
dynamics of the system is found, above which the system works as an amplifier and below which as an
attenuator of the output fields. The threshold is determined by the ratio of the coupling strengths
of the cavity mode to the mirror and to the atomic ensemble. It is shown that above the threshold the
system effectively behaves as a two-mode system in which a perfect bipartite EPR state can be generated,
while it is impossible below the threshold. Furthermore, a fully inseparable tripartite entanglement
and even further a genuine tripartite entanglement can be produced above and below the threshold.
In addition, we consider quantum steering and examine the monogamy relations that quantify the
amount of bipartite steering that can be shared between different modes. It is found that the mirror
is more capable for steering of entanglement than the cavity mode. The two way steering is found between
the mirror and the atomic ensemble despite the fact that they are not directly coupled to each other,
while it is impossible between the output of cavity mode and the ensemble which are directly coupled
to each other.
