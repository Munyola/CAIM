The stationary Schr\"odinger equation can be cast in the form $H \rho = E \rho$, where $H$ is the system's
Hamiltonian and $\rho$ is the system's density matrix. We explore the merits of this unconventional
form of the stationary Schr\"odinger equation, which we refer to as SSE$_\rho$. For a nondegenerate
energy level, the solution $\rho$ of the SSE$_\rho$ is merely a projection on the corresponding
eigenvector. However, in the case of degeneracy $\rho$ in non-unique and not necessarily pure.
In fact, it can be an arbitrary mixture of the degenerate pure eigenstates. Importantly, $\rho$
can always be chosen to respect all symmetries of the Hamiltonian, even if each pure eigenstate in
the corresponding degenerate multiplet spontaneously breaks the symmetries. This and other features
of the solutions of the SSE$_\rho$ can prove helpful by easing the notations and providing an unobscured
insight into the structure of the eigenstates. We work out the SSE$_\rho$ for the system of spins
$1/2$ with Heisenberg interactions. Eigenvalue problem for quantum observables other than Hamiltonian
can also be formulated in terms of density matrices. We provide an analytical solution to one of them,
${\bf S}^2 \rho=S(S+1) \rho$, where $\bf S$ is the total spin of $N$ spins $1/2$, and $\rho$ is chosen
to be invariant under permutations of spins. This way we find an explicit form of projections to the
invariant subspaces of ${\bf S}^2$. Finally, we note that the anti-Hermitian part of the SSE$_\rho$
can be used to construct sum rules for temperature correlation functions, and provide an example
of such sum rule.
