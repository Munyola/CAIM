As a direct consequence of the no-cloning theorem, the deterministic amplification as in classical
communication is impossible for quantum states. This calls for more advanced techniques in a future
global quantum network, e.g. for cloud quantum computing. A unique solution is the teleportation
of an entangled state, i.e. entanglement swapping, representing the central resource to relay
entanglement between distant nodes. Together with entanglement purification and a quantum memory
it constitutes a so-called quantum repeater. Since the afore mentioned building blocks have been
individually demonstrated in laboratory setups only, the applicability of the required technology
in real-world scenarios remained to be proven. Here we present a free-space entanglement-swapping
experiment between the Canary Islands of La Palma and Tenerife, verifying the presence of quantum
entanglement between two previously independent photons separated by 143 km. We obtained an expectation
value for the entanglement-witness operator, more than 6 standard deviations beyond the classical
limit. By consecutive generation of the two required photon pairs and space-like separation of
the relevant measurement events, we also showed the feasibility of the swapping protocol in a long-distance
scenario, where the independence of the nodes is highly demanded. Since our results already allow
for efficient implementation of entanglement purification, we anticipate our assay to lay the
ground for a fully-fledged quantum repeater over a realistic high-loss and even turbulent quantum
channel.
