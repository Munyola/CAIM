We provide a general description of the phenomenon of entanglement in bipartite systems, as it manifests
in micro and macro physical systems, as well as in human cognitive processes. We do so by observing
that when genuine coincidence measurements are considered, the violation of the 'marginal laws',
in addition to the Bell-CHSH inequality, is also to be expected. The situation can be described in
the quantum formalism by considering the presence of entanglement not only at the level of the states,
but also at the level of the measurements. However, at the "local'" level of a specific joint measurement,
a description where entanglement is only incorporated in the state remains always possible, by
adopting a fine-tuned tensor product representation. But contextual tensor product representations
should only be considered when there are good reasons to describe the outcome-states as (non-entangled)
product states. This will not in general be true, hence, the entangement resource will have to generally
be allocated both in the states and in the measurements. In view of the numerous violations of the
marginal laws observed in physics' laboratories, it remains unclear to date if entanglement in
micro-physical systems is to be understood only as an 'entanglement of the states', or also as an
'entanglement of the measurements'. But even if measurements would also be entangled, the corresponding
violation of the marginal laws (no-signaling conditions) would not for this imply that a superluminal
communication would be possible.
