We suggest a novel approach for wide-field imaging of the neural network dynamics of brain slices
that uses highly sensitivity magnetometry based on nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond.
In-vitro recordings in brain slices is a proven method for the characterization of electrical neural
activity and has strongly contributed to our understanding of the mechanisms that govern neural
information processing. However, traditional recordings can only acquire signals from a few positions
simultaneously, which severely limits their ability to characterize the dynamics of the underlying
neural networks. We suggest to radically extend the scope of this method using the wide-field imaging
of the neural magnetic fields across the slice by means of NV magnetometry. Employing comprehensive
computational simulations and theoretical analyses, we characterize the spatiotemporal characteristics
of the neural magnetic fields and derive the required key performance parameters of an imaging setup
based on NV magnetometry. In particular, we determine how the technical parameters determine the
achievable spatial resolution for an optimal reconstruction of the neural currents from the measured
field distributions. Finally, we compare the imaging of neural slice activity with that of a single
planar pyramidal cell. Our results suggest that imaging of neural slice activity will be possible
with the upcoming generation of NV magnetic field sensors, while imaging of the activity of a single
planar cell remains more challenging.
