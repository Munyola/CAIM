The geometric aspects of quantum mechanics are underlined most prominently by the concept of geometric
phases, which are acquired whenever a quantum system evolves along a closed path in Hilbert space.
The geometric phase is determined only by the shape of this path and is -- in its simplest form -- a real
number. However, if the system contains degenerate energy levels, matrix-valued geometric phases,
termed non-abelian holonomies, can emerge. They play an important role for the creation of synthetic
gauge fields in cold atomic gases and the description of non-abelian anyon statistics. Moreover,
it has been proposed to exploit non-abelian holonomic gates for robust quantum computation. In
contrast to abelian geometric phases, non-abelian ones have been observed only in nuclear quadrupole
resonance experiments with a large number of spins and without fully characterizing the geometric
process and its non-commutative nature. Here, we realize non-abelian holonomic quantum operations
on a single superconducting artificial three-level atom by applying a well controlled two-tone
microwave drive. Using quantum process tomography, we determine fidelities of the resulting non-commuting
gates exceeding 95 %. We show that a sequence of two paths in Hilbert space traversed in different
order yields inequivalent transformations, which is an evidence for the non-abelian character
of the implemented holonomic quantum gates. In combination with two-qubit operations, they form
a universal set of gates for holonomic quantum computation.
