Nonlinear optical cavities are crucial both in classical and quantum optics; in particular, nowadays
optical parametric oscillators are one of the most versatile and tunable sources of coherent light,
as well as the sources of the highest quality quantum-correlated light in the continuous variable
regime. Being nonlinear systems, they can be driven through critical points in which a solution
ceases to exist in favour of a new one, and it is close to these points where quantum correlations are
the strongest. The simplest description of such systems consists in writing the quantum fields
as the classical part plus some quantum fluctuations, linearizing then the dynamical equations
with respect to the latter; however, such an approach breaks down close to critical points, where
it provides unphysical predictions such as infinite photon numbers. On the other hand, techniques
going beyond the simple linear description become too complicated especially regarding the evaluation
of two-time correlators, which are of major importance to compute observables outside the cavity.
In this article we provide a regularized linear description of nonlinear cavities, that is, a linearization
procedure yielding physical results, taking the degenerate optical parametric oscillator as
the guiding example. The method, which we call self-consistent linearization, is shown to be equivalent
to a general Gaussian ansatz for the state of the system, and we compare its predictions with those
obtained with available exact (or quasi-exact) methods.
