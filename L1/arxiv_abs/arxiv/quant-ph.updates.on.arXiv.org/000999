The von Neumann entropy of a graph is a spectral complexity measure that has recently found applications
in complex networks analysis and pattern recognition. Two variants of the von Neumann entropy exist
based on the graph Laplacian and normalized graph Laplacian, respectively. Due to its computational
complexity, previous works have proposed to approximate the von Neumann entropy, effectively
reducing it to the computation of simple node degree statistics. Unfortunately, a number of issues
surrounding the von Neumann entropy remain unsolved to date, including the interpretation of this
spectral measure in terms of structural patterns, understanding the relation between its two variants,
and evaluating the quality of the corresponding approximations. In this paper we aim to answer these
questions by first analysing and comparing the quadratic approximations of the two variants and
then performing an extensive set of experiments on both synthetic and real-world graphs. We find
that 1) the two entropies lead to the emergence of similar structures, but with some significant
differences; 2) the correlation between them ranges from weakly positive to strongly negative,
depending on the topology of the underlying graph; 3) the quadratic approximations fail to capture
the presence of non-trivial structural patterns that seem to influence the value of the exact entropies;
4) the quality of the approximations, as well as which variant of the von Neumann entropy is better
approximated, depends on the topology of the underlying graph.
