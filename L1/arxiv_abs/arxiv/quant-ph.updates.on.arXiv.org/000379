At the exceptional point where two eigenstates coalesce in open quantum systems, the usual diagonalization
scheme breaks down and the Hamiltonian can only be reduced to Jordan block form. Most of the studies
on the exceptional point appearing in the literature introduce a phenomenological effective Hamiltonian
that essentially reduces the problem to that of a finite non-Hermitian matrix for which it is straightforward
to obtain the Jordan form. In this paper, we demonstrate how the Hamiltonian of an open quantum system
reduces to Jordan block form at an exceptional point in an exact manner that treats the continuum
without any approximation. Our method relies on the Brillouin-Wigner-Feshbach projection method
according to which we can obtain a finite dimensional effective Hamiltonian that shares the discrete
sector of the spectrum with the original Hamiltonian. While owing to its eigenvalue dependence
this effective Hamiltonian cannot be used to write the Jordan block directly, we show that by formally
extending the problem to include eigenstates with complex eigenvalues that reside outside the
usual Hilbert space, we can obtain the Jordan block form at the exceptional point without introducing
any approximation. We also introduce an extended Jordan form basis away from the exceptional point,
which provides an alternative way to obtain the Jordan block at an exceptional point. The extended
Jordan block connects continuously to the Jordan block exactly at the exceptional point implying
that the observable quantities are continuous at the exceptional point.
