Quantum searching for one of \(N\) marked items in an unsorted database of \(n\) items is solved in
\(\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{n/N})\) steps using Grover's algorithm. Using nonlinear quantum dynamics
with a Gross-Pitaevskii type quadratic nonlinearity, Childs and Young discovered a quantum search
algorithm with a complexity \(\mathcal{O}( \min \{ 1/g' \, \log (g' n), \sqrt{n} \} ) \), which can
be used to find a marked node after \(o(\log(n))\) repetitions, where \(g'\) is the nonlinearity
strength \cite{PhysRevA.93.022314}. In this work we find a new quantum control protocol which
can be realised on a linear or nonlinear quantum Turing machine. Our continuous time search algorithm
finds a marked node on complete graphs with running time \(\mathcal{O}((N^{\perp} - N) / (g \sqrt{N
N^{\perp}}) )\), when \(N^{\perp} > N\) and \(N^{\perp}\) denotes the number of unmarked nodes.
When \(N^{\perp} \leq N\), we obtain a runtime \(\mathcal{O}( 1 / (2 N) \, )\). Even for constant \(g\),
this protocol scales better than Grover's and nonlinear quantum searches when \(N^{\perp} \leq
N\). In our protocol the nonlinearity is time dependent and can always be chosen less than or equal
to \(g\). In the linear case \(g\) represents the difference in the Hamiltonian of the marked and
unmarked states. This protocol can be implemented on a linear quantum Turing machine and we discuss
the potential to implement this algorithm according to nonlinear quantum regimes using Bose-Einstein
Condensates in optical lattices and photons in nonlinear optical waveguides.
