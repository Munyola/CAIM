It is shown that the maximal phase sensitivity of a two-path interferometer with high-intensity
coherent light and squeezed vacuum in the input ports can be achieved by photon number resolving
detection of only a small number of photons in a dark output port. It is then possible to achieve the
quantum Cram\'{e}r-Rao bound of the two-path interferometer using only the field displacement
dependence of the photon number statistics in the single mode output of the dark port represented
by a field-displaced squeezed vacuum state. We find that, at small field displacements, it is not
sufficient to use the average photon number as the estimator, indicating that an optimal phase estimation
depends critically on measurements of the precise photon number. We therefore analyze the effect
of detection efficiency on the Fisher information and show that there is a transition from low robustness
against photon losses associated with quantum interference effects at low field displacements
to high robustness against photon losses at high field displacements. The transition between the
two regimes occurs at field shifts proportional to the third power of the squeezing factor, indicating
that squeezing greatly enhances the phase interval in which quantum effects are relevant in optimal
phase estimations using photon resolving detectors. The case under study could thus be understood
as a `missing link' between genuine multi-photon interference and the straightforward suppression
of noise usually associated with squeezed light.
