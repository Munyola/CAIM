We present a comprehensive analysis of the emerging order and chaos and enduring symmetries, accompanying
a generic (high-barrier) first-order quantum phase transition (QPT). The interacting boson model
Hamiltonian employed, describes a QPT between spherical and deformed shapes, associated with
its U(5) and SU(3) dynamical symmetry limits. A~classical analysis of the intrinsic dynamics reveals
a rich but simply-divided phase space structure with a H\'enon-Heiles type of chaotic dynamics
ascribed to the spherical minimum and a robustly regular dynamics ascribed to the deformed minimum.
The simple pattern of mixed but well-separated dynamics persists in the coexistence region and
traces the crossing of the two minima in the Landau potential. A quantum analysis discloses a number
of regular low-energy U(5)-like multiplets in the spherical region, and regular SU(3)-like rotational
bands extending to high energies and angular momenta, in the deformed region. These two kinds of
regular subsets of states retain their identity amidst a complicated environment of other states
and both occur in the coexistence region. A symmetry analysis of their wave functions shows that
they are associated with partial U(5) dynamical symmetry (PDS) and SU(3) quasi-dynamical symmetry
(QDS), respectively. The pattern of mixed but well-separated dynamics and the PDS or QDS characterization
of the remaining regularity, appear to be robust throughout the QPT. Effects of kinetic collective
rotational terms, which may disrupt this simple pattern, are considered.
