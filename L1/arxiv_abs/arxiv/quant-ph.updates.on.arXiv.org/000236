Using the wave equation in d > or = 1 space dimensions it is illustrated how dynamical equations
may be simultaneously Poincar\'e and Galileo covariant with respect to different sets of independent
variables. This provides a method to obtain dynamics-dependent representations of the kinematical
symmetries. When the field is a displacement function both symmetries have a physical interpretation.
For d = 1 the Lorentz structure is utilized to reveal hitherto unnoticed features of the non-relativistic
Chaplygin gas, including a relativistic structure with a limiting case that exhibits the Carroll
group, and field-dependent symmetries and associated Noether charges. The Lorentz transformations
of the potentials naturally associated with the Chaplygin system are given. These results prompt
the search for further symmetries and it is shown that the Chaplygin equations support a nonlinear
superposition principle. A known spacetime mixing symmetry is shown to decompose into label-time
and superposition symmetries. It is shown that a quantum mechanical system in a stationary state
behaves as a Chaplygin gas. The extension to d > 1 is used to illustrate how the physical significance
of the dual symmetries is contingent on the context by showing that Maxwells equations exhibit an
exact Galileo covariant formulation where Lorentz and gauge transformations are represented
by field-dependent symmetries. A natural conceptual and formal framework is provided by the Lagrangian
and Eulerian pictures of continuum mechanics.
