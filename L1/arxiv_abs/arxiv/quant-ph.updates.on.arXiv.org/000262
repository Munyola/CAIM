To build a fault-tolerant quantum computer, it is necessary to implement a quantum error correcting
code. Such codes rely on the ability to extract information about the quantum error syndrome while
not destroying the quantum information encoded in the system. Stabilizer codes are attractive
solutions to this problem, as they are analogous to classical linear codes, have simple and easily
computed encoding networks, and allow efficient syndrome extraction. In these codes, syndrome
extraction is performed via multi-qubit stabilizer measurements, which are bit and phase parity
checks up to local operations. Previously, stabilizer codes have been realized in nuclei, trapped-ions,
and superconducting qubits. However these implementations lack the ability to perform fault-tolerant
syndrome extraction which continues to be a challenge for all physical quantum computing systems.
Here we experimentally demonstrate a key step towards this problem by using a two-by-two lattice
of superconducting qubits to perform syndrome extraction and arbitrary error detection via simultaneous
quantum non-demolition stabilizer measurements. This lattice represents a primitive tile for
the surface code, which is a promising stabilizer code for scalable quantum computing. Furthermore,
we successfully show the preservation of an entangled state in the presence of an arbitrary applied
error through high-fidelity syndrome measurement. Our results bolster the promise of employing
lattices of superconducting qubits for larger-scale fault-tolerant quantum computing.
