Lov{\'a}sz Local Lemma (LLL) is a very powerful tool in combinatorics and probability theory to
show the possibility of avoiding all "bad" events under some "weakly dependent" condition. Over
the last decades, the algorithmic aspect of LLL has also attracted lots of attention in theoretical
computer science. A tight criterion under which the \emph{abstract} version LLL (ALLL) holds was
given by Shearer. It turns out that Shearer's bound is generally not tight for \emph{variable} version
LLL (VLLL). Recently, Ambainis et al. introduced a quantum version LLL (QLLL), which was then shown
to be powerful for quantum satisfiability problem. In this paper, we prove that Shearer's bound
is tight for QLLL, i.e., the relative dimension of the smallest satisfying subspace is completely
characterized by the independent set polynomial, affirming a conjecture proposed by Sattath et
al.. Our result also shows the tightness of Gily{\'e}n and Sattath's algorithm, and implies that
the lattice gas partition function fully characterizes quantum satisfiability for almost all
Hamiltonians with large enough qudits. Commuting LLL (CLLL), LLL for commuting local Hamiltonians
which are widely studied in the literature, is also investigated here. We prove that the tight regions
of CLLL and QLLL are different in general. Thus, the efficient region of algorithms for CLLL can go
beyond Shearer's bound. In applications of LLLs, the symmetric cases are most common, i.e., the
events are with the same probability and the Hamiltonians are with the same relative dimension.
