We seek to develop a Bures (minimal monotone/statistical distinguishability) metric-based series
of formulas for the moments of probability distributions over the determinants $|\rho|$ and $|\rho^{PT}|$
of $4 \times 4$ density matrices, $\rho$, for generalized (rebit, quater[nionic]bit,\ldots)
two-qubit systems, analogous to a series that has been obtained for the Hilbert-Schmidt (HS) metric.
In particular, we desire--using moment-inversion procedures--to be able to closely test the previously-developed
conjecture (J. Geom. Phys., 53, 74 [2005]) that the Bures separability probability over the (standard,
fifteen-dimensional convex set of) two-qubit states is $\frac{1680 \left(\sqrt{2}-1\right)}{\pi
^8} \approx 0.0733389$--while, in the HS context, strong evidence has been adduced, along the indicated
analytical lines, that the counterpart of this value is $\frac{8}{33}$ (J. Phys. A}, 45, 095305
[2012]). Working within the "utility function" framework of Dunkl employed in that latter study,
we obtain an interesting $_{10}F_{9}$ balanced hypergeometric function based on a "hybridization"
of known Bures and HS terms. This exercise appears to provide an upper bound on the Bures two-qubit
separability probability of 0.0798218. We also examine the yet unresolved HS qubit-qutrit scenario.
Mathematica calculations indicate that if the same form of hypergeometric paradigm as has been
established for the generalized two-qubit HS moments is followed in either the HS qubit-qutrit
or Bures two-qubit cases, then a balanced hypergeometric function $_{p}F_{p-1}$ with $p>9$
would be required.
