A method for the systematic construction of few-body damped harmonic oscillator networks accurately
reproducing the effect of general bosonic environments in open quantum systems is presented. Under
the sole assumptions of a Gaussian environment and regardless of the system coupled to it, an algorithm
to determine the parameters of an equivalent set of interacting damped oscillators obeying a Markovian
quantum master equation is introduced. By choosing a suitable coupling to the system and minimizing
an appropriate distance between the two-time correlation function of this effective bath and that
of the target environment, the error induced in the reduced dynamics of the system is brought under
rigorous control. The interactions among the effective modes provide remarkable flexibility
in replicating non-Markovian effects on the system even with a small number of oscillators, and
the resulting Lindblad equation may therefore be integrated at a very reasonable computational
cost using standard methods for Markovian problems, even in strongly non-perturbative coupling
regimes and at arbitrary temperatures including zero. We apply the method to an exactly solvable
problem in order to demonstrate its accuracy, and present a study based on current research in the
context of coherent transport in biological aggregates as a more realistic example of its use; performance
and versatility are highlighted, and theoretical and numerical advantages over existing methods,
as well as possible future improvements, are discussed.
