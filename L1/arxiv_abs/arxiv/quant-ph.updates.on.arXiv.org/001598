To solve classically hard problems, quantum computers need to be resilient to the influence of noise
and decoherence. In such a fault-tolerant quantum computer, noise-induced errors must be detected
and corrected in real-time to prevent them from propagating between components. This requirement
is especially pertinent while applying quantum gates, when the interaction between components
can cause errors to quickly spread throughout the system. However, the large overhead involved
in most fault-tolerant architectures makes implementing these systems a daunting task, which
motivates the search for hardware-efficient alternatives. Here, we present a gate enacted by a
multilevel ancilla transmon on a cavity-encoded logical qubit that is fault-tolerant with respect
to decoherence in both the ancilla and the encoded qubit. We maintain the purity of the encoded qubit
in the presence of ancilla errors by detecting those errors in real-time, and applying the appropriate
corrections. We show a reduction of the logical gate error by a factor of two in the presence of naturally
occurring decoherence, and demonstrate resilience against ancilla bit-flips and phase-flips
by observing a sixfold suppression of the gate error with increased energy relaxation, and a fourfold
suppression with increased dephasing noise. The results demonstrate that bosonic logical qubits
can be controlled by error-prone ancilla qubits without inheriting the ancilla's inferior performance.
As such, error-corrected ancilla-enabled gates are an important step towards fully fault-tolerant
processing of bosonic qubits.
