We investigate the relationship between the energy spectrum of a local Hamiltonian and the geometric
properties of its ground state. By generalizing a standard framework from the analysis of Markov
chains to arbitrary (non-stoquastic) Hamiltonians we are naturally led to see that the spectral
gap can always be upper bounded by an isoperimetric ratio that depends only on the ground state probability
distribution and the range of the terms in the Hamiltonian, but not on any other details of the interaction
couplings. This means that for a given probability distribution the inequality constrains the
spectral gap of any local Hamiltonian with this distribution as its ground state probability distribution
in some basis (Eldar and Harrow derived a similar result in order to characterize the output of low-depth
quantum circuits). Going further, we relate the Hilbert space localization properties of the ground
state to higher energy eigenvalues by showing that the presence of k strongly localized ground state
modes (i.e. clusters of probability, or subsets with small expansion) in Hilbert space implies
the presence of k energy eigenvalues that are close to the ground state energy. Our results suggest
that quantum adiabatic optimization using local Hamiltonians will inevitably encounter small
spectral gaps when attempting to prepare ground states corresponding to multi-modal probability
distributions with strongly localized modes, and this problem cannot necessarily be alleviated
with the inclusion of non-stoquastic couplings.
