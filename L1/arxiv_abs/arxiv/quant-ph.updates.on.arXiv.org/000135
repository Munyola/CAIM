Acin et al. introduced a unified framework for the study of no-signalling correlations. Such a framework
is based on the notion of local quantum measurements, but, in order to account for beyond-quantum
correlations, global pseudo-states that are not positive semidefinite are allowed. After a short
review of the formalism, we consider its use in the quantification of both general non-local and
beyond-quantum correlations. We argue that the unified framework for correlations provides a
simple approach to such a quantification, in particular when the quantification is meant to be operational
and meaningful in a resource-theory scenario, i.e., when considering the processing of resources
by means of non-resources. We relate different notions of robustness of correlations, both at the
level of (pseudo-)states and abstract probability distributions, with particular focus on the
beyond-quantum robustness of correlations and pseudo-states. We revisit known results and argue
that, within the unified framework, the relation between the two levels---that of operators and
that of probability distributions---is very strict. We point out how the consideration of robustness
at the two levels leads to a natural framework for the quantification of entanglement in a device-independent
way. Finally, we show that the beyond-quantum robustness of the non-positive operators needed
to achieve beyond-quantum correlations coincides with their negativity and their distance from
the set of quantum states. As an example, we calculate the beyond-quantum robustness for the case
of a noisy Popescu-Rohrlich box.
