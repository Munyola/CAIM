Quantum metrology protocols are typically designed around the assumption that we have an abundance
of measurement data, but recent practical applications are increasingly driving interest in cases
with very limited data. In this regime the best approach involves an interesting interplay between
the amount of data and the prior information. Here we propose a new way of optimising these schemes
based on the practically-motivated assumption that we have a sequence of identical and independent
measurements. For a given probe state we take our measurement to be the best one for a single shot and
we use this sequentially to study the performance of different practical states in a Mach-Zehnder
interferometer when we have moderate prior knowledge of the underlying parameter. We find that
we recover the quantum Cram\'er-Rao bound asymptotically, but for low data counts we find a completely
different structure. Despite the fact that intra-mode correlations are known to be the key to increasing
the asymptotic precision, we find evidence that these can be detrimental in the low data regime and
that entanglement between the paths of the interferometer can play a more important role. Finally,
we analyse how close realistic measurements can get to the bound and find that measuring quadratures
can improve upon counting photons, though both strategies converge asymptotically. These results
may prove to be important in the development of quantum enhanced metrology applications where practical
considerations mean that we are limited to a small number of trials.
