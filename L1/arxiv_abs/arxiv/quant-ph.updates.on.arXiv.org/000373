We present a "hybrid quantum repeater" protocol for the long-distance distribution of atomic entangled
states beyond qubits. In our scheme, imperfect noisy entangled pairs of two qudits, i.e., two discrete-variable
$d$-level systems, each of, in principle, arbitrary dimension $d$, are initially shared between
the intermediate stations of the channel. This is achieved via local, sufficiently strong light-matter
interactions, involving optical coherent states and their transmission after these interactions,
and optical measurements on the transmitted field modes, especially (but not restricted to) efficient
continuous-variable homodyne detections ("hybrid" here refers to the simultaneous exploitation
of discrete and continuous variable degrees of freedom for the local processing and storage of entangled
states as well as their non-local distribution, respectively). For qutrits we quantify the light-matter
entanglement that can be effectively shared through an elementary lossy channel, and for a repeater
spacing of up to 10 km we show that the realistic (lossy) qutrit entanglement is even larger than any
ideal (loss-free) qubit entanglement. After including qudit entanglement purification and swapping
procedures, we calculate the long-distance entangled-pair distribution rates and the final entangled-state
fidelities for total communication distances of up to 1280 km. With three rounds of purification,
entangled qudit pairs of near-unit fidelity can be distributed over 1280 km at rates of the order
of, in principle, 100 Hz.
