Variational quantum algorithms are promising applications of noisy intermediate-scale quantum
(NISQ) computers. These algorithms consist of a number of separate prepare-and-measure experiments
that estimate terms in the Hamiltonian. The number of separate measurements required can become
overwhelmingly large for problems at the scale of NISQ hardware that may soon be available. We approach
this problem from the perspective of contextuality, and use unitary partitioning (developed independently
by Izmaylov \emph{et al.}) to define VQE procedures in which additional unitary operations are
appended to the ansatz preparation to reduce the number of measurements. This approach may be scaled
to use all coherent resources available after ansatz preparation. We also study the use of asymmetric
qubitization to implement the additional coherent operations with lower circuit depth. We investigate
this technique for lattice Hamiltonians, random Pauli Hamiltonians, and electronic structure
Hamiltonians. We find a constant factor speedup for lattice and random Pauli Hamiltonians. For
electronic structure Hamiltonians, we prove that the linear term reduction with respect to the
number of orbitals, which has been previously observed in numerical studies, is always achievable.
We show that unitary partitioning applied to the plane-wave dual basis representation of fermionic
Hamiltonians offers only a constant factor reduction in the number of terms. Finally, we show that
noncontextual Hamiltonians are equivalent to commuting Hamiltonians by giving a reduction via
unitary partitioning.
