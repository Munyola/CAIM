In this article, we design a quantum device to duplicate the Robins procedure. It is known that the
Robins use the unique method to determine the migratory direction. In the procedure utilized, the
important issue is the effect of the geomagnetic field on the magnetic momentum of the created radical
pairs (triplet-singlet states) which dance with a special frequency. To duplicate the same operational
procedure, the quantum sensor consisting of two coincident tripartite systems is designed. Each
system is excited separately with the entangled photons (signal and idler) produced through the
nonlinearity. In a traditional tripartite system, the microwave cavity mode can be non-classically
correlated with the optical cavity mode. In the designed system, on the other hand, there are two
microwave cavities modes which are separately affected by the entangled photons, and these modes
can be entangled. The entangled microwave photons play the same role that the triplet-singlet state
of the electrons have in the Robins operating system. It is the key point that the quantum sensor is
deigned to work with, in such a way that the entanglement between two microwave photons can be strongly
affected by the applied external magnetic field. In fact, it is the criterion utilized by the quantum
sensor to determine the magnetic field intensity and the direction. To analyze the system, the canonical
conjugate method is employed to determine the quantum sensor Hamiltonian, and then the dynamics
equations of motions are analytically derived using Heisenberg-Langevin equations.
