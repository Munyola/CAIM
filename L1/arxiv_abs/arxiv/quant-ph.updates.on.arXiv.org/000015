We have investigated quantum phase transition employing the quantum renormalization group (QRG)
method while in most previous literature barely entanglement (concurrence) has been demonstrated.
However, it is now well known that entanglement is not the only signature of quantum correlations
and a variety of computable measures have been developed to characterize quantum correlations
in the composite systems. As an illustration, two cases are elaborated: one dimensional anisotropic
(i) XXZ model and (ii) XY model, with various measures of quantum correlations, including quantum
discord (QD), geometric discord (GD), measure-induced disturbance (MID), measure-induced nonlocality
(MIN) and violation of Bell inequalities (eg. CHSH inequality). We have proved that all these correlation
measures can effectively detect the quantum critical points associated with quantum phase transitions
(QPT) after several iterations of the renormalization in both cases. Nonetheless, it is shown that
some of their dynamical behaviors are not totally similar with entanglement and even when concurrence
vanishes there still exists some kind of quantum correlations which is not captured by entanglement.
Intriguingly, CHSH inequality can never be violated in the whole iteration procedure, which indicates
block-block entanglement can not revealed by the CHSH inequality. Moreover, the nonanalytic and
scaling behaviors of Bell violation have also been discussed in detail. As a byproduct, we verify
that measure-induced disturbance is exactly equal to the quantum discord measured by \sigma_z
for general X-structured states.
