According to classical physics particles are basic building blocks of the world. Classical particles
are distinguishable objects, individuated by physical characteristics. By contrast, in quantum
mechanics the standard view is that particles of the same kind ("identical particles") are in all
circumstances indistinguishable from each other. This indistinguishability doctrine is motivated
by the (anti)symmetrization postulates together with the assumption (``factorism'') that each
single particle is represented in exactly one factor space in the tensor product Hilbert space of
a many-particles system. Although the factorist assumption is standard in the literature, it is
conceptually problematic. Particle indistinguishability is incompatible with the everyday
meaning of ``particle'', and also with how this term is used both in classical physics and in the experimental
practice of physics. The standard view requires quantum particles of the same kind to remain indistinguishable
even in the classical limit, so that a transition to the classical picture of the world seems impossible.
Earlier we have proposed an alternative conception of quantum particles that does not rely on factorism
and that avoids these and other problems. We further explain and develop this proposal here. In our
view, particles in quantum theory are not fundamental but \emph{emergent}. However, in those situations
where the particle concept is applicable, quantum particles---identical or not---are distinguishable
in the same way as classical particles.
