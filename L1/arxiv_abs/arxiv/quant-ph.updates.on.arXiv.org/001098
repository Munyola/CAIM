What is the physical principle that singles out the quantum correlations for Bell and contextuality
scenarios? Here we show that, if we restrict our attention to correlations that, as is the case for
all correlations in classical and quantum physics, can be produced by measurements that: (i) yield
the same outcome when repeated, (ii) only disturb measurements that are not jointly measurable,
and (iii) all their coarse-grainings have realizations that satisfy (i) and (ii), then the question
has a surprising answer. The set of quantum correlations is singled out by the following principle:
No law restricts the outcomes of the measurements; every outcome probability distribution that
is not inconsistent does take place. "Not inconsistent" distributions are defined through a necessary
condition based on the observation that, for measurements satisfying (i)-(iii), the sum of the
probabilities of any set of pairwise exclusive events is bounded by one. Two events are exclusive
if they correspond to different outcomes of the same measurement. To prove the result, we begin by
characterizing the sets of not inconsistent probability distribution for each "graph of exclusivity,"
without referring to any particular scenario, but treating all Bell and contextuality scenarios
at once. The restrictions of each scenario are introduced at the end of the proof and then we obtain
the set of probability distributions that satisfies the above principle for each scenario. Each
of these sets is equal to the corresponding set in quantum theory.
