Quantum physics was invented to account for two fundamental features of measurement results --
their discreetness and randomness. Emblematic of these features is Bohr's idea of quantum jumps
between two discrete energy levels of an atom. Experimentally, quantum jumps were first observed
in an atomic ion driven by a weak deterministic force while under strong continuous energy measurement.
The times at which the discontinuous jump transitions occur are reputed to be fundamentally unpredictable.
Can there be, despite the indeterminism of quantum physics, a possibility to know if a quantum jump
is about to occur or not? Here, we answer this question affirmatively by experimentally demonstrating
that the jump from the ground to an excited state of a superconducting artificial three-level atom
can be tracked as it follows a predictable "flight," by monitoring the population of an auxiliary
energy level coupled to the ground state. The experimental results demonstrate that the jump evolution
when completed is continuous, coherent, and deterministic. Furthermore, exploiting these features
and using real-time monitoring and feedback, we catch and reverse a quantum jump mid-flight, thus
deterministically preventing its completion. Our results, which agree with theoretical predictions
essentially without adjustable parameters, support the modern quantum trajectory theory and
provide new ground for the exploration of real-time intervention techniques in the control of quantum
systems, such as early detection of error syndromes.
