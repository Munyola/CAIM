I present here a new method that allows the introduction of a discrete auxiliary symmetry in a theory
in such a way that the eigenvalue spectrum of the fermion functional determinant is made up of complex
conjugated pairs. The method implies a particular way of introducing and integrating over auxiliary
fields related to a set of artificial shift symmetries. Gauge-fixing the artificial continuous
shift symmetries in the direct and dual sectors leads to the implementation of direct and dual BRST-type
global symmetries and of a symplectic structure over the field space (as prescribed by the Batalin-Vilkovisky
method). A procedure similar to Kahler polarization in geometric quantization guarantees the
possibility to choose a Kahler structure over the field space. This structure is generated by a special
way of performing gauge fixing over the direct and dual sectors. The desired discrete symmetry appears
to be induced by the Hodge-* operator. The particular extension of the field space presented here
makes the operators of the de-Rham cohomology manifest. These become symmetries in the extended
theory. This method implies the identification of the (anti)-BRST and dual-(anti)-BRST operators
with the exterior derivative and its dual in the context of the complex de-Rham cohomology. The novelty
of this method relies on the fact that the field structure is doubled two times in order to make use
of a supplemental symmetry prescribed by algebraic geometry. This leads to a generalization of
Kramers theorem that avoids the Quantum Monte Carlo phase sign problem without any apparent increase
in complexity.
