We discuss the modeling of the electrical manipulation of spin qubits in the linear-response regime
where the Rabi frequency is proportional to the magnetic field and to the radio-frequency electric
field excitation. We show that the Rabi frequency can be obtained from a generalized g-tensor magnetic
resonance formula featuring a g-matrix and its derivative g' with respect to the electric field
(or gate voltage) as inputs. These matrices can be easily calculated from the wave functions of the
qubit at zero magnetic field. The g-matrix formalism therefore provides the complete dependence
of the Larmor and Rabi frequencies on the orientation of the magnetic field at very low computational
cost. It also provides a compact model for the control of the qubit, and a simple framework for the
analysis of the effects of symmetries on the anisotropy of the Larmor and Rabi frequencies. The g-matrix
formalism applies to a wide variety of electron and hole qubits, and we focus on a hole qubit in a silicon-on-insulator
nanowire as an illustration. We show that the Rabi frequency of this qubit shows a complex dependence
on the orientation of the magnetic field, and on the gate voltages that control the symmetry of the
hole wave functions. We point out that the qubit may be advantageously switched between two bias
points, one where it can be manipulated efficiently, and one where it is largely decoupled from the
gate field but presumably longer lived. We also discuss the role of residual strains in such devices
in relation to recent experiments.
