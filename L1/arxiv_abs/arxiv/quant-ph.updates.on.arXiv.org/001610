With silicon being the go-to material for spin qubits, and motivated by the demand of a scalable quantum
computer architecture for fast and reliable quantum information transfer on-chip, we study coherent
electron transport in a silicon double quantum dot. We first examine the valley-orbital dynamics
in a silicon double dot, and discuss how to properly measure the tunnel couplings as well as the valley
phase difference between two quantum dots. We then focus on possible phase and spin flip errors during
spin transport across a silicon double dot. In particular, we clarify correction on the effective
$g$-factor for the electron spin from the double dot confinement potential, and quantify the resulting
phase error. We then study spin fidelity loss due to spin-valley mixing, which is a unique feature
of silicon quantum dots. We show that a small phase correction between valleys can cause a significant
coherence loss. We also investigate spin flip errors caused by either an external inhomogeneous
magnetic field or the intrinsic spin-orbit coupling. We show that the presence of valleys makes
it possible to have much broader (in terms of interdot detuning) level anti-crossings compared
to typical anti-crossings in, for example, a GaAs double dot, and such broad anti-crossings lead
to amplification of spin flip errors. Lastly, we design a pulse sequence to suppress various possible
spin flip errors by taking advantage of the multiple level anti-crossings in a silicon double dot
and employing Landau-Zener transitions.
