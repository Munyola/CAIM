Isolated quantum many-body systems with integrable dynamics do not thermalize starting from generic
initial states. As one perturbs such systems away from the integrable point, thermalization sets
in, but the nature of the crossover from integrable to thermalizing behavior is an unresolved and
actively discussed question. We explore this question using a dipolar quantum Newton's cradle
consisting of highly magnetic dysprosium atoms. The magnetic dipole-dipole interaction provides
tunability of both the strength of the integrability-breaking perturbation and the nature of the
near-integrable dynamics. We find that the momentum distribution of the atoms has two evolution
regimes: fast dephasing followed by near-exponential thermalization. We do not observe the intermediate-time
prethermal "plateaux" that have been numerically detected when perturbing a noninteracting system.
Ab initio simulations on a dipolar lattice model yield a similar two-timescale decay, suggesting
that the absence of prethermalization plateaux and the two-timescale decay are generic properties
of strongly interacting near-integrable models. Moreover, the measured thermalization rate
is consistent with a parameter-free theoretical estimate, based on identifying the types of collisions
that dominate thermalization. By providing tunability between regimes of integrable and quantum
chaotic dynamics, our work sheds light both on the mechanisms by which isolated quantum many-body
systems thermalize, and on the temporal structure of the onset of thermalization.
