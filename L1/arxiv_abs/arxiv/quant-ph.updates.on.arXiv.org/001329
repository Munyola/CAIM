Motivated by recent studies of quantum computational complexity in quantum field theory and holography,
we discuss how weighting certain classes of gates building up a quantum circuit more heavily than
others does affect the complexity. Utilizing Nielsen's geometric approach to circuit complexity,
we investigate the effects for a regulated field theory for which the optimal circuit is a representation
of $GL(N,\mathbb{R})$. More precisely, we work out how a uniformly chosen weighting factor acting
on the entangling gates affects the complexity and, particularly, its divergent behavior. We show
that assigning a higher cost to the entangling gates increases the complexity. Employing the penalized
and the unpenalized complexities for the $\mathcal{F}_{\kappa=2}$ cost, we further find an interesting
relation between the latter and the one based on the unpenalized $\mathcal{F}_{\kappa=1}$ cost.
In addition, we exhibit how imposing such penalties modifies the leading order UV divergence in
the complexity. We show that appropriately tuning the gate weighting eliminates the additional
logarithmic factor, thus, resulting in a simple power law scaling. We also compare the circuit complexity
with holographic predictions, specifically, based on the complexity=action conjecture, and
relate the weighting factor to certain bulk quantities. Finally, we comment on certain expectations
concerning the role of gate penalties in defining complexity in field theory and also speculate
on possible implications for holography.
