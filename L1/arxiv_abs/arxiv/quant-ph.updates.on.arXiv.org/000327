The Lieb-Schultz-Mattis theorem and its higher dimensional generalizations by Oshikawa and Hastings
require that translationally invariant 2D spin systems with a half-integer spin per unit cell must
either have a continuum of low energy excitations, spontaneously break some symmetries, or exhibit
topological order with anyonic excitations. We establish a connection between these constraints
and a remarkably similar set of constraints at the surface of a 3D interacting topological insulator.
This, combined with recent work on symmetry-enriched topological phases (SETs) with on-site unitary
symmetries, enables us to develop a framework for understanding the structure of SETs with both
translational and on-site unitary symmetries, including the effective theory of symmetry defects.
This framework places stringent constraints on the possible types of symmetry fractionalization
that can occur in 2D systems whose unit cell contains fractional spin, fractional charge, or a projective
representation of the symmetry group. As a concrete application, we determine when a topological
phase must possess a "spinon" excitation, even in cases when spin rotational invariance is broken
down to a discrete subgroup by the crystal structure. We also describe the phenomena of "anyonic
spin-orbit coupling", which may arise from the interplay of translational and on-site symmetries.
These include the possibility of on-site symmetry defect branch lines carrying topological charge
per unit length and lattice dislocations inducing on-site symmetry protected degeneracies.
