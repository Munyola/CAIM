We investigate and map out the non-equilibrium phase diagram of a generalization of the well known
Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper (AAH) model. This generalized AAH (GAAH) model is known to have a single-particle
mobility edge which also has an additional self-dual property akin to that of the critical point
of AAH model. By calculating the imbalance, we get hints of a rich phase diagram. We find a fascinating
connection between single particle wavefunctions near the mobility edge of GAAH model and the wavefunctions
of the critical AAH model. As a result, the critical point of the AAH model now generalizes to a `critical'
line separating regions of ballistic and localized transport, as evidenced by closed system transport
properties like spread of wavepacket. Like critical point of AAH model, closed system transport
is `non-Gaussian but diffusive' on the `critical' line. Futher, by placing this model far-from-equilibrium
with the aid of two baths, we investigate the open system transport via system size scaling of non-equilibrium
steady state (NESS) current calculated by fully exact non-equilibrium Green's function (NEGF)
method. We find sub-diffusive scaling of NESS current with system-size ($I\sim N^{-2\pm0.1}$)
on the `critical' line. Remarkably, the scaling exponent on this line is distinctly different from
that obtained at the critical point of the conventional AAH model (where $I\sim N^{-1.4\pm0.05}$).
A very interesting high temperature non-equilibrium phase diagram of the GAAH model emerges from
our calculations.
