Periodically driven parametric oscillators offer a convenient way to simulate classical Ising
spins. When many parametric oscillators are coupled dissipatively, they can be analogous to networks
of Ising spins, forming an effective coherent Ising machine (CIM) that efficiently solves computationally
hard optimization problems. In the companion paper, we studied experimentally the minimal realization
of a CIM, i.e. two coupled parametric oscillators [L. Bello, M. Calvanese Strinati, E. G. Dalla Torre,
and A. Pe'er, Phys. Rev. Lett. 123, 083901 (2019)]. We found that the presence of an energy-conserving
coupling between the oscillators can dramatically change the dynamics, leading to everlasting
beats, which transcend the Ising description. Here, we analyze this effect theoretically by solving
numerically and, when possible, analytically the equations of motion of two parametric oscillators.
Our main tools include: (i) a Floquet analysis of the linear equations, (ii) a multi-scale analysis
based on a separation of time scales between the parametric oscillations and the beats, and (iii)
the numerical identification of limit cycles and attractors. Using these tools, we fully determine
the phase boundaries and critical exponents of the model, as a function of the intensity and the phase
of the coupling and of the pump. Our study highlights the universal character of the phase diagram
and its independence on the specific type of nonlinearity present in the system. Furthermore, we
identify new phases of the model with more than two attractors, possibly describing a larger spin
algebra.
