High-frequency gating InGaAs/InP single-photon detectors (SPDs) are widely used for applications
requiring single-photon detection in the near-infrared region such as quantum key distribution.
Reducing SPD size is highly desired for practical use, which is favorable to the implementation
of further system integration. Here we present, to the best of our knowledge, the most compact high-frequency
sine wave gating (SWG) InGaAs/InP SPD. We design and fabricate an InGaAs/InP single-photon avalanche
diode (SPAD) with optimized semiconductor structure, and then encapsulate the SPAD chip and a mini-thermoelectric
cooler inside a butterfly package with a size of 12.5 mm $\times$ 22 mm $\times$ 10 mm. Moreover, we
implement a monolithic readout circuit for the SWG SPD in order to replace the quenching electronics
that is previously designed with board-level integration. Finally, the components of SPAD, monolithic
readout circuit and the affiliated circuits are integrated into a single module with a size of 13
cm $\times$ 8 cm $\times$ 4 cm. Compared with the 1.25 GHz SWG InGaAs/InP SPD module (25 cm $\times$
10 cm $\times$ 33 cm) designed in 2012, the volume of our miniaturized SPD is reduced by 95\%. After
the characterization, the SPD exhibits excellent performance with a photon detection efficiency
of 30\%, a dark count rate of 2.0 kcps and an afterpulse probability of 8.8\% under the conditions
of 1.25 GHz gating rate, 100 ns hold-off time and 243 K. Also, we perform the stability test over one
week, and the results show the high reliability of the miniaturized SPD module.
