The shot-noise unit in continuous-variable quantum key distribution plays an important and fundamental
role in experimental implementation as it is used as a normalization parameter that contribute
to perform security analysis and distill the key information. However, the traditional calibration
procedure and detector model can not cover all system noise in practical application, which will
result in some loopholes and influence the practical security. What's more, the traditional procedure
is also rather complicated and has difficulty in compatible with automatic operating system. In
this paper we propose a calibration model based on the proposed trusted detector model, which could
naturally close the loopholes in practical application. It can help identify the shot-noise unit
in only one step, which can not only effectively simplify the evaluation process but also reduce
the statistical fluctuation, while two steps are needed in traditional method. We prove its feasibility
and derive the complete version of the corresponding entanglement-based model. Detailed security
analysis against arbitrary collective attacks and numerous simulation results in both the asymptotic
limit regime and the finite-size regime are provided. A proof-of-principle experiment has been
implemented and the results indicate that the one-time-calibration model can be employed as a powerful
substitution to calibrate the shot-noise unit. Our method paves the way for the deployment of continuous-variable
quantum key distribution with real time calibration and automatic operation.
