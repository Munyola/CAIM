We study the generation of propagation invariant photons with orbital angular momentum by spontaneous
parametric down conversion (SPDC) using a Bessel-Gauss pump beam. The angular and conditional
angular spectra are calculated for an uniaxial crystal optimized for type I SPDC with standard Gaussian
pump beams. It is shown that, as the mean value of the magnitude of the transverse wave vector of the
pump beam increases, the emission cone is deformed into two non coaxial cones that touch each other
along a line determined by the orientation of the optical axis of the nonlinear crystal. At this location,
the conditional spectrum becomes maximal for a pair of photons, one of which is best described by
a Gaussian-like photon with a very small transverse wave vector, and the othera Bessel-Gauss photon
with a distribution of transverse wave vectors similar in amplitude to that of the incident pump
beam. A detailed analysis is then performed of the angular momentum content of SPDC photons by the
evaluation of the corresponding transition amplitudes. As a result, we obtain conditions for the
generation of heralded single photons which are approximately propagation invariant and have
orbital angular momentum. A discussion is given about the difficulties in the interpretation of
the results in terms of conservation of optical orbital angular momentum along the vector normal
to the crystal surface. The angular spectra and the conditional angular spectra are successfully
compared with available experimental data recently reported in the literature.
