To formulate the universal constraints of quantum statistics data of generic long-range entangled
quantum systems, we introduce the geometric-topology surgery theory on spacetime manifolds where
quantum systems reside, cutting and gluing the associated quantum amplitudes, specifically in
2+1 and 3+1 spacetime dimensions. First, we introduce the fusion data for worldline and worldsheet
operators capable of creating anyonic excitations of particles and strings, well-defined in gapped
states of matter with intrinsic topological orders. Second, we introduce the braiding statistics
data of particles and strings, such as the geometric Berry matrices for particle-string Aharonov-Bohm,
3-string, 4-string, or multi-string adiabatic loop braiding process, encoded by submanifold
linkings, in the closed spacetime 3-manifolds and 4-manifolds. Third, we derive new `quantum surgery'
formulas and constraints, analogous to Verlinde formula associating fusion and braiding statistics
data via spacetime surgery, essential for defining the theory of topological orders, 3d and 4d TQFTs
and potentially correlated to bootstrap boundary physics such as gapless modes, extended defects,
2d and 3d conformal field theories or quantum anomalies. This article is meant to be an extended and
further detailed elaboration of our previous work [arXiv:1602.05951] and Chapter 6 of [arXiv:1602.05569].
Our theory applies to general quantum theories and quantum mechanical systems, also applicable
to, but not necessarily requiring the quantum field theory description.
