Simulating quantum circuits classically is an important area of research in quantum information,
with applications in computational complexity and validation of quantum devices. One of the state-of-the-art
simulators, that of Bravyi et al, utilizes a randomized sparsification technique to approximate
the output state of a quantum circuit by a stabilizer sum with a reduced number of terms. In this paper,
we describe an improved Monte Carlo algorithm for performing randomized sparsification. This
algorithm reduces the runtime of computing the approximate state by the factor $\ell/m$, where
$\ell$ and $m$ are respectively the total and non-Clifford gate counts. The main technique is a circuit
recompilation routine based on manipulating exponentiated Pauli operators. The recompilation
routine also facilitates numerical search for Clifford decompositions of products of gates, which
can further reduce the runtime in certain cases. It may additionally lead to a framework for optimizing
circuit implementations over a gate set, reducing the overhead for state-injection in fault-tolerant
implementations. We provide a concise exposition of randomized sparsification, and describe
how to use it to estimate circuit amplitudes in a way which can be generalized to a broader class of
gates and states. This latter method can be used to obtain additive error estimates of circuit probabilities
with a faster runtime than the full techniques of Bravyi et al. Such estimates are useful for validating
near-term quantum devices provided that the target probability is not exponentially small.
