This chapter provides a comprehensive overview of the Bohmian formulation of quantum mechanics.
It starts with a historical review of the difficulties found by Louis de Broglie, David Bohm, and
John S. Bell to convince the scientific community about the validity and utility of Bohmian mechanics.
Then, a formal explanation of Bohmian mechanics for nonrelativistic, single-particle quantum
systems is presented. The generalization to many-particle systems, where the exchange interaction
and the spin play an important role, is also presented. After that, the measurement process in Bohmian
mechanics is discussed. It is emphasized that Bohmian mechanics exactly reproduces the mean value
and temporal and spatial correlations obtained from the standard, that is the Copenhagen or orthodox,
formulation. The ontological characteristics of Bohmian mechanics provide a description of measurements
as another type of interaction without the need for introducing the wave function collapse. Several
solved problems are presented at the end of the chapter, giving additional mathematical support
to some particular issues. A detailed description of computational algorithms to obtain Bohmian
trajectories from the numerical solution of the Schrodinger or the Hamilton-Jacobi equations
are presented in an appendix. The motivation of this chapter is twofold: first, as a didactic introduction
to Bohmian formalism, which is used in the subsequent chapters, and second, as a self-contained
summary for any newcomer interested in using Bohmian mechanics in his or her daily research activity.
