A conceptual variable is any variable defined by a person or by a group of persons. Such variables
may be inaccessible, meaning that they cannot be measured with arbitrary accuracy on the physical
system under consideration at any given time. An example may be the spin vector of a particle; another
example may be the vector (position, momentum). In this paper, a space of inaccessible conceptual
variables is defined, and group actions are defined on this space. Accessible functions are then
defined on the same space. Assuming this structure, the basic Hilbert space structure of quantum
theory is derived: Operators on a Hilbert space corresponding to the accessible variables are introduced;
when these operators have a discrete spectrum, a natural model reduction implies a new model in which
the values of the accessible variables are the eigenvalues of the operator. The principle behind
this model reduction demands that a group action may also be defined also on the accessible variables;
this is possible if the corresponding functions are permissible, a term that is precisely defined.
The following recent principle from statistics is assumed: every model reduction should be to an
orbit or to a set of orbits of the group. From this derivation, a new interpretation of quantum theory
is briefly discussed: I argue that a state vector may be interpreted as connected to a focused question
posed to nature together with a definite answer to this question. Further discussion of these topics
is provided in a recent book published by the author of this paper.
