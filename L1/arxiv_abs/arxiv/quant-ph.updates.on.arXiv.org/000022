This is the fourth in a series of papers on developing a formulation of quantum mechanics in non-inertial
reference frames. This formulation is grounded in a class of unitary cocycle representations of
what we have called the Galilean line group, the generalization of the Galilei group to include transformations
amongst non-inertial reference frames. These representations show that in quantum mechanics,
just as the case in classical mechanics, the transformations to accelerating reference frames
give rise to fictitious forces. In previous work, we have shown that there exist representations
of the Galilean line group that uphold the non-relativistic equivalence principle as well as representations
that violate the equivalence principle. In these previous studies, the focus was on linear accelerations.
In this paper, we undertake an extension of the formulation to include rotational accelarations.
We show that the incorporation of rotational accelerations requires a class of \emph{loop prolongations}
of the Galilean line group and their unitary cocycle representations. We recover the centrifugal
and Coriolis force effects from these loop representations. Loops are more general than groups
in that their multiplication law need not be associative. Hence, our broad theoretical claim is
that a Galilean quantum theory that holds in arbitrary non-inertial reference frames requires
going beyond groups and group representations, the well-stablished framework for implementing
symmetry transformations in quantum mechanics.
