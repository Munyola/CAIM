Most scholars concerned with the foundations of quantum mechanics (QM) think that contextuality
and nonlocality (hence nonobjectivity of physical properties) are unavoidable features of QM
which follow from the mathematical apparatus of QM. Moreover these features are usually considered
as basic in quantum information processing. Nevertheless they raise still unsolved problems,
as the objectification problem in the quantum theory of measurement. The extended semantic realism
(ESR) model offers a possible way out from these difficulties by embedding the mathematical formalism
of QM into a broader mathematical formalism and reinterpreting quantum probabilities as conditional
on detection rather than absolute. The embedding allows to recover the formal apparatus of QM within
the ESR model, and the reinterpretation of QM allows to construct a noncontextual hidden variables
theory which justifies the assumptions introduced in the ESR model and proves its objectivity.
According to the ESR model both linear and nonlinear time evolution occur, depending on the physical
environment, as in QM. In addition, the ESR model, though objective, implies modified Bell's inequalities
that do not conflict with QM, supplies different mathematical representations of proper and improper
mixtures, provides a general framework in which the local interpretations of the GHZ experiment
obtained by other authors are recovered and explained, and supports an interpretation of quantum
logic which avoids the introduction of the problematic notion of quantum truth.
