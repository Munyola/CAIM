The relationship between position and momentum in quantum mechanics formally translates into
a Fourier transform between the position (configuration) and momentum representations of the
wave function. These two representations are usually introduced without a proper physical contextualization.
Here this issue is tackled by means of a simple and pedagogical analysis of the atomic three-grating
Mach-Zehnder interferometer. This analysis provides a clear picture of how both representations
intertwine as well as an easy way to understand the physics underpinning this type of interferometers.
Bearing in mind the physics of undergraduate courses, a simple working model of gratings consisting
of evenly-spaced Gaussian slits has been considered. This model allows to explore the physics involved
in these interferometers in a simple fashion combining both analytical results and numerical simulations.
A clear picture of the wavefront splitting process inside the interferometer is thus provided,
illustrating how the momentum is well defined along each diffraction order in spite of the complexity
exhibited by the diffracted wave in configuration space. This is a key point to understand the simplified
models commonly used in the literature to describe this type of interferometers, where the particular
shape of the wave function is neglected and only the momentum carried along the relevant diffraction
orders is considered. For completeness, the role of the third grating in the measure of transmitted
atomic flux is also analyzed and discussed.
