In recent years, exploring the possible use of separable states as resource for achieving quantum
information processing(QIP) tasks has been gaining increasing significance. In this context,
a particularly important demonstration has been that non-vanishing discord is the necessary condition
for the separable states to be used as resource for remotely preparing any arbitrary pure target
state [Nature Physics $8$, $666$ $(2012)$]. The present work stems from our observation that not
only resource states with same discord can imply different efficiencies (in terms of average fidelity)
of the remote state preparation (RSP) protocol, but also states with higher discord can imply lower
RSP efficiency. This, therefore, necessitates identification of the relevant feature of quantum
correlations which can appropriately quantify effectiveness of the resource state for the RSP
protocol. To this end, for the two-qubit Bell-diagonal states, we show that an appropriate measure
of simultaneous correlations in three mutually unbiased bases can serve to quantify usefulness
of the resource for the RSP task using entangled as well as separable states, including non-discordant
states as resource. In particular, it is revealed that zero-discord states having such non-vanishing
measure can be useful for remotely preparing a subset of pure target states. Thus, this work shows
that, using separable states, an effective resource for QIP tasks such as RSP can be provided by simultaneous
correlations in mutually unbiased bases.
