Quantum decoherence is generally recognized as responsible for the emergence of a definite outcome
from a quantum measurement. Decoherence is realized by the interaction of the measuring apparatus
with a large number of degrees of freedom of an environment. In [E.A. Galapon {\it EPL} {\bf 113} 60007
(2016)], a measurement model is found to have the feature of inducing exact decoherence at a finite
time via one internal degree of freedom of the apparatus provided that the apparatus is decomposed
into a pointer and an inaccessible probe, with the pointer and the probe being in momentum-limited
initial states. However, an issue can be raised against the model: while the factorization method
of the time evolution operator used there is formally correct, it is not completely rigorous due
to some unstated conditions on the validity of the factorization in the Hilbert space of the model.
Furthermore, no examples were presented there in implementing the measurement scheme in specific
quantum systems. The goal of this paper is to re-examine the model and confirm its features independently
by solving the von Neumann equation for the joint state of the composite system as a function of time.
This approach reproduces the joint state obtained in the original work, leading to the same conditions
for exact decoherence and orthogonal pointer states when the required initial conditions on the
probe and pointer are imposed. Using the scheme, we illustrate the exact decoherence process and
its effects on the measurement of observables of a spin-1/2 particle and a quantum harmonic oscillator.
