Entanglement--one of the most delicate phenomena in nature--is an essential resource for quantum
information applications. Large entangled states have been theoretically shown to allow universal
quantum computation, with a model based on single-qubit measurements of a cluster state being particularly
amenable to an implementation with photons. Useful large-scale quantum devices must be able to
generate and control qubit entanglement on-chip, where quantum information is naturally encoded
in the photonic path degree of freedom. Here we report a silicon photonic chip which integrates resonant-enhanced
sources, filters, and reconfigurable optics to generate a path-entangled two-qubit state--the
smallest non-trivial cluster state--and to coherently analyse its entanglement on-chip. We show
that two ring-resonator-based spontaneous four-wave mixing (SFWM) sources can be made highly
indistinguishable, despite their well-documented nonlinear dynamics, and we show the first evidence
that their frequency correlations are small, as predicted. We use quantum state tomography, and
the strict Bell-CHSH inequality violation to quantify the entanglement present in the device,
and use that entanglement as an indicator of device performance. We find a 91+/-1% overlap with a
maximally entangled state, and a Bell-CHSH violation of 2.69+/-0.03, demonstrating a very high
level of entanglement. Our quantum photonic device is the most functionally complex ever: it integrates
components which will be invaluable for building devices and systems to harness quantum entanglement
on the large scale.
