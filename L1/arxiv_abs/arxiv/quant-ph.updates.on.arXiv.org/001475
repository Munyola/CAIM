The evaluation of expectation values $Tr\left[\rho O\right]$ for some pure state $\rho$ and Hermitian
operator $O$ is of central importance in a variety of quantum algorithms. Near optimal techniques
developed in the past require a number of measurements $N$ approaching the Heisenberg limit $N=\mathcal{O}\left(1/\epsilon\right)$
as a function of target accuracy $\epsilon$. The use of Quantum Phase Estimation requires however
long circuit depths $C=\mathcal{O}\left(1/\epsilon\right)$ making their implementation difficult
on near term noisy devices. The more direct strategy of Operator Averaging is usually preferred
as it can be performed using $N=\mathcal{O}\left(1/\epsilon^2\right)$ measurements and no additional
gates besides those needed for the state preparation. In this work we use a simple but realistic model
to describe the bound state of a neutron and a proton (the deuteron) and show that the latter strategy
can require an overly large number of measurement in order to achieve a reasonably small relative
target accuracy $\epsilon_r$. We propose to overcome this problem using a single step of QPE and
classical post-processing. This approach leads to a circuit depth $C=\mathcal{O}\left(\epsilon^\mu\right)$
(with $\mu\geq0$) and to a number of measurements $N=\mathcal{O}\left(1/\epsilon^{2+\nu}\right)$
for $0<\nu\leq1$. We provide detailed descriptions of two implementations of our strategy for
$\nu=1$ and $\nu\approx0.5$ and derive appropriate conditions that a particular problem instance
has to satisfy in order for our method to provide an advantage.
