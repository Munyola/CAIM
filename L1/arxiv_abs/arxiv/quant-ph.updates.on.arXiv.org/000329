In contrast to a projective quantum measurement in which the system is projected onto an eigenstate
of the measured operator, in a weak measurement the system is only weakly perturbed while only partial
information on the measured observable is obtained. A full description of such measurement should
describe the measurement protocol and provide an explicit form of the measurement operator that
transform the quantum state to its post measurement form. A simultaneous measurement of non-commuting
observables cannot be projective, however the strongest possible such measurement can be defined
as providing their values at the smallest uncertainty limit. Starting with the Arthurs and Kelly
(AK) protocol for such measurement of position and momentum, we derive a systematic extension to
a corresponding weak measurement along three steps: First, a plausible form of the weak measurement
operator analogous to the Gaussian Kraus operator often used to model a weak measurement of a single
observable is obtained by projecting a na\"ive extension (valid for commuting observable) onto
the corresponding Gabor space. Second, we show that the so obtained set of measurement operators
satisfies the normalization condition for the probability to obtain given values of the position
and momentum in the weak measurement operation, namely that this set constitutes a positive operator
valued measure (POVM) in the position-momentum space. Finally, we show that the so-obtained measurement
operator corresponds to a generalization of the AK measurement protocol in which the initial detector
wavefunctions is suitable broadened.
