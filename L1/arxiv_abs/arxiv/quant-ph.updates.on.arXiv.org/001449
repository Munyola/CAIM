Topological quantum error-correcting codes are a promising candidate for building fault-tolerant
quantum computers. Decoding topological codes optimally, however, is known to be a computationally
hard problem. Various decoders have been proposed that achieve approximately optimal error thresholds.
Due to practical constraints, it is not known if there exists an obvious choice for a decoder. In this
paper, we introduce a framework which can combine arbitrary decoders for any given code to significantly
reduce the logical error rates. We rely on the crucial observation that two different decoding techniques,
while possibly having similar logical error rates, can perform differently on the same error syndrome.
We use machine learning techniques to assign a given error syndrome to the decoder which is likely
to decode it correctly. We apply our framework to an ensemble of Minimum-Weight Perfect Matching
(MWPM) and Hard-Decision Re-normalization Group (HDRG) decoders for the surface code in the depolarizing
noise model. Our simulations show an improvement of 38.4%, 14.6%, and 7.1% over the pseudo-threshold
of MWPM in the instance of distance 5, 7, and 9 codes, respectively. Lastly, we discuss the advantages
and limitations of our framework and applicability to other error-correcting codes. Our framework
can provide a significant boost to error correction by combining the strengths of various decoders.
In particular, it may allow for combining very fast decoders with moderate error-correcting capability
to create a very fast ensemble decoder with high error-correcting capability.
