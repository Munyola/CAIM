Kauffman and Lomonaco explored the idea of understanding quantum entanglement (the non-local
correlation of certain properties of particles) topologically by viewing unitary entangling
operators as braiding operators. In the work of G. Alagic, M. Jarret, and S. Jordan it is shown that
entanglement is a necessary condition for forming invariants of knots from braid closures via solutions
to the Yang-Baxter Equation. We show that the arguments used by these authors generalize to essentially
the same results for quantum invariant state summation models of knots. We also given an example
of an SU(2) representation of the three-strand braid group that models the Jones polynomial for
closures of three-strand braids. This invariant is a quantum model for the Jones polynomial restricted
to three strand braids, and it does not involve quantum entanglement. These relationships between
topological braiding and quantum entanglement can be used as a framework for future work in understanding
the properties of entangling gates in topological quantum computing.The paper ends with a discussion
of the Aravind hypothesis about the direct relationship of knots and quantum entanglement, and
the ER = EPR hypothesis about the relationship of quantum entanglement with the connectivity of
space. We describe how, given a background space and a quantum tensor network, to construct a new
topological space, that welds the network and the background space together. This construction
embodies the principle that quantum entanglement and topological connectivity are intimately
related.
