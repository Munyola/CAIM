Physical laws for elementary particles can be described by the quantum dynamics equation given
a Hamiltonian. The solution are probability amplitudes in Hilbert space that evolve over time.
A probability density function over position and time is given as the magnitude square of such probability
amplitude. An entropy can be associated with these probability densities characterizing the position
information of a particle. Coherent states are localized wave packets and may describe the spatial
distribution for some particle states. We show that due to a dispersion property of Hamiltonians
in quantum physics, the entropy of coherent states increases over time. We investigate a partition
of the Hilbert space into four sets based on whether the entropy is (i) increasing but not constant,
(ii) decreasing but not constant, (iii) constant, (iv) oscillating. We then postulate that quantum
theory of elementary particles is equipped with a law that entropy (weakly) increases in time and
thus states in set (ii) are disallowed, and the states in set (iii) can not complete an oscillation
period. There is a key role of the conjugate process transforming states that are allowed into states
that are not, and vice-versa. Then, according to this law, quantum theory is not time reversible
unless the state is in the partition (iii), e.g., stationary states (eigentstates of the Hamiltonian).
This law in quantum theory limits physical scenarios beyond conservation laws, providing causality
reasoning by defining an arrow of time.
