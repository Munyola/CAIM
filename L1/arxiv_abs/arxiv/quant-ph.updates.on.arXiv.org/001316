Quantum computation promises applications that are thought to be impossible with classical computation.
To realize practical quantum computation, the following three properties will be necessary: universality,
scalability, and fault-tolerance. Universality is the ability to execute arbitrary multi-input
quantum algorithms. Scalability means that computational resources such as logical qubits can
be increased without requiring exponential increase in physical resources. Lastly, fault-tolerance
is the ability to perform quantum algorithms in presence of imperfections and noise. A promising
approach to scalability was demonstrated with the generation of one-million-mode 1-dimensional
cluster state, a resource for one-input computation in measurement-based quantum computation
(MBQC). The demonstration was based on time-domain multiplexing (TDM) approach using continuous-variable
(CV) optical flying qumodes (CV analogue of qubit). Demonstrating universality, however, has
been a challenging task for any physical system and approach. Here, we present, for the first time
among any physical system, experimental realization of a scalable resource state for universal
MBQC: a 2-dimensional cluster state. We also prove the universality and give the methodology for
utilizing this state in MBQC. Our state is based on TDM approach that allows unlimited resource generation
regardless of the coherence time of the system. As a demonstration of our method, we generate and
verify a 2-dimensional cluster state capable of about 5,000 operation steps on 5 inputs.
