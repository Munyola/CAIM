Gao (2017) presents a new mentalistic reformulation of the well-known measurement problem affecting
the standard formulation of quantum mechanics. According to this author, it is essentially a determinate-experience
problem, namely a problem about the compatibility between the linearity of the Schroedinger's
equation, the fundamental law of quantum theory, and definite experiences perceived by conscious
observers. In this essay I aim to clarify (i) that the well-known measurement problem is a mathematical
consequence of quantum theory's formalism, and that (ii) its mentalistic variant does not grasp
the relevant causes which are responsible for this puzzling issue. The first part of this paper will
be concluded claiming that the "physical" formulation of the measurement problem cannot be reduced
to its mentalistic version. In the second part of this work it will be shown that, contrary to the case
of quantum mechanics, Bohmian mechanics and GRW theories provide clear explanations of the physical
processes responsible for the definite localization of macroscopic objects and, consequently,
for well-defined perceptions of measurement outcomes by conscious observers. More precisely,
the macro-objectification of states of experimental devices is obtained exclusively in virtue
of their clear ontologies and dynamical laws without any intervention of human observers. Hence,
it will be argued that in these theoretical frameworks the measurement problem and the determinate-experience
problem are logically distinct issues.
