Multipartite entanglement on very large scales is a crucial requirement for quantum information
processing (QIP), but no discrete variable proposals have been put forth for resonators. In this
theoretical work, we present a highly scalable black box scheme that accepts as input any microwave
resonator state with negligible occupation of number states $|0>$ and $|1>$, and nonlocally
superposes it across an arbitrarily large array of resonators. The resulting large-scale entanglement
is of the W-type, which is well-known for its robustness. The scheme employs a (quasi-)quantum phase
transition of the attractive Bose-Hubbard model to generate the multipartite entanglement in
parallel, and is therefore deterministic and permits an increase in resonator number with no increase
in resources; the number of resonators is limited instead by system characteristics such as uniformity
of resonator frequencies and inter-resonator coupling strength. Only one local and two global
controls are required for the scheme. The scheme is made viable due to recent advances in superconducting
circuit technology. We numerically demonstrate the scheme using realistic system parameters,
and estimate that current capabilities can realize the scheme with greater than 100 resonators
on a timescale of about 100 nanoseconds. Because superconducting microwave resonators are capable
of exchanging quanta with qubits, mechanical resonators, and (potentially) optical fields, this
proposal provides a route toward large-scale W-type entanglement in those modes as well.
