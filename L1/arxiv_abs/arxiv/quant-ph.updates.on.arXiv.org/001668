Quantum imaging has a potential of enhancing precision of the object reconstruction by using quantum
correlations of the imaging field. This is especially important for imaging requiring low-intensity
fields up to the level of few-photons. However, quantum imaging generally leads to nonlinear estimation
problems. The complexity of these problems rapidly increases with the number of parameters describing
the object. We suggest a way to drastically reduce the complexity for a wide class of problems. The
key point of our approach is connecting the features of the Fisher information with the parametric
locality of the problem, and building the efficient iterative inference scheme reconstructing
only a subset of the whole set of parameters in each step. This iterative scheme is linear on the total
number of parameters. This scheme is applied to quantum near-field imaging, the inference procedure
is developed resulting in super-resolving reconstruction of grey compound transmission objects.
The functionality of the method is demonstrated with experimental data obtained by measurements
of higher-order correlation functions for imaging with entangled twin-photons and pseudo-thermal
light sources. By analyzing the informational content of the measurement, it becomes possible
to predict the existence of optimal photon correlations providing for the best image resolution
in the super-resolution regime. This prediction is experimentally confirmed. It is also shown
how an estimation bias stemming from image features may drastically improve the resolution.
