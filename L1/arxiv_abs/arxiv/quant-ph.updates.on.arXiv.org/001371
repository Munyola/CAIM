The Dicke model -- a paradigmatic example of superradiance in quantum optics -- describes an ensemble
of atoms which are collectively coupled to a leaky cavity mode. As a result of the cooperative nature
of these interactions, the system's dynamics are captured by the behavior of a single mean-field,
collective spin. In this mean-field limit, it has recently been shown that the interplay between
photon losses and periodic driving of light-matter coupling can lead to time-crystalline-like
behavior of the collective spin. In this work, we investigate whether such a Dicke time crystal is
stable to perturbations that explicitly break the mean-field solvability of the conventional
Dicke model. In particular, we consider the addition of short-range interactions between atoms,
which breaks the collective coupling and leads to complex many-body dynamics. In this context,
the interplay between periodic driving, dissipation and interactions yields a rich set of dynamical
responses including long-lived and metastable Dicke time crystals, where losses can cool down
the many-body heating resulting from the continuous pump of energy from the periodic drive. Specifically,
when the additional short-range interactions are ferromagnetic, we observe time crystalline
behavior at non-perturbative values of the coupling strength, suggesting the possible existence
of stable dynamical order in a driven-dissipative quantum many-body system. These findings illustrate
the rich nature of novel dynamical responses with many-body character in quantum optics platforms.
