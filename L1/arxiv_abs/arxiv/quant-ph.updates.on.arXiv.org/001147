We give asymptotically converging semidefinite programming hierarchies of outer bounds on bilinear
programs of the form $\mathrm{Tr}\big[M(X\otimes Y)\big]$, maximized with respect to semidefinite
constraints on $X$ and $Y$. Applied to the problem of quantum error correction this gives hierarchies
of efficiently computable outer bounds on the optimal fidelity for any message dimension and error
model. The first level of our hierarchies corresponds to the non-signalling assisted fidelity
previously studied by [Leung & Matthews, IEEE Trans.~Inf.~Theory 2015], and positive partial
transpose constraints can be added and used to give a sufficient criterion for the exact convergence
at a given level of the hierarchy. To quantify the worst case convergence speed of our hierarchies,
we derive novel quantum de Finetti theorems that allow imposing linear constraints on the approximating
state. In particular, we give finite de Finetti theorems for quantum channels, quantifying closeness
to the convex hull of product channels as well as closeness to local operations and classical forward
communication assisted channels. As a special case this constitutes a finite version of Fuchs-Schack-Scudo's
asymptotic de Finetti theorem for quantum channels. Finally, our proof methods also allow us to
answer an open question from [Brand\~ao & Harrow, STOC 2013] by improving the approximation factor
of de Finetti theorems with no symmetry from $O(d^{k/2})$ to $\mathrm{poly}(d,k)$, where $d$ denotes
local dimension and $k$ the number of copies.
