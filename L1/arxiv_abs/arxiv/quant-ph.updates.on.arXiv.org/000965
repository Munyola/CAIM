in Phys. Rev. D, (Part A of this paper) pointed out that vacuum energy fluctuations implied mass fluctuations
which implied curvature fluctuations which then implied fluctuations of the metric tensor. The
metric fluctuations were then taken as fundamental and a stochastic space-time was theorized.
A number of results from quantum mechanics were derived. This paper (Part B), in addressing some
of the difficulties of Part A, required an extension of the model: In so far as the fluctuations are
not \emph{in} space-time but \emph{of} space-time, a granular model was deemed necessary. For
Lorentz invariance, the grains have constant 4-volume. Further, as we wish to treat time and space
similarly, we propose fluctuations in time. In order that a particle not appear at different points
in space at the same time, we find it necessary to introduce a new model for time where time as we know
it is emergent from an analogous coordinate, tau-time, where 'Tau-Time Leaves No Tracks' (that
is to say, in the sub-quantum domain, there is no 'history'). The model provides a 'meaning' of curvature
as well as a (loose) derivation of the Schwartzschild metric without need for the General Relativity
field equations. The purpose is to fold the seemingly incomprehensible behaviors of quantum mechanics
into the (one hopes) less incomprehensible properties of space-time. \end{document
