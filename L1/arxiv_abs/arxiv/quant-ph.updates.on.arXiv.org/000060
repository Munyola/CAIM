Based on the instantaneous nonlocal quantum computation (INQC), Buhrman et al. proposed an excellent
attack strategy to quantum position verification (QPV) protocols in 2011, and showed that, if the
colluding adversaries are allowed to previously share unlimited entangled states, it is impossible
to design an unconditionally secure QPV protocol in the previous model. Here, trying to overcome
this no-go theorem, we find some assumptions in the INQC attack, which are implicit but essential
for the success of this attack, and present three different QPV protocols where these assumptions
are not satisfied. We show that for the general adversaries, who execute the attack operations at
every common time slot or the time when they detect the arrival of the challenge signals from the verifiers,
secure QPV is achievable. This implies practically secure QPV can be obtained even if the adversaries
is allowed to share unlimited entanglement previously. Here by "practically" we mean that in a successful
attack the adversaries need launch a new round of attack on the coming qubits with extremely high
frequency so that none of the possible qubits, which may be sent at random time, will be missed. On
the other side, using such Superdense INQC (SINQC) attack, the adversaries can still attack the
proposed protocols successfully in theory. The particular attack strategies to our protocols
are presented respectively. On this basis, we demonstrate the impossibility of secure QPV with
looser assumptions, i.e. the enhanced no-go theorem for QPV.
