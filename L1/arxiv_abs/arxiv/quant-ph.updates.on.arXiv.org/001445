We study theoretically the interaction between two photons in a nonlinear cavity. The photons are
loaded into the cavity via a method we propose here, in which the input/output coupling of the cavity
is effectively controlled via a tunable coupling to a second cavity mode that is itself strongly
output-coupled. Incoming photon wave packets can be loaded into the cavity with high fidelity when
the timescale of the control is smaller than the duration of the wave packets. Dynamically coupled
cavities can be used to avoid limitations in the photon-photon interaction time set by the delay-bandwidth
product of passive cavities. Additionally, they enable the elimination of wave packet distortions
caused by dispersive cavity transmission and reflection. We consider three kinds of nonlinearities,
those arising from $\chi^{\scriptscriptstyle(2)}$ and $\chi^{\scriptscriptstyle(3)}$ materials
and that due to an interaction with a two-level emitter. To analyze the input and output of few-photon
wave packets we use a Schr\"odinger-picture formalism in which travelling-wave fields are discretized
into infinitesimal time-bins. We suggest that dynamically coupled cavities provide a very useful
tool for improving the performance of quantum devices relying on cavity-enhanced light-matter
interactions such as single-photon sources and atom-like quantum memories with photon interfaces.
As an example, we present simulation results showing that high fidelity two-qubit entangling gates
may be constructed using any of the considered nonlinear interactions.
