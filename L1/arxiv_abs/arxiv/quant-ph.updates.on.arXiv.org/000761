We investigate the influence of the incidence conditions on the transverse length of the surface
area that is coherently illuminated by the atomic beam, after passing through a given collimating
aperture. Such a transverse coherence length controls the general features of the interference
structures of FAD distributions. In our model, the coherence length, derived from the Van Cittert-Zernike
theorem, is used to build the initial coherent wave packet within the Surface Initial Value Representation
(SIVR) approximation. In this version of the SIVR approach we also include the contribution coming
from different positions of the focus point of the beam, which gives rise to the spot-beam effect.
The method is applied to fast He and Ne atoms colliding grazingly with a LiF(001) surface along low-indexed
crystallographic directions. We found that by varying the impact energy, while keeping the same
collimating setup and normal energy, we would be able to control the interference mechanism that
prevails in FAD patterns, switching between inter-channel and intra-channel interferences.
The energy range for each mechanism depends also on the incidence channel and the projectile mass.
On the other hand, when a region narrower than a single crystallographic channel is coherently lighted
by the beam, the spot-beam contribution affects the visibility of the interference patterns, resulting
crucial to the proper description of the projectile distributions. These focusing effects contribute
to the gradual quantum-classical transition of FAD spectra.
