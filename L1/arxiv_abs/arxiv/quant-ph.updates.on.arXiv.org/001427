In 1935, in a paper entitled "Can quantum-mechanical description of reality be considered complete?",
Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen (EPR) formulated an apparent paradox of quantum theory. They considered
two quantum systems that were initially allowed to interact, and were then later separated. A measurement
of a physical observable performed on one system then had to have an immediate effect on the conjugate
observable in the other system - even if the systems were causally disconnected! The authors viewed
this as a clear indication of the inconsistency of quantum mechanics. In the parton model of the nucleon
formulated by Bjorken, Feynman, and Gribov, the partons (quarks and gluons) are viewed by an external
hard probe as independent. The standard argument is that, inside the nucleon boosted to an infinite-momentum
frame, the parton probed by a virtual photon with virtuality Q is causally disconnected from the
rest of the nucleon during the hard interaction. Yet, the parton and the rest of the nucleon have to
form a colour-singlet state due to colour confinement, and so have to be in strongly correlated quantum
states - we thus encounter the EPR paradox at the sub-nucleonic scale. In this paper, we propose a
resolution of this paradox based on the quantum entanglement of partons. We devise an experimental
test of entanglement, and carry it out using data on proton-proton collisions from the Large Hadron
Collider (LHC). Our results provide a strong direct indication of quantum entanglement at sub-nucleonic
scales.
