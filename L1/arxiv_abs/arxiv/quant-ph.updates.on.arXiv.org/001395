Non-Abelian and non-adiabatic variants of Berry's geometric phase have been pivotal in the recent
advances in fault tolerant quantum computation gates, while Berry's phase itself is at the heart
of the study of topological phases of matter. The geometrical and topological properties of the
phase space of spin$-1$ quantum states is richer than that of spin$-1/2$ quantum states and is relatively
unexplored. For instance, the spin vector of a spin-1 system, unlike that of a spin$-1/2$ system,
can lie anywhere on or inside the Bloch sphere representing the phase space. Recently, a generalization
of Berry's phase that encapsulates the topology of spin-1 quantum states has been formulated in
J. Math. Phys., 59(6), 062105. This geometric phase includes loops that go inside the Bloch sphere
and is carried by the tensor of spin fluctuations, unlike Berry's phase which is carried by the global
phase of the quantum state. Furthermore, due to a mathematical singularity at the center of the Bloch
sphere, the class of loops that pass through the center are called singular loops and are significant
because their geometric phase is non-Abelian. In contrast with Berry's phase for spin$-1/2$ systems,
whose properties come from the topology of a sphere, the properties of singular loop geometric phases
come from the topology of the real projective plane $\mathbb{RP}^2$, which is more non-trivial.
Here we use coherent control of ultracold $^{87}$Rb atoms in an optical trap to experimentally explore
this geometric phase for singular loops in a spin-1 quantum system.
