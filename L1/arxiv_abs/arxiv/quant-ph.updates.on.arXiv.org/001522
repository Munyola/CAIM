Coherent noise can be much more damaging than incoherent (probabilistic) noise in the context of
quantum error correction. One solution is to use twirling to turn coherent noise into incoherent
Pauli channels. In this article, we argue that if twirling can improve the logical fidelity versus
a given noise model, we can always achieve an even higher logical fidelity by simply sandwiching
the noise with a chosen pair of Pauli gates, which we call Pauli conjugation. We devise a way to search
for the optimal Pauli conjugation scheme and apply it to Steane code, 9-qubit Shor code and distance-3
surface code under global coherent $Z$ noise. The optimal conjugation schemes show improvement
in logical fidelity over twirling while the weights of the conjugation gates we need to apply are
lower than the average weight of the twirling gates. In our example noise and codes, the concatenated
threshold obtained using conjugation is consistently higher than the twirling threshold and can
be up to 1.5 times higher than the original threshold where no mitigation is applied. Our simulations
show that Pauli conjugation can be robust against gate errors and its advantages over twirling persist
as we go to multiple rounds of quantum error correction. Pauli conjugation can be viewed as dynamical
decoupling applied to the context of quantum error correction, in which our objective changes from
maximising the physical fidelity to maximising the logical fidelity. The approach may be helpful
in adapting other noise tailoring techniques in the quantum control theory into quantum error correction.
