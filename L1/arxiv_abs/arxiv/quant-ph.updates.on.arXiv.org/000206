A remarkable feature of quantum theory is that particles with identical intrinsic properties must
be treated as indistinguishable if the theory is to give valid predictions. In the quantum formalism,
indistinguishability is expressed via the symmetrization postulate, which restricts a system
of identical particles to the set of symmetric states (`bosons') or the set of antisymmetric states
(`fermions'). However, the physical basis and range of validity of the symmetrization postulate
has not been established. A well-known topological derivation of the postulate implies that its
validity depends on the dimensionality of the space in which the particles move. However, this derivation
relies on the labeling of indistinguishable particles, a notion that cannot be justified on an informational
basis. Here we show that the symmetrization postulate can be derived by strictly adhering to the
informational requirement that particles which cannot be experimentally distinguished from
one another are not labeled. Our key novel postulate is the operational indistinguishability postulate,
which posits that the amplitude of a process involving several indistinguishable particles is
determined by the amplitudes of all possible transitions of these particles when treated as distinguishable.
The symmetrization postulate follows by requiring consistency with the rest of the quantum formalism.
The derivation implies that the symmetrization postulate admits no natural variants. In particular,
the possibility that identical particles generically exhibit anyonic behavior in two dimensions
is excluded.
