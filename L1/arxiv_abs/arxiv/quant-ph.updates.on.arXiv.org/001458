High-dimensional quantum systems are vital for quantum technologies and are essential in demonstrating
practical quantum advantage in quantum computing, simulation and sensing. Since dimensionality
grows exponentially with the number of qubits, the potential power of noisy intermediate-scale
quantum (NISQ) devices over classical resources also stems from entangled states in high dimensions.
An important family of quantum protocols that can take advantage of high-dimensional Hilbert space
are classification tasks. These include quantum machine learning algorithms, witnesses in quantum
information processing and certain decision problems. However, due to counter-intuitive geometrical
properties emergent in high dimensions, classification problems are vulnerable to adversarial
attacks. We demonstrate that the amount of perturbation needed for an adversary to induce a misclassification
scales inversely with dimensionality. This is shown to be a fundamental feature independent of
the details of the classification protocol. Furthermore, this leads to a trade-off between the
security of the classification algorithm against adversarial attacks and quantum advantages
we expect for high-dimensional problems. In fact, protection against these adversarial attacks
require extra resources that scale at least polynomially with the Hilbert space dimension of the
system, which can erase any significant quantum advantage that we might expect from a quantum protocol.
This has wide-ranging implications in the use of both near-term and future quantum technologies
for classification.
