The complete general fundamental theory of the dynamical hypergraphs whose all mathematical structures
are quantized, HoloQuantum Network Theory, is originally defined and formulated based upon a unique
system of nine principles. HoloQuantum Networks are the quantum states of a (0+1) dimensional purely-information-theoretic
quantum many body system, made of a complete set of the distinctively-interacting qubits of the
absences-or-presences, which formulate the most complete unitary evolutions of the most general
superpositions of the arbitrarily-structured hypergraphs. All the defining interactions and
the complete total Hamiltonian of the quantum many body system of HoloQuantum Network Theory are
uniquely obtained upon realizing the dynamical hypergraphical well-definedness by all the `cascade
operators', the quantum-hypergraphical isomorphisms, the U(1) symmetry for the global-phase
redundancies of the multi-qubit wavefunctions, the minimally broken symmetry of the qubits-equal-treatment,
a Wheelerian maximal-randomness, and the `covariant completeness'. By the axiomatic definition
and construction of the theory, HoloQuantum Networks are `all' the time-dependent purely-information-theoretic
wavefunctions, and mixed states, of every in-principle-realizable quantum many body system of
the arbitrarily-chosen quantum objects and their arbitrarily-chosen quantum relations. Being
so, we propose HoloQuantuam Network Theory as the most-fundamental most-complete form-invariant
`it-from-qubit' theory of `All Quantum Natures'.
