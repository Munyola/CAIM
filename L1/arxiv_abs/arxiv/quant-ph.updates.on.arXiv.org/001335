For a local Hamiltonian $H=\sum_i c_i A_i$, with $A_i$s being local operators, it is known that $H$
could be encoded in a single (non-degenerate) eigenstate $|\psi\rangle$ in certain cases. One
case is that the system satisfies the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH), where the local
reduced density matrix asymptotically become equal to the thermal reduced density matrix [PRX
\textbf{8}, 021026 (2018)]. In this case, one can reproduce $H$ (i.e. $c_i$s) from local measurement
results $\langle\psi|A_i|\psi\rangle=a_i$. Another case is that the two-point correlation
functions $\langle\psi|A_iA_j|\psi\rangle$ are known, one can reproduce $H$ without satisfying
ETH (arXiv: 1712.01850); however, in practice nonlocal correlation functions $\langle\psi|A_iA_j|\psi\rangle$
are not easy to obtain. In this work, we develop a method to determine $H$ (i.e., $c_i$s) with local
measurement results $a_i=\langle\psi|A_i|\psi\rangle$ and without the ETH assumption, by reformulating
the task as an unconstrained optimization problem of certain target function of $c_i$s, with only
polynomial number of parameters in terms of system size when $A_i$s are local operators. Our method
applies in general cases for the known form of $A_i$s, and is tested numerically for both randomly
generated $A_is$ and also the case when $A_i$s are local operators. Our result shed light on the fundamental
question of how a single eigenstate can encode the full system Hamiltonian, indicating a somewhat
surprising answer that only local measurements are enough without additional assumptions, for
generic cases.
