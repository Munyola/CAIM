We study the Maxwell-Dirac equations in a manifestly gauge invariant presentation using only the
spinor bilinear scalar and pseudoscalar densities, and the vector and pseudovector currents,
together with their quadratic Fierz relations. The internally produced vector potential is expressed
via algebraic manipulation of the Dirac equation, as a rational function of the Fierz bilinears
and first derivatives (valid on the support of the scalar density), which allows a gauge invariant
vector potential to be defined. This leads to a Fierz bilinear formulation of the Maxwell tensor
and of the Maxwell-Dirac equations, without any reference to gauge dependent quantities. We show
how demanding invariance of tensor fields under the action of a fixed (but arbitrary) Lie subgroup
of the Poincar\'e group leads to symmetry reduced equations. The procedure is illustrated, and
the reduced equations worked out explicitly for standard spherical and cylindrical cases, which
are coupled third order nonlinear PDEs. Spherical symmetry necessitates the existence of magnetic
monopoles, which do not affect the coupled Maxwell-Dirac system due to magnetic terms canceling.
In this paper we do not take up numerical computations. As a demonstration of the power of our approach,
we also work out the symmetry reduced equations for two distinct classes of dimension 4 one-parameter
families of Poincar\'e subgroups, one splitting and one non-splitting. The splitting class yields
no solutions, whereas for the non-splitting class we find a family of formal exact solutions in closed
form.
