Generation and manipulation of many-body entangled states is of considerable interest, for use
in quantum simulation and information processing. Measurement and verification of the resulting
many-body state presents a formidable challenge, however, which can be simplified by multiplexed
readout using shared measurement resources. In this work, we analyze and demonstrate state retrodiction
for a system of optomechanical oscillators coupled to a single-mode optical cavity. Coupling to
the shared cavity field facilitates simultaneous optical measurement of the oscillators' transient
dynamics, distinguished by their individual frequencies. Optimal estimators for the initial
oscillator states are defined by linear matched filters, derived from a detailed model for the detected
homodyne signal. The optimal state estimate for optomechanical retrodiction is obtained from
high-cooperativity measurements, overcoming loss to intrinsic thermal baths and providing estimate
sensitivity approaching the Standard Quantum Limit (SQL). Simultaneous estimation of the state
of multiple oscillators places additional limits on the estimate precision, due to the diffusive
noise each oscillator adds to the optomechanical signal. However, we show that the sensitivity
of simultaneous multi-mode state retrodiction reaches the SQL, for sufficiently well-resolved
oscillators. Finally, an experimental demonstration of two-mode retrodiction is presented,
which requires further accounting for technical fluctuations of the oscillator frequency.
