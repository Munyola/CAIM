Where does quantum advantage spring from? Such an investigation necessitates invoking an ontology
on which non-classical features of quantum theory are explored. One such non-classical ontic-feature
is preparation contextuality (PC) and advantage in oblivious communication tasks is its operational
signature. In this letter, we deal with quantum advantage in communication which has two prominent
manifestations, advantage in communication complexity (CC) and device independent information
processing based on violation of Bell inequalities. First, we demonstrate that quantum advantage
in one-way CC operationally reveals PC. Specifically, we construct oblivious communication tasks
tailored to one-way CC problems. The bound on classical success probability in the oblivious communication
tasks forms our preparation non-contextual inequalities. We use the same states along with their
orthogonal mixtures and measurements responsible for advantage in one-way CC problems to orchestrate
an advantageous protocol for the oblivious communication tasks and the violation of the associated
inequalities. Further, we find a criterion for unbounded violation of these inequalities and demonstrate
the same for two widely studied CC problems. Second, we prove that (spatial and temporal) Bell-inequality
violation implies an advantage in oblivious communication tasks, thereby revealing PC. Along
with the implications of this work, we discuss other known indications towards our assertion that
PC is the fundamental non-classical feature underlying quantum advantage.
