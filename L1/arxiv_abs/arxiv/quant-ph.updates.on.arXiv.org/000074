Most of what is considered as solid evidence of quantum non-locality is based on experimental violations
of the Clauser-Horne (CH) inequality (1974), under the no-enhancement assumption (i.e., a non-genuine
version). The role of this and other additional assumptions in Bell tests is not sufficiently acknowledged:
here we provide explicit examples of how a model of hidden local variables (LHV) defying no-enhancement
is able to produce a violation of such inequality ("enhancement" enables unfair sampling on the
non-genuine expression). Seeking for an accurate criteria on the physical significance of these
models, we demand compliance with the full set of quantum predictions for a given state and observables;
we find that, as usual, the existence of such a model can be excluded for detection rates beyond a critical
value $\eta_{\rm crit}$ (usually known as "critical detection efficiency"). In any case, $\eta_{\rm
crit} \geq \tfrac{1}{2}$ for any choice of state and observables, always, at least when symmetry
between the two observers is considered. On the other hand, the inplausibility of both the no-enhancement
and the fair-sampling assumptions is also strongly suggested by what we call "the Wigner-PDC picture
of photon entanglement" (Casado et al). Finally, some recent reports of relevance are also briefly
addressed: Kot et al in PRL {\bf 108}, (2012), Giustina et al in Nature (2013). Contrary to what the
authors seem to believe, this second test, while closing the detection loophole, does not however
exclude local theories exhibiting unfair sampling: the question is still open.
