We introduce a new implementation of the coupled cluster method tailored by matrix product states
wave functions (DMRG-TCCSD), which employs the local pair natural orbital approach (LPNO). By
exploiting locality in the coupled cluster stage of the calculation, we were able to remove some
of the limitations that hindered the application of the canonical version of the method to larger
systems and/or with larger basis sets. We assessed the accuracy of the approximation using two systems:
tetramethyleneethane (TME) and oxo-Mn(Salen). Using the default cut-off parameters, we were
able to recover over 99.7% and 99.8% of canonical correlation energy for the triplet and singlet
state of TME respectively. In case of oxo-Mn(Salen), we found out that the amount of retrieved canonical
correlation energy depends on the size of the active space (CAS) - we retrieved over 99.6% for the
larger 27 orbital CAS and over 99.8% for the smaller 22 orbital CAS. The use of LPNO-TCCSD allowed
us to perform these calculations up to quadruple-$\zeta$ basis set amounting to 1178 basis functions.
Moreover, we examined dependance of the ground state of oxo-Mn(Salen) on CAS composition. We found
out that the inclusion of 4d$_{xy}$ orbital plays an important role in stabilizing the singlet state
at the DMRG-CASSCF level via double-shell effect. However, by including dynamic correlation the
ground state was found to be triplet regardless of the size of the basis set or composition of CAS,
which is in agreement with previous findings by canonical DMRG-TCCSD in smaller basis.
