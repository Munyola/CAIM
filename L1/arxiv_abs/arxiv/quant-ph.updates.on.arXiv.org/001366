Quantum algorithms have the potential to outperform their classical counterparts in a variety
of tasks. The realization of the advantage often requires the ability to load classical data efficiently
into quantum states. However, the best known methods for loading generic data into an $n$-qubit
state require $\mathcal{O}\left(2^n\right)$ gates. This scaling can easily predominate the
complexity of a quantum algorithm and, thereby, impair potential quantum advantage. Our work demonstrates
that quantum Generative Adversarial Networks (qGANs) facilitate efficient loading of generic
probability distributions -- implicitly given by data samples -- into quantum states. More specifically,
the qGAN scheme employs the interplay of a quantum channel, a variational quantum circuit, and a
classical neural network to learn the probability distribution underlying training data samples
and load it into the quantum channel. Effectively, the scheme results in a quantum channel that loads
the learned distribution with $\mathcal{O}\left(poly\left(n\right)\right)$ gates. This distribution
loading method can, thus, enable the exploitation of quantum advantage induced by other quantum
algorithms, such as Quantum Amplitude Estimation. We implement the qGAN distribution learning
and loading method with Qiskit and test it using a quantum simulation as well as actual quantum processors
provided by the IBM Q Experience. Furthermore, we employ quantum simulation to demonstrate the
use of the trained quantum channel in a quantum finance application.
