A basic question in the theory of fault-tolerant quantum computation is to understand the fundamental
resource costs for performing a universal logical set of gates on encoded qubits to arbitrary accuracy.
Here we consider qubits encoded with constant space overhead (i.e. finite encoding rate) in the
limit of arbitrarily large code distance $d$ through the use of topological codes associated to
triangulations of hyperbolic surfaces. We introduce explicit protocols to demonstrate how Dehn
twists of the hyperbolic surface can be implemented on the code through constant depth unitary circuits,
without increasing the space overhead. The circuit for a given Dehn twist consists of a permutation
of physical qubits, followed by a constant depth local unitary circuit, where locality here is defined
with respect to a hyperbolic metric that defines the code. Applying our results to the hyperbolic
Fibonacci Turaev-Viro code implies the possibility of applying universal logical gate sets on
encoded qubits through constant depth unitary circuits and with constant space overhead. Our circuits
are inherently protected from errors as they map local operators to local operators while changing
the size of their support by at most a constant factor; in the presence of noisy syndrome measurements,
our results suggest the possibility of universal fault tolerant quantum computation with constant
space overhead and time overhead of $\mathcal{O}(d/\log d)$. For quantum circuits that allow parallel
gate operations, this yields the optimal scaling of space-time overhead known to date.
