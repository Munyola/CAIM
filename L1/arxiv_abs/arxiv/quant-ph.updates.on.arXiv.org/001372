We establish lower-bounds on the number of resource states, also known as magic states, needed to
perform various quantum computing tasks, treating stabilizer operations as free. Our bounds apply
to adaptive computations using measurements and an arbitrary number of stabilizer ancillas. We
consider (1) resource state conversion, (2) single-qubit unitary synthesis, and (3) computational
tasks. To prove our resource conversion bounds we introduce two new monotones, the stabilizer nullity
and the dyadic monotone, and make use of the already-known stabilizer extent. We consider conversions
that borrow resource states, known as catalyst states, and return them at the end of the algorithm.
We show that catalysis is necessary for many conversions and introduce new catalytic conversions,
some of which are close to optimal. By finding a canonical form for post-selected stabilizer computations,
we show that approximating a single-qubit unitary to within diamond-norm precision $\varepsilon$
requires at least $1/7\cdot\log_2(1/\varepsilon) - 4/3$ $T$-states on average. This is the first
lower bound that applies to synthesis protocols using fall-back, mixing techniques, and where
the number of ancillas used can depend on $\varepsilon$. Up to multiplicative factors, we optimally
lower bound the number of $T$ or $CCZ$ states needed to implement the ubiquitous modular adder and
multiply-controlled-$Z$ operations. When the probability of Pauli measurement outcomes is 1/2,
some of our bounds become tight to within a small additive constant.
