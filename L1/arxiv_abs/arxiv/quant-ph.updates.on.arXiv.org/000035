Five physics mechanisms of interaction leading to the binding of the ${\rm H}_3^+$ molecular ion
are identified. They are realized in a form of variational trial functions and their respective
total energies are calculated. Each of them provides subsequently the most accurate approximation
for the Born-Oppenheimer (BO) ground state energy among (two-three-seven)-parametric trial
functions being correspondingly, H$_2$-molecule plus proton (two variational parameters),
H$_2^+$-ion plus H-atom (three variational parameters) and generalized Guillemin-Zener (seven
variational parameters). These trial functions are chosen following a criterion of physical adequacy.
They include the electronic correlation in the exponential form $\sim\exp{(\gamma r_{12})}$,
where $\gamma$ is a variational parameter. Superpositions of two different mechanisms of binding
are investigated and a particular one, which is a generalized Guillemin-Zener plus H$_2$-molecule
plus proton (ten variational parameters), provides the total energy at the equilibrium of $E=-1.3432$\
a.u. The superposition of three mechanisms: generalized Guillemin-Zener plus (H$_2$ -molecule
plus proton) plus (H$_2^+$ -ion plus H) (fourteen parameters) leads to the total energy which deviates
from the best known BO energy to $\sim 0.0004$\ a.u., {\it it reproduces two-three significant digits
in exact, non-BO total energy}. In general, our variational energy agrees in two-three-four significant
digits with the most accurate results available at present as well as major expectation values.
