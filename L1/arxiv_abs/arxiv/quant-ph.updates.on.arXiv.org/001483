That quantum correlations can be generated over time between the spin and the position of a quantum
walker is indisputable. The creation of bipartite entanglement has also been reported for two-walker
systems. In this scenario, however, since the global state lies in a fourpartite Hilbert space,
the question arises as to whether genuine multipartite entanglement may develop in time. Also,
since the spatial degrees of freedom can be viewed as a noisy channel for the two-spin part, one may
wonder how other nonclassical aspects (quantumnesses), such as Bell nonlocality, Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen
steering, quantum discord, and symmetrical quantum discord, evolve in time during the walk. The
scarcity of such a broader investigation is possibly due to computational difficulties associated
with the recursive nature of quantum walks. Here, we work around this issue by introducing a simplified
Gaussian model which proves to be very accurate within a given domain and powerful for the analytical
studies. Then, for an instance involving two noninteracting quantum walkers, whose spins start
in the singlet state, we quantify the aforementioned quantumnesses as a function of time, and evaluate
violations of both realism and related aspects of locality. In addition, we analyze situations
in which the initial two-spin state is affected by white noise. The typical scenario found is such
that while genuine fourpatite entanglement increases over time, all the investigated quantumnesses
vanish (suddenly or asymptotically) except realism-based nonlocality. Moreover, realism is
prevented for all finite times.
