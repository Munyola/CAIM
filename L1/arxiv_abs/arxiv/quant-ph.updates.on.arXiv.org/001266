Bell inequalities are important tools in contrasting classical and quantum behaviors. To date,
most Bell inequalities are linear combinations of statistical correlations between remote parties.
Nevertheless, finding the classical and quantum mechanical (Tsirelson) bounds for a given Bell
inequality in a general scenario is a difficult task which rarely leads to closed-form solutions.
Here we introduce a new class of Bell inequalities based on products of correlators that alleviate
these issues. Each such Bell inequality is associated with a unique coordination game. In the simplest
case, Alice and Bob, each having two random variables, attempt to maximize the area of a rectangle
and the rectangle's area is represented by a certain parameter. This parameter, which is a function
of the correlations between their random variables, is shown to be a Bell parameter, i.e. the achievable
bound using only classical correlations is strictly smaller than the achievable bound using non-local
quantum correlations. We continue by generalizing to the case in which Alice and Bob, each having
now n random variables, wish to maximize a certain volume in n-dimensional space. We term this parameter
a multiplicative Bell parameter and prove its Tsirelson bound. Finally, we investigate the case
of local hidden variables and show that for any deterministic strategy of one of the players the Bell
parameter is a harmonic function whose maximum approaches the Tsirelson bound as the number of measurement
devices increases. Some theoretical and experimental implications of these results are discussed.
