The behavior of classical monochromatic waves in stationary media is shown to be ruled by a frequency
dependent function, which we call "Wave Potential", encoded in the structure of the Helmholtz equation.
Contrary to the common belief that the very concept of ray trajectory is reserved to the eikonal approximation,
a general and exact ray-based Hamiltonian treatment, reducing to the eikonal approximation in
the absence of Wave Potential, shows that its presence induces a mutual, perpendicular ray-coupling,
which is the one and only cause of any typically wave-like phenomenon, such as diffraction and interference.
Recalling, then, that the time-independent Schroedinger equation (associating the motion of
mono-energetic particles with stationary monochromatic matter waves) is itself a Helmholtz-like
equation, the exact, ray-based treatment developed in the classical case may be extended - without
resorting to statistical concepts - to the exact, trajectory-based Hamiltonian dynamics of mono-energetic
point-li e particles. The trajectories turn out to be mutually coupled, once more, by an exact, energy-dependent
Wave Potential, coinciding in the form, but not in the physical meaning, with the statistical, energy-independent
"Quantum Potential" of Bohm's theory (where particles are represented by means of wave-packets,
moving along probability flux lines). This result, together with the connections shown to exist
between Wave Potential and Uncertainty Principle, suggests a novel, classical-looking, non-probabilistic
interpretation of Wave Mechanics.
