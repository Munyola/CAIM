A theoretical model of diffraction based on quantum mechanics is presented. It provides a general
expression of the quantum state of a particle after its passage through an aperture in an opaque plane
(diaphragm). In this model, the diaphragm is considered as a measurement device not only of the transverse
coordinates but also of the longitudinal coordinate of the particle. Moreover, the change of state
from the initial state (incident wave) to the final state (diffracted wave) results from two successive
projections involving a transitional state which corresponds to the state of the particle when
it is localized inside the aperture. These features of the model results from the need to ensure compatibility
with the Huygens-Fresnel principle and with the kinematics constraints of the particle-diaphragm
interaction. In the case of the diffraction at infinity (Fraunhofer diffraction), the predictions
of the quantum model and of the classical theories based on the integrals of Fresnel-Kirchhoff (FK)
and Rayleigh-Sommerfeld (RS1 and RS2) are different. They are close at small diffraction angles
but contradictory at large angles. In this latter region, only the quantum and RS1 models predict
the probable decrease in the intensity of the diffracted wave to zero when the diffraction angle
reaches 90{\deg}. However, this decrease is different according to the model and it turns out that
the discrepancies become significant beyond 60{\deg}. A measurement of the intensity of the particle
flow in this region should allow to test the two theories.
