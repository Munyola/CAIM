Commercial quantum annealers from D-Wave Systems make it possible to obtain approximate solutions
of high quality for certain NP-hard problems in nearly constant time. Before solving a problem on
D-Wave, several preprocessing methods can be applied, one of them being the so-called spin reversal
or gauge transform. The spin reversal transform flips the sign of selected variables and coefficients
of the Ising or QUBO (quadratic unconstrained binary optimization) representation of the problem
that D-Wave minimizes. The spin reversal transform leaves the ground state of the Ising model invariant,
but can average out the biases induced through analog and systematic errors on the device, thus improving
the quality of the solution that D-Wave returns. This work investigates the effectiveness of the
spin reversal transform for D-Wave 2000Q. We consider two important NP-hard problems, the Maximum
Clique and the Minimum Vertex Cover problems, and show on a variety of input problem graphs that using
the spin reversal transform can yield substantial improvements in solution quality. In contrast
to the native spin reversal built into D-Wave, we consider more general ways to reverse individual
spins and we investigate the dependence on the problem type, on the spin reversal probability, and
possible advantages of carrying out reversals on the qubit instead of the chain level. Most importantly,
for a given individual problem, we use our findings to optimize the spin reversal transform using
a genetic optimization algorithm.
