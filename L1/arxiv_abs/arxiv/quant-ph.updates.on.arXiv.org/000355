The ability to induce, observe and control quantum coherent interactions in room temperature,
electrically driven optoelectronic devices is of outmost significance for advancing quantum
science and engineering towards practical applications. Following up on previous demonstrations
of Rabi oscillations, self-induced transparency and coherent control by shaped optical excitation
pulses in quantum dot (QD) optical amplifiers, we report here on measuring Ramsey fringes in such
devices. Observation of Ramsey fringes in semiconductor QDs was previously achieved only at cryogenic
temperatures, mainly in isolated single dot systems, while now they have been demonstrated in an
inhomogeneously broadened QD ensemble in the form of a 1.5 mm long optical amplifier operating at
room temperature. A high-resolution pump probe scheme where both pulses are characterized by cross
frequency resolved optical gating revealed a clear oscillatory behavior of the amplitude and instantaneous
frequency of the probe pulse with a period that equals one optical cycle. Moreover, the temporal
position of the output probe pulse also oscillates with the same periodicity but with a quarter cycle
delay relative to the intensity variations. This delay is the time domain manifestation of coupling
between the real and imaginary parts of the complex susceptibility. Using nominal input delays
of 600 to 900 fs and scanning the separation around each delay in 1 fs steps, we map the evolution of
the material de-coherence and extract a coherence time of 410 fs.
