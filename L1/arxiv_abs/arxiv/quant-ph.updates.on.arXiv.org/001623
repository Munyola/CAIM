The Lieb-Robinson (LR) bound rigorously shows that in quantum systems with short-range interactions,
the maximum amount of information that travels beyond an effective "light cone" decays exponentially
with distance from the light-cone front, which expands at finite velocity. Despite being a fundamental
result, existing bounds are often extremely loose, limiting their applications when quantitative
accuracy is necessary. We derive improved LR bounds in systems with finite-range interactions
that qualitatively strengthen previous bounds in three ways: (1) At large distance $d_{XY}$, the
bound decays like $e^{-d_{XY}\ln d_{XY}}$, faster than the previous exponential decay. (2) At
short times, the bound is $O(t^{d_{XY}})$, which is much smaller than previous bounds, which grow
proportional to $t$, and is often tight. (3) The LR velocity vastly improves previous bounds. As
an example, when applied to the two-dimensional transverse field Ising model~(TFIM) with interaction
strength $J$ and transverse field $h$, our bound for the LR velocity is $\min\{4.27\sqrt{Jh},15.1J,12.1h\}$.
Compared to the best previously known bound on the LR speed, $16 e J\approx 43.5J$, the new bound is
more than 10 times tighter for $J=h$, at least 2.8 times tighter for every value of $J$ and $h$, and
remains finite as $J\rightarrow\infty$, while previous bounds diverge. These tighter LR bounds
have immediate consequences. For example, we obtain qualitatively tighter bounds for the correlations
in gapped ground states. We also expect the bounds to enable new applications where quantitative
accuracy is necessary.
