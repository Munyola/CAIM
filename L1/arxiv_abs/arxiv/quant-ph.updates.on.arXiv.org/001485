Quantum low-density parity-check codes can be decoded using a syndrome based $\mathrm{GF}(4)$
belief propagation decoder. However, the performance of this decoder is limited both by unavoidable
$4$-cycles in the code's factor graph and the degenerate nature of quantum errors. For the subclass
of CSS codes, the number of $4$-cycles can be reduced by breaking an error into an $X$ and $Z$ component
and decoding each with an individual $\mathrm{GF}(2)$ based decoder. However, this comes at the
expense of ignoring potential correlations between these two error components. We present a number
of modified belief propagation decoders that address these issues. We propose a $\mathrm{GF}(2)$
based decoder for CSS codes that reintroduces error correlations by reattempting decoding with
adjusted error probabilities. We also propose the use of an augmented decoder, which has previously
been suggested for classical binary low-density parity-check codes. This decoder iteratively
reattempts decoding on factor graphs that have a subset of their check nodes duplicated. The augmented
decoder can be based on a $\mathrm{GF}(4)$ decoder for any code, a $\mathrm{GF}(2)$ decoder for
CSS code, or even a supernode decoder for a dual-containing CSS code. For CSS codes, we further propose
a $\mathrm{GF}(2)$ based decoder that combines the augmented decoder with error probability adjustment.
We demonstrate the performance of these new decoders on a range of different codes, showing that
they perform favorably compared to other decoders presented in literature.
