Starting from the Gisin-Percival state diffusion equation for the pure state trajectory of a composite
bipartite quantum system and exploiting the purification of a mixed state via its Schmidt decomposition,
we write the diffusion equation for the quantum trajectory of the mixed state of a subsystem $S$ of
the bipartite system, when the initial state in $S$ is mixed. Denoting the diffused state of the system
$S$ at time $t$ by $\rho_t(\mathbf{B})$ for each $t\geq 0$, where $\mathbf{B}$ is the underlying
complex $n$-dimensional vector-valued Brownian motion process and using It{\^o} calculus, along
with an induction procedure, we arrive at the stochastic differential of the scalar-valued moment
process ${\rm Tr}[\rho_t^m( \mathbf{B})], \,\,\, m=2,3,\ldots$ in terms of $d\,\mathbf{B}$
and $d\,t$. This shows that each of the processes $\{{\rm Tr}[\rho_t^m( \mathbf{B})], t\geq 0\}$
admits a Doob-Meyer decomposition as the sum of a martingale $M^{(m)}_t(\mathbf{B})$ and a non-negative
increasing process $S^{(m)}_t(\mathbf{B})$. This ensures the existence of $\underset{t\rightarrow\infty}{\lim}\,
{\rm Tr}[\rho_t^m( \mathbf{B})]$ almost surely with respect to the Wiener probability measure
$\mu$ of the Brownian motion $\mathbf{B}$, for each $m=2,\, 3,\, \ldots$. In particular, when $S$
is a finite level system, the spectrum and therefore the entropy of $\rho_t (\mathbf{B})$ converge
almost surely to a limit as $t\rightarrow \infty$. In the Appendix, by employing probabilistic
means, we prove a technical result which implies the almost sure convergence of the spectrum for
countably infinite level systems.
