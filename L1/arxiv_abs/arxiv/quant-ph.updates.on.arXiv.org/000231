Generally, the local interactions in a many-body quantum spin system on a lattice do not commute
with each other. Consequently, the Hamiltonian of a local region will generally not commute with
that of the entire system, and so the two cannot be measured simultaneously. The connection between
the probability distributions of measurement outcomes of the local and global Hamiltonians will
depend on the angles between the diagonalizing bases of these two Hamiltonians. In this paper we
characterize the relation between these two distributions. On one hand, we upperbound the probability
of measuring an energy $\tau$ in a local region, if the global system is in a superposition of eigenstates
with energies $\epsilon<\tau$. On the other hand, we bound the probability of measuring a global
energy $\epsilon$ in a bipartite system that is in a tensor product of eigenstates of its two subsystems.
Very roughly, we show that due to the local nature of the governing interactions, these distributions
are identical to what one encounters in the commuting case, up to some exponentially small corrections.
Finally, we use these bounds to study the spectrum of a locally truncated Hamiltonian, in which the
energies of a contiguous region have been truncated above some threshold energy $\tau$. We show
that the lower part of the spectrum of this Hamiltonian is exponentially close to that of the original
Hamiltonian. A restricted version of this result in 1D was a central building block in a recent improvement
of the 1D area-law.
