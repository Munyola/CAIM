Silicon photonics is a powerful platform for implementing large-scale photonic integrated circuits
(PICs), because of its compatibility with mature complementary-metal-oxide-semiconductor
(CMOS) technology. Exploiting silicon-based PICs for quantum photonic information processing
(or the so-called silicon quantum photonics) provides a promising pathway for large-scale quantum
applications. For the development of scalable silicon quantum PICs, a major challenge is integrating
on-silicon quantum light sources that deterministically emit single photons. In this regard,
the use of epitaxial InAs/GaAs quantum dots (QDs) is a very promising approach, because of their
capability of deterministic single-photon emission with high purity and indistinguishability.
However, the required hybrid integration is inherently difficult and often lacks the compatibility
with CMOS processes. Here, we demonstrate a QD single-photon source (SPS) integrated on a glass-clad
silicon photonic waveguide processed by a CMOS foundry. Hybrid integration is performed using
transfer printing, which enables us to integrate heterogeneous optical components in a simple
pick-and-place manner and thus assemble them after the entire CMOS process is completed. We observe
single-photon emission from the integrated QD and its efficient coupling into the silicon waveguide.
Our transfer-printing-based approach is fully compatible with CMOS back-end processes, and thus
will open the possibility for realizing large-scale quantum PICs that leverage CMOS technology.
