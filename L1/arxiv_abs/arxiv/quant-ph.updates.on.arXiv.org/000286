Previously, we had proposed a gravitational wave detector that incorporates the white light cavity
(WLC) effect using a compound cavity for signal recycling (CC-SR). Here, we first calculate the
quantum noise (QN) limited sensitivity curves for this design, and find that the broadening of sensitivity
predicted by the classical analysis is also present in these curves, but is somewhat reduced. Furthermore,
we find that the curves always stay above the standard quantum limit (SQL). To circumvent this limitation,
we modify the dispersion to compensate the non-linear phase variation produced by the opto-mechanical
(OM) resonance effects by making use of the single sideband approximation (SSA). We find that the
resonance dips in the resulting QN curves entail a 14 times higher sensitivity-bandwidth product
compared to the highest sensitivity result presented by Bunanno and Chen. We also present a simpler
scheme (WLC-SR) where a dispersion medium is inserted in the SR cavity. Compared to the highest sensitivity
result of Bunanno and Chen, the QN exhibits an enhancement of sensitivity-bandwidth product by
a factor of 18. We consider both positive and negative dispersion for phase compensation. For the
negative dispersion, we consider a narrow band dip on top of a broadband gain. For the positive dispersion,
we consider a narrow transparency on top of a broad absorption. For the negative dispersion, we show
that, for the parameters that yield net enhancement in the sensitivity-bandwidth product, lasing
does not occur.
