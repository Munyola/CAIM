Laser-light (coherent-state) modulation is sufficient to achieve the ultimate (Holevo) capacity
of classical communication over a lossy and noisy optical channel, but requires a receiver that
jointly detects long modulated codewords with highly nonlinear quantum operations, which are
near-impossible to realize using current technology. We analyze the capacity of the lossy-noisy
optical channel when the transmitter uses coherent state modulation but the receiver is restricted
to a general quantum-limited Gaussian receiver, i.e., one that may involve arbitrary combinations
of Gaussian operations (passive linear optics: beamsplitters and phase-shifters, second order
nonlinear optics (or active linear optics): squeezers, along with homodyne or heterodyne detection
measurements) and any amount of classical feedforward within the receiver. Under these assumptions,
we show that the Gaussian receiver that attains the maximum mutual information is either homodyne
detection, heterodyne detection, or time sharing between the two, depending upon the received
power level. In other words, our result shows that to exceed the theoretical limit of conventional
coherent optical communications, one has to incorporate non-Gaussian, i.e., third or higher-order
nonlinear operations in the receiver. Finally we compare our Gaussian receiver limit with experimentally
feasible non-Gaussian receivers and show that in the regime of low received photon flux, it is possible
to overcome the Gaussian receiver limit by relatively simple non-Gaussian receivers based on photon
counting.
