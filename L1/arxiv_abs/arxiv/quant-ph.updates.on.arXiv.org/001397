Pricing interest-rate financial derivatives is a major problem in finance, in which it is crucial
to accurately reproduce the time-evolution of interest rates. Several stochastic dynamics have
been proposed in the literature to model either the instantaneous interest rate or the instantaneous
forward rate. A successful approach to model the latter is the celebrated Heath-Jarrow-Morton
framework, in which its dynamics is entirely specified by volatility factors. On its multifactor
version, this model considers several noisy components to capture at best the dynamics of several
time-maturing forward rates. However, as no general analytical solution is available, there is
a trade-off between the number of noisy factors considered and the computational time to perform
a numerical simulation. Here, we employ the quantum principal component analysis to reduce the
number of noisy factors required to accurately simulate the time evolution of several time-maturing
forward rates. The principal components are experimentally estimated with the $5$-qubit IBMQX2
quantum computer for $2\times 2$ and $3\times 3$ cross-correlation matrices, which are based on
historical data for two and three time-maturing forward rates. This manuscript is a first step towards
the design of a general quantum algorithm to fully simulate on quantum computers the Heath-Jarrow-Morton
model for pricing interest-rate financial derivatives. It shows indeed that practical applications
of quantum computers in finance will be achievable in the near future.
