We discuss different physical effects related to the uniform acceleration of atoms in vacuum, in
the framework of quantum electrodynamics. We first investigate the van der Waals/Casimir-Polder
dispersion and resonance interactions between two uniformly accelerated atoms in vacuum. We show
that the atomic acceleration significantly affects the van der Waals force, yielding a different
scaling of the interaction with the interatomic distance and an explicit time dependence of the
interaction energy. We argue how these results could allow for an indirect detection of the Unruh
effect through dispersion interactions between atoms. We then consider the resonance interaction
between two accelerated atoms, prepared in a correlated Bell-type state, and interacting with
the electromagnetic field in the vacuum state, separating vacuum fluctuations and radiation reaction
contributions, both in the free-space and in the presence of a perfectly reflecting plate. We show
that nonthermal effects of acceleration manifest in the resonance interaction, yielding a change
of the distance dependence of the resonance interaction energy. This suggests that the equivalence
between temperature and acceleration does not apply to all radiative properties of accelerated
atoms. To further explore this aspect, we evaluate the resonance interaction between two atoms
in non inertial motion in the coaccelerated (Rindler) frame and show that in this case the assumption
of an Unruh temperature for the field is not required for a complete equivalence of locally inertial
and coaccelerated points of views.
