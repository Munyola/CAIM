While adiabatic quantum computing (AQC) has some robustness to noise and decoherence it is widely
believed that encoding, error suppression and error correction will be required to scale AQC to
large problem sizes. Previous works have established at least two different techniques for error
suppression in AQC. In this paper we derive a dynamical model for describing the dynamics of encoded
AQC and show that previous constructions for error suppression can be unified with this dynamical
model. In addition the model clarifies the mechanisms of error suppression and allow identification
of its weaknesses. In the second half of the paper we utilize our description of non-equilibrium
dynamics in encoded AQC to construct methods for error correction in AQC by cooling local degrees
of freedom (qubits). While this is shown to be possible in principle, we also identify the key challenge
to this approach: the requirement of high-weight Hamiltonians. Finally, we use our dynamical model
to perform a simplified thermal stability analysis of concatenated-stabilizer-code encoded
many-body systems for AQC or quantum memories. This work is a companion paper to "Error suppression
and error correction in adiabatic quantum computation I: techniques and challenges", which provides
a quantum information perspective on the techniques and limitations of error suppression and correction
in AQC. In this paper we couch the same results within a dynamical framework, which allows for detailed
analysis of the non-equilibrium dynamics of error suppression and correction in encoded AQC.
