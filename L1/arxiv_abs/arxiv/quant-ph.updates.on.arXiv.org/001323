In this paper I propose a new method of encoding integer variables into Ising model qubits for quantum
optimization. The new method is based on the physics of domain walls in one dimensional Ising spin
chains. I find that these encodings and the encoding of arbitrary two variable interactions is possible
with only two body Ising terms. Following on from similar results for the `one hot' method of encoding
integer variables [Hadfield et. al. Algorithms 12.2 (2019): 34] I also demonstrate that it is possible
to construct two body mixer terms which do not leave the logical subspace, an important consideration
for optimising using the quantum alternating operator ansatz (QAOA). I additionally discuss how,
since the couplings in the domain wall encoding only need to be ferromagnetic and therefore could
in principle be much stronger than anti-ferromagnetic couplers, that application specific quantum
annealers for integer problems based on this construction may be beneficial. Finally, I compare
embedding for synthetic scheduling and colouring problems with the domain wall and one hot encodings
on two graphs which are relevant for quantum annealing, the chimera graph and the Pegasus graph.
For every case I examine I find a similar or better performance from the domain wall encoding as compared
to one hot, but this advantage is highly dependent on the structure of the problem. For encoding some
problems, I find an advantage similar to the one found by embedding in a Pegasus graph compared to
embedding in a chimera graph.
