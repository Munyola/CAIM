We experimentally evaluate the practical state-of-the-art in graph bipartization (Odd Cycle
Transversal), motivated by recent advances in near-term quantum computing hardware and the related
embedding problems. We assemble a preprocessing suite of fast input reduction routines from the
Odd Cycle Transversal (OCT) and Vertex Cover (VC) literature, allowing algorithm implementations
to be compared using Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization problems from the quantum literature.
These problems represent a wide array of graph properties, leading to harder OCT instances than
in previous benchmarks. In addition to combinatorial branching algorithms for solving OCT directly,
we study various reformulations into other NP-hard problems such as VC and Integer Linear Programming
(ILP), enabling the use of solvers such as CPLEX. We find that for heuristic solutions with time constraints
under a second, iterative compression routines jump-started with a heuristic solution perform
best, after which point using a highly tuned solver like CPLEX is worthwhile. Results on exact solvers
are split between using ILP formulations on CPLEX and solving VC formulations with a branch-and-reduce
solver. We compare our results to those on a corpus of synthetic graphs, establishing robustness
and potential to generalize to other domain data. Finally, we provide all code and data in an open
source suite, including a Python API for accessing reduction routines and branching algorithms,
along with scripts for fully replicating our results.
