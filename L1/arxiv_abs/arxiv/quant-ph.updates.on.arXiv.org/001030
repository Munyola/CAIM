Recent gravity discussions of a traversable wormhole indicate that in holographic systems signals
generated by a source could reappear long after they have dissipated, with the need of only performing
some simple operations. In this paper we argue the phenomenon, to which we refer as "regenesis",
is universal in general quantum chaotic many-body systems, and elucidate its underlying physics.
The essential elements behind the phenomenon are: (i) scrambling which in a chaotic system makes
out-of-time-ordered correlation functions (OTOCs) vanish at large times; (ii) the entanglement
structure of the state of the system. The latter aspect also implies that the regenesis phenomenon
requires fine tuning of the initial state. Compared to other manifestations of quantum chaos such
as the initial growth of OTOCs which deals with early times, and a random matrix-type energy spectrum
which reflects very large time behavior, regenesis concerns with intermediate times, of order
the scrambling time of a system. We also study the phenomenon in detail in general two-dimensional
conformal field theories in the large central charge limit, and highlight some interesting features
including a resonant enhancement of regenesis signals near the scrambling time and their oscillations
in coupling. Finally, we discuss gravity implications of the phenomenon for systems with a gravity
dual, arguing that there exist regimes for which traversability of a wormhole is quantum in nature,
i.e. cannot be associated with a semi-classical spacetime causal structure.
