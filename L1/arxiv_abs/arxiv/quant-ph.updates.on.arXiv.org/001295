In a breakthrough, Hastings showed that there exist quantum channels whose classical capacity
is superadditive i.e. more classical information can be transmitted by quantum encoding strategies
entangled across multiple channel uses as compared to unentangled quantum encoding strategies.
Hastings' proof used Haar random unitaries to exhibit superadditivity. In this paper we show that
a unitary chosen uniformly at random from an approximate n^{2/3}-design gives rise to a quantum
channel with superadditive classical capacity, where n is the dimension of the unitary exhibiting
the Stinespring dilation of the channel superoperator. We do so by showing that the minimum output
von Neumann entropy of a quantum channel arising from an approximate unitary n^{2/3}-design is
subadditive, which by Shor's work implies superadditivity of classical capacity of quantum channels.
We follow the geometric functional analytic approach of Aubrun, Szarek and Werner in order to prove
our result. More precisely we prove a sharp Dvoretzky-like theorem stating that, with high probability
under the choice of a unitary from an approximate t-design, random subspaces of large dimension
make a Lipschitz function take almost constant value. Such theorems were known earlier only for
Haar random unitaries. We obtain our result by appealing to Low's technique for proving concentration
of measure for an approximate t-design, combined with a stratified analysis of the variational
behaviour of Lipschitz functions on the unit sphere in high dimension. The stratified analysis
is the main technical advance of this work.
