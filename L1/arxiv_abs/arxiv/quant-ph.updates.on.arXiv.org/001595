We study the steady state entanglement and correlations of an open system comprised of two fermions
coupling with the equilibrium or nonequilibrium environments. We find that for equilibrium case,
quantum correlations exhibit non-monotonic behavior with the increase of temperature and quantum
entanglement dies at finite temperature. Under nonequilibrium environments, the quantum correlations
can show monotonic or non-monotonic behavior upon the change of temperature or chemical potential
bias depending on the tunneling rate and the decay rate of the system. By tuning the chemical potential
of the environment, the quantum correlation of the system can be maximized more efficiently than
tuning the temperatures. In the equilibrium regime, the entanglement vanishes to zero upon the
increase of temperature or chemical potential. In the nonequilibrium case, there is a transition
point in the chemical potential above which the entanglement remains positive regardless of the
chemical potential bias of the two reservoirs. When the tunneling rate is small, quantum correlations
increase almost monotonically with the asymmetric setup of the two reservoirs. In the large-tunneling
regime, quantum correlations are non-monotonic with the change of bias between the two reservoirs,
while in the small-tunneling regime, they are monotonic. The transition from the large-tunneling
regime to the small-tunneling regime is discussed. In the intermediate tunneling regime near the
transition, the entanglement resurrects with the increase of chemical potential bias after its
previous drop to zero.
