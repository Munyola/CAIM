A bit-quantum map relates probabilistic information for Ising spins or classical bits to quantum
spins or qubits. Quantum systems are subsystems of classical statistical systems. The Ising spins
can represent macroscopic two-level observables, and the quantum subsystem employs suitable
expectation values and correlations. We discuss static memory materials based on Ising spins for
which boundary information can be transported through the bulk in a generalized equilibrium state.
They can realize quantum operations as the Hadamard or CNOT-gate for the quantum subsystem. Classical
probabilistic systems can account for the entanglement of quantum spins. An arbitrary unitary
evolution for an arbitrary number of quantum spins can be described by static memory materials for
an infinite number of Ising spins which may, in turn, correspond to continuous variables or fields.
We discuss discrete subsets of unitary operations realized by a finite number of Ising spins. They
may be useful for new computational structures. We suggest that features of quantum computation
or more general probabilistic computation may be realized by neural networks, neuromorphic computing
or perhaps even the brain. This does neither require small isolated entities nor very low temperature.
In these systems the processing of probabilistic information can be more general than for static
memory materials. We propose a general formalism for probabilistic computing for which deterministic
computing and quantum computing are special limiting cases.
