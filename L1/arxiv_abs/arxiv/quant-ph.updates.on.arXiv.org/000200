How can one be certain that the output of an alleged random number generator is indeed random? The
mathematical theory of randomness extraction requires two or more independent weak randomness
sources for ensuring output quality. To circumvent this fundamental yet hard-to-enforce limit,
we formulate precisely a model of extracting randomness from non-interacting and untrusted quantum
devices, and base security on the validity of physical theories. We further construct the first
such extractor that uses a single and arbitrarily weak source and is secure against all-powerful
quantum adversaries. Our construction can reach a close-to-optimal error parameter, and is efficient
in several configurations. In conjunction with Miller-Shi ( arXiv:1402.0489 ), it can tolerate
a constant level of device imperfection, produce an arbitrarily long and near-prefect random output,
using just one source of only a constant amount of weak randomness. Our result also implies a strong
"dichotomy" that unless the world is deterministic, we can experimentally create arbitrarily
many inherently random events and be confident of their unpredictability. This provides both a
practical and the strongest known method for mitigating the Freedom-of-Choice loophole in Bell
test experiments. A main technical contribution is our Equivalence Lemma, which states that the
performance of a physical extractor remains unchanged when its globally uniformly random input
is replaced by an input uniform only to the devices. This principle for the secure composition of
untrusted-device protocols has found several other applications.
