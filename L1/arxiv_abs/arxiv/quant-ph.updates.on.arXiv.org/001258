We investigate the advantages of extracting the degree of entanglement in bipartite systems directly
from tomograms, as it is the latter that are readily obtained from experiments. This would provide
a superior alternative to the standard procedure of assessing the extent of entanglement between
subsystems after employing the machinery of state reconstruction from the tomogram. The latter
is both cumbersome and involves statistical methods, while a direct inference about entanglement
from the tomogram circumvents these limitations. In an earlier paper, we had identified a procedure
to obtain a bipartite entanglement indicator directly from tomograms. To assess the efficacy of
this indicator, we now carry out a detailed investigation using two nonlinear bipartite models
by comparing this tomographic indicator with standard markers of entanglement such as the subsystem
linear entropy and the subsystem von Neumann entropy and also with a commonly-used indicator obtained
from inverse participation ratios. The two model systems selected for this purpose are a multilevel
atom interacting with a radiation field, and a double-well Bose-Einstein condensate. The role
played by the specific initial states of these two systems in the performance of the tomographic
indicator is also examined. Further, the efficiency of the tomographic entanglement indicator
during the dynamical evolution of the system is assessed from a time-series analysis of the difference
between this indicator and the subsystem von Neumann entropy.
