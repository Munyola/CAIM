We analytically designed the control bias pulses to realize new multi-qubit parity detector gates
for 2-Dimensional (2D) array of superconducting flux qubits with non-tunable couplings. We designed
two 5-qubit gates such that the middle qubit is the target qubit and all four coupled neighbors are
the control qubits. These new gates detect the parity between two vertically/horizontally coupled
neighbor qubits while cancelling out the coupling effect of horizontally/vertically coupled
neighbor qubits. For a 3 by 3 array of 9 qubits with non-tunable couplings, we simulated the effect
of our new 5-qubit horizontal and vertical parity detector gates. We achieved the intrinsic fidelity
of 99.9% for horizontal and vertical parity detector gates. In this paper we realize Surface Code
memories based on the multi-qubit parity detector gates for nearest neighbor superconducting
flux qubits with and without tunable couplings. However, our scheme is applicable to other superconducting
qubits as well. In our proposed memory realization, error correction cycles can be performed in
parallel on several logical qubits or even on the entire 2D array of qubits, this makes it a desirable
candidate for large scale and longtime quantum computation. In addition to extensive reduction
of the number of control parameters in our method, the error correction cycle time is reduced and
does not grow by increasing the number of qubits in the logical qubit layout. Another advantage of
this approach is that there will not be any dephasing from idle qubits since all the qubits are used
in the error correction cycles.
