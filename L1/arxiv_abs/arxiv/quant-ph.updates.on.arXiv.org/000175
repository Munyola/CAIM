We present a non-Markovian quantum jump approach for simulating coherent energy transfer dynamics
in molecular systems in the presence of laser fields. By combining a coherent modified Redfield
theory (CMRT) and a non-Markovian quantum jump (NMQJ) method, this new approach inherits the broad-range
validity from the CMRT and highly efficient propagation from the NMQJ. To implement NMQJ propagation
of CMRT, we show that the CMRT master equation can be casted into a generalized Lindblad form. Moreover,
we extend the NMQJ approach to treat time-dependent Hamiltonian, enabling the description of excitonic
systems under coherent laser fields. As a benchmark of the validity of this new method, we show that
the CMRT-NMQJ method accurately describes the energy transfer dynamics in a prototypical photosynthetic
complex. Finally, we apply this new approach to simulate the quantum dynamics of a dimer system coherently
excited to coupled single-excitation states under the influence of laser fields, which allows
us to investigate the interplay between the photoexcitation process and ultrafast energy transfer
dynamics in the system. We demonstrate that laser-field parameters significantly affect coherence
dynamics of photoexcitations in excitonic systems, which indicates that the photoexcitation
process must be explicitly considered in order to properly describe photon-induced dynamics in
photosynthetic systems. This work should provide a valuable tool for efficient simulations of
coherent control of energy flow in photosynthetic systems and artificial optoelectronic materials.
