The states of an open quantum system are coupled via the environment of scattering wavefunctions.
The complex coupling coefficients $\omega$ between system and environment arise from the principal
value integral and the residuum. At high level density where the resonance states overlap, the dynamics
of the system is determined by exceptional points. At these points, the eigenvalues of two states
are equal and the corresponding eigenfunctions are linearly dependent. It is shown in the present
paper that Im$(\omega)$ and Re$(\omega)$ influence the system properties differently in the surrounding
of exceptional points. Controlling the system by a parameter, the eigenvalues avoid crossing in
energy near an exceptional point under the influence of Re$(\omega)$ in a similar manner as it is
well known from discrete states. Im$(\omega)$ however leads to width bifurcation and finally (when
the system is coupled to one channel, i.e. to a common continuum of scattering wavefunctions), to
a splitting of the system into two parts with different characteristic time scales. Physically,
the system is stabilized by this splitting since the lifetimes of most ($N-1$) states are longer
than before while that of only one state is shorter. In the cross section the short-lived state appears
as a background term in high-resolution experiments. The wavefunctions of the long-lived states
are mixed in those of the original ones in a comparably large parameter range. Numerical results
for the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions are shown for $N=2, ~4$ and 10 states coupled mostly to 1 channel.
