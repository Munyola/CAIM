The paradigmatic spin-boson model considers a spin degree of freedom interacting with an environment
typically constituted by a continuum of bosonic modes. This ubiquitous model is of relevance in
a number of physical systems where, in general, one has neither control over the bosonic modes, nor
the ability to tune distinct interaction mechanisms. Despite this apparent lack of control, we
present a suitable transformation that approximately maps the spin-boson dynamics into that of
a tunable multiphoton Jaynes-Cummings model undergoing dissipation. Interestingly, the latter
model describes the coherent interaction between a spin and a single bosonic mode via the simultaneous
exchange of n bosons per spin excitation. Resorting to the so-called reaction coordinate method,
we identify a relevant collective bosonic mode in the environment which is then used to generate
multiphoton interactions following the proposed theoretical framework. Moreover, we show that
spin-boson models featuring structured environments can lead into non-Markovian multiphoton
Jaynes-Cummings dynamics. We discuss the validity of the proposed method depending on the parameters
and analyze its performance, which is supported by numerical simulations. In this manner, the spin-boson
model serves as a good analog quantum simulator for the inspection and realization of multiphoton
Jaynes-Cummings models as well as the interplay of non-Markovian effects, and thus, as a simulator
of light-matter systems with tunable interaction mechanisms.
