Anisotropic quantum Rabi model is a generalization of quantum Rabi model, which allows its rotating
and counter-rotating terms to have two different coupling constants. It provides us with a fundamental
model to understand various physical features concerning quantum optics, solid-state physics,
and mesoscopic physics. In this paper, we propose an experimental feasible scheme to implement
anisotropic quantum Rabi model in a circuit quantum electrodynamics system via periodic frequency
modulation. An effective Hamiltonian describing the tunable anisotropic quantum Rabi model can
be derived from a qubit-resonator coupling system modulated by two periodic driving fields. All
effective parameters of the simulated system can be adjusted by tuning the initial phases, the frequencies
and the amplitudes of the driving fields. We show that the periodic driving is able to drive a coupled
system in dispersive regime to ultrastrong coupling regime, and even deep-strong coupling regime.
The derived effective Hamiltonian allows us to obtain pure rotating term and counter-rotating
term. Numerical simulation shows that such effective Hamiltonian is valid in ultrastrong coupling
regime, and stronger coupling regime. Moreover, our scheme can be generalized to the multi-qubit
case. We also give some applications of the simulated system to the Schr\"{o}dinger cat states and
quantum gate generalization. The presented proposal will pave a way to further study the stronger
anisotropic Rabi model whose coupling strength is far away from ultrastrong coupling and deep-strong
coupling regimes in quantum optics.
