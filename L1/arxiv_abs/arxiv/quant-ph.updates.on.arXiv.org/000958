We introduce collective geometric phases of bosons and fermions interfering on a linear unitary
multiport, where each phase depends on the internal states of identical particles (i.e., not affected
by the multiport) and corresponds to a cycle of the symmetric group. We show that quantum interference
of $N$ particles in generic pure internal states, i.e., with no pair being orthogonal, is governed
by $(N-1)(N-2)/2$ independent triad phases (each involving only three particles). The deterministic
distinguishability, preventing quantum interference with two or three particles, allows for
the genuine $(N\ge 4)$-particle phase (interference) on a multiport: setting each particle to
be deterministically distinguishable from all others except two by their internal states allows
for a novel (circle-dance) interference of $N\ge 4$ particles governed by a collective $N$-particle
phase, while simultaneously preventing the $R$-particle interference for $3\le R\le N-1$. The
genuine $N$-particle interference manifests the $N$th order quantum correlations between identical
particles at a multiport output, it does not appear in the marginal probability for a subset of the
particles, e.g., it cannot be detected if at least one of the particles is lost. This means that the
collective phases are not detectable by the usual "quantumness" criteria based on the second-order
quantum correlations. The results can be useful for quantum computation, quantum information,
and other quantum technologies with single photons. \end{abstract}
