Quantum memories can be used not only for the storage of quantum information, but also for substantial
manipulation of ensembles of quantum states. Therefore, the speed of such manipulation and the
ability to write and retrieve the signals of relatively short duration becomes important. Previously
there have been considered the limits on efficiency of the cavity-enhanced atomic Raman memories
for the signals whose duration is not much larger than the cavity field lifetime, that is, beyond
the bad cavity limit. We investigate in this work the four-wave mixing noise that arises by the retrieval
of the relatively short signals from the cavity-assisted memories, thus complementing recent
considerations by other authors, who mainly concentrated on the limit of large cavity decay rate.
The four-wave mixing noise is commonly recognized as an important factor, able to prevent achieving
a high memories quality in a variety of the atomic, solid state etc. implementations. The side-band
noise sources (with respect to the quantized signal, supported by the cavity) play important role
in the four-wave mixing. We propose an approach that allows one to account for the side-band quantum
noise sources of different physical origin in the cavity-assisted atomic memories using a unified
theoretical framework, based on a two-band spectral filtering of the noise sources. We demonstrate
that in such spectrally-selective memories the side-band atomic noise sources essentially contribute
to the four-wave mixing noise of the retrieved signal on a par with the side-band quantized field
entering the cavity.
