A finite hypergraph $H$ consists of a finite set of vertices $V(H)$ and a collection of subsets $E(H)
\subseteq 2^{V(H)}$ which we consider as partition of unity relations between projection operators.
These partition of unity relations freely generate a universal C*-algebra, which we call the "free
hypergraph C*-algebra" $C^*(H)$. General free hypergraph C*-algebras were first studied in the
context of quantum contextuality. As special cases, the class of free hypergraph C*-algebras comprises
quantum permutation groups, maximal group C*-algebras of graph products of finite cyclic groups,
and the C*-algebras associated to quantum graph homomorphism, isomorphism, and colouring. Here,
we conduct the first systematic study of aspects of free hypergraph C*-algebras. We show that they
coincide with the class of finite colimits of finite-dimensional commutative C*-algebras, and
also with the class of C*-algebras associated to synchronous nonlocal games. We had previously
shown that it is undecidable to determine whether $C^*(H)$ is nonzero for given $H$. We now show that
it is also undecidable to determine whether a given $C^*(H)$ is residually finite-dimensional,
and similarly whether it only has infinite-dimensional representations, and whether it has a tracial
state. It follows that for each one of these properties, there is $H$ such that the question whether
$C^*(H)$ has this property is independent of the ZFC axioms, assuming that these are consistent.
We clarify some of the subtleties associated with such independence results in an appendix.
