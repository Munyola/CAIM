Secret sharing allows a trusted party (the dealer) to distribute a secret to a group of players, who
can only access the secret cooperatively. Quantum secret sharing (QSS) protocols could provide
unconditional security based on fundamental laws in physics. While the general security proof
has been established recently in an entanglement-based QSS protocol, the tolerable channel loss
is unfortunately rather small. Here we propose a continuous variable QSS protocol using conventional
laser sources and homodyne detectors. In this protocol, a Gaussian-modulated coherent state (GMCS)
prepared by one player passes through the secure stations of the other players sequentially, and
each of the other players injects a locally prepared, independent GMCS into the circulating optical
mode. Finally, the dealer measures both the amplitude and phase quadratures of the receiving optical
mode using double homodyne detectors. Collectively, the players can use their encoded random numbers
to estimate the measurement results of the dealer and further generate a shared key. Unlike the existing
single photon based sequential QSS protocol, our scheme is intrinsically immune to Trojan horse
attacks. Furthermore, the additional loss introduced by each player's system can be extremely
small, which makes the protocol scalable to a large number of players. We prove the unconditional
security of the proposed protocol against both eavesdroppers and dishonest players in the presence
of high channel loss, and discuss various practical issues.
