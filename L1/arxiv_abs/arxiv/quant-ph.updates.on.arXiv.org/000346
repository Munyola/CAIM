The Kochen-Specker theorem rules out models of quantum theory wherein sharp measurements are assigned
outcomes deterministically and independently of context. This notion of noncontextuality is
not applicable to experimental measurements because these are never free of noise and thus never
truly sharp. For unsharp measurements, therefore, one must drop the requirement that an outcome
is assigned deterministically in the model and merely require that the distribution over outcomes
that is assigned in the model is context-independent. By demanding context-independence in the
representation of preparations as well, one obtains a generalized principle of noncontextuality
that also supports a quantum no-go theorem. Several recent works have shown how to derive inequalities
on experimental data which, if violated, demonstrate the impossibility of finding a generalized-noncontextual
model of this data. That is, these inequalities do not presume quantum theory and, in particular,
they make sense without requiring a notion of "sharpness" of measurements in any operational theory
describing the experiment. We here describe a technique for deriving such inequalities starting
from arbitrary proofs of the Kochen-Specker theorem. It extends significantly previous techniques,
which worked only for logical proofs (based on uncolourable orthogonality graphs), to the case
of statistical proofs (where the graphs are colourable, but the colourings cannot explain the quantum
statistics). The derived inequalities are robust to noise.
