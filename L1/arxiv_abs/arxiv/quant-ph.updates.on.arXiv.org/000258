We present a consistent analysis of linear spectroscopy for arrays of nearest neighbor dipole-coupled
two-level molecules that reveals distinct signatures of weak and strong coupling regimes separated
for infinite size arrays by a quantum critical point. In the weak coupling regime, the ground state
of the molecular array is disordered, but in the strong coupling regime it has (anti)ferroelectric
ordering. We show that multiple molecular excitations (odd/even in weak/strong coupling regime)
can be accessed directly from the ground state. We analyze the scaling of absorption and emission
with system size and find that the oscillator strengths show enhanced superradiant behavior in
both ordered and disordered phases. As the coupling increases, the single excitation oscillator
strength rapidly exceeds the well known Heitler-London value. In the strong coupling regime we
show the existence of a unique spectral transition with excitation energy that can be tuned by varying
the system size and that asymptotically approaches zero for large systems. The oscillator strength
for this transition scales quadratically with system size, showing an anomalous one-photon superradiance.
For systems of infinite size, we find a novel, singular spectroscopic signature of the quantum phase
transition between disordered and ordered ground states. We outline how arrays of ultra cold dipolar
molecules trapped in an optical lattice can be used to access the strong coupling regime and observe
the anomalous superradiant effects associated with this regime.
