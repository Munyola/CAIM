A non-relativistic quantum mechanical theory is proposed that describes the universe as a continuum
of worlds whose mutual interference gives rise to quantum phenomena. A logical framework is introduced
to properly deal with propositions about objects in a multiplicity of worlds. In this logical framework,
the continuum of worlds is treated similarly to the continuum of time points; both "time" and "world"
are considered as mutually independent modes of existence. The theory combines elements of Bohmian
mechanics and of Everett's many-worlds interpretation; it has a clear ontology and a set of precisely
defined postulates from where the predictions of standard quantum mechanics can be derived. Probability
as given by the Born rule emerges as a consequence of insufficient knowledge of observers about which
world it is that they live in. The theory describes a continuum of worlds rather than a single world
or a discrete set of worlds, so it is similar in spirit to many-worlds interpretations based on Everett's
approach, without being actually reducible to these. In particular, there is no splitting of worlds,
which is a typical feature of Everett-type theories. Altogether, the theory explains 1) the subjective
occurrence of probabilities, 2) their quantitative value as given by the Born rule, 3) the identification
of observables as self-adjoint operators on Hilbert space, and 4) the apparently random "collapse
of the wavefunction" caused by the measurement, while still being an objectively deterministic
theory.
