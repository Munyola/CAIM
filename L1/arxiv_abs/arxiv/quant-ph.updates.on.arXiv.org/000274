Recent theoretical work on time-periodically kicked Hofstadter model found robust counter-propagating
edge modes. It remains unclear how ubiquitously such anomalous modes can appear, and what dictates
their robustness against disorder. Here we shed further light on the nature of these modes by analyzing
a simple type of periodic driving where the hopping along one spatial direction is modulated sinusoidally
with time while the hopping along the other spatial direction is kept constant. We obtain the phase
diagram for the quasienergy spectrum at flux 1/3 as the driving frequency $\omega$ and the hopping
anisotropy are varied. A series of topologically distinct phases with counter-propagating edge
modes appear due to the harmonic driving, similar to the case of a periodically kicked system studied
earlier. We analyze the time dependence of the pair of Floquet edge states localized at the same edge,
and compare their Fourier components in the frequency domain. In the limit of small modulation,
one of the Floquet edge mode within the pair can be viewed as the edge mode originally living in the
other energy gap shifted in quasienergy by $\hbar \omega$, i.e., by absorption or emission of a "photon"
of frequency $\omega$. Our result suggests that counter-propagating Floquet edge modes are generic
features of periodically driven integer quantum Hall systems, and not tied to any particular driving
protocol. It also suggests that the Floquet edge modes would remain robust to any static perturbations
that do not destroy the chiral edge modes of static quantum Hall states.
