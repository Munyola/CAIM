Uncertainty relations are central to quantum physics. While they were originally formulated in
terms of variances, they have later been successfully expressed with entropies following the advent
of Shannon information theory. Here, we review recent results on entropic uncertainty relations
involving continuous variables, such as position $x$ and momentum $p$. This includes the generalization
to arbitrary (not necessarily canonically-conjugate) variables as well as entropic uncertainty
relations that take $x$-$p$ correlations into account and admit all Gaussian pure states as minimum
uncertainty states. We emphasize that these continuous-variable uncertainty relations can be
conveniently reformulated in terms of entropy power, a central quantity in the information-theoretic
description of random signals, which makes a bridge with variance-based uncertainty relations.
In this review, we take the quantum optics viewpoint and consider uncertainties on the amplitude
and phase quadratures of the electromagnetic field, which are isomorphic to $x$ and $p$, but the
formalism applies to all such variables (and linear combinations thereof) regardless of their
physical meaning. Then, in the second part of this paper, we move on to new results and introduce a
tighter entropic uncertainty relation for two arbitrary vectors of intercommuting continuous
variables that take correlations into account. It is proven conditionally on reasonable assumptions.
Finally, we present some conjectures for new entropic uncertainty relations involving more than
two continuous variables.
