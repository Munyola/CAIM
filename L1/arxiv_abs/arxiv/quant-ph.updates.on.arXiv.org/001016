Vacuum fluctuations fundamentally affect an atom by inducing a fnite excited state lifetime along
with a Lamb shift of its transition frequency. Here we report the reverse effect: modifcation of
vacuum by a single atom in circuit quantum electrodynamics. Our one-dimensional vacuum is a long
section of a high wave impedance (comparable to resistance quantum) superconducting transmission
line. It is directly wired to a transmon qubit circuit. Owing to the combination of high impedance
and galvanic connection, the transmon's spontaneous emission linewidth can greatly exceed the
discrete transmission line modes spacing. This condition defines a previously unexplored superstrong
coupling regime of quantum electrodynamics where many vacuum modes hybridize with each other through
interactions with a single atom. We explore this regime by spectroscopically measuring the positions
of over 100 consecutive transmission line resonances. The atom reveals itself as a broad peak in
the vacuum's density of states (DOS) together with the Kerr and cross-Kerr interaction of photons
at frequencies within the DOS peak. Both dispersive effects are well described by a dissipative
Caldeira-Leggett model of our circuit, with the transmon's quartic anharmonicity treated as a
perturbation. Non-perturbative modifications of such a vacuum, including inelastic scattering
of single photons, are expected upon replacing the transmon by more anharmonic circuits, with broad
implications for simulating critical dynamics of quantum impurity models.
