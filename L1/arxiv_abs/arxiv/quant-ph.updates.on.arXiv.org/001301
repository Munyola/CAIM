We study the set of two-qubit pure states with real amplitudes and their geometrical representation
onto a real projective space. In this representation, we show that the maximally entangled states
--those locally equivalent to the Bell States --form two disjoint circles perpendicular to each
other. We also show that, taking the natural Riemannian metric on this space, the set of states connected
by local gates are equidistant to this pair of circles. Moreover, the unentangled, or so called product
states, are $\pi/4$ units away to the maximally entangled states. This is, the unentangled states
are the farthest away to the maximally entangled states. In this way, if we define two states to be
equivalent if they are connected by local gates, we have that there are as many equivalent classes
as points in the interval $[0,\pi/4]$ with the point $0$ corresponding to the maximally entangled
states. The point $\pi/4$ corresponds to the unentangled states which geometrically are described
by a Klein bottle. Finally, for every $0< d < \pi/4$ the point $d$ corresponds to a disjoint pair of
Klein bottles. We also show that if a state is $d$ units away from the maximally entangled states,
then its entanglement entropy is $S(d) = 1- \log_2 \sqrt{\frac{(1+\sin 2 d)^{1+\sin 2 d}}{(1-\sin
2 d)^{-1+\sin 2 d}}}$. Finally, we also show how this geometrical interpretation allows to clearly
see the known result that any pair of two-qubit states with real amplitudes can be connected with
a circuit that only has single-qubit gates and one controlled-Z gate.
