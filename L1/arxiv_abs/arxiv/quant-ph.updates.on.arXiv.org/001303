We proposed an entangled multi-knot lattice model to explore the exotic statistics of anyon. This
knot lattice model bears abelian and non-abelian anyons as well as integral and fractional filling
states that is similar to quantum Hall system. The fusion rules of anyon are explicitly demonstrated
by braiding on crossing states of the multi-knot lattice. The statistical character of anyon is
quantified by topological linking number of multi-knot link. Long-range coupling interaction
is a fundamental character of this knot lattice model. The short range coupling models, such as Ising
model, fermion paring model, Kitaev honeycomb lattice model and so on, appears as the short range
coupling case of the knot lattice model. We introduced link lattice pattern as geometric representation
of the eigenstate of quantum many body model to explore the topological nature of quantum eigen-states.
For example, a convection flow loop is introduced into the well-know BCS fermions pairing model
to show the Pseudo-gap state in unconventional super-conducting state. The integral and fractional
filling numbers in quantum Hall system is directly quantized by topological linking number. The
quantum phase transition between different quantum states in quantum spin model is also directly
quantified by the change of topological linking number, which revealed topological character
of phase transition. This multi-knot lattice has a promising physical implementation by circularized
photons in optical firbre network. It may also provide another different path to topological quantum
computation.
