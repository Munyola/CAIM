In [Science 340, 1205, 7 June (2013)], via polytopes Michael Walter et al. proposed a sufficient
condition detecting the genuinely entangled pure states. In this paper, we indicate that generally,
the coefficient vector of a pure product state of $n$ qubits cannot be decomposed into a tensor product
of two vectors, and show that a pure state of $n$ qubits is a product state if and only if there exists
a permutation of qubits such that under the permutation, its coefficient vector arranged in ascending
lexicographical order can be decomposed into a tensor product of two vectors. The contrapositive
of this result reads that a pure state of $n$ qubits is genuinely entangled if and only if its coefficient
vector cannot be decomposed into a tensor product of two vectors under any permutation of qubits.
Further, by dividing a coefficient vector into $2^{i}$ equal-size block vectors, we show that the
coefficient vector can be decomposed into a tensor product of two vectors if and only if any two non-zero
block vectors of the coefficient vector are proportional. In terms of \textquotedblleft proportionality\textquotedblright
, we can rephrase that a pure state of $n$ qubits is genuinely entangled if and only if there are two
non-zero block vectors of the coefficient vector which are not proportional under any permutation
of qubits. Thus, we avoid decomposing a coefficient vector into a tensor product of two vectors to
detect the genuine entanglement. We also present the full decomposition theorem for product states
of n qubits.
