We study the localization properties, energy spectra and coin-position entanglement of the aperiodic
discrete-time quantum walks. The aperiodicity is described by spatially dependent quantum coins
distributed on the lattice, whose distribution is neither periodic (Bloch-like) nor random (Anderson-like).
Within transport properties we identified delocalized/localized quantum walks mediated by a
proper adjusting of aperiodic parameter. Both scenarios are studied by exploring typical quantities
(inverse participation ratio and survival probability), as well as the energy spectra of an associated
effective Hamiltonian. By using the energy spectra analysis, we show that the early stage the inhomogeneity
leads to vanishing gap between two main bands, which justifies the the delocalized character observed
for $\nu<0.5$. With increase of $\nu$ arises gaps and flat-bands on the energy spectra, which corroborates
the suppresion of transport detected for $\nu>0.5$. For $\nu$ high enough we observe an energy spectra
which resembles that described by the 1d Anderson model. Within coin-position entanglement, we
show many settings in which an enhancement in the ability to entangle is observed. This behavior
brings new informations about the role played by aperiodicity on the coin-poisition entanglement
for static inhomogeneous systems, reported before as almost always reducing the entanglement
when comparing with the homogeneous case. We extend the analysis in order to show that systems with
static inhomogeneity are able to exhibit asymptotic limit of entanglement.
