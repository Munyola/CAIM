Even after almost a century, the foundations of quantum statistical mechanics are still not completely
understood. In this work, we provide a precise account on these foundations for a class of systems
of paradigmatic importance that appear frequently as mean-field models in condensed matter physics,
namely non-interacting lattice models of fermions (with straightforward extension to bosons).
We demonstrate that already the translation invariance of the Hamiltonian governing the dynamics
and a finite correlation length of the possibly non-Gaussian initial state provide sufficient
structure to make mathematically precise statements about the equilibration of the system towards
a generalized Gibbs ensemble, even for highly non-translation invariant initial states far from
ground states of non-interacting models. Whenever these are given, the system will equilibrate
rapidly according to a power-law in time as long as there are no long-wavelength dislocations in
the initial second moments that would render the system resilient to relaxation. Our proof technique
is rooted in the machinery of Kusmin-Landau bounds. Subsequently, we numerically illustrate our
analytical findings by discussing quench scenarios with an initial state corresponding to an Anderson
insulator observing power-law equilibration. We discuss the implications of the results for the
understanding of current quantum simulators, both in how one can understand the behaviour of equilibration
in time, as well as concerning perspectives for realizing distinct instances of generalized Gibbs
ensembles in optical lattice-based architectures.
