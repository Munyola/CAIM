Bob hides a ball in one of four drawers. Alice is to locate it. Classically, to be a-priori certain
of solving the problem, Alice should plan to open three drawers; quantally, just one. There is not
yet an exact explanation of the fundamental mechanism of this "quantum speedup". We extend the representation
of the quantum algorithm to the choice of the number of the drawer with the ball. The correlation between
this number and the solution (that same number) becomes quantum in character. There is thus a redundancy
between the initial measurement performed by Bob to prepare the ball in the desired drawer and the
final measurement performed by Alice to read the solution. Either measurement selects the number
of the drawer with the ball. The measurement postulate does not specify which measurement does what.
A reasonable disambiguation of the postulate (one that avoids all redundancy and satisfies the
symmetry of the measurement situation) explains the speedup. All is as if Alice, by reading the solution,
contributed jointly with Bob to selecting the number of the drawer with the ball. Relativizing the
extended representation with respect to Alice shows that she knows her contribution in advance,
before performing any computation. The quantum algorithm turns out to be a sum over classical histories
in each of which Alice knows in advance that the ball is in one of a pair of drawers and locates it by opening
one of the two. More in general, given an oracle problem, the present explanation defines the number
of oracle queries required to solve it quantally in an optimal way.
