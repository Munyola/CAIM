Open Source Software (OSS) has been widely used in the educational environment largely due to its
reduced cost of ownership. While OSS has evolved over the years, challenges exist in its implementation
and wide adoption. Foremost among these detriments is the lack of available skills across industries.
Since future users of this technology will settle in an organizational ecosystem where proprietary
and OSS technologies coexist, it is vital to understand their learning environment where they initially
acquire their technology skills. The University implements courses that champion the use of open
source technologies within its curricula. However, other courses are also anchored on technologies
that are proprietary. This study is based on the premise that training or the learning experience
and visibility or the prevalence of OSS in the environment influences its adoption among students.
Empirical evidences explore the relationship of visibility and training in the adoption of OSS
from the perspectives of students in a Philippine university. A modified Technology Acceptance
Model incorporating additional constructs is validated using Partial Least Squares Structural
Equation Model. Results of the study confirms the applicability of TAM in this study, training has
positive influence on both perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness and visibility has a positive
influence on perceived ease of use towards initial acceptability of students of OSS. Educational
implications of the study are discussed, limitations are acknowledged and research frontiers
are recommended.
