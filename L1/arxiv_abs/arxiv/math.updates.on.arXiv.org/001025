Weighted projective lines, introduced by Geigle and Lenzing in 1987, are one of the basic objects
in representation theory. One key property is that they have tilting bundles, whose endomorphism
algebras are the canonical algebras introduced by Ringel. The aim of this paper is to study their
higher dimensional analogs. First, we introduce a certain class of commutative rings $R$ graded
by abelian groups $L$ of rank $1$, which we call Geigle-Lenzing complete intersections. We study
their Cohen-Macaulay representations, and show that there always exists a tilting object in the
stable category of ${\mathsf CM}^LR$. As an application we study when $(R,L)$ is $d$-Cohen-Macaulay
finite in the sense of higher dimensional Auslander-Reiten theory. Secondly, by applying the Serre
construction to $(R,L)$, we introduce the category ${\mathsf coh} X$ of coherent sheaves on a Geigle-Lenzing
projective space $X$. We show that there always exists a tilting bundle $T$ on $X$, and study the endomorphism
algebra ${\rm End}_X(T)$ which we call a $d$-canonical algebra. Further we study when ${\mathsf
coh} X$ is derived equivalent to a $d$-representation infinite algebra in the sense of higher dimensional
Auslander-Reiten theory. Also we show that $d$-canonical algebras provide a rich source of $d$-Fano
and $d$-anti-Fano algebras from non-commutative algebraic geometry. Moreover we observe Orlov-type
semiorthogonal decompositions between the stable category of ${\mathsf CM}^LR$ and the derived
category $D^b({\mathsf coh} X)$.
