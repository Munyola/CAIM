We study mixed surfaces, the minimal resolution S of the singularities of a quotient of the square
of a curve by a finite group G of automorphisms that contains elements not preserving the factors.
We study them through certain maps they natural carry, obtained by enlarging G. We call these maps
further quotients. As first applications we prove that if the irregularity of S is at least 2, then
S has maximal Albanese dimension, and if the irregularity is at least 3, then S is also minimal. Both
results are sharp. We associate a further quotient to every normal subgroup of G that acts preserving
the factors, and we study the ramifications of these further quotients. We show that, in the maximal
Albanese dimension case, the Albanese morphism of S may be studied through such a further quotient
that is \'etale cover of the symmetric square of a curve. This leaded us to consider certain quotients
by generalized dihedral group that we call dihedral surfaces. We give a criterion for normal subgroups
of G to induce a further quotient that is a dihedral surface. If such a subgroup exist, we can use the
corresponding further quotient to study the Albanese morphism of S. We run the method for 8 different
families of mixed surfaces, and precisely for all the semi-isogenous mixed surfaces of maximal
Albanese dimension constructed by Cancian and Frapporti. We describe in detail their Albanese
morphism, and use this description to relate them with the other constructions of surfaces of general
type with the same invariants in the literature.
