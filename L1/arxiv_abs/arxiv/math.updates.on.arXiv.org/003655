The Segal algebra ${\textbf{S}}_{0}(G)$ is well defined for arbitrary locally compact Abelian
Hausdorff (LCA) groups $G$. Despite the fact that it is a Banach space it is possible to derive a kernel
theorem similar to the Schwartz kernel theorem, of course without making use of the Schwartz kernel
theorem. First we characterize the bounded linear operators from ${\textbf{S}}_{0}(G_1)$ to
${\textbf{S}}_{0}'(G_2)$ by distributions in ${\textbf{S}}_{0}'(G_1 \times G_2)$. We call
this the "outer kernel theorem". The "inner kernel theorem" is concerned with the characterization
of those linear operators which have kernels in the subspace ${\textbf{S}}_{0}(G_1 \times G_2)$,
the main subject of this manuscript. We provide a description of such operators as regularizing
operators in our context, mapping ${\textbf{S}}_{0}'(G_1)$ into test functions in ${\textbf{S}}_{0}(G_2)$,
in a $w^{*}$-to norm continuous manner. The presentation provides a detailed functional analytic
treatment of the situation and applies to the case of general LCA groups, without recurrence to the
use of so-called Wilson bases, which have been used for the case of elementary LCA groups. The approach
is then used in order to describe natural laws of composition which imitate the composition of linear
mappings via matrix multiplications, now in a continuous setting. We use here that in a suitable
(weak) form these operators approximate general operators. We also provide an explanation and
mathematical justification used by engineers explaining in which sense pure frequencies "integrate"
to a Dirac delta distribution.
