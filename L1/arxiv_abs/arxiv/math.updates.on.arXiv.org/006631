In this paper we introduce a technique to produce tighter cutting planes for mixed-integer non-linear
programs. Usually, a cutting plane is generated to cut off a specific infeasible point. The underlying
idea is to use the infeasible point to restrict the feasible region in order to obtain a tighter domain.
To ensure validity, we require that every valid cut separating the infeasible point from the restricted
feasible region is still valid for the original feasible region. We translate this requirement
in terms of the separation problem and the reverse polar. In particular, if the reverse polar of the
restricted feasible region is the same as the reverse polar of the feasible region, then any cut valid
for the restricted feasible region that separates the infeasible point, is valid for the feasible
region. We show that the reverse polar of the visible points of the feasible region from the infeasible
point coincides with the reverse polar of the feasible region. In the special where the feasible
region is described by a single non-convex constraint intersected with a convex set we provide a
characterization of the visible points. Furthermore, when the non-convex constraint is quadratic
the characterization is particularly simple. We also provide an extended formulation for a relaxation
of the visible points when the non-convex constraint is a general polynomial. Finally, we give some
conditions under which for a given set there is an inclusion-wise smallest set, in some predefined
family of sets, whose reverse polars coincide.
