This paper considers a Cram\'er-Lundberg risk setting, where the components of the underlying
model change over time. These components could be thought of as the claim arrival rate, the claim-size
distribution, and the premium rate, but we allow the more general setting of the cumulative claim
process being modelled as a spectrally positive L\'evy process. We provide an intuitively appealing
mechanism to create such parameter uncertainty: at Poisson epochs we resample the model components
from a finite number of $d$ settings. It results in a setup that is particularly suited to describe
situations in which the risk reserve dynamics are affected by external processes (such as the state
of the economy, political developments, weather or climate conditions, and policy regulations).
We extend the classical Cram\'er-Lundberg approximation (asymptotically characterizing the
all-time ruin probability in a light-tailed setting) to this more general setup. In addition, for
the situation that the driving L\'evy processes are sums of Brownian motions and compound Poisson
processes, we find an explicit uniform bound on the ruin probability, which can be viewed as an extension
of Lundberg's inequality; importantly, here it is not required that the L\'evy processes be spectrally
one-sided. In passing we propose an importance-sampling algorithm facilitating efficient estimation,
and prove it has bounded relative error. In a series of numerical experiments we assess the accuracy
of the asymptotics and bounds, and illustrate that neglecting the resampling can lead to substantial
underestimation of the risk.
