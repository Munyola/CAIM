This paper studies two related topology design problems: given a collection of weighted links,
including links among state variables or from existing inputs to state variables, how to construct
a system with the minimal cost under structural controllability constraint; and conversely, how
to determine the minimal cost of links whose deletion deteriorates structural controllability
of the system. It is proved that both of these two problems are NP-hard. As for approximation, there
exists a 2- approximation algorithm for the first problem admitting iterative improvements, and
any multiplicative factor approximation for the minimal cost 1-block problem for bipartite graphs
is also the approximation factor for the second problem. Two subproblems of the above problems are
also studied, which can be addressed equivalently as determining the graph edit distance of a linear
structurally uncontrollable (respectively, controllable) system to its nearest structurally
controllable (respectively, uncontrollable) system with the same state variables and inputs.
A polynomial time algorithm is given for the first subproblem characterizing optimal solutions.
Some variants of the above problems are also considered, where the insertable links are restricted
in state links, or the deletable links are restricted in input ones. Examples are finally presented
to illustrate our results. These results may serve an answer to the general hardness of optimally
designing a structurally controllable network topology and measuring its robustness against
link failures.
