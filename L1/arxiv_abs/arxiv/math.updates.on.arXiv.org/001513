We study mixed surfaces, that are surfaces $S$ that are minimal resolution of the singularities
of a quotient of $C \times C$, the square of a curve, by a finite group $G$ of automorphisms that contains
elements not preserving the factors. We study them through certain maps they natural carry, obtained
by enlarging $G$. We call these maps further quotients. As first applications we prove that if the
irregularity of $S$ is at least $2$, then $S$ has maximal Albanese dimension, and if the irregularity
is at least $3$, then $S$ is also minimal. Both results are sharp. We associate then a further quotient
to every normal subgroup of $G$ that acts preserving the factors, and we study the ramifications
of these further quotients. This leaded us to consider certain quotients by generalized dihedral
group that we call dihedral surfaces. They are \'etale covers of the symmetric square of a curve,
and turned out to be very useful for studying the Albanese morphism of a mixed surface. We give a criterion
for normal subgroups of $G$ to induce a further quotient that is a dihedral surface. If such a subgroup
exist, we can use the corresponding further quotient to study the Albanese morphism of $S$. To show
how to do it, we run the method for $8$ different families of mixed surfaces, and precisely for all
the semi-isogenous mixed surfaces of maximal Albanese dimension constructed by Cancian and Frapporti.
We describe in detail their Albanese morphism, and use this description to relate them with the other
constructions of surfaces of general type with the same invariants in the literature.
