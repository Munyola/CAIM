For standard algorithms verifying positive definiteness of a matrix $A\in\mathbb{M}_n(\mathbb{R})$
based on Sylvester's criterion, the computationally pessimistic case is this when $A$ is positive
definite. We present two algorithms realizing the same task for $A\in\mathbb{M}_n(\mathbb{Z})$,
for which the case when $A$ is positive definite is the optimistic one. The algorithms have pessimistic
computational complexities $\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ and $\mathcal{O}(n^4)$ and they rely on performing
certain edge transformations, called inflations, on the edge-bipartite graph (=bigraph) $\Delta=\Delta(A)$
associated with $A$. We provide few variants of the algorithms, including Las Vegas type randomized
ones with precisely described maximal number of steps. The algorithms work very well in practice,
in many cases with a better speed than the standard tests. Moreover, the algorithms yield some additional
information on the properties on the quadratic form $q_A:\mathbb{Z}^n\to\mathbb{Z}$ associated
with a matrix $A$. On the other hand, our results provide an interesting example of an application
of symbolic computing methods originally developed for different purposes, with a big potential
for further generalizations in matrix problems. This is an extended version of the article [A. Mr\'oz,
Effective nondeterministic positive definiteness test for unidiagonal integral matrices, Proceedings
SYNASC 2016, IEEE Computer Society CPS (2016), 65-71] in which we discussed the algorithm of the
complexity $\mathcal{O}(n^4)$.
