A common method for analyzing the effects of molecular noise in chemical reaction networks is to
approximate the underlying chemical master equation by a Fokker-Planck equation, and to study
the statistics of the associated chemical Langevin equation. This so-called diffusion approximation
involves performing a perturbation expansion with respect to a small dimensionless parameter
$\epsilon =\Omega^{-1}$, where $\Omega$ characterizes the system size. For example, $\Omega$
could be the mean number of proteins produced by a gene regulatory network. In the deterministic
limit $\Omega\rightarrow \infty$, the chemical reaction network evolves according to a system
of ordinary differential equations based on classical mass action kinetics. In this paper we develop
a phase reduction method for chemical reaction networks that support a stable limit cycle in the
deterministic limit. We present a variational principle for the phase reduction, yielding an exact
analytic expression for the resulting phase dynamics. We demonstrate that this decomposition
is accurate over timescales that are exponential in the system size $\Omega$. This contrasts with
the phase equation obtained under the diffusion approximation, which is only accurate up to times
$O(\Omega)$. In particular, we show that for a constant $C$, the probability that the system leaves
an $O(\zeta)$ neighborhood of the limit cycle before time $T$ scales as $T\exp\big(-C\Omega b\zeta^2
\big)$, where $b$ is the rate of attraction to the limit cycle. We illustrate our analysis using the
example of a chemical Brusselator.
