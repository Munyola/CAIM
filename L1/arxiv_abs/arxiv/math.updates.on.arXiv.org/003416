Empirical observations show that ecological communities can have a huge number of coexisting species,
also with few or limited number of resources. These ecosystems are characterized by multiple type
of interactions, in particular displaying cooperative behaviors. However, standard modeling
of population dynamics based on Lotka-Volterra type of equations predicts that ecosystem stability
should decrease as the number of species in the community increases and that cooperative systems
are less stable than communities with only competitive and/or exploitative interactions. Here
we propose a stochastic model of population dynamics, which includes exploitative interactions
as well as cooperative interactions induced by cross-feeding. The model is exactly solved and we
obtain results for relevant macro-ecological patterns, such as species abundance distributions
and correlation functions. In the large system size limit, any number of species can coexist for
a very general class of interaction networks and stability increases as the number of species grows.
For pure mutualistic/commensalistic interactions we determine the topological properties of
the network that guarantee species coexistence. We also show that the stationary state is globally
stable and that inferring species interactions through species abundance correlation analysis
may be misleading. Our theoretical approach thus show that appropriate models of cooperation naturally
leads to a solution of the long-standing question about complexity-stability paradox and on how
highly biodiverse communities can coexist.
