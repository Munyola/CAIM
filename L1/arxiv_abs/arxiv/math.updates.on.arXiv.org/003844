We provide a mathematical formulation and develop a computational framework for identifying multiple
strains of microorganisms from mixed samples of DNA. Our method is applicable in public health domains
where efficient identification of pathogens is paramount, e.g., for the monitoring of disease
outbreaks. We formulate strain identification as an inverse problem that aims at simultaneously
estimating a binary matrix (encoding presence or absence of mutations in each strain) and a real-valued
vector (representing the mixture of strains) such that their product is approximately equal to
the measured data vector. The problem at hand has a similar structure to blind deconvolution, except
for the presence of binary constraints, which we enforce in our approach. Following a Bayesian approach,
we derive a posterior density. We present two computational methods for solving the non-convex
maximum a posteriori estimation problem. The first one is a local optimization method that is made
efficient and scalable by decoupling the problem into smaller independent subproblems, whereas
the second one yields a global minimizer by converting the problem into a convex mixed-integer quadratic
programming problem. The decoupling approach also provides an efficient way to integrate over
the posterior. This provides useful information about the ambiguity of the underdetermined problem
and, thus, the uncertainty associated with numerical solutions. We evaluate the potential and
limitations of our framework in silico using synthetic and experimental data with available ground
truths.
