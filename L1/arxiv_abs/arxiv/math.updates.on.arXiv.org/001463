We present a model for the dynamics of a population of bacteria with a continuum of traits, who compete
for resources and exchange horizontally (transfer) an otherwise vertically inherited trait with
possible mutations. Competition influences individual demographics, affecting population
size, which feeds back on the dynamics of transfer. We consider a stochastic individual-based pure
jump process taking values in the space of point measures, and whose jump events describe the individual
reproduction, transfer and death mechanisms. In a large population scale, the stochastic process
is proved to converge to the solution of a nonlinear integro-differential equation. When there
are only two different traits and no mutation, this equation reduces to a non-standard two-dimensional
dynamical system. We show how crucial the forms of the transfer rates are for the long-term behavior
of its solutions. We describe the dynamics of invasion and fixation when one of the two traits is initially
rare, and compute the invasion probabilities. Then, we study the process under the assumption of
rare mutations. We prove that the stochastic process at the mutation time scale converges to a jump
process which describes the successive invasions of successful mutants. We show that the horizontal
transfer can have a major impact on the distribution of the successive mutational fixations, leading
to dramatically different behaviors, from expected evolution scenarios to evolutionary suicide.
Simulations are given to illustrate these phenomena.
