In this paper, the minimization of computational cost on evaluating multi-dimensional integrals
is explored. More specifically, a method based on an adaptive scheme for error variance selection
in Monte Carlo integration (MCI) is presented. It uses a stochastic Efficient Global Optimization
(sEGO) framework to guide the optimization search. The MCI is employed to approximate the integrals,
because it provides the variance of the error in the integration. In the proposed approach, the variance
of the integration error is included into a Stochastic Kriging framework by setting a target variance
in the MCI. We show that the variance of the error of the MCI may be controlled by the designer and that
its value strongly influences the computational cost and the exploration ability of the optimization
process. Hence, we propose an adaptive scheme for automatic selection of the target variance during
the sEGO search. The robustness and efficiency of the proposed adaptive approach were evaluated
on global optimization stochastic benchmark functions as well as on a tuned mass damper design problem.
The results showed that the proposed adaptive approach consistently outperformed the constant
approach and a multi-start optimization method. Moreover, the use of MCI enabled the method application
in problems with high number of stochastic dimensions. On the other hand, the main limitation of
the method is inherited from sEGO coupled with the Kriging metamodel: the efficiency of the approach
is reduced when the number of design variables increases.
