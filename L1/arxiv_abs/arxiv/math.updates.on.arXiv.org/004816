In this work, we consider the singular set in the thin obstacle problem with weight $|x_{n+1}|^a$
for $a\in (-1, 1)$, which arises as the local extension of the obstacle problem for the fractional
Laplacian (a non-local problem). We develop a refined expansion of the solution around its singular
points by building on the ideas introduced by Figalli and Serra to study the fine properties of the
singular set in the classical obstacle problem. As a result, under a superharmonicity condition
on the obstacle, we prove that each stratum of the singular set is locally contained in a single $C^2$
manifold, up to a lower dimensional subset, and the top stratum is locally contained in a $C^{1,\alpha}$
manifold for some $\alpha > 0$ if $a < 0$. In studying the top stratum, we discover a dichotomy, until
now unseen, in this problem (or, equivalently, the fractional obstacle problem). We find that second
blow-ups at singular points in the top stratum are global, homogeneous solutions to a codimension
two lower dimensional obstacle problem (or fractional thin obstacle problem) when $a < 0$, whereas
second blow-ups at singular points in the top stratum are global, homogeneous, and $a$-harmonic
polynomials when $a \geq 0$. To do so, we establish regularity results for this codimension two problem,
what we call the very thin obstacle problem. Our methods extend to the majority of the singular set
even when no sign assumption on the Laplacian of the obstacle is made. In this general case, we are
able to prove that the singular set can be covered by countably many $C^2$ manifolds, up to a lower
dimensional subset.
