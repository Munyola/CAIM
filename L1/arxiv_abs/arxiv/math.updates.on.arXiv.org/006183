Hybrid precoding is a cost-effective approach to support directional transmissions for millimeter-wave
(mm-wave) communications, but its precoder design is highly complicated. In this paper, we propose
a new hybrid precoder implementation, namely the double phase shifter (DPS) implementation, which
enables highly tractable hybrid precoder design. Efficient algorithms are then developed for
two popular hybrid precoder structures, i.e., the fully- and partially-connected structures.
For the fully-connected one, the RF-only precoding and hybrid precoding problems are formulated
as a least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) problem and a low-rank matrix approximation
problem, respectively. In this way, computationally efficient algorithms are provided to approach
the performance of the fully digital one with a small number of radio frequency (RF) chains. On the
other hand, the hybrid precoder design in the partially-connected structure is identified as an
eigenvalue problem. To enhance the performance of this cost-effective structure, dynamic mapping
from RF chains to antennas is further proposed, for which a greedy algorithm and a modified K-means
algorithm are developed. Simulation results demonstrate the performance gains of the proposed
hybrid precoding algorithms over existing ones. It shows that, with the proposed DPS implementation,
the fully-connected structure enjoys both satisfactory performance and low design complexity
while the partially-connected one serves as an economic solution with low hardware complexity.
