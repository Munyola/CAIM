We show that if $\kappa$ is even and some variety $\mathcal V$ is congruence modular as witnessed
by $k+1$ Day terms then, for every $q \geq 1$, $\mathcal V$ satisfies the congruence identity $ \alpha
( \beta \circ \alpha \gamma \circ \beta \circ \dotsc \circ \alpha \gamma \circ \beta ) \subseteq
\alpha \beta \circ \alpha \gamma \circ \alpha \beta \circ \dots$, with $2 ^{q+1}-1 $ factors on the
left-hand side and $ \frac{ k^q}{2 ^{q-1} }$ factors on the right-hand side. Here juxtaposition
denotes intersection and terms as $\alpha \gamma $ are counted as a single factor. If $\mathcal V$
has $n+2$ Gumm terms and $q \geq 2$, then the above identity holds with $2^q -1 $ factors on the left
and $ (2^{q+1}-2q-2)n+3$ factors on the right. So far, in general, the best evaluation is obtained
by combining the two methods. It is an open problem whether there is a better way. Other open problems
related to similar identities are discussed. The results might shed new light to the problem of the
relationship between the number of Day terms and the number of Gumm terms for a congruence modular
variety. By the way, we use Gumm terms also in order to give bounds of the form $ \alpha (\beta \circ
\gamma \circ \beta \circ \dots ) \subseteq \alpha ( \gamma \circ \beta ) \circ (\alpha \gamma \circ
\alpha \beta \circ \alpha \gamma \circ \dots )$, with appropriate numbers of factors. This extends
ideas of S. Tschantz. We also slightly improve a result by A. Day, to the effect that if $n$ is even,
then every variety with $n+2$ J\'onsson terms has $2n+1$ Day terms.
