In biodiversity conservation it is often necessary to prioritize the species to conserve. Existing
approaches to prioritization, e.g. the Fair Proportion Index and the Shapley Value, are based on
phylogenetic trees and rank species according to their contribution to overall phylogenetic diversity.
However, in many cases evolution is not treelike and thus, phylogenetic networks have come to the
fore as a generalization of phylogenetic trees, allowing for the representation of non-treelike
evolutionary events, such as horizontal gene transfer or hybridization. Here, we extend the concepts
of phylogenetic diversity and phylogenetic diversity indices from phylogenetic trees to phylogenetic
networks. On the one hand, we consider the treelike content of a phylogenetic network, e.g. the (multi)set
of phylogenetic trees displayed by a network and the LSA tree associated with it. On the other hand,
we derive the phylogenetic diversity of subsets of taxa and biodiversity indices directly from
the internal structure of the network. Furthermore, we introduce our software package NetDiversity,
which was implemented in Perl and allows for the calculation of all generalized measures of phylogenetic
diversity and generalized phylogenetic diversity indices established in this note that are independent
of inheritance probabilities. We apply our methods to a phylogentic network representing the evolutionary
relationships among swordtails and platyfishes (Xiphophorus: Poeciliidae), a group of species
characterized by widespread hybridization.
