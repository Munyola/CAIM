Some new directions to lay a rigorous mathematical foundation for the phase-portrait-based modelling
of fingerprints are discussed in the present work. Couched in the language of dynamical systems,
and preparing to a preliminary modelling, a back-to-basics analogy between Poincar\'{e}'s categories
of equilibria of planar differential systems and the basic fingerprint singularities according
to Purkyn\v{e}-Galton's standards is first investigated. Then, the problem of the global representation
of a fingerprint's flow-like pattern as a smooth deformation of the phase portrait of a differential
system is addressed. Unlike visualisation in fluid dynamics, where similarity between integral
curves of smooth vector fields and flow streamline patterns is eye-catching, the case of an oriented
texture like a fingerprint's stream of ridges proved to be a hard problem since, on the one hand, not
all fingerprint singularities and nearby orientational behaviour can be modelled by canonical
phase portraits on the plane, and on the other hand, even if it were the case, this should lead to a perplexing
geometrical problem of connecting local phase portraits, a question which will be formulated within
Poincar\'{e}'s index theory and addressed via a normal form approach as a bivariate Hermite interpolation
problem. To a certain extent, the material presented herein is self-contained and provides a baseline
for future work where, starting from a normal form as a source image, a transport via large deformation
flows is envisaged to match the fingerprint as a target image.
