A third-order moving mesh cell-centered scheme without the remapping of physical variables is
developed for the numerical solution of one-dimensional elastic-plastic flows with the Mie-Gr\"{u}neisen
equation of state, the Wilkins constitutive model, and the von Mises yielding criterion. The scheme
combines the Lagrangian method with the MMPDE moving mesh method and adaptively moves the mesh to
better resolve shock and other types of waves while preventing the mesh from crossing and tangling.
It can be viewed as a direct arbitrarily Lagrangian-Eulerian method but can also be degenerated
to a purely Lagrangian scheme. It treats the relative velocity of the fluid with respect to the mesh
as constant in time between time steps, which allows high-order approximation of free boundaries.
A time dependent scaling is used in the monitor function to avoid possible sudden movement of the
mesh points due to the creation or diminishing of shock and rarefaction waves or the steepening of
those waves. A two-rarefaction Riemann solver with elastic waves is employed to compute the Godunov
values of the density, pressure, velocity, and deviatoric stress at cell interfaces. Numerical
results are presented for three examples. The third-order convergence of the scheme and its ability
to concentrate mesh points around shock and elastic rarefaction waves are demonstrated. The obtained
numerical results are in good agreement with those in literature. The new scheme is also shown to
be more accurate in resolving shock and rarefaction waves than an existing third-order cell-centered
Lagrangian scheme.
