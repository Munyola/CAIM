The Twin Prime conjecture states that there are infinitely many pairs of distinct primes which differ
by $2$. Until recently this conjecture had seemed to be far out of reach with current techniques.
However, in April 2013, Yitang Zhang proved the existence of a finite bound $B$ such that there are
infinitely many pairs of distinct primes which differ by no more than $B$. This is a massive breakthrough,
making the twin prime conjecture look highly plausible, and the techniques developed help us to
better understand other delicate questions about prime numbers that had previously seemed intractable.
Zhang even showed that one can take $B = 70000000$. Moreover, a co-operative team, \emph{polymath8},
collaborating only on-line, had been able to lower the value of $B$ to ${4680}$. They had not only
been more careful in several difficult arguments in Zhang's original paper, they had also developed
Zhang's techniques to be both more powerful and to allow a much simpler proof (and forms the basis
for the proof presented herein). In November 2013, inspired by Zhang's extraordinary breakthrough,
James Maynard dramatically slashed this bound to $600$, by a substantially easier method. Both
Maynard, and Terry Tao who had independently developed the same idea, were able to extend their proofs
to show that for any given integer $m\geq 1$ there exists a bound $B_m$ such that there are infinitely
many intervals of length $B_m$ containing at least $m$ distinct primes. We will also prove this much
stronger result herein, even showing that one can take $B_m=e^{8m+5}$.
