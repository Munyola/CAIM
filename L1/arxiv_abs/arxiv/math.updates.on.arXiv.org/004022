A family of Gaussian analytic functions (GAFs) has recently been linked to the Gabor transform of
white Gaussian noise [Bardenet et al., 2017]. This answered pioneering work by Flandrin [2015],
who observed that the zeros of the Gabor transform of white noise had a very regular distribution
and proposed filtering algorithms based on the zeros of a spectrogram. The mathematical link with
GAFs provides a wealth of probabilistic results to inform the design of such signal processing procedures.
In this paper, we study in a systematic way the link between GAFs and a class of time-frequency transforms
of Gaussian white noises on Hilbert spaces of signals. Our main observation is a conceptual correspondence
between pairs (transform, GAF) and generating functions for classical orthogonal polynomials.
This correspondence covers some classical time-frequency transforms, such as the Gabor transform
and the Daubechies-Paul analytic wavelet transform. It also unveils new windowed discrete Fourier
transforms, which map white noises to fundamental GAFs. All these transforms may thus be of interest
to the research program `filtering with zeros'. We also identify the GAF whose zeros are the extrema
of the Gabor transform of the white noise and derive their first intensity. Moreover, we discuss
important subtleties in defining a white noise and its transform on infinite dimensional Hilbert
spaces. Finally, we provide quantitative estimates concerning the finite-dimensional approximations
of these white noises, which is of practical interest when it comes to implementing signal processing
algorithms based on GAFs.
