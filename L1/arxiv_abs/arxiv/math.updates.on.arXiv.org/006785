The quality of datasets is a critical issue in big data mining. More interesting things could be mined
from datasets with higher quality. The existence of missing values in geographical data would worsen
the quality of big datasets. To improve the data quality, the missing values are generally needed
to be estimated using various machine learning algorithms or mathematical methods such as approximations
and interpolations. In this paper, we propose an adaptive Radial Basis Function (RBF) interpolation
algorithm for estimating missing values in geographical data. In the proposed method, the samples
with known values are considered as the data points, while the samples with missing values are considered
as the interpolated points. For each interpolated point, first, a local set of data points are adaptively
determined. Then, the missing value of the interpolated point is imputed via interpolating using
the RBF interpolation based on the local set of data points. Moreover, the shape factors of the RBF
are also adaptively determined by considering the distribution of the local set of data points.
To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, we compare our method with the commonly used
k Nearest Neighbors (kNN) interpolation and Adaptive Inverse Distance Weighted (AIDW) methods,
and conduct three groups of benchmark experiments. Experimental results indicate that the proposed
method outperforms the kNN interpolation and AIDW in terms of accuracy, but worse than the kNN interpolation
and AIDW in terms of efficiency.
