Based on elementary one-sided (first-order) directional derivatives and their extensions to
second order, we introduce several local properties of non-convex, non-differentiable functions
at a given point, and discuss their realizations in piecewise affine statistical estimation problems,
with or without sparsity control. These properties provide sufficient conditions under which
the following local optimality questions can be positively answered for a constrained optimization
problem with first-order, and respectively, second-order directionally differentiable objective
functions. When is first-order directional stationarity necessary and sufficient for local minimizing?
When is weak second-order directional stationarity necessary and sufficient for local minimizing?
We also show that for a twice directionally differentiable objective, the strongly locally minimizing
property of a first-order directional stationary solution can be characterized in terms of a strong
second-order directional stationarity condition. The introduced properties are of a local pointwise
convexity and generalized convexity type, they are shown to be invariant under composition with
piecewise affine functions. For a special class of unconstrained problems with a smooth objective
function plus the non-differentiable $\ell_1$-function, we show that the task of verifying the
second-order directional stationarity condition can be converted to the problem of checking the
copositivity of certain Schur complement on the nonnegative
