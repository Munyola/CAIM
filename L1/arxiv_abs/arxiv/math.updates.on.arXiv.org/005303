This paper develops a computational framework with unfitted meshes to solve linear piezoelectricity
and flexoelectricity electromechanical boundary value problems including strain gradient elasticity
at infinitesimal strains. The high-order nature of the coupled PDE system is addressed by a sufficiently
smooth hierarchical B-spline approximation on a background Cartesian mesh. The domain of interest
is embedded into the background mesh and discretized in an unfitted fashion. The immersed boundary
approach allows us to use B-splines on arbitrary domain shapes, regardless of their geometrical
complexity, and could be directly extended, for instance, to shape and topology optimization.
The domain boundary is represented by NURBS, and exactly integrated by means of the NEFEM mapping.
Local adaptivity is achieved by hierarchical refinement of B-spline basis, which are efficiently
evaluated and integrated thanks to their piecewise polynomial definition. Nitsche's formulation
is derived to weakly enforce essential boundary conditions, accounting also for the non-local
conditions on the non-smooth portions of the domain boundary (i.e. edges in 3D or corners in 2D) arising
from Mindlin's strain gradient elasticity theory. Boundary conditions modeling sensing electrodes
are formulated and enforced following the same approach. Optimal error convergence rates are reported
using high-order B-spline approximations. The method is verified against available analytical
solutions and well-known benchmarks from the literature.
