We consider the problem of minimizing a difference-of-convex (DC) function, which can be written
as the sum of a smooth convex function with Lipschitz gradient, a proper closed convex function and
a continuous possibly nonsmooth concave function. We refine the convergence analysis in [38] for
the proximal DC algorithm with extrapolation (pDCA$_e$) and show that the whole sequence generated
by the algorithm is convergent when the objective is level-bounded, {\em without} imposing differentiability
assumptions in the concave part. Our analysis is based on a new potential function and we assume such
a function is a Kurdyka-{\L}ojasiewicz (KL) function. We also establish a relationship between
our KL assumption and the one used in [38]. Finally, we demonstrate how the pDCA$_e$ can be applied
to a class of simultaneous sparse recovery and outlier detection problems arising from robust compressed
sensing in signal processing and least trimmed squares regression in statistics. Specifically,
we show that the objectives of these problems can be written as level-bounded DC functions whose
concave parts are {\em typically nonsmooth}. Moreover, for a large class of loss functions and regularizers,
the KL exponent of the corresponding potential function are shown to be 1/2, which implies that the
pDCA$_e$ is locally linearly convergent when applied to these problems. Our numerical experiments
show that the pDCA$_e$ usually outperforms the proximal DC algorithm with nonmonotone linesearch
[24, Appendix A] in both CPU time and solution quality for this particular application.
