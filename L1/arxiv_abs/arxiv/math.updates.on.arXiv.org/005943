Stochastic point processes with Coulomb interactions arise in various natural examples of statistical
mechanics, random matrices and optimization problems. Often such systems due to their natural
repulsion exhibit remarkable hyperuniformity properties, that is, the number of points landing
in any given region fluctuates at a much smaller scale compared to that of a set of i.i.d. random points.
A well known conjecture from physics appearing in the works of Jancovici, Lebowitz, Manificat,
Martin, and Yalcin ('80,'83,'93), states that the variance of the number of points landing in a set
should grow like the surface area instead of the volume unlike i.i.d. random points. In a recent beautiful
work, Chatterjee (2017) gave the first proof of such a result in dimension three for a Coulomb type
system, known as the hierarchical Coulomb gas, inspired by Dyson's hierarchical model of the Ising
ferromagnet. However the case of dimensions greater than three had remained open. In this paper,
we establish the correct fluctuation behavior up to logarithmic factors in all dimensions greater
than three, for the hierarchical model. Using similar methods, we also prove sharp variance bounds
for smooth linear statistics which were unknown in any dimension bigger than two. A key intermediate
step is to obtain precise results about the ground states of such models whose behavior can be interpreted
as hierarchical analogues of various crystalline conjectures predicted for energy minimizing
systems, and could be of independent interest.
