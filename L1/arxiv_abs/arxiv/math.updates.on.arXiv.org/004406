We study a natural growth process with competition, which was recently introduced to analyze MDLA,
a challenging model for the growth of an aggregate by diffusing particles. The growth process consists
of two first-passage percolation processes $\text{FPP}_1$ and $\text{FPP}_\lambda$, spreading
with rates $1$ and $\lambda>0$ respectively, on a graph $G$. $\text{FPP}_1$ starts from a single
vertex at the origin $o$, while the initial configuration of $\text{FPP}_\lambda$ consists of
infinitely many \emph{seeds} distributed according to a product of Bernoulli measures of parameter
$\mu>0$ on $V(G)\setminus \{o\}$. $\text{FPP}_1$ starts spreading from time 0, while each seed
of $\text{FPP}_\lambda$ only starts spreading after it has been reached by either $\text{FPP}_1$
or $\text{FPP}_\lambda$. A fundamental question in this model, and in growth processes with competition
in general, is whether the two processes coexist (i.e., both produce infinite clusters) with positive
probability. We show that this is the case when $G$ is vertex transitive, non-amenable and hyperbolic,
in particular, for any $\lambda>0$ there is a $\mu_0=\mu_0(G,\lambda)>0$ such that for all $\mu\in(0,\mu_0)$
the two processes coexist with positive probability. This is the first non-trivial instance where
coexistence is established for this model. We also show that $\text{FPP}_\lambda$ produces an
infinite cluster almost surely for any positive $\lambda,\mu$, establishing fundamental differences
with the behavior of such processes on $\mathbb{Z}^d$.
