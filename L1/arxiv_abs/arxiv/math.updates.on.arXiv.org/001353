We study multivariate numerical integration of smooth functions in weighted Sobolev spaces with
dominating mixed smoothness $\alpha\geq 2$ defined over the unit cube. We propose a new quasi-Monte
Carlo (QMC)-based quadrature rule, named \emph{extrapolated polynomial lattice rule}, which
achieves the almost optimal rate of convergence. Extrapolated polynomial lattice rules are constructed
in two steps: i) construction of classical polynomial lattice rules over $\mathbb{F}_b$ with $\alpha$
consecutive sizes of nodes, $N=b^{m-\alpha+1},\ldots,b^{m}$, and ii) recursive application
of Richardson extrapolation to a chain of $\alpha$ approximate values of the integral obtained
by consecutive polynomial lattice rules. We prove the existence of good extrapolated polynomial
lattice rules achieving the almost optimal order of convergence of the worst-case error in Sobolev
spaces with general weights. Then, by restricting to product weights, we show that such good extrapolated
polynomial lattice rules can be constructed by the fast component-by-component algorithm under
a computable quality criterion, and that the required total construction cost is smaller than that
of interlaced polynomial lattice rule. We also study the dependence of the worst-case error bound
on the dimension. A big advantage of our method compared to interlaced polynomial polynomial lattice
rules is that the fast QMC matrix vector method can be used in this setting, while still achieving
the same rate of convergence. Such a method was previously not known. Numerical experiments for
test integrands support our theoretical result.
