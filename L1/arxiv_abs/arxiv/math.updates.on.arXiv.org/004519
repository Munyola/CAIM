The focusing Nonlinear Schr\"odinger (NLS) equation is the simplest universal model describing
the modulation instability (MI) of quasi monochromatic waves in weakly nonlinear media, and MI
is considered the main physical mechanism for the appearence of anomalous (rogue) waves (AWs) in
nature. In this paper we study, using the finite gap method, the NLS Cauchy problem for generic periodic
initial perturbations of the unstable background solution of NLS (what we call the Cauchy problem
of the AWs), in the case of a finite number $N$ of unstable modes. We show how the finite gap method adapts
to this specific Cauchy problem through three basic simplifications, allowing one to construct
the solution, at the leading and relevant order, in terms of elementary functions of the initial
data. More precisely, we show that, at the leading order, i) the initial data generate a partition
of the time axis into a sequence of finite intervals, ii) in each interval $I$ of the partition, only
a subset of ${\cal N}(I)\le N$ unstable modes are "visible", and iii) the NLS solution is approximated,
for $t\in I$, by the ${\cal N}(I)$-soliton solution of Akhmediev type, describing the nonlinear
interaction of these visible unstable modes, whose parameters are expressed in terms of the initial
data through elementary functions. This result explains the relevance of the $m$-soliton solutions
of Akhmediev type, with $m\le N$, in the generic periodic Cauchy problem of the AWs, in the case of
a finite number $N$ of unstable modes.
