Mobile edge computing (MEC) has been regarded as a promising technique to enhance the computation
capabilities of wireless devices, by enabling them to offload computation-intensive tasks to
base stations (BSs) at the network edge. This paper studies a new multiuser MEC system by exploiting
the multi-antenna non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA)-based computation offloading. In this
system, multiple users can simultaneously offload their computation tasks to one multi-antenna
BS over the same time/frequency resources for remote execution, and the BS can employ successive
interference cancellation (SIC) for information decoding. We consider the partial offloading
case, such that each user can partition the computation task into two parts for local computing and
offloading, respectively. Under this setup, we minimize the weighted sum of the energy consumption
at all users subject to their computation latency constraints, by jointly optimizing each user's
task partition, local central processing unit (CPU) frequency for local computing, and transmit
power and rate for offloading, as well as the BS's decoding order for SIC. We present an efficient
algorithm to obtain the globally optimal solution to this problem by applying the Lagrange dual
method. Numerical results show that the proposed NOMA-based partial offloading design significantly
improves the energy efficiency of the multiuser MEC system, as compared to benchmark schemes with
orthogonal multiple access (OMA)-based partial offloading, local computing only, and full offloading
only.
