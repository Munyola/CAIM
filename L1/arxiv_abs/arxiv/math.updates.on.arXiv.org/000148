We deal with first-order variational principles for the field of linear co-frames in an $n$-dimensional
manifold. We formulate a certain class of models with Lagrangians invariant both under the group
of diffeomorphisms and under the matrix group ${\rm GL}(n,\mathbb{R})$ acting in a natural way
on linear frames. This internal ${\rm GL}(n,\mathbb{R})$-symmetry is the main difference between
models presented here and relativistic theories of micromorphic continua or metric-teleparallel
theories of gravitation (including the conventional Einstein theory). The latter theories are
invariant only under the Lorentz subgroup ${\rm SO}(1,n-1;\mathbb{R})$ acting globally in the
general case and locally in the Einstein theory. We show that from some point of view the restriction
of the internal group ${\rm GL}(n,\mathbb{R})$ to ${\rm SO}(1,n-1;\mathbb{R})$ is artificial.
We present simple examples of rigorous solutions of our field equations. Every field of linear frames
whose "legs" span a semisimple Lie algebra is a solution. Roughly speaking, they are "homogeneous
vacuums", i.e., classical ground states of our model. Trivial central extensions of semisimple
Lie groups give rise to another class of natural solutions ("homogeneous-developing vacuums").
Preliminary discussion of isotropic solutions is presented. It is interesting that the normal-hyperbolic
signature is not a priori assumed. Roughly speaking, the signature is implied by differential equations.
There are certain similarities between models presented here and nonlinear models of electrodynamics
due to Born, Infeld and Mie.
