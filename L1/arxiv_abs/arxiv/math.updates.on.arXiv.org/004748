A new mathematical method for the dynamic analysis of nonlinear ecological systems has recently
been developed by the author and was presented in a separate article. Based on this methodology,
multiple new dynamic ecological system measures and indices of matrix, vector, and scalar types
are systematically introduced in the present paper. These mathematical system analysis tools
are quantitative ecological indicators that monitor the flow distribution and storage organization,
quantify the effect and utility of one compartment directly or indirectly on another, identify
the system efficiency and stress, measure the compartmental exposure to system flows, determine
the residence time and compartmental activity levels, and ascertain the restoration time and resilience
in the case of disturbances. Major flow- and stock-related concepts and quantities of the current
static network analyses are also extended to nonlinear dynamic settings and integrated with the
proposed dynamic measures and indices within this novel and unifying mathematical framework.
In particular, the dynamic versions of the static indirect effect and celebrated cycling indices
are formulated integrally. This unifying comprehensive framework enables a holistic view and
analysis of ecological systems. The proposed dynamic system measures and indices, thus, extract
detailed information about ecosystems' characteristics, as well as their functions, properties,
behaviors, and various other system attributes that are potentially hidden in and even obscured
by data.
