In the recent paper `Well-posedness and regularity for a generalized fractional Cahn-Hilliard
system' (arXiv:1804.11290) by the same authors, general well-posedness results have been established
for a a class of evolutionary systems of two equations having the structure of a viscous Cahn-Hilliard
system, in which nonlinearities of double-well type occur. The operators appearing in the system
equations are fractional versions in the spectral sense of general linear operators A,B having
compact resolvents, which are densely defined, unbounded, selfadjoint, and monotone in a Hilbert
space of functions defined in a smooth domain. In this work we complement the results given in arXiv:1804.11290
by studying a distributed control problem for this evolutionary system. The main difficulty in
the analysis is to establish a rigorous Frechet differentiability result for the associated control-to-state
mapping. This seems only to be possible if the state stays bounded, which, in turn, makes it necessary
to postulate an additional global boundedness assumption. One typical situation, in which this
assumption is satisfied, arises when B is the negative Laplacian with zero Dirichlet boundary conditions
and the nonlinearity is smooth with polynomial growth of at most order four. Also a case with logarithmic
nonlinearity can be handled. Under the global boundedness assumption, we establish existence
and first-order necessary optimality conditions for the optimal control problem in terms of a variational
inequality and the associated adjoint state system.
