Submodular set-functions are extensively used in large-scale combinatorial optimization problems
arising in complex networks and machine learning. While there has been significant interest in
distributed formulations of convex optimization, distributed minimization of submodular functions
has not received significant attention. Thus, our main contribution is a framework for minimizing
submodular functions in a distributed manner. The proposed framework is based on the ideas of Lov{\'a}sz
extension of submodular functions and distributed optimization of convex functions. The framework
exploits a fundamental property of submodularity that the convex relaxation of a submodular function
can be computed efficiently. Since a minimizer of the convex relaxation of a discrete function is
also a minimizer of that function over the associated discrete state space, submodular functions
can be minimized in polynomial time. In the proposed framework, we employ a consensus based distributed
optimization algorithm to minimize set-valued submodular functions as well as general submodular
functions defined over set products. We also identify distributed motion coordination in multiagent
systems as a new application domain for submodular function minimization. For demonstrating key
ideas of the proposed framework, we select a complex setup of the capture the flag game, which offers
a variety of challenges relevant to multiagent system. We formulate the problem as a submodular
minimization problem and verify through extensive simulations that the proposed framework results
in feasible policies for the agents.
