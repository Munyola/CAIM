Avian Spirochaetosis is an acute endemic tick-borne disease of birds, caused by Borrelia anserins,
a species of Borrelia bacteria. In this paper, we present a compartmental Mathematical model of
the disease for the bird population and Tick population. The model so constructed was analyzed using
methods from dynamical systems theory. \tcr{The disease steady (equilibrium) state was determined
and the conditions for the disease-free steady state to be stable were determined}. The analysis
showed that the disease-free steady state is locally stable if $d\geq \tau_B$ and $\delta \geq \tau_T$,
that is, the natural death rate of birds (d) will be greater than the per capita birth rate of birds
$\tau_B$ and the death rate of tick $\delta)$ is greater than the per capita birth rate of tick $\tau_T$.
This means that for the disease to be under control and eradicated within a while from its outbreak,
the natural death rate of birds $d$ will be greater than the per capita birth rate of bird $\tau_B$
and the death rate of tick $\delta$ is greater than the per capita birth rate of tick $\tau_T$. It was
also proved the disease-free equilibrium (DFE) and the endemic equilibrium (EE) are globally stable
using Lyaponov method. Three control measures were introduced into the model. The optimality system
of the three controls is characterized using optimal control theory and the existence and uniqueness
of the optimal control are established. Then, the effect of the incorporation of the three controls
is investigated by performing numerical simulation.
