In this work we study the Ruelle Operator associated to continuous potentials on general compact
spaces. We present a new criterion for uniqueness of the eigenmeasures associated to the spectral
radius of this operator acting on the space of all real-valued continuous functions defined on some
suitable compact metric space. This uniqueness result is obtained by showing that set of eigenmeasures
for any continuous potential, coincides with the set of the DLR-Gibbs measures for a suitable quasilocal
specification. In particular, we proved that the phase transition in the DLR sense is equivalent
to existence of more than one eigenprobability for the dual of the Ruelle operator. The strongly
non-null condition, for the specifications considered here, is analyzed, in the case of finite
alphabets and on the Thermodynamic Formalism setting. We also consider bounded extensions of the
Ruelle operator to the Lebesgue space of integrable functions with respect to the eigenmeasures.
We give very general sufficient conditions for the existence of integrable and almost everywhere
positive eigenfunctions associated to the spectral radius of the Ruelle operator. A perturbation
theory is developed for sequences of Ruelle operators and some continuity results are obtained,
among them a limit theorem for the topological pressure functional. Techniques of super and sub
solutions to the eigenvalue problem is developed and employed to construct (semi-explicitly)
eigenfunctions for a very large class of continuous potentials having low regularity.
