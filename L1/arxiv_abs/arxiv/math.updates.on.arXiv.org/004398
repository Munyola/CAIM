In this work we combing models of disease dynamics and economic production, and we show the potential
implications of this for demonstrating the importance of savings for buffering an economy during
the period of an epidemic. Finding an explicit function that relates poverty and the production
of a community is an almost impossible task because of the number of variables and parameters that
should be taken into account. However, studying the dynamics of an endemic disease in a region that
affects its population, and therefore its ability to work, is an honest approach to understanding
this function. We propose a model, perhaps the simplest, that couples two dynamics, the dynamics
of an endemic disease and the dynamics of a closed economy of products and goods that the community
produces in the epidemic period. Some of the results of this study are expected and known in the literature
but some others are not. We highlight three of them: the interdependence that exists between health
and the product of that economy. The majority of the known results only show the dependence in a single
direction. Another of the most important goals in this work is to show the existence of a poverty Malthusian
trap in economies with low levels of capital investment due to pandemic disease. And another is to
show that there is an optimal level of savings that maximizes the \emph{per capita} product of the
economy, which is Machiavellian, but has important implications for market efficiency. The model
tells us why saving is important in an aggregate economy despite being affected by an epidemic.
