It is well-known that for a quickly increasing sequence $(n_k)_{k \geq 1}$ the functions $(\cos
2 \pi n_k x)_{k \geq 1}$ show a behavior which is typical for sequences of independent random variables.
If the growth condition on $(n_k)_{k \geq 1}$ is relaxed then this almost-independent behavior
generally fails. Still, probabilistic constructions show that for \emph{some} very slowly increasing
sequences $(n_k)_{k \geq 1}$ this almost-independence property is preserved. For example, there
exists $(n_k)_{k \geq 1}$ having bounded gaps such that the normalized sums $\sum \cos 2 \pi n_k x$
satisfy the central limit theorem (CLT). However, due to a ``loss of mass'' phenomenon the variance
in the CLT for a sequence with bounded gaps is always smaller than $1/2$. In the case of the law of the
iterated logarithm (LIL) the situation is different; as we proved in an earlier paper, there exists
$(n_k)_{k \geq 1}$ with bounded gaps such that $$ \limsup_{N \to \infty} \frac{\left| \sum_{k=1}^N
\cos 2 \pi n_k x \right|}{\sqrt{N \log \log N}} = \infty \qquad \textrm{for almost all $x$.} $$ In
the present paper we prove a complementary results showing that any prescribed limsup-behavior
in the LIL is possible for sequences with bounded gaps. More precisely, we show that for any real number
$\Lambda \geq 0$ there exists a sequence of integers $(n_k)_{k \geq 1}$ satisfying $n_{k+1} - n_{k}
\in \{1,2\}$ such that the limsup in the LIL equals $\Lambda$ for almost all $x$. Similar results
are proved for sums $\sum f(n_k x)$ and for the discrepancy of $(\langle n_k x \rangle)_{k \geq 1}$.
