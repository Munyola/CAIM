In mammals, female germ cells are sheltered within somatic structures called ovarian follicles,
which remain in a quiescent state until they get activated, all along reproductive life. We investigate
the sequence of somatic cell events occurring just after follicle activation. We introduce a nonlinear
stochastic model accounting for the joint dynamics of two cell types, either precursor or proliferative
cells. The initial precursor cell population transitions progressively to a proliferative cell
population, by both spontaneous and self-amplified processes. In the mean time, the proliferative
cell population may start either a linear or exponential growing phase. A key issue is to determine
whether cell proliferation is concomitant or posterior to cell transition, and to assess both the
time needed for all precursor cells to complete transition and the corresponding increase in the
cell number with respect to the initial cell number. Using the probabilistic theory of first passage
times, we design a numerical scheme based on a rigorous Finite State Projection and coupling techniques
to assess the mean extinction time and the cell number at extinction time. We also obtain analytical
formulas for an approximating branching process. We calibrate the model parameters using an exact
likelihood approach using both experimental and in-silico datasets. We carry out a comprehensive
comparison between the initial model and a series of submodels, which help to select the critical
cell events taking place during activation. We finally interpret these results from a biological
viewpoint.
