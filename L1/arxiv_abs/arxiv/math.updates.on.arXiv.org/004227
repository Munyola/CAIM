We consider a one-dimensional simple random walk surviving among a field of static soft traps : each
time it meets a trap the walk is killed with probability 1--e --$\beta$, where $\beta$ is a positive
and fixed parameter. The positions of the traps are sampled independently from the walk and according
to a renewal process. The increments between consecutive traps, or gaps, are assumed to have a power-law
decaying tail with exponent $\gamma$ > 0. We prove convergence in law for the properly rescaled logarithm
of the quenched survival probability as time goes to infinity. The normalization exponent is $\gamma$/($\gamma$
+ 2), while the limiting law writes as a variational formula with both universal and non-universal
features. The latter involves (i) a Poisson point process that emerges as the universal scaling
limit of the properly rescaled gaps and (ii) a function of the parameter $\beta$ that we call asymptotic
cost of crossing per trap and that may, in principle, depend on the details of the gap distribution.
Our proof suggests a confinement strategy of the walk in a single large gap. This model may also be
seen as a (1 + 1)-directed polymer among many repulsive interfaces, in which case $\beta$ corresponds
to the strength of repulsion, the survival probability to the partition function and its logarithm
to the finite-volume free energy. Along the way we prove a stochastic monotonicity property for
the hitting time of the killed random walk with respect to the non-killed one, that could be of interest
in other contexts, see Proposition 3.5.
