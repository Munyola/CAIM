We construct symmetric pairs for Drinfeld doubles of pre-Nichols algebras of diagonal type and
determine when they possess an Iwasawa decomposition. This extends G. Letzter's theory of quantum
symmetric pairs. Our results can be uniformly applied to Kac-Moody quantum groups for a generic
quantum parameter, for roots of unity in respect to both big and small quantum groups, to quantum
supergroups and to exotic quantum groups of ufo type. We give a second construction of symmetric
pairs for Heisenberg doubles in the above generality and prove that they always admit an Iwasawa
decomposition. For symmetric pair coideal subalgebras with Iwasawa decomposition in the above
generality we then address two problems which are fundamental already in the setting of quantum
groups. Firstly, we show that the symmetric pair coideal subalgebras are isomorphic to intrinsically
defined deformations of partial bosonizations of the corresponding pre-Nichols algebras. To
this end we develop a general notion of star products on N-graded connected algebras which provides
an efficient tool to prove that two deformations of the partial bosonization are isomorphic. The
new perspective also provides an effective algorithm for determining the defining relations of
the coideal subalgebras. Secondly, for Nichols algebras of diagonal type, we use the linear isomorphism
between the coideal subalgebra and the partial bosonization to give an explicit construction of
quasi K-matrices as sums over dual bases. We show that the resulting quasi K-matrices give rise to
weakly universal K-matrices in the above generality.
