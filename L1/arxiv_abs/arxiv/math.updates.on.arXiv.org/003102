Let $P:=\frac 1 3 P\circ S_1^{-1}+\frac 13 P\circ S_2^{-1}+\frac 13\nu$, where $S_1(x)=\frac
15 x$, $S_2(x)=\frac 1 5 x+\frac 45$ for all $x\in \mathbb R$, and $\nu$ be a Borel probability measure
on $\mathbb R$ with compact support. Such a measure $P$ is called a condensation measure, or an an
inhomogeneous self-similar measure, associated with the condensation system $(\{S_1, S_2\},
(\frac 13, \frac 13, \frac 13), \nu)$. Let $D(\mu)$ denote the quantization dimension of a measure
$\mu$ if it exists. Let $\kappa$ be the unique number such that $(\frac 12 (\frac 15)^2)^{\frac {\kappa}{2+\kappa}}+(\frac
12 (\frac 15)^2)^{\frac {\kappa}{2+\kappa}}=1$. In this paper, we have considered three different
self-similar measures $\nu:=\nu_1, \nu_2, \nu_3$ satisfying $D(\nu_1)>\kappa$, $D(\nu_2)<\kappa$,
and $D(\nu_3)=\kappa$. For each measure $\nu$ we show that there exist two sequences $a(n)$ and
$F(n)$, which we call as canonical sequences. With the help of the canonical sequences, we obtain
a closed formula to determine the optimal sets of $F(n)$-means and $F(n)$th quantization errors
for the condensation measure $P$ for each $\nu$. Then, we show that for each measure $\nu$ the quantization
dimension $D(P)$ of the condensation measure $P$ exists, and satisfies: $D(P)=\max\{\kappa,
D(\nu)\}$. Moreover, we show that for $D(\nu)>\kappa$, the $D(P)$-dimensional lower and upper
quantization coefficients are finite, positive and unequal; and for $D(\nu)\leq \kappa$, the
$D(P)$-dimensional lower quantization coefficient is infinity.
