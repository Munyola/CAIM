Let $(X, \sigma_X), (Y, \sigma_Y)$ be one-sided subshifts with the specification property and
$\pi:X\rightarrow Y$ a factor map. Let $\mu$ be a unique invariant Gibbs measure for a sequence of
continuous functions $\F=\{\log f_n\}_{n=1}^{\infty}$ on $X$, which is an almost additive potential
with bounded variation. We first show that $\pi\mu$ is also a unique invariant Gibbs measure for
a sequence of continuous functions $\G=\{\log g_n\}_{n=1}^{\infty}$ on $Y$. In particular, when
$(X, \sigma_X)$ is a full shift, we characterize $\G$ by using relative pressure and $\mu$ as a unique
relative equilibrium state for $\F$ over $\pi\mu$. This almost additive potential $\G$ is an extension
of a continuous function found by Pollicott and Kempton in their work on the images of Gibbs measures
for continuous functions under factor maps. We also consider the following question: Given a unique
invariant Gibbs measure $\nu$ for a sequence of continuous functions $\F_2$ on $Y$, can we find an
invariant Gibbs measure $\mu$ for a sequence of continuous functions $\F_1$ on $X$ such that $\pi\mu=\nu$?
In general, by constructing two distinct measures projected to $\nu$, we show that such a measure
exists under a certain condition. We also study when these two measures coincide. In particular,
if $(X, \sigma_X)$ is a full shift and $\nu$ is a unique invariant Gibbs measure for a function that
belongs to the Bowen class, then we can find a preimage $\mu$ of $\nu$ which is a unique invariant Gibbs
measure for a function that belongs to the Bowen class.
