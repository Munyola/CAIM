Let $X$ be an exchangeable increment (EI) process whose sample paths are of infinite variation.
We prove that, for any fixed $t$ almost surely, \[ \limsup_{h\to 0 \pm} (X_{t+h}-X_t)/h=\infty
\quad\text{and}\quad \liminf_{h\to 0\pm} (X_{t+h}-X_t)/h=-\infty. \]This extends a celebrated
result of Rogozin (1968) for L\'evy processes, and completes the known picture for finite-variation
EI processes. Applications are numerous. For example, we deduce that both half-lines $(-\infty,
0)$ and $(0,\infty)$ are visited immediately for infinite variation EI processes (called upward
and downward regularity). We also generalize the zero-one law of Millar (1977) for L\'evy processes
by showing continuity of $X$ when it reaches its minimum in the infinite variation EI case; an analogous
result for all EI processes links right and left continuity at the minimum with upward and downward
regularity. We also consider results of Durrett, Iglehart and Miller (1977) on the weak convergence
of conditioned Brownian bridges to the normalized Brownian excursion, and broadened to a subclass
of L\'evy processes and EI processes by Uribe Bravo (2014) and Chaumont and Uribe Bravo (2015). We
prove it here for all infinite variation EI processes. We furthermore obtain a description of the
convex minorant for non-piecewise linear EI processes, the case of L\'evy processes given by Pitman
and Uribe Bravo (2012). Our main tool to study the Dini derivatives is a change of measure for EI processes
which extends the Esscher transform for L\'evy processes.
