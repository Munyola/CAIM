Demographic projections of future mortality rates involve a high level of uncertainty and require
stochastic mortality models. The current paper investigates forward mortality models driven
by a (possibly infinite dimensional) Wiener process and a compensated Poisson random measure.
A major innovation of the paper is the introduction of a family of processes called forward mortality
improvements which provide a flexible tool for a simple construction of stochastic forward mortality
models. In practice, the notion of mortality improvements are a convenient device for the quantification
of changes in mortality rates over time that enables, for example, the detection of cohort effects.
We show that the forward mortality rates satisfy Heath-Jarrow-Morton-type consistency conditions
which translate to the forward mortality improvements. While the consistency conditions of the
forward mortality rates are analogous to the classical conditions in the context of bond markets,
the conditions of the forward mortality improvements possess a different structure: forward mortality
models include a cohort parameter besides the time horizon; these two dimensions are coupled in
the dynamics of consistent models of forwards mortality improvements. In order to obtain a unified
framework, we transform the systems of It\^o-processes which describe the forward mortality rates
and improvements: in contrast to term-structure models, the corresponding stochastic partial
differential equations (SPDEs) describe the random dynamics of two-dimensional surfaces rather
than curves.
