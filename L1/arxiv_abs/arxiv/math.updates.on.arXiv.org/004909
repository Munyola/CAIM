This work is devoted to the design of interior penalty discontinuous Galerkin (dG) schemes that
preserve maximum principles at the discrete level for the steady transport and convection-diffusion
problems and the respective transient problems with implicit time integration. Monotonic schemes
that combine explicit time stepping with dG space discretization are very common, but the design
of such schemes for implicit time stepping is rare, and it had only been attained so far for 1D problems.
The proposed scheme is based on an artificial diffusion that linearly depends on a shock detector
that identifies the troublesome areas. In order to define the new shock detector, we have introduced
the concept of discrete local extrema. The diffusion operator is a graph-Laplacian, instead of
the more common finite element discretization of the Laplacian operator, which is essential to
keep monotonicity on general meshes and in multi-dimension. The resulting nonlinear stabilization
is non-smooth and nonlinear solvers can fail to converge. As a result, we propose a smoothed (twice
differentiable) version of the nonlinear stabilization, which allows us to use Newton with line
search nonlinear solvers and dramatically improve nonlinear convergence. A theoretical numerical
analysis of the proposed schemes show that they satisfy the desired monotonicity properties. Further,
the resulting operator is Lipschitz continuous and there exists at least one solution of the discrete
problem, even in the non-smooth version. We provide a set of numerical results to support our findings.
