In this work an activator-depleted reaction-diffusion system is investigated on polar coordinates
with the aim of exploring the relationship and the corresponding influence of domain size on the
types of possible diffusion-driven instabilities. Quantitative relationships are found in the
form of necessary conditions on the area of a disk-shape domain with respect to the diffusion and
reaction rates for certain types of diffusion-driven instabilities to occur. Robust analytical
methods are applied to find explicit expressions for the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the
diffusion operator on a disk-shape domain with homogenous Neumann boundary conditions in polar
coordinates. Spectral methods are applied using chebyshev non-periodic grid for the radial variable
and Fourier periodic grid on the angular variable to verify the nodal lines and eigen-surfaces subject
to the proposed analytical findings. The full classification of the parameter space in light of
the bifurcation analysis is obtained and numerically verified by finding the solutions of the partitioning
curves inducing such a classification. Furthermore, analytical results are found relating the
area of (disk-shape) domain with reaction-diffusion rates in the form of necessary conditions
for the different types of bifurcations. These results are on one hand presented in the form of mathematical
theorems with rigorous proofs, and, on the other hand using finite element method, each claim of
the corresponding theorems are verified by obtaining the theoretically predicted behaviour of
the dynamics in the numerical simulations.
