The chromatic polynomial of a graph $G$, denoted $P(G,m)$, is equal to the number of proper $m$-colorings
of $G$. The list color function of graph $G$, denoted $P_{\ell}(G,m)$, is a list analogue of the chromatic
polynomial that has been studied since 1992, primarily through comparisons with the corresponding
chromatic polynomial. DP-coloring (also called correspondence coloring) is a generalization
of list coloring recently introduced by Dvo\v{r}\'{a}k and Postle. In this paper, we introduce
a DP-coloring analogue of the chromatic polynomial called the DP color function denoted $P_{DP}(G,m)$.
Motivated by known results related to the list color function, we show that while the DP color function
behaves similar to the list color function for some graphs, there are also some surprising differences.
For example, Wang, Qian, and Yan recently showed that if $G$ is a connected graph with $l$ edges, then
$P_{\ell}(G,m)=P(G,m)$ whenever $m > \frac{l-1}{\ln(1+ \sqrt{2})}$, but we will show that for
any $g \geq 3$ there exists a graph, $G$, with girth $g$ such that $P_{DP}(G,m) < P(G,m)$ when $m$ is
sufficiently large. We also study the asymptotics of $P(G,m) - P_{DP}(G,m)$ for a fixed graph $G$.
We develop techniques to compute $P_{DP}(G,m)$ exactly and apply them to certain classes of graphs
such as chordal graphs, unicyclic graphs, and cycles with a chord. Finally, we make progress towards
showing that for any graph $G$, there is a $p$ such that $P_{DP}(G \vee K_p, m) = P(G \vee K_p , m)$ for
large enough $m$.
