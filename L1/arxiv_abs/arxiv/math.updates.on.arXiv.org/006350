In this work we study first-order linear parabolic evolution PDEs over $\mathbb{R}^{d}\times\mathbb{R}$
and $\mathbb{R}^{d}\times\mathbb{R}^{+}$ comprising a spatial operator defined through a symbol
function and a source term such that its spatial Fourier transform is a slow-growing measure over
$\mathbb{R}^{d}\times\mathbb{R}$. When the source term is required to has its support on $\mathbb{R}^{d}\times\mathbb{R}^{+}$,
it is shown that there exists a unique solution such that its spatial Fourier transform is a slow-growing
measure with support in $\mathbb{R}^{d}\times\mathbb{R}^{+}$, which in addition has a c\`adl\`ag-in-time
behaviour. This allows to well-pose and analyse an initial value problem associated to this class
of equations and to consider cases where the spatial operator can be a pseudo-differential operator.
We also look at for solutions to the cases where the source term is such that its spatial and spatio-temporal
Fourier transforms are slow-growing measures over $\mathbb{R}^{d}\times\mathbb{R}$. In such
a case, it is shown that when the real part of the symbol function of the spatial operator is inferiorly
bounded by a strictly positive constant, there exists a unique solution whose both spatial and spatio-temporal
Fourier transforms are slow-growing measures over $\mathbb{R}^{d}\times\mathbb{R}$, and which
also has a c\`adl\`ag-in-time behaviour. In addition, it is proven that the solution to an associated
Cauchy problem converges spatio-temporally asymptotically to this unique solution as the time
flows long enough.
