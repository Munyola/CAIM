We propose a novel efficient algorithm to solve Poisson equation in irregular two dimensional domains
for electrostatics. It can handle Dirichlet, Neumann or mixed boundary problems in which the filling
media can be homogeneous or inhomogeneous. The basic idea of the new method is solve the problem in
three steps: (i) First solve the equation $\nabla\cdot\mathbf D=\rho$. The inverse of the divergence
operator in a restricted subspace is found to yield the electric flux density $\mathbf D$ by a fast
direct solver in O(N) operations. The $\mathbf D$ so obtained is nonunique with indeterminate divergence-free
component. Then the electric field is found by $\mathbf E=\mathbf D/\epsilon$. But $\nabla\times\mathbf
E=0$ for electrostatic field; hence, $\mathbf E$ is curl free and orthogonal to the divergence free
space. (ii) An orthogonalization process is used to purify the electric field making it curl free
and unique. (iii) Then the potential $\phi$ is obtained by solving $\nabla \phi=-\mathbf E$ or finding
the inverse of the gradient operator in a restricted subspace by a similar fast direct solver in O(N)
operations. Treatments for both Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions are addressed. Finally,
the validation and efficiency are illustrated by several numerical examples. Through these simulations,
it is observed that the computational complexity of our proposed method almost scales as O(N) where
N is the triangle patch number of meshes. Consequently, this new algorithm is a feasible fast Poisson
solver.
