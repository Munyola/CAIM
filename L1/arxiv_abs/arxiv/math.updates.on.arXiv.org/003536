The parameters in the governing system of partial differential equations of multicompartmental
poroelastic models typically vary over several orders of magnitude making its stable discretization
and efficient solution a challenging task. In this paper, inspired by the approach recently presented
by Hong and Kraus~[Parameter-robust stability of classical three-field formulation of Biot's
consolidation model, ETNA (to appear)] for the Biot model, we establish the uniform stability,
propose stable disretization and parameter-robust preconditioner for flux-based formulations
of multiple-network poroelastic systems. Novel proper parameter-dependent norms that provide
the key for establishing uniform inf-sup stability of the continuous problems are introduced.
Therefore, the stability results presented here are uniform not only with respect to the Lam\'e
parameter $\lambda$, but also with respect to all the other model parameters such as permeability
coefficients $K_i$, storage coefficients $c_{p_i}$, network transfer coefficients $\beta_{ij},
i,j=1,\cdots,n$, the scale of the networks $n$ and the time step size $\tau$. Moreover, strongly
mass conservative discretizations that meet the required conditions for parameter-robust stability
are suggested and corresponding optimal error estimates are proved. The transfer of the canonical
(norm-equivalent) operator preconditioners from the continuous and the discrete level lays the
foundation for optimal and fully robust iterative solution methods. The theory results are justified
by numerical experiments from problems with practical application.
