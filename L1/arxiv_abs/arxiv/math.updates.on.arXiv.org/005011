The aim of these notes is to describe how to construct canonical bundles of moving frames and differential
invariants for parametrized curves in Lagrangian Grassmannians, at least in the monotonic case.
Such curves appear as Jacobi curves of sub-Riemannian extremals [1,2] . Originally this construction
was done in [6,7], where it uses the specifics of Lagrangian Grassmannian. In later works [3,4] a
much more general theory for construction of canonical bundles of moving frames for parametrized
or unparametrized curves in the so-called generalized flag varieties was developed, so that the
problem which is discussed here can be considered as a particular case of this general theory. Although
this was briefly discussed at the very end of [3], the application of the theory of [3,4] to obtain
the results of [6,7] were never written in detail and this is our goal here. We believe that this exposition
gives a more conceptual point of view on the original results of [6,7] and especially clarifies the
origin of the normalization conditions of the canonical bundles of moving frames there, which in
fact boil down to a choice of a complement to a certain subspace of the symplectic Lie algebra. The
notes in almost the same form are included under my authorship as the Appendix in the book "A Comprehensive
Introduction to sub-Riemannian Geometry from Hamiltonian view point" by A. Agrachev D. Barilari,
U. Boscain. Following the style of this book, some not difficult statements are given as exercises
for pedagogical purposes.
