The predictive performance of point forecasts for a statistical functional, such as the mean, a
quantile, or a certain risk measure, is commonly assessed in terms of scoring (or loss) functions.
A scoring functions should be (strictly) consistent for the functional of interest, that is, the
expected score should be minimised by the correctly specified functional value. A functional is
elicitable if it possesses a strictly consistent scoring function. In quantitative risk management,
the elicitability of a risk measure is closely related to comparative backtesting procedures.
As such, it has gained considerable interest in the debate about which risk measure to choose in practice.
While this discussion has mainly focused on the dichotomy between Value at Risk (VaR) - a quantile
- and Expected Shortfall (ES) - a tail expectation, this paper is concerned with Range Value at Risk
(RVaR). RVaR can be regarded as an interpolation of VaR and ES, which constitutes a tradeoff between
the sensitivity of the latter and the robustness of the former. Recalling that RVaR is not elicitable,
we show that a triplet of RVaR with two VaR components at different levels is elicitable. We characterise
the class of strictly consistent scoring functions. Moreover, additional properties of these
scoring functions are examined, including the diagnostic tool of Murphy diagrams. The results
are illustrated with a simulation study, and we put our approach in perspective with respect to the
classical approach of trimmed least squares in robust regression.
