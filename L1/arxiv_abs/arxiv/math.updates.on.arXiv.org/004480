Mirror symmetry relates Gromov-Witten invariants of an elliptic curve with certain integrals
over Feynman graphs. We prove a tropical generalization of mirror symmetry for elliptic curves,
i.e., a statement relating certain labeled Gromov-Witten invariants of a tropical elliptic curve
to more refined Feynman integrals. This result easily implies the tropical analogue of the mirror
symmetry statement mentioned above and, using the necessary Correspondence Theorem, also the
mirror symmetry statement itself. In this way, our tropical generalization leads to an alternative
proof of mirror symmetry for elliptic curves. We believe that our approach via tropical mirror symmetry
naturally carries the potential of being generalized to more adventurous situations of mirror
symmetry. Moreover, our tropical approach has the advantage that all involved invariants are easy
to compute. Furthermore, we can use the techniques for computing Feynman integrals to prove that
they are quasimodular forms. Also, as a side product, we can give a combinatorial characterization
of Feynman graphs for which the corresponding integrals are zero. More generally, the tropical
mirror symmetry theorem gives a natural interpretation of the A-model side (i.e., the generating
function of Gromov-Witten invariants) in terms of a sum over Feynman graphs. Hence our quasimodularity
result becomes meaningful on the A-model side as well. Our theoretical results are complemented
by a Singular package including several procedures that can be used to compute Hurwitz numbers of
the elliptic curve as integrals over Feynman graphs.
