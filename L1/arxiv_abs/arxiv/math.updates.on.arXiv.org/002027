Persistent homology is a way of determining the topological properties of a data set. It is well known
that each persistence module admits the structure of a representation of a finite totally ordered
set. In previous work, the authors proved an analogue of the isometry theorem of Bauer and Lesnick
for representations of a certain class of finite posets. The isometry was between the interleaving
metric of Bubenik, de Silva and Scott and a bottleneck metric which incorporated algebraic information.
The key step in both isometry theorems was proving a matching theorem, that an interleaving gives
rise to a matching of the same height. In this paper we continue this work, restricting to those posets
which arise from data while making more general the choice of metrics. We first show that while an
interleaving always produces a matching, for an arbitrary choice of weights it will not produce
one of the same height. We then show that although the matching theorem fails in this sense, one obtains
a "shifted" matching (of the correct height) from an interleaving by enlarging the category. We
then prove an isometry theorem on this extended category. As an application, we make precise the
way in which representations of finite partially ordered sets approximate persistence modules.
Specifically, given two finite point clouds of data, we associate a generalized sequence (net)
of algebras over which the persistence modules for both data sets can be compared. We recover the
classical interleaving distance uniformly by taking limits.
