We study nonlinear dynamics of two coupled contrast agents that are micro-meter size gas bubbles
encapsulated into a viscoelastic shell. Such bubbles are used for enhancing ultrasound visualization
of blood flow and have other promising applications like targeted drug delivery and noninvasive
therapy. Here we consider a model of two such bubbles interacting via the Bjerknes force and exposed
to an external ultrasound field. We demonstrate that in this five-dimensional nonlinear dynamical
system various types of complex dynamics can occur, namely, we observe periodic, quasi-periodic,
chaotic and hypechaotic oscillations of bubbles. We study the bifurcation scenarios leading to
the onset of both chaotic and hyperchaotic oscillations. We show that chaotic attractors in the
considered system can appear via either Feigenbaum's cascade of period doubling bifurcations
or Afraimovich--Shilnikov scenario of torus destruction. For the onset of hyperchaotic attractor
we propose a new bifurcation scenario, which is based on the appearance of a homoclinic chaotic attractor
containing a saddle-focus periodic orbit with its two-dimensional unstable manifold. Finally,
we demonstrate that the bubbles' dynamics can be multistable, i.e. various combinations of co-existence
of the above mentioned attractors are possible. These cases include co-existence of hyperchaotic
regime with any of the other remaining types of dynamics for different parameter values. Thus, the
model of two coupled gas bubbles provide a new examples of physically relevant system with multistable
hyperchaos.
