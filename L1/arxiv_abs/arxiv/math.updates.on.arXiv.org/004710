Let $(M,g)$ be a connected, compact, oriented, locally homogeneous Riemannian manifold, $K$ be
a connected, compact Lie group, and $p:P\to M$ be a principal $K$-bundle on $M$. A connection on $P$
will be called locally homogeneous (LH) if for every two points $x$, $x'\in M$ there exist open neighborhoods
$U\ni x$, $U'\ni x'$ , an isometry $\varphi:U\to U'$ such that $\varphi(x)=x'$, and a $\varphi$-covering
bundle isomorphism $\Phi:P_U\to P_{U'}$ which preserves the connection. If this condition holds,
then $P$ can be naturally endowed with a LH metric, so the classification of LH connections on bundles
over a given manifold $M$ is related to the classification of geometric manifolds which are fibre
bundles over $M$. This yields a strong motivation for studying the following general classification
problem: given a compact LH Riemannian manifold $(M,g)$, and a compact Lie group $K$, classify up
to isomorphism, all pairs $(P,A)$ consisting of a principal $K$-bundle $P$ on $M$ and a LH connection
$A$ on $P$. Using a general theorem stating that any LH pair $(P,A)$ on $M$ is obtained as a quotient
of a (globally) homogeneous pair on the universal covering $\tilde M$, this problem reduces to the
classification of homogeneous pairs on $\tilde M$. This leads naturally to moduli spaces which
can be described explicitly. In this article, we will illustrate our general classification method,
and describe explicitly the moduli spaces of LH connections with structure group $K=\mathrm{S}^1$,
$\mathrm{PU}(2)$ on hyperbolic Riemann surfaces.
