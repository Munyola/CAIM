We give a self-contained proof of the fact that, for any prime number $p$, there exists a power series
$$\Psi= \Psi_p(T) \in T + T^2\Z[[T]] $$ which trivializes the addition law of the formal group of
Witt covectors, is $p$-adically entire and assumes values in $\Z_p$ all over $\Q_p$. We show that
$\Psi$ provides a quasi-finite covering of the Berkovich affine line $\A^1_{\Q_p}$ by itself and
prove new strong estimates on its growth. These estimates are essential in the application to $p$-adic
Fourier expansions and for the determination of the zeros of $\Psi$. We show that, for any $\lambda
\in \Q_p^\times$, the closure $\sE_\lambda^\circ$ of $\Z_p[\Psi(p^ix/\lambda)\,|\,i=0,1,\dots]$
in $\Q_p\{x\}$ is a Hopf algebra object in the category of Fr\'echet $\Z_p$-algebras. The special
fiber of $\sE_\lambda^\circ$ is the affine algebra of the $p$-divisible group $\Q_p/p \lambda
\Z_p$ over $\F_p$, while $\sE_\lambda^\circ [1/p]$ is dense in $\Q_p\{x\}$. From $\Z_p[\Psi(\lambda
x)\,|\,\lambda \in \Q_p^\times]$ we construct a $p$-adic (resp. integral) analog $\AP_{\Q_p}(\rho)$
(resp. $\AP_{\Z_p}(\rho)$) of the algebra of almost periodic functions, holomorphic in a strip
$(-\rho, \rho) \times i \R \subset \C$ (or, rather, $\R \times i(-\rho, \rho)$...), for any $\rho
>0$. We start developing this analogy: in particular, the (resp. integral) $p$-adic analog Banach
algebra of Bohr's almost periodic functions on $\R$ turns out to be the uniform completion of the
restriction to $\Q_p$ of germs of (resp. integral) holomorphic almost periodic functions.
