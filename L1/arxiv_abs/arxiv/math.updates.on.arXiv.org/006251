We prove the linear stability of slowly rotating Kerr black holes as solutions of the Einstein vacuum
equation: linearized perturbations of a Kerr metric decay at an inverse polynomial rate to a linearized
Kerr metric plus a pure gauge term. We work in a natural wave map/DeTurck gauge and show that the pure
gauge term can be taken to lie in a fixed 7-dimensional space with a simple geometric interpretation.
Our proof rests on a robust general framework, based on recent advances in microlocal analysis and
non-elliptic Fredholm theory, for the analysis of resolvents of operators on asymptotically flat
spaces. With the mode stability of the Schwarzschild metric as well as of certain scalar and 1-form
wave operators on the Schwarzschild spacetime as an input, we establish the linear stability of
slowly rotating Kerr black holes using perturbative arguments; in particular, our proof does not
make any use of special algebraic properties of the Kerr metric. The heart of the paper is a detailed
description of the resolvent of the linearization of a suitable hyperbolic gauge-fixed Einstein
operator at low energies. As in previous work by the second and third authors on the nonlinear stability
of cosmological black holes, constraint damping plays an important role. Here, it eliminates certain
pathological generalized zero energy states; it also ensures that solutions of our hyperbolic
formulation of the linearized Einstein equation have the stated asymptotics and decay for general
initial data and forcing terms, which is a useful feature in nonlinear and numerical applications.
