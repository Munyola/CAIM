We introduce a second-order numerical scheme for compressible atmospheric motions at small to
planetary scales. The collocated finite volume method treats the advection of mass, momentum,
and mass-weighted potential temperature in conservation form while relying on Exner pressure
for the pressure gradient term. It discretises the rotating compressible equations by evolving
full variables rather than perturbations around a background state, and operates with time steps
constrained by the advection speed only. Perturbation variables are only used as auxiliary quantities
in the formulation of the elliptic problem. Borrowing ideas on forward-in-time differencing,
the algorithm reframes the authors' previously proposed schemes into a sequence of implicit midpoint,
advection, and implicit trapezoidal steps that allows for a time integration unconstrained by
the internal gravity wave speed. Compared with existing approaches, results on a range of benchmarks
of nonhydrostatic- and hydrostatic-scale dynamics are competitive. The test suite includes a
new planetary-scale inertia-gravity wave test highlighting the properties of the scheme and its
large time step capabilities. In the hydrostatic-scale cases the model is run in pseudo-incompressible
and hydrostatic mode with simple switching within a uniform discretization framework. The differences
with the compressible runs return expected relative magnitudes. By providing seamless access
to soundproof and hydrostatic dynamics, the developments represent a necessary step towards an
all-scale blended multimodel solver.
