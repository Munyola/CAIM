In this paper, we study a threshold-kernel estimation method for jump-diffusion processes, which
iteratively applies thresholding and kernel methods in an approximately optimal way to achieve
improved finite-sample performance. As in Figueroa-L\'opez and Nisen (2013), we use the expected
number of jump misclassification as the objective function to optimally select the threshold parameter
of the jump detection scheme. We prove that the objective function is quasi-convex and obtain a novel
second-order infill approximation of the optimal threshold, hence extending results from the
aforementioned paper. The approximate optimal threshold depends not only on the spot volatility
$\sigma_t$, but also turns out to be a decreasing function of the jump intensity and the value of the
jump density at the origin. The estimation methods for these quantities are then developed, where
the spot volatility is estimated by a kernel estimator with a threshold and the value of the jump density
at the origin is estimated by a density kernel estimator applied to those increments deemed to contains
jumps by the chosen thresholding criterion. Due to the interdependency between the model parameters
and the approximate optimal estimators designed to estimate them, a type of iterative fixed-point
algorithm is developed to implement them. Simulation studies show that it is not only feasible to
implement the higher-order local optimal threshold scheme but also that this is superior to those
based only on the first order approximation and/or on average values of the parameters over the estimation
time period.
