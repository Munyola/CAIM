Sparse principal component analysis (sPCA) has become one of the most widely used techniques for
dimensionality reduction in high-dimensional datasets. The main challenge underlying sPCA is
to estimate the first vector of loadings of the population covariance matrix, provided that only
a certain number of loadings are non-zero. In this paper, we propose confidence intervals for individual
loadings and for the largest eigenvalue of the population covariance matrix. Given an independent
sample $X^i \in\mathbb R^p, i = 1,...,n,$ generated from an unknown distribution with an unknown
covariance matrix $\Sigma_0$, our aim is to estimate the first vector of loadings and the largest
eigenvalue of $\Sigma_0$ in a setting where $p\gg n$. Next to the high-dimensionality, another
challenge lies in the inherent non-convexity of the problem. We base our methodology on a Lasso-penalized
M-estimator which, despite non-convexity, may be solved by a polynomial-time algorithm such as
coordinate or gradient descent. We show that our estimator achieves the minimax optimal rates in
$\ell_1$ and $\ell_2$-norm. We identify the bias in the Lasso-based estimator and propose a de-biased
sparse PCA estimator for the vector of loadings and for the largest eigenvalue of the covariance
matrix $\Sigma_0$. Our main results provide theoretical guarantees for asymptotic normality
of the de-biased estimator. The major conditions we impose are sparsity in the first eigenvector
of small order $\sqrt{n}/\log p$ and sparsity of the same order in the columns of the inverse Hessian
matrix of the population risk.
