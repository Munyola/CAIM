Very recently, an asymptotic transcendental equation satisfied by the $n$-th Riemann zero on the
critical line was derived by one of us. Here we provide a more detailed analysis of this result, demonstrating
more rigorously that the Riemann zeros occur on the critical line with real part equal to 1/2, and
their imaginary parts satisfy such a transcendental equation. From this equation, the counting
of zeros on the critical line can be derived, yielding precisely the Riemann-von Mangoldt counting
function $N(T)$ for the zeros on the entire critical strip. Furthermore, without considering such
an asymptotic expansion, we obtain an exact equation satisfied by the $n$-th Riemann zero on the
critical line, from which Backlund's exact counting formula is derived. Therefore, these results
constitute a proposal for establishing the validity of the Riemann hypothesis. We also obtain an
approximate solution of these equations, in closed form, based on the Lambert $W$ function, which
yields a very good estimate for arbitrarily high Riemann zeros. Starting from this approximation,
we then obtain numerical solutions, without using Gram points nor the Riemann-Siegel formula,
of the complete transcendental equation. This yields accurate numbers for the Riemann zeros which
agree with previously known results found in the literature computed by different methods. Employing
these numerical solutions, we verify that they are accurate enough to confirm Montgomery's and
Odlyzko's pair correlation conjectures and also to reconstruct the prime number counting formula.
