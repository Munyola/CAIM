For a nondegenerate analytic system with a conserved quantity, a classic result by Lyapunov guarantees
the existence of an analytic manifold of periodic orbits tangent to any two-dimensional, elliptic
eigenspace of a fixed point satisfying nonresonance conditions. These two dimensional manifolds
are referred as Lyapunov Subcenter Manifolds (LSM). Numerical and experimental observations
in the nonlinear vibrations literature suggest that LSM's often persist under autonomous, dissipative
perturbations. These perturbed manifolds are useful since they provide information of the asymptotics
of the convergence to equilibrium. In this paper, we formulate and prove precise mathematical results
on the persistence of LSM under dissipation. We show that, under mild non-degeneracy conditions
on the perturbation, for small enough dissipation, there are analytic invariant manifolds of the
perturbed system that approximate (in the analytic sense) the LSM in a fixed neighborhood. We also
provide examples that show that some non-degeneracy conditions on the perturbations are needed
for the results to hold true. We also study the dependence of the manifolds on the dissipation parameter.
If $\varepsilon$ is the dissipation parameter, we show that the manifolds are real analytic in $(-\varepsilon_0,
\varepsilon_0) \setminus \{0\} $ and $C^\infty $ in $(-\varepsilon_0, \varepsilon_0)$. We construct
explicit asymptotic expansions in powers of $\varepsilon$ (which presumably do not converge).
Finally, we present applications of our results to several mechanical systems.
