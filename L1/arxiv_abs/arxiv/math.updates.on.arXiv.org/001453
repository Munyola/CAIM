This is a survey on Nichols algebras of diagonal type with finite dimension, or more generally with
arithmetic root system. The knowledge of these algebras is the cornerstone of the classification
program of pointed Hopf algebras with finite dimension, or finite Gelfand-Kirillov dimension;
and their structure should be indispensable for the understanding of the representation theory,
the computation of the various cohomologies, and many other aspects of finite dimensional pointed
Hopf algebras. These Nichols algebras were classified in [H-classif RS] as a notable application
of the notions of Weyl groupoid and generalized root system [H-Weyl gpd,HY]. In the first part of
this monograph, we give an overview of the theory of Nichols algebras of diagonal type. This includes
a discussion of the notion of generalized root system and its appearance in the contexts of Nichols
algebras of diagonal type and (modular) Lie superalgebras. In the second and third part, we describe
for each Nichols algebra in the list of [H-classif RS] the following basic information: the generalized
root system; its label in terms of Lie theory; the defining relations found in [A-jems,A-presentation];
the PBW-basis; the dimension or the Gelfand-Kirillov dimension; the associated Lie algebra as
in [AAR2]. Indeed the second part deals with Nichols algebras related to Lie algebras and superalgebras
in arbitrary characteristic, while the third contains the information on Nichols algebras related
to Lie algebras and superalgebras only in small characteristic, and the few examples yet unidentified
in terms of Lie theory.
