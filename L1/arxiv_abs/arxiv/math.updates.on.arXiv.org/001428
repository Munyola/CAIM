Let H be any reductive p-adic group. We introduce a notion of cuspidality for enhanced Langlands
parameters for H, which conjecturally puts supercuspidal H-representations in bijection with
such L-parameters. We also define a cuspidal support map and Bernstein components for enhanced
L-parameters, in analogy with Bernstein's theory of representations of p-adic groups. We check
that for several well-known reductive groups these analogies are actually precise. Furthermore
we reveal a new structure in the space of enhanced L-parameters for H, that of a disjoint union of twisted
extended quotients. This is an analogue of the ABPS conjecture (about irreducible H-representations)
on the Galois side of the local Langlands correspondence. Only, on the Galois side it is no longer
conjectural. These results will be useful to reduce the problem of finding a local Langlands correspondence
for H-representations to the corresponding problem for supercuspidal representations of Levi
subgroups of H. The main machinery behind this comes from perverse sheaves on algebraic groups.
We extend Lusztig's generalized Springer correspondence to disconnected complex reductive groups
G. It provides a bijection between, on the one hand, pairs consisting of a unipotent element u in G
and an irreducible representation of the component group of the centralizer of u in G, and, on the
other hand, irreducible representations of a set of twisted group algebras of certain finite groups.
Each of these twisted group algebras contains the group algebra of a Weyl group, which comes from
the neutral component of G.
