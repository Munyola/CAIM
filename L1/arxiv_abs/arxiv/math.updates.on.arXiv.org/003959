Quantum embedding theories are playing an increasingly important role in bridging different levels
of approximation to the many body Schr\"odinger equation in physics, chemistry and materials science.
In this paper, we present a linear algebra perspective of the recently developed projection based
embedding theory (PET) [Manby et al, J. Chem. Theory Comput. 8, 2564, 2012], restricted to the context
of Kohn-Sham density functional theory. By partitioning the global degrees of freedom into a `system'
part and a `bath' part, and by choosing a proper projector from the bath, PET is an in principle exact
formulation to confine the calculation to the system part only, and hence can be carried out with
reduced computational cost. Viewed from the perspective of the domain decomposition method, one
particularly interesting feature of PET is that it does not enforce a boundary condition explicitly,
and remains applicable even when the discretized Hamiltonian matrix is dense, such as in the context
of the planewave discretization. In practice, the accuracy of PET depends on the accuracy of the
projector for the bath. Based on the linear algebra reformulation, we develop a first order perturbation
correction to the projector from the bath to improve its accuracy. Numerical results for real chemical
systems indicate that with a proper choice of reference system, the perturbatively corrected PET
can be sufficiently accurate even when strong perturbation is applied to very small systems, such
as the computation of the ground state energy of a SiH$_3$F molecule, using a SiH$_4$ molecule as
the reference system.
