A 4-independent wheel driving (4-IWD) electric vehicle has distinctive advantages with both enhanced
dynamic and energy efficiency performances since this configuration provides more flexibilities
from both the design and control aspects. However, it is difficult to achieve the optimal performances
of a 4-IWD electric vehicle with conventional design and control approaches. This work is dedicated
to investigating the vehicular optimal design and control approaches, with a 4-IWD electric race
car aiming at minimizing the lap time on a given circuit as a case study. A 14-DOF vehicle model that
can fully evaluate the influences of the unsprung mass is developed based on Lagrangian dynamics.
The 14-DOF vehicle model implemented with the reprogrammed Magic Formula tire model and a time-efficient
suspension model supports metric operations and parallel computing, which can dramatically improve
the computational efficiency. The optimal design and control problems with design parameters
of the motor, transmission, mass center, anti-roll bar and the suspension of the race car are successively
formulated. The formulated problems are subsequently solved by directly transcribing the original
problems into large scale nonlinear optimization problems based on trapezoidal approach. The
influences of the mounting positions of the propulsion system, the mass and inertia of the unsprung
masses, the anti-roll bars and suspensions on the lap time are analyzed and compared quantitatively.
Some interesting findings that are different from the `already known facts' are presented.
