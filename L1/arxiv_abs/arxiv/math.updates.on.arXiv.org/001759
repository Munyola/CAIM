We use techniques from statistical mechanics to give evidence for new formulas for nonarchimedean
metaplectic Whittaker functions, arising in the local theory of automorphic forms. We study a particular
variation/generalization of the six-vertex model of type C having domain-wall boundary conditions
dependent on a given integer partition $\lambda$ of length at most $r$, where $r$ is a fixed positive
integer. More precisely, we examine a planar, non-nested, U-turn model whose partition function
$Z_{\lambda}$ is related to characters of the symplectic group $\operatorname{Sp} (2r, \mathbb{C})$.
Special cases appeared in Kuperberg and then in Brubaker, Bump, Chinta, Friedberg, and Gunnells,
and then in Ivanov. We relate certain admissible states of our statistical-mechanical model to
metaplectic Eisenstein series (or equivalently metaplectic Whittaker functions). We give a solution
to the Yang--Baxter equation for metaplectic Boltzmann weights, which we use to derive two functional
equations involving $Z_{\lambda}$, one of which describes the action on $Z_{\lambda}$ by a short
simple root, the other the action by a long simple root. We also give evidence for the conjecture that
$Z_{\lambda}$ is a spherical Whittaker function by showing that $Z_{\lambda}$ satisfies the same
identities under our solution to the Yang--Baxter equation as the metaplectic Whittaker function
under intertwining operators on the unramified principal series of an $n$-fold metaplectic cover
of $\operatorname{SO}(2r+1)$, for $n$ odd.
