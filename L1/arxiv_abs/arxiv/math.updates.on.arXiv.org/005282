In this paper, following the works on non-harmonic analysis of boundary value problems by Tokmagambetov,
Ruzhansky and Delgado, we use Operator Ideals Theory and Gershgorin Theory to obtain explicit information
concerning the spectrum of pseudo-differential operators, on a smooth manifold $\Omega$ with
boundary $\partial \Omega$, in the context of the non-harmonic analysis of boundary value problems,
introduced by Tokmagambetov and Ruzhansky in terms of a model operator $\mathfrak{L} $. Under certain
assumptions about the eigenfunctions of the model operator, for symbols in the H\"ormander class
$S^0_{1,0} (\overline{\Omega} \times \mathcal{I} )$, we provide a "non-harmonic version" of
Gohberg's Lemma, and a sufficient and necessary condition to ensure that the corresponding pseudo-differential
operator is a compact operator in $L^2(\Omega)$. Also, for pseudo-differential operators with
symbols satisfying some integrability condition, one defines its associated matrix in terms of
the biorthogonal system associated to $\mathfrak{L} $, and this matrix is used to give necessary
and sufficient conditions for the $L^2(\Omega)$-boundedness, and to locate the spectrum of some
operators. After that, we extend to the context of the non-harmonic analysis of boundary value problems
the well known theorems about the exact domain of elliptic operators, and discuss some applications
of the obtained results to evolution equations. Specifically we provide sufficient conditions
to ensure the smoothness and stability of solutions to a generalised version of the heat equation.
