Future generations of communications systems will target a very wide range of applications, with
possibly very different specifications. This implies the need for a physical layer technology
allowing for an ultra flexible allocation of the time-frequency resources. In this regard, the
most popular modulation nowadays, namely, the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)
modulation, is characterized by a very poor frequency localization, making frequency resource
allocation much less flexible. In the light of these limitations, communications using new waveforms,
relying on more sophisticated time windowing or filtering, have attracted a lot of attention for
the last decade, such as offset-QAM-based filterbank multicarrier (FBMC-OQAM), universal filtered
multicarrier (UFMC) or generalized frequency division multiplexing (GFDM). At the same time,
the higher complexity of these new waveforms, not only in terms of implementation but especially
conceptually, creates an entrance barrier that slow down their adoption by industries, standardization
bodies and more generally in the telecommunication community. The WaveComBox toolbox, available
at www.wavecombox.com, is a user-friendly, open-source and well documented piece of software
aiming at simplifying the use and considerably lowering the entrance barrier of recently proposed
waveforms. By using an abstract architecture, the toolbox allows for simple implementation of
typical physical layer functionalities and for comparison with state-of-the-art technologies.
