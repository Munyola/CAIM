Convex optimization is a well-established research area with applications in almost all fields.
Over the decades, multiple approaches have been proposed to solve convex programs. The development
of interior-point methods allowed solving a more general set of convex programs known as semi-definite
programs and second-order cone programs. However, it has been established that these methods are
excessively slow for high dimensions, i.e., they suffer from the curse of dimensionality. On the
other hand, optimization algorithms on manifold have shown great ability in finding solutions
to nonconvex problems in reasonable time. This paper is interested in solving a subset of convex
optimization using a different approach. The main idea behind Riemannian optimization is to view
the constrained optimization problem as an unconstrained one over a restricted search space. The
paper introduces three manifolds to solve convex programs under particular box constraints. The
manifolds, called the doubly stochastic, symmetric and the definite multinomial manifolds, generalize
the simplex also known as the multinomial manifold. The proposed manifolds and algorithms are well-adapted
to solving convex programs in which the variable of interest is a multidimensional probability
distribution function. Theoretical analysis and simulation results testify the efficiency of
the proposed method over state of the art methods. In particular, they reveal that the proposed framework
outperforms conventional generic and specialized solvers, especially in high dimensions.
