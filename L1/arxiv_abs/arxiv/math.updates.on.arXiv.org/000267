In statistical analysis, measuring a score of predictive performance is an important task. In many
scientific fields, appropriate scores were tailored to tackle the problems at hand. A proper score
is a popular tool to obtain statistically consistent forecasts. Furthermore, a mathematical characterization
of the proper score was studied. As a result, it was revealed that the proper score corresponds to
a Bregman divergence, which is an extension of the squared distance over the set of probability distributions.
In the present paper, we introduce composite scores as an extension of the typical scores in order
to obtain a wider class of probabilistic forecasting. Then, we propose a class of composite scores,
named Holder scores, that induce equivariant estimators. The equivariant estimators have a favorable
property, implying that the estimator is transformed in a consistent way, when the data is transformed.
In particular, we deal with the affine transformation of the data. By using the equivariant estimators
under the affine transformation, one can obtain estimators that do no essentially depend on the
choice of the system of units in the measurement. Conversely, we prove that the Holder score is characterized
by the invariance property under the affine transformations. Furthermore, we investigate statistical
properties of the estimators using Holder scores for the statistical problems including estimation
of regression functions and robust parameter estimation, and illustrate the usefulness of the
newly introduced scores for statistical forecasting.
