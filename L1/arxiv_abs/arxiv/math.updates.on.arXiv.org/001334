Mathematically, it takes an infinite amount of time for the transient solution of a diffusion equation
to transition from initial to steady state. Calculating a \textit{finite} transition time, defined
as the time required for the transient solution to transition to within a small prescribed tolerance
of the steady state solution, is much more useful in practice. In this paper, we study estimates of
finite transition times that avoid explicit calculation of the transient solution by using the
property that the transition to steady state defines a cumulative distribution function when time
is treated as a random variable. In total, three approaches are studied: (i) mean action time (ii)
mean plus one standard deviation of action time and (iii) a new approach derived by approximating
the large time asymptotic behaviour of the cumulative distribution function. The new approach
leads to a simple formula for calculating the finite transition time that depends on the prescribed
tolerance $\delta$ and the $(k-1)$th and $k$th moments ($k \geq 1$) of the distribution. Results
comparing exact and approximate finite transition times lead to two key findings. Firstly, while
the first two approaches are useful at characterising the time scale of the transition, they do not
provide accurate estimates for diffusion processes. Secondly, the new approach allows one to calculate
finite transition times accurate to effectively any number of significant digits, using only the
moments, with the accuracy increasing as the index $k$ is increased.
