We develop a mathematically and physically sound definition of the spectrally-hyperviscous Navier-Stokes
equations (SHNSE) on general bounded domains \Omega with zero (no-slip) boundary conditions prescribed
on \varGamma=\partial\varOmega. Previous successful studies of the SHNSE have been limited to
periodic-box domains. There are significant theoretical obstacles to overcome in extending the
SHNSE beyond this case. We solve them with the help of the Helmholtz decomposition, and with our new
formulation of the SHNSE on general bounded domains in hand we then establish foundational results,
beginning with the existence of globally regular solutions. Given that the SHNSE is meant to approximate
the NSE for small \mu or large m, we establish this rigorously in the general case by adapting the weak
subsequence convergence results of [5] to hold here. On intervals [0,T] with a common H^{1}-bound
we deepen this sense of approximation by obtaining strong convergence. First, by using estimates
depending only on the common H^{1}-bound to maximize computational applicability we show that
SHNSE solutions converge uniformly in H^{1} to the NSE solution as either \mu\rightarrow0 or m\rightarrow\infty.
Then in cases in which bootstrapped higher-order bounds can be readily used we show that higher-order
convergence results hold. Our final results use the Stokes-pressure methodology developed in
[29], [30] to recast the SHNSE in a form which like the NSE reformulation in [29], [30] is more adaptable
to computation and the specification of boundary values for the pressure.
