Compelling evidence-though yet no formal proof-has been adduced that the probability that a generic
(standard) two-qubit state ($\rho$) is separable/disentangled is $\frac{8}{33}$ ( arXiv:1301.6617
, arXiv:1109.2560 , arXiv:0704.3723 ). Proceeding in related analytical frameworks, using a further
determinantal $4F3$-hypergeometric moment formula (Appendix A), we reach, {\it via} density-approximation
procedures, the conclusion that one-half ($\frac{4}{33}$) of this probability arises when the
determinantal inequality $|\rho^{PT}|>|\rho|$, where $PT$ denotes the partial transpose,
is satisfied, and, the other half, when $|\rho|>|\rho^{PT}|$. These probabilities are taken
with respect to the flat, Hilbert-Schmidt measure on the fifteen-dimensional convex set of $4 \times
4$ density matrices. We find fully parallel bisection/equipartition results for the previously
adduced, as well, two-"re[al]bit" and two-"quater[nionic]bit"separability probabilities
of $\frac{29}{64}$ and $\frac{26}{323}$, respectively. The new determinantal $4F3$-hypergeometric
moment formula is, then, adjusted (Appendices B and C) to the boundary case of minimally degenerate
states ($|\rho|=0$), and its consistency manifested-also using density-approximation-with
a theorem of Szarek, Bengtsson and {\.Z}yczkowski ( arXiv:quant-ph/0509008 ). This theorem states
that the Hilbert-Schmidt separability probabilities of generic minimally degenerate two-qubit
states are (again) one-half those of the corresponding generic nondegenerate states.
