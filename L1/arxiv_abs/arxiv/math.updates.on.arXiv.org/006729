In this paper, we consider the problem of computing a Wasserstein barycenter for a set of discrete
probability distributions with finite supports, which finds many applications in areas such as
statistics, machine learning and image processing. When the support points of the barycenter are
pre-specified, this problem can be modeled as a linear program (LP) whose problem size can be extremely
large. To handle this large-scale LP, we analyse the structure of its dual problem, which is conceivably
more tractable and can be reformulated as a well-structured convex problem with 3 kinds of block
variables and a coupling linear equality constraint. We then adapt a symmetric Gauss-Seidel based
alternating direction method of multipliers (sGS-ADMM) to solve the resulting dual problem and
establish its global convergence and global linear convergence rate. As a critical component for
efficient computation, we also show how all the subproblems involved can be solved exactly and efficiently.
This makes our method suitable for computing a Wasserstein barycenter on a large dataset, without
introducing an entropy regularization term as is commonly practiced. In addition, our sGS-ADMM
can be used as a subroutine in an alternating minimization method to compute a barycenter when its
support points are not pre-specified. Numerical results on synthetic datasets and image datasets
demonstrate that our method is highly competitive for solving large-scale problems, in comparison
to two existing representative methods and the commercial software Gurobi.
