We undertake a detailed study of the lowest weight modules for the Hermitian symmetric pair (G,K),
where G=Sp_4(R) and K is its maximal compact subgroup. In particular, we determine K-types and composition
series, and write down explicit differential operators that navigate all the highest weight vectors
of such a module starting from the unique lowest-weight vector. By rewriting these operators in
classical language, we show that the automorphic forms on G that correspond to the highest weight
vectors are exactly those that arise from nearly holomorphic vector-valued Siegel modular forms
of degree 2. Further, by explicating the algebraic structure of the relevant space of n-finite automorphic
forms, we are able to prove a structure theorem for the space of nearly holomorphic vector-valued
Siegel modular forms of (arbitrary) weight $det^\ell$ sym^m with respect to an arbitrary congruence
subgroup of Sp_4(Q). We show that the cuspidal part of this space is the direct sum of subspaces obtained
by applying explicit differential operators to holomorphic vector-valued cusp forms of weight
$det^{\ell'} sym^{m'}$ with $(\ell', m')$ varying over a certain set. The structure theorem for
the space of all modular forms is similar, except that we may now have an additional component coming
from certain nearly holomorphic forms of weight $det^{3}sym^{m'}$ that cannot be obtained from
holomorphic forms. As an application of our structure theorem, we prove several arithmetic results
concerning nearly holomorphic modular forms that improve previously known results in that direction.
