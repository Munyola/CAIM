For any two complete discrete valued fields $K_1$ and $K_2$ of mixed characteristic with perfect
residue fields, we show that if the $n$-th valued hyperfields of $K_1$ and $K_2$ are isomorphic over
$p$ for each $n\ge1$, then $K_1$ and $K_2$ are isomorphic. More generally, for $n_1,n_2\ge 1$, if
$n_2$ is large enough, then any homomorphism, which is over $p$, from the $n_1$-th valued hyperfield
of $K_1$ to the $n_2$-th valued hyperfield of $K_2$ can be lifted to a homomorphism from $K_1$ to $K_2$.
We compute such $n_2$ effectively, which depends only on the ramification indices of $K_1$ and $K_2$.
Moreover, if $K_1$ is tamely ramified, then any homomorphism over $p$ between the first valued hyperfields
is induced from a unique homomorphism of valued fields. Using this lifting result, we deduce a relative
completeness theorem of AKE-style in terms of valued hyperfields. We also study some relationships
between valued hyperfields, truncated discrete valuation rings, and complete discrete valued
fields of mixed characteristic. For a prime number $p$ and a positive integer $e$ and for large enough
$n$, we show that a certain category of valued hyperfields is equivalent to the category of truncated
discrete valuation rings of length $n$ and the ramification indices $e$ having perfect residue
fields of characteristic $p$. Furthermore, in the tamely ramified case, we show that a subcategory
of this category of valued hyperfields is equivalent to the category of complete discrete valued
rings of mixed characteristic $(0,p)$ having perfect residue fields.
