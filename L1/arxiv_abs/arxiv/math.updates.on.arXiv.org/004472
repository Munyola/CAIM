The two dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes equation on $D_\delta := [0, 2\pi\delta] \times
[0, 2\pi]$ with $\delta \approx 1$, periodic boundary conditions, and viscosity $0 < \nu \ll 1$ is
considered. Bars and dipoles, two explicitly given quasi-stationary states of the system, evolve
on the time scale $\mathcal{O}(e^{-\nu t})$ and have been shown to play a key role in its long-time
evolution. Of particular interest is the role that $\delta$ plays in selecting which of these two
states is observed. Recent numerical studies suggest that, after a transient period of rapid decay
of the high Fourier modes, the bar state will be selected if $\delta \neq 1$, while the dipole will
be selected if $\delta = 1$. Our results support this claim and seek to mathematically formalize
it. We consider the system in Fourier space, project it onto a center manifold consisting of the lowest
eight Fourier modes, and use this as a model to study the selection of bars and dipoles. It is shown
for this ODE model that the value of $\delta$ controls the behavior of the asymptotic ratio of the
low modes, thus determining the likelihood of observing a bar state or dipole after an initial transient
period. Moreover, in our model, for all $\delta \approx 1$, there is an initial time period in which
the high modes decay at the rapid rate $\mathcal{O}(e^{-t/\nu})$, while the low modes evolve at
the slower $\mathcal{O}(e^{-\nu t})$ rate. The results for the ODE model are proven using energy
estimates and invariant manifolds and further supported by formal asymptotic expansions and numerics.
