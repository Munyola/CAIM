Let $\pi$ be an irreducible smooth complex representation of a general linear p-adic group and let
$\sigma$ be an irreducible complex supercuspidal representation of a quasi-split classical p-adic
group. We show that the reducibility of the representation of the appropriate p-adic classical
group obtained by (normalized) parabolic induction from $\pi\otimes\sigma $ does not depend on
$\pi$, if and only if the supercuspidal support of $\pi$ is "separated" from $\sigma$. (Here, "separated"
means that, for each factor $\rho $ of a representation in the supercuspidal support of $\pi $, the
representation parabolically induced from $\rho\otimes\sigma $ is irreducible.) This was conjectured
by E. Lapid and M. Tadi\'c. (In addition, they proved that this induced representation is always
reducible if the supercuspidal support is not "separated".) More generally, we study, for a given
set I of inertial orbits of supercuspidal representations of p-adic general linear groups, the
category $C(I;\sigma )$ of smooth complex finitely generated representations of classical p-adic
groups of fixed type, but arbitrary rank, and supercuspidal support given by $\sigma$ and I, show
that this category is equivalent to a category of finitely generated right modules over a direct
sum of tensor products of extended affine Hecke algebras of type A, B, C and D and establish functoriality
properties, relating categories with disjoint I's. The proof of the above reducibility result
is then based on Hecke algebra arguments, using Kato's exotic geometry.
