It has been previously shown by the authors that a directed graph on a linearly ordered set of edges
(ordered graph) with adjacent unique source and sink (bipolar digraph) has a unique fully optimal
spanning tree, that satisfies a simple criterion on fundamental cycle/cocycle directions. This
result yields, for any ordered graph, a canonical bijection between bipolar orientations and spanning
trees with internal activity 1 and external activity 0 in the sense of the Tutte polynomial. This
bijection can be extended to all orientations and all spanning trees, yielding the active bijection,
presented for graphs in a companion paper. In this paper, we specifically address the problem of
the computation of the fully optimal spanning tree of an ordered bipolar digraph. In contrast with
the inverse mapping, built by a straightforward single pass over the edge set, the direct computation
is not easy and had previously been left aside. We give two independent constructions. The first
one is a deletion/contraction recursion, involving an exponential number of minors. It is structurally
significant but it is efficient only for building the whole bijection (i.e. all images) at once.
The second one is more complicated and is the main contribution of the paper. It involves just one
minor for each edge of the resulting spanning tree, and it is a translation and an adaptation in the
case of graphs, in terms of weighted cocycles, of a general geometrical linear programming type
algorithm, which allows for a polynomial time complexity.
