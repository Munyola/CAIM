The long-term mean-field dynamics of coupled underdamped Duffing oscillators driven by an external
periodic signal with Gaussian noise is investigated. A Boltzmann-type H-theorem is proved for
the associated nonlinear Fokker-Planck equation to ensure that the system can always be relaxed
to one of the stationary states as time is long enough. Based on a general framework of the linear response
theory, the linear dynamical susceptibility of the system order parameter is explicitly deduced.
With the spectral amplification factor as a quantifying index, calculation by the method of moments
discloses that both mono-peak and double-peak resonance might appear, and that noise can greatly
signify the peak of the resonance curve of the coupled underdamped system as compared with a single-element
bistable system. Then, with the input signals taken from laboratory experiments, further observations
show that the mean-field coupled stochastic resonance system can amplify the periodic input signal.
Also, it reveals that for some driving frequencies, the optimal stochastic resonance parameter
and the critical bifurcation parameter have a close relationship. Moreover, it is found that the
damping coefficient can also give rise to nontrivial non-monotonic behaviors of the resonance
curve, and the resultant resonant peak attains its maximal height if the noise intensity or the coupling
strength takes the critical value. The new findings reveal the role of the order parameter in a coupled
system of chaotic oscillators.
