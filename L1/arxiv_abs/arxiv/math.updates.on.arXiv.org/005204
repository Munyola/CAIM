The UFMC modulation is among the most considered solutions for the realization of beyond-OFDM air
interfaces for future wireless networks. This paper focuses on the design and analysis of an UFMC
transceiver equipped with multiple antennas and operating at millimeter wave carrier frequencies.
The paper provides the full mathematical model of a MIMO-UFMC transceiver, taking into account
the presence of hybrid analog/digital beamformers at both ends of the communication links. Then,
several detection structures are proposed, both for the case of single-packet isolated transmission,
and for the case of multiple-packet continuous transmission. In the latter situation, the paper
also considers the case in which no guard time among adjacent packets is inserted, trading off an
increased level of interference with higher values of spectral efficiency. At the analysis stage,
the several considered detection structures and transmission schemes are compared in terms of
bit-error-rate, root-mean-square-error, and system throughput. The numerical results show
that the proposed transceiver algorithms are effective and that the linear MMSE data detector is
capable of well managing the increased interference brought by the removal of guard times among
consecutive packets, thus yielding throughput gains of about 10 - 13 $\%$. The effect of phase noise
at the receiver is also numerically assessed, and it is shown that the recursive implementation
of the linear MMSE exhibits some degree of robustness against this disturbance.
