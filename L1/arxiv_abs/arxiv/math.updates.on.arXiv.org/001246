We present two maximally superintegrable Hamiltonian systems ${\cal H}_\lambda$ and ${\cal H}_\eta$
that are defined, respectively, on an $N$-dimensional spherically symmetric generalization
of the Darboux surface of type III and on an $N$-dimensional Taub-NUT space. Afterwards, we show
that the quantization of ${\cal H}_\lambda$ and ${\cal H}_\eta$ leads, respectively, to exactly
solvable deformations (with parameters $\lambda$ and $\eta$) of the two basic quantum mechanical
systems: the harmonic oscillator and the Coulomb problem. In both cases the quantization is performed
in such a way that the maximal superintegrability of the classical Hamiltonian is fully preserved.
In particular, we prove that this strong condition is fulfilled by applying the so-called conformal
Laplace-Beltrami quantization prescription, where the conformal Laplacian operator contains
the usual Laplace-Beltrami operator on the underlying manifold plus a term proportional to its
scalar curvature (which in both cases has non-constant value). In this way, the eigenvalue problems
for the quantum counterparts of ${\cal H}_\lambda$ and ${\cal H}_\eta$ can be rigorously solved,
and it is found that their discrete spectrum is just a smooth deformation (in terms of the parameters
$\lambda$ and $\eta$) of the oscillator and Coulomb spectrum, respectively. Moreover, it turns
out that the maximal degeneracy of both systems is preserved under deformation. Finally, new further
multiparametric generalizations of both systems that preserve their superintegrability are
envisaged.
