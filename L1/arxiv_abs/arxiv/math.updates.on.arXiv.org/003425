A subgraph of an edge-coloured graph is called rainbow if all its edges have distinct colours. The
study of rainbow subgraphs goes back more than two hundred years to the work of Euler on Latin squares
and has been the focus of extensive research ever since. Euler posed a problem equivalent to finding
properly $n$-edge-coloured complete bipartite graphs $K_{n,n}$ which can be decomposed into
rainbow perfect matchings. While there are proper edge-colourings of $K_{n,n}$ without even a
single rainbow perfect matching, the theme of this paper is to show that with some very weak additional
constraints one can find many disjoint rainbow perfect matchings. In particular, we prove that
if some fraction of the colour classes have at most $(1-o(1)) n$ edges then one can nearly-decompose
the edges of $K_{n,n}$ into edge-disjoint perfect rainbow matchings. As an application of this,
we establish in a very strong form a conjecture of Akbari and Alipour and asymptotically prove a conjecture
of Barat and Nagy. Both these conjectures concern rainbow perfect matchings in edge-colourings
of $K_{n,n}$ with quadratically many colours. Using our techniques, we also prove a number of results
on near-decompositions of graphs into other rainbow structures like Hamiltonian cycles and spanning
trees. Most notably, we prove that any properly coloured complete graph can be nearly-decomposed
into spanning rainbow trees. This asymptotically proves the Brualdi-Hollingsworth and Kaneko-Kano-Suzuki
conjectures which predict that a perfect decomposition should exist under the same assumptions.
