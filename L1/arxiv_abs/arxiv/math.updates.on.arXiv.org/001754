A sequence of chains exhibits (total-variation) cutoff (resp., pre-cutoff) if for all $0<\epsilon<
1/2$, the ratio $t_{\mathrm{mix}}^{(n)}(\epsilon)/t_{\mathrm{mix}}^{(n)}(1-\epsilon)$
tends to 1 as $n \to \infty $ (resp., the $\limsup$ of this ratio is bounded uniformly in $\epsilon$),
where $t_{\mathrm{mix}}^{(n)}(\epsilon)$ is the $\epsilon$-total-variation mixing-time
of the $n$th chain in the sequence. We construct a sequence of bounded degree graphs $G_n$, such that
the lazy simple random walks (LSRW) on $G_n$ satisfy the "product condition" $\mathrm{gap}(G_n)
t_{\mathrm{mix}}^{(n)}(\epsilon) \to \infty $ as $n \to \infty$, where $\mathrm{gap}(G_n)$
is the spectral gap of the LSRW on $G_n$ (a known necessary condition for pre-cutoff that is often
sufficient for cutoff), yet this sequence does not exhibit pre-cutoff. Recently, Chen and Saloff-Coste
showed that total-variation cutoff is equivalent for the sequences of continuous-time and lazy
versions of some given sequence of chains. Surprisingly, we show that this is false when considering
separation cutoff. We also construct a sequence of bounded degree graphs $G_n=(V_{n},E_{n})$
that does not exhibit cutoff, for which a certain bounded perturbation of the edge weights leads
to cutoff and increases the order of the mixing-time by an optimal factor of $\Theta (\log |V_n|)$.
Similarly, we also show that "lumping" states together may increase the order of the mixing-time
by an optimal factor of $\Theta (\log |V_n|)$. This gives a negative answer to a question asked by
Aldous and Fill.
