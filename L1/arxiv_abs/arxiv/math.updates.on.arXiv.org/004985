In the world of generalized entropies---which, for example, play a role in physical systems with
sub- and super-exponential phasespace growth per degree of freedom---there are two ways for implementing
constraints in the maximum entropy principle: linear- and escort constraints. Both appear naturally
in different contexts. Linear constraints appear e.g. in physical systems, when additional information
about the system is available through higher moments. Escort distributions appear naturally in
the context of multifractals and information geometry. It was shown recently that there exists
a fundamental duality that relates both approaches on the basis of the corresponding deformed logarithms
(deformed-log duality). Here we show that there exists another duality that arises in the context
of information geometry, relating the Fisher information of $\phi$-deformed exponential families
that correspond to linear constraints (as studied by J. Naudts), with those that are based on escort
constraints (as studied by S.-I. Amari). We explicitly demonstrate this information geometric
duality for the case of $(c,d)$-entropy that covers all situations that are compatible with the
first three Shannon-Khinchin axioms, and that include Shannon, Tsallis, Anteneodo-Plastino
entropy, and many more as special cases. Finally, we discuss the relation between the deformed-log
duality and the information geometric duality, and mention that the escort distributions arising
in the two dualities are generally different and only coincide for the case of the Tsallis deformation.
