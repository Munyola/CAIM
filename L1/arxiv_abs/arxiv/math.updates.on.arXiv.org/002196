We study a Riemannian manifold equipped with a density which satisfies the Bakry--\'Emery Curvature-Dimension
condition (combining a lower bound on its generalized Ricci curvature and an upper bound on its generalized
dimension). We first obtain a Poincar\'e-type inequality on its boundary assuming that the latter
is locally-convex; this generalizes a purely Euclidean inequality of Colesanti, originally derived
as an infinitesimal form of the Brunn-Minkowski inequality, thereby precluding any extensions
beyond the Euclidean setting. A dual version for generalized mean-convex boundaries is also obtained,
yielding spectral-gap estimates for the weighted Laplacian on the boundary. Motivated by these
inequalities, a new geometric evolution equation is proposed, which extends to the Riemannian
setting the Minkowski addition operation of convex domains, a notion thus far confined to the purely
linear setting. This geometric flow is characterized by having parallel normals (of varying velocity)
to the evolving hypersurface along the trajectory, and is intimately related to a homogeneous Monge-Amp\`ere
equation on the exterior of the convex domain. Using the aforementioned Poincar\'e-type inequality
on the boundary of the evolving hypersurface, we obtain a novel Brunn--Minkowski inequality in
the weighted-Riemannian setting, amounting to a certain concavity property for the weighted-volume
of the evolving enclosed domain. All of these results appear to be new even in the classical non-weighted
Riemannian setting.
