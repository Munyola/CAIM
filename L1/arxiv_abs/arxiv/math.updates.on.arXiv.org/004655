Let ${\mathbb E}^d$ denote the $d$-dimensional Euclidean space. The $r$-ball body generated by
a given set in ${\mathbb E}^d$ is the intersection of balls of radius $r$ centered at the points of
the given set. In this paper we prove the following Blaschke-Santal\'o-type inequalities for $r$-ball
bodies: for all $1\leq k\leq d$ and for any set of given volume in ${\mathbb E}^d$ the $k$-th intrinsic
volume of the $r$-ball body generated by the set becomes maximal if the set is a ball. As an application
we prove the following. Gromov's conjecture (1987) states that if the centers of a family of $N$ congruent
balls in ${\mathbb E}^d$ is contracted, then the volume of the intersection does not decrease. A
uniform contraction is a contraction where all the pairwise distances in the first set of centers
are larger than all the pairwise distances in the second set of centers, that is, when the pairwise
distances of the two sets are separated by some positive real number. The author and M. Nasz\'odi
[Discrete Comput. Geom. 60/4 (2018), 967-980] proved Gromov's conjecture as well as its extension
to intrinsic volumes for all uniform contractions in ${\mathbb E}^d$, $d>1$ under the condition
that $ N\geq \left(1+\sqrt{2}\right)^d$. We give a short proof of this result using the Blaschke-Santal\'o-type
inequalities of $r$-ball bodies. Moreover, we prove it under the weaker condition $N\geq \sqrt{\frac{\pi}{2d}}
(1+\sqrt{2})^d+1$ for $d\geq 42$. Finally, we prove an analogue result for uniform contractions
of unions of congruent balls in ${\mathbb E}^d$, which improves the relevant earlier results.
