In September 2017, McAffee Labs quarterly report estimated that brute force attacks represent
20% of total network attacks, making them the most prevalent type of attack ex-aequo with browser
based vulnerabilities. These attacks have sometimes catastrophic consequences, and understanding
their fundamental limits may play an important role in the risk assessment of password-secured
systems, and in the design of better security protocols. While some solutions exist to prevent online
brute-force attacks that arise from one single IP address, attacks performed by botnets are more
challenging. In this paper, we analyze these distributed attacks by using a simplified model. Our
aim is to understand the impact of distribution and asynchronization on the overall computational
effort necessary to breach a system. Our result is based on Guesswork, a measure of the number of password
queries (guesses) before the correct one is found in an optimal attack, which is a direct surrogate
for the time and the computational effort. We model the lack of synchronization by a worst-case optimization
in which the queries are received in the worst possible order, resulting in a min-max formulation.
We show that even without synchronization and for sequences of growing length, the asymptotic optimal
performance is achievable by using randomized guesses drawn from an appropriate distribution.
Therefore, randomization is key for distributed asynchronous attacks. In other words, asynchronous
guessers can asymptotically perform brute-force attacks as efficiently as synchronized guessers.
