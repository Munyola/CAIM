Recently developed general constraint polynomial approach is shown to replace a set of algebraic
equations of the functional Bethe Ansatz method by a single polynomial constraint. As the proof
of principle, the usefulness of the method is demonstrated for a number of quasi-exactly solvable
(QES) potentials of the Schr\"odinger equation, such as two different sets of modified Manning
potentials with three parameters, an electron in Coulomb and magnetic fields and relative motion
of two electrons in an external oscillator potential, the hyperbolic Razavy potential, and a (perturbed)
double sinh-Gordon system. The approach enables one to straightforwardly determine eigenvalues
and wave functions. Odd parity solutions for the modified Manning potentials are also determined.
For the QES examples considered here, constraint polynomials terminate a finite chain of orthogonal
polynomials in an independent variable that need not to be necessarily energy. In the majority of
cases the finite chain of orthogonal polynomials is characterized by a positive-definite moment
functional ${\cal L}$, implying that a corresponding constraint polynomial has only real and simple
zeros. Constraint polynomials are shown to be different from the weak orthogonal Bender-Dunne
polynomials. At the same time the QES examples considered elucidate essential difference with
various generalizations of the Rabi model. Whereas in the former case there are $n+1$ polynomial
solutions at each point of a $n$th baseline, in the latter case there are at most $n+1$ polynomial
solutions on entire $n$th baseline.
