Chain models can be represented by a tridiagonal matrix with periodic entries along its diagonals.
Eigenmodes of open chains are represented by spectra of such tridiagonal $k$-Toeplitz matrices,
where $k$ represents length of the repeated unit, allowing for a maximum of $k$ distinct types of
elements in the chain. We present an analysis that allows for generality in $k$ and values in $\mathbb{C}$
representing elements of the chain, including non-Hermitian systems. Numerical results of spectra
of some special $k$-Toeplitz matrices are presented as a motivation. This is followed by analysis
of a general tridiagonal $k$-Toeplitz matrix of increasing dimensions, beginning with 3-term
recurrence relations between their characteristic polynomials involving a $k^{th}$ order coefficient
polynomial, with the variables and coefficients in $\mathbb{C}$. The existence of limiting zeros
for these polynomials and their convergence are established, and the conditioned $k^{th}$ order
coefficient polynomial is shown to provide a continuous support for the limiting spectra representing
modes of the chain. This analysis also includes the at most $2k$ eigenvalues outside this continuous
set. It is shown that this continuous support can as well be derived using Widom's conditional theorems
(and its recent extensions) for the existence of limiting spectra for block-Toeplitz operators,
except in special cases. Numerical examples are used to graphically demonstrate theorems. As an
addendum, we derive expressions for $O(k)$ computation of the determinant of tridiagonal $k$-Toeplitz
matrices of any dimension.
