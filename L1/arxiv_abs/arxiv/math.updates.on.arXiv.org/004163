The current paper studies the synthesis of control strategies that realize reach-and-stay objectives
for nonlinear systems without stability assumptions. Under moderate conditions, we propose a
control synthesis algorithm that is finitely terminating and guaranteed to return a control strategy
provided that the specification is robustly realizable. Such a feature is desirable as the commonly
used abstraction-based methods are sound but not complete for systems that are not incrementally
stable. Fundamental to the proposed method is a fixed-point algorithm characterizing the winning
set of a given specification, i.e., the initial states that can be controlled to satisfy the specification,
over a continuous state space. Interval arithmetic and an adaptive partitioning scheme are used
so that the given precision of the approximation of the winning set is guaranteed. By recording valid
control values throughout the fixed-point iterations, partition-based control strategies can
be extracted immediately after the algorithm terminates. Compared with abstraction-based methods,
the adaptive partitioning scheme reduces the size of the finite partition by utilizing the information
of both the dynamics and the given specification. The proposed algorithm is capable of handling
nonlinear dynamics and non-convex constraints, which makes it applicable to general discrete-time
nonlinear systems and sampled-data systems. The effectiveness of our method is illustrated by
the applications to automatic parallel parking and estimation of the regions of attraction for
continuous-time nonlinear systems.
