This work deals with systems of interacting reinforced stochastic processes, where each process
$X^j=(X_{n,j})_n$ is located at a vertex $j$ of a finite weighted direct graph, and it can be interpreted
as the sequence of "actions" adopted by an agent $j$ of the network. The interaction among the evolving
dynamics of these processes depends on the weighted adjacency matrix $W$ associated to the underlying
graph: indeed, the probability that an agent $j$ chooses a certain action depends on its personal
"inclination" $Z_{n,j}$ and on the inclinations $Z_{n,h}$, with $h\neq j$, of the other agents
according to the elements of $W$. Asymptotic results for the stochastic processes of the personal
inclinations $Z^j=(Z_{n,j})_n$ have been subject of studies in recent papers (e.g. Aletti, Crimaldi,
and Ghiglietti [arXiv:1607.08514, Ann. Appl. Probab., 27(6):3787-3844, 2017]; Crimaldi, Dai
Pra, Louis, and Minelli [arXiv:1602.06217, Forthcoming in Stochastic Process. Appl.]); while
the asymptotic behavior of quantities based on the stochastic processes $X^j$ of the actions has
never been studied yet. In this paper, we fill this gap by characterizing the asymptotic behavior
of the empirical means $N_{n,j}=\sum_{k=1}^n X_{k,j}/n$, proving their almost sure synchronization
and some central limit theorems in the sense of stable convergence. Moreover, we discuss some statistical
applications of these convergence results concerning confidence intervals for the random limit
toward which all the processes of the system converge and tools to make inference on the matrix $W$.
