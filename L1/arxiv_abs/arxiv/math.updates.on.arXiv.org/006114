The level dependent Choquet integral has been proposed to handle decision making problems in which
the importance and the interaction of criteria may depend on the level of the alternatives' evaluations.
This integral is based on a level dependent capacity, which is a family of single capacities associated
to each level of evaluation for the considered criteria. We present two possible formulations of
the level dependent capacity where importance and interaction of criteria are constant inside
each one of the subintervals in which the interval of evaluations for considered criteria is split
or vary with continuity inside the whole interval of evaluations. Since, in general, there is not
only one but many level dependent capacities compatible with the preference information provided
by the Decision Maker, we propose to take into account all of them by using the Robust Ordinal Regression
(ROR) and the Stochastic Multicriteria Acceptability Analysis (SMAA). On one hand, ROR defines
a necessary preference relation (if an alternative a is at least as good as an alternative b for all
compatible level dependent capacities), and a possible preference relation (if a is at least as
good as b for at least one compatible level dependent capacity). On the other hand, considering a
random sampling of compatible level dependent capacities, SMAA gives the probability that each
alternative reaches a certain ranking position as well as the probability that an alternative is
preferred to another. A real-world decision problem on rankings of universities is provided to
illustrate the proposed methodology.
