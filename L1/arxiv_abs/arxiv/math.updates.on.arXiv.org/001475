Many equations of mathematical physics are described by differential polynomials, that is by polynomials
in the derivatives of a certain number of functions. However, up to the knowledge of the author, differential
algebra in a modern setting has never been applied to study the specific algebraic feature of such
equations. The purpose of this short but difficult paper is to revisit a few domains like general
relativity, conformal geometry and contact geometry in the light of a modern approach to nonlinear
systems of partial differential equations, using new methods from Differential Geometry (D.C.
Spencer, 1970), Differential Algebra (J.F. Ritt, 1950 and E. Kolchin, 1973) and Algebraic Analysis
(M. Kashiwara, 1970). Identifying the differential indeterminates of Ritt and Kolchin with the
jet coordinates of Spencer, the idea is to study Differential Duality by using only linear differential
operators with coefficients in a differential field. In particular, the linearized second order
Einstein equations are parametrizing the first order Cauchy stress equations but cannot themselves
be parametrized. In the framework of Homological Algebra, this result is not coherent with the vanishing
of certain first and second extension modules. As a byproduct, we shall prove that gravitation and
electromagnetism must only depend on the second order jets (elations) of the system of conformal
Killing equations. Finally, we shall use these new methods in order to study contact transformations
in arbitrary odd dimension and apply these results to the study of Hamilton-Jacobi equations in
mechanics.
