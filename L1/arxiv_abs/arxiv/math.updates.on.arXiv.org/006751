This paper is devoted to the study of convergence of Fourier series for non-abelian groups and quantum
groups. It is well-known that a number of approximation properties of groups can be interpreted
as some summation methods and mean convergence of associated noncommutative Fourier series. Based
on this framework, this work studies the refined counterpart of pointwise convergence of these
Fourier series. We establish a general criterion of maximal inequalities for approximative identities
of noncommutative Fourier multipliers. As a result we prove that for any countable discrete amenable
group, there exists a sequence of finitely supported positive definite functions tending to $1$
pointwise, so that the associated Fourier multipliers on noncommutative $L_p$-spaces satisfy
the pointwise convergence for all $1<p<\infty$. In a similar fashion, we also obtain results for
a large subclass of groups (as well as discrete quantum groups) with the Haagerup property and weak
amenability. We also consider the analogues of Fej\'{e}r means and Bochner-Riesz means in the noncommutative
setting. Our results in particular apply to the almost everywhere convergence of Fourier series
of $L_p$-functions on non-abelian compact groups. On the other hand, we obtain as a byproduct the
dimension free bounds of noncommutative Hardy-Littlewood maximal inequalities associated with
convex bodies. As an ingredient, our proof also provides a refined version of Junge-Le Merdy-Xu's
square function estimates $H_p (\mathcal M) \simeq L_p^\circ (\mathcal M )$ when $p\to 1$.
