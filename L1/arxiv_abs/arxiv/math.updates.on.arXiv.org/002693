We prove new a posteriori error estimates for surface finite element methods (SFEM). Surface FEM
approximate solutions to PDE posed on surfaces. Prototypical examples are elliptic PDE involving
the Laplace-Beltrami operator. Typically the surface is approximated by a polyhedral or higher-order
polynomial approximation. The resulting FEM exhibits both a geometric consistency error due to
the surface approximation and a standard Galerkin error. A posteriori estimates for SFEM require
practical access to geometric information about the surface in order to computably bound the geometric
error. It is thus advantageous to allow for maximum flexibility in representing surfaces in practical
codes when proving a posteriori error estimates for SFEM. However, previous a posteriori estimates
using general parametric surface representations are suboptimal by one order on $C^2$ surfaces.
Proofs of error estimates optimally reflecting the geometric error instead employ the closest
point projection, which is defined using the signed distance function. Because the closest point
projection is often unavailable or inconvenient to use computationally, a posteriori estimates
using the signed distance function have notable practical limitations. We merge these two perspectives
by assuming {\it practical} access only to a general parametric representation of the surface,
but using the distance function as a {\it theoretical} tool. This allows us to derive sharper geometric
estimators which exhibit improved experimentally observed decay rates when implemented in adaptive
surface finite element algorithms.
