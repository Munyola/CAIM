We study (transverse) scalar curvature type equation on compact Sasaki manifolds, in view of recent
breakthrough of Chen-Cheng \cite{CC1, CC2, CC3} on existence of K\"ahler metrics with constant
scalar curvature (csck) on compact K\"ahler manifolds. Following their strategy, we prove that
given a Sasaki structure (with Reeb vector field and complex structure on its cone fixed ), there
exists a Sasaki structure with transverse constant scalar curvature (cscs) if and only if the $\mathcal{K}$-energy
is reduced proper modulo the identity component of the automorphism group which preserves both
the Reeb vector field and transverse complex structure. Technically, the proof mainly consists
of two parts. The first part is a priori estimates for scalar curvature type equations which are parallel
to Chen-Cheng's results in \cite{CC2, CC3} in Sasaki setting. The second part is geometric pluripotential
theory on a compact Sasaki manifold, building up on profound results in geometric pluripotential
theory on K\"ahler manifolds. There are notable, and indeed subtle differences in Sasaki setting
(compared with K\"ahler setting) for both parts (PDE and pluripotential theory). The PDE part is
an adaption of deep work of Chen-Cheng \cite{CC1, CC2, CC3} to Sasaki setting with necessary modifications.
While the geometric pluripotential theory on a compact Sasaki manifold has new difficulties, compared
with geometric pluripotential theory in K\"ahler setting which is very intricate. We shall present
the details of geometric pluripotential on Sasaki manifolds in a separate paper \cite{HL} (joint
work with Jun Li).
