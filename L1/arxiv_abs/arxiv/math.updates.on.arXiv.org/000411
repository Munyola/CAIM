This paper dwells upon two aspects of affine supergroup theory, investigating the links among them.
First, I discuss the "splitting" properties of affine supergroups, i.e. special kinds of factorizations
they may admit - either globally, or pointwise. Second, I present yet another method to study affine
supergroups (in the algebraic super-geometry setting) by means of super Harish-Chandra pairs.
Namely, I provide an explicit, functorial construction \Psi\ which, with each super Harish-Chandra
pair, associates an affine supergroup that is always globally strongly split (in short, gs-split)
- thus setting a link with the first part of the paper. On the other hand, one has a natural functor \Phi\
from affine supergroups to super Harish-Chandra pairs; then we show that the new functor \Psi\ we
introduce - which goes the other way round - is indeed a quasi-inverse to \Phi, provided we restrict
our attention to the subcategory of affine supergroups that are gs-split. Therefore, (the restrictions
of) \Phi\ and \Psi\ are equivalences between the categories of gs-split affine supergroups and
of super Harish-Chandra pairs. Such a result was known in other contexts, such as the smooth differential
or the complex analytic one, or in some special cases, via different approaches. Here I extend it
to a much larger setup, with a totally different, more geometrical method - a very naif one, by bare
hands, somehow. The case of linear algebraic groups is treated also as an intermediate, inspiring
step. Some examples, applications and further generalizations are presented at the end of the paper.
