Let $(W,S)$ be a Coxeter system and let $P_W(q)$ be its Poincar\'e series. Lusztig has shown that
when $W$ is finite, the quotient $P_W(q^2)/P_W(q)$ is equal to a certain power series $L_{W}(q)$,
defined by specializing one variable in the natural bivariate generating function recording the
lengths and absolute lengths of the involutions in $W$. Both $P_W(q)$ and $L_{W}(q)$ are well-defined
when $W$ is any Coxeter group, and it seems plausible to conjecture that the identity $L_{W}(q) =
P_W(q^2)/P_{W}(q)$ holds in general. In studying this conjecture in the case when $W$ is an affine
Weyl group, it is natural to define a certain polynomial $T_{W}(x,q)$ in an indeterminate $x$ with
coefficients in $\mathbb{Z}[[q]]$. This polynomial is given explicitly by a certain sum of rational
functions attached to the double cosets of the associated finite Weyl group in $W$, and the conjecture
$L_{W}(q) = P_W(q^2)/P_{W}(q)$ is equivalent in this case to the claim that $T_{W}(-1,q)=1$. After
explaining carefully our motivation for the definition of $T_W(x,q)$, we compute an explicit formula
for this polynomial when $W$ is an affine Weyl group of type $A$. This computation establishes our
original conjecture in type $A$ and shows, unexpectedly, that in this case $T_W(x,q)$ is actually
a polynomial in $x$ and $q$ with nonnegative coefficients. More surprisingly, this polynomial
turns out to be a $q$-analogue of the Chebyshev polynomials of the first kind, which coincides precisely
with the "$q$-Chebyshev polynomials" recently studied by Cigler in a completely different context.
