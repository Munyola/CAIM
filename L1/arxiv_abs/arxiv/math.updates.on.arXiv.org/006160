It is customary to couple a quantum system to external classical fields. One application is to couple
the global symmetries of the system (including the Poincar\'{e} symmetry) to background gauge
fields (and a metric for the Poincar\'{e} symmetry). Failure of gauge invariance of the partition
function under gauge transformations of these fields reflects 't Hooft anomalies. It is also common
to view the ordinary (scalar) coupling constants as background fields, i.e. to study the theory
when they are spacetime dependent. We will show that the notion of 't Hooft anomalies can be extended
naturally to include these scalar background fields. Just as ordinary 't Hooft anomalies allow
us to deduce dynamical consequences about the phases of the theory and its defects, the same is true
for these generalized 't Hooft anomalies. Specifically, since the coupling constants vary, we
can learn that certain phase transitions must be present. We will demonstrate these anomalies and
their applications in simple pedagogical examples in one dimension (quantum mechanics) and in
some two, three, and four-dimensional quantum field theories. An anomaly is an example of an invertible
field theory, which can be described as an object in (generalized) differential cohomology. We
give an introduction to this perspective. Also, we use Quillen's superconnections to derive the
anomaly for a free spinor field with variable mass. In a companion paper we will study four-dimensional
gauge theories showing how our view unifies and extends many recently obtained results.
