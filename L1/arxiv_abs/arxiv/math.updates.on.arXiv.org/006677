The induced star arboricity (isa($G$)) of a graph $G$ is a new parameter introduced in 2019 by Axenovich
et \textit{al.} \cite{axia2019}, it is defined as the smallest number of induced star-forests
covering the edges of $G$. An injective edge-coloring $c$ of a graph $G$ is an edge coloring such that
if $e_1$, $e_2$ and $e_3$ are three consecutive edges in $G$ (they are consecutive if they form a path
or a cycle of length three), then $e_1$ and $e_3$ receive different colors. The minimum integer $k$
such that $G$ has an injective $k$-edge-coloring is called injective chromatic index of $G$ ($\chi'_{inj}(G)$).
This parameter was introduced in 2015 by Cardoso et \textit{al.} \cite{CCCD} motivated by the Packet
Radio Network problem. They proved that computing $\chi'_{inj}(G)$ of a graph $G$ is NP-hard and
they gave the injective chromatic index of some classes of graphs. In our paper we first prove that
for any graph $G$ we have isa($G$)=$\chi'_{inj}(G)$. We give some new upper bounds for this last
parameter and we prove that if $G$ is a subcubic graph with maximum average degree less than $\frac{16}{7}
$ (resp. $\frac{8}{3} $, $3$), then $G$ admits an injective edge-coloring with at most 4 (resp. $6$,
$7$) colors. Morover, we establish a tight upper bound for subcubic outerplanar graphs. For this
purpose, we do not use the discharging method but rather we use the fundamental structural properties
of the subcubic graphs and outerplanar subcubic graphs. All our results can be immediately translated
in terms of induced star arboricity.
