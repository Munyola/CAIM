This article describes the geometry of isomorphisms between complements of geometrically irreducible
closed curves in the affine plane $\mathbb{A}^2$, over an arbitrary field, which do not extend to
an automorphism of $\mathbb{A}^2$. We show that such isomorphisms are quite exceptional. In particular,
they occur only when both curves are isomorphic to open subsets of the affine line $\mathbb{A}^1$,
with the same number of complement points, over any field extension of the ground field. Moreover,
the isomorphism is uniquely determined by one of the curves, up to left composition with an automorphism
of $\mathbb{A}^2$, except in the case where the curve is isomorphic to the affine line $\mathbb{A}^1$
or to the punctured line $\mathbb{A}^1 \setminus \{0\}$. If one curve is isomorphic to $\mathbb{A}^1$,
then both curves are in fact equivalent to lines. In addition, for any positive integer $n$, we construct
a sequence of $n$ pairwise non-equivalent closed embeddings of $\mathbb{A}^1 \setminus \{0\}$
with isomorphic complements. In characteristic~$0$ we even construct infinite sequences with
this property. Finally, we give a geometric construction that produces a large family of examples
of non-isomorphic geometrically irreducible closed curves in $\mathbb{A}^2$ that have isomorphic
complements, answering negatively the Complement Problem posed by Hanspeter Kraft.. This also
gives a negative answer to the holomorphic version of this problem in any dimension $n \geq 2$. The
question had been raised by Pierre-Marie Poloni.
