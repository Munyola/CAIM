The Green-Naghdi equations are a nonlinear dispersive perturbation of the nonlinear shallow water
equations, more precise by one order of approximation. These equations are commonly used for the
simulation of coastal flows, and in particular in regions where the water depth vanishes (the shoreline).
The local well-posedness of the Green-Naghdi equations (and their justification as an asymptotic
model for the water waves equations) has been extensively studied, but always under the assumption
that the water depth is bounded from below by a positive constant. The aim of this article is to remove
this assumption. The problem then becomes a free-boundary problem since the position of the shoreline
is unknown and driven by the solution itself. For the (hyperbolic) nonlinear shallow water equation,
this problem is very related to the vacuum problem for a compressible gas. The Green-Naghdi equation
include additional nonlinear, dispersive and topography terms with a complex degenerate structure
at the boundary. In particular, the degeneracy of the topography terms makes the problem loose its
quasilinear structure and become fully nonlinear. Dispersive smoothing also degenerates and
its behavior at the boundary can be described by an ODE with regular singularity. These issues require
the development of new tools, some of which of independent interest such as the study of the mixed
initial boundary value problem for dispersive perturbations of characteristic hyperbolic systems,
elliptic regularization with respect to conormal derivatives, or general Hardy-type inequalities.
