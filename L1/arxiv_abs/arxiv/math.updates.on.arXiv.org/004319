Bootstrap percolation is a wide class of monotone cellular automata with random initial state.
In this work we develop tools for studying in full generality one of the three `universality' classes
of bootstrap percolation models in two dimensions, termed subcritical. We introduce the new notion
of `critical densities' serving the role of `difficulties' for critical models, but adapted to
subcritical ones. We characterise the critical probability in terms of these quantities and successfully
apply this link to prove new and old results for concrete models such as DTBP and Spiral as well as a
general non-trivial upper bound. Our approach establishes and exploits a tight connection between
subcritical bootstrap percolation and a suitable generalisation of classical oriented percolation,
which will undoubtedly be the source of more results and could provide an entry point for general
percolationists to bootstrap percolation. Furthermore, we prove that above a certain critical
probability there is exponential decay of the probability of a one-arm event, while below it the
event has positive probability and the expected infection time is infinite. We also identify this
as the transition of the spectral gap and mean infection time of the corresponding kinetically constrained
model. Finally, we essentially characterise the noise sensitivity properties at fixed density
for the two natural one-arm events. In doing so we answer fully or partially most of the open questions
asked by Balister, Bollob\'as, Przykucki and Smith (2016) -- namely we are concerned with their
Questions 11, 12, 13, 14 and 17.
