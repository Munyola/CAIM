Information communicated within cyber-physical systems (CPSs) is often used in determining the
physical states of such systems, and malicious adversaries may intercept these communications
in order to infer future states of a CPS or its components. Accordingly, there arises a need to protect
the state values of a system. Recently, the notion of differential privacy has been used to protect
state trajectories in dynamical systems, and it is this notion of privacy that we use here to protect
the state trajectories of CPSs. We incorporate a cloud computer to coordinate the agents comprising
the CPSs of interest, and the cloud offers the ability to remotely coordinate many agents, rapidly
perform computations, and broadcast the results, making it a natural fit for systems with many interacting
agents or components. Striving for broad applicability, we solve infinite-horizon linear-quadratic-regulator
(LQR) problems, and each agent protects its own state trajectory by adding noise to its states before
they are sent to the cloud. The cloud then uses these state values to generate optimal inputs for the
agents. As a result, private data is fed into feedback loops at each iteration, and each noisy term
affects every future state of every agent. In this paper, we show that the differentially private
LQR problem can be related to the well-studied linear-quadratic-Gaussian (LQG) problem, and we
provide bounds on how agents' privacy requirements affect the cloud's ability to generate optimal
feedback control values for the agents. These results are illustrated in numerical simulations.
