An upper quasi-density on $\mathbf{H}$ (the integers or the non-negative integers) is a subadditive
function $\mu^\ast: \mathcal{P}(\mathbf{H}) \to \bf R$ such that $\mu^\ast(X) \le \mu^\ast(\mathbf{H})
= 1$ and $\mu^\ast(k \cdot X + h) = \frac{1}{k}\, \mu^\ast(X)$ for all $X \subseteq \mathbf{H}$ and
$h,k \in \mathbf{N}^+$, where $k \cdot X := \{kx: x \in X\}$. Upper quasi-densities were recently
introduced by the authors as an abstraction of classical objects in number theory, examples including
the upper Buck, upper P\'olya, and upper analytic densities, as well as the uncountable family of
upper $\alpha$-densities, where $\alpha$ is a real parameter $\ge -1$. In the present work, we inquire
further into this line of research by studying various properties of uqd-small sets, where a subset
$X$ of $\mathbf{H}$ is said to be uqd-small if $\mu^\star(X) = 0$ for every upper quasi-density $\mu^\star$
on $\mathbf{H}$. In particular, we establish that a subset of $\mathbf H$ is uqd-small if and only
if it belongs to the zero set of the upper Buck density on $\mathbf Z$. This characterization, combined
with a generalization of an inequality of R.C. Buck, allows us to show that many interesting sets
(including the image of $\mathbf{Z}$ through a non-linear integral polynomial in one variable,
or the numbers represented by a binary quadratic form with integer coefficients whose discriminant
is not a perfect square) are uqd-small. Overall, we can thus strengthen, extend, and unify several
``independent results'' previously known for some of the classical upper densities mentioned
in the above.
