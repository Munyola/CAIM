What transpires from recent research is that temperatures and radiative forcing seem to be characterized
by a linear trend with two changes in the rate of growth. The first occurs in the early 60s and indicates
a very large increase in the rate of growth of both temperature and radiative forcing series. This
was termed as the "onset of sustained global warming". The second is related to the more recent so-called
hiatus period, which suggests that temperatures and total radiative forcing have increased less
rapidly since the mid-90s compared to the larger rate of increase from 1960 to 1990. There are two
issues that remain unresolved. The first is whether the breaks in the slope of the trend functions
of temperatures and radiative forcing are common. This is important because common breaks coupled
with the basic science of climate change would strongly suggest a causal effect from anthropogenic
factors to temperatures. The second issue relates to establishing formally via a proper testing
procedure that takes into account the noise in the series, whether there was indeed a `hiatus period'
for temperatures since the mid 90s. This is important because such a test would counter the widely
held view that the hiatus is the product of natural internal variability. Our paper provides tests
related to both issues. The results show that the breaks in temperatures and radiative forcing are
common and that the hiatus is characterized by a significant decrease in their rate of growth. The
statistical results are of independent interest and applicable more generally.
