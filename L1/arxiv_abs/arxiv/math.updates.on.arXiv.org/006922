Synthetic biology is an interdisciplinary field aiming to design biochemical systems with desired
behaviors. To this end, molecular controllers have been developed which, when embedded into a pre-existing
ambient biochemical network, control the dynamics of the underlying target molecular species.
When integrated into smaller compartments, such as biological cells in vivo, or vesicles in vitro,
controllers have to be calibrated to factor in the intrinsic noise. In this context, molecular controllers
put forward in the literature have focused on manipulating the mean (first moment), and reducing
the variance (second moment), of the target species. However, many critical biochemical processes
are realized via higher-order moments, particularly the number and configuration of the modes
(maxima) of the probability distributions. To bridge the gap, a controller called stochastic morpher
is put forward in this paper, inspired by gene-regulatory networks, which, under suitable time-scale
separations, morphs the probability distribution of the target species into a desired predefined
form. The morphing can be performed at the lower-resolution, allowing one to achieve desired multi-modality/multi-stability,
and at the higher-resolution, allowing one to achieve arbitrary probability distributions. Properties
of the controller, such as robust perfect adaptation and convergence, are rigorously established,
and demonstrated on various examples. Also proposed is a blueprint for an experimental implementation
of stochastic morpher.
