Consider a population where individuals give birth at constant rate during their lifetimes to i.i.d.
copies of themselves. Individuals bear clonally inherited types, but (neutral) mutations may
happen at the birth events. The smallest subtree containing the genealogy of all the extant individuals
at a fixed time \tau, is called the coalescent point process. We enrich this process with the history
of the mutations that appeared over time, and call it the marked coalescent point process. With the
help of limit theorems for L\'evy processes with marked jumps established in a previous work ( arXiv:1305.6245
), we prove the convergence of the marked coalescent point process with large population size and
two possible regimes for the mutations - one of them being a classical rare mutation regime, towards
a multivariate Poisson point process. This Poisson point process can be described as the coalescent
point process of the limiting population at \tau, with mutations arising as inhomogeneous regenerative
sets along the lineages. Its intensity measure is further characterized thanks to the excursion
theory for spectrally positive L\'evy processes. In the rare mutations asymptotic, mutations
arise as the image of a Poisson process by the ladder height process of a L\'evy process with infinite
variation, and in the particular case of the critical branching process with exponential lifetimes,
the limiting object is the Poisson point process of the depths of excursions of the Brownian motion,
with Poissonian mutations on the lineages.
