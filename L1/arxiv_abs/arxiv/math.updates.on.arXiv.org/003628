Let $f:M\to M$ be a $C^1$ map of a compact manifold $M$, with dimension at least $2$, admitting some
point whose future trajectory has only negative Lyapunov exponents. Then this trajectory converges
to a periodic sink. We need only assume that $Df$ is never the null map at any point (in particular,
we need no extra smoothness assumption on $Df$), encompassing a wide class of possible critical
behavior. Similarly, a trajectory having only positive Lyapunov exponents for a $C^1$ diffeomorphism
is itself a periodic repeller (source). Analogously for a $C^1$ open and dense subset of vector field
on finite dimensional manifolds: for a flow $\phi_t$ generated by such a vector field, if a trajectory
admits weak asymptotic sectional contraction (the extreme rates of expansion of the Linear Poincar\'e
Flow are all negative), then this trajectory belongs either to the basin of attraction of a periodic
hyperbolic attracting orbit (a periodic sink or an attracting equilibrium); or the trajectory
accumulates a codimension one saddle singularity. Similar results hold for weak sectional expanding
trajectories. Both results extend part of the non-uniform hyperbolic theory (Pesin's Theory)
from the $C^{1+}$ diffeomorphism setting to $C^1$ endomorphisms and $C^1$ flows. Some ergodic
theoretical consequences are discussed. The proofs use versions of Pliss' Lemma for maps and flows
translated as (reverse) hyperbolic times, and a condition ensuring that certain subadditive cocycles
over vector fields are in fact additive.
