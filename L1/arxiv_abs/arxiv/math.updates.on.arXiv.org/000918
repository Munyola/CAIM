To give an almost quaternionic structure on a 4n-manifold $M$ is equivalent to give its bundle of
twistors $Z(M,D)\longrightarrow M$. When $D$ is invariant under a torsion free connection, $Z(M,D)
$ can be provided with an almost complex structure $ \mathbb J $. In the case $ n = 1 $ Atiyah, Hitchin
and Singer have related the integrability of $ \mathbb J $ to the geometry of $ (M, D) $. For $ n> 1
$ Salamon showed that the almost complex structure $ \mathbb J $ on $ Z (M, D) $ is always integrable.
The purpose of this article is to extend these results to the generalized complex geometry. We begin
by defining the concept of almost generalized quaternionic manifolds $ (M, g, \mathcal D ) $. We will
see that we can associate a twistor space denoted by $ \mathcal Z(M, \mathcal D) $ which is a $ \mathbb
S^2$-bundle over $ M $. When $\mathcal D$ is invariant under a generalized torsion free connection,
then $ \mathcal Z(M, \mathcal D) $ comes with an almost generalized complex structure $\mathbb J$.
Whatever the dimension of $ M $ is, we give a criterion for integrability of the almost generalized
complex structure $ \mathbb J $ on $ \mathcal Z(M,\mathcal D) $. In the particular case where $ (M,
g,\mathcal D) $ is a generalized quaternionic K\"ahler manifold, we show that $\mathbb J$ is always
integrable as soon as $n>1$. We illustrate this work by giving several examples of generalized
quaternionic K\"ahler manifolds for which the almost generalized complex structure $ \mathbb
J $ on the twistor space $ \mathcal Z(M,\mathcal D) $ is integrable.
