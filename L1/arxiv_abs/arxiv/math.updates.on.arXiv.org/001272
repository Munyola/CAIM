Ebola virus disease is a lethal human and primate disease that currently requires a particular attention
from the international health authorities due to important outbreaks in some Western African countries
and possible spread to other continents, which has already occurred in the USA and Spain. Regarding
the emergency of this situation, there is a need of development of decision tools to assist the authorities
to focus their efforts in important factors to eradicate Ebola. In particular, mathematical modelling
can help to predict the possible evolution of the Ebola outbreaks and to give some recommendations
about surveillance. In this work, we propose a novel spatial and temporal model, called Be-CoDiS
(Between-COuntries Disease Spread), to study the evolution of human diseases between countries.
The goal is to simulate the spread of a particular disease and identify risk zones worldwide. The
main interesting characteristics of Be-CoDiS are the consideration of the migratory flux between
countries and control measure effects and the use of time dependent coefficients adapted to each
country. First, we focus on the mathematical formulation of each component of the model. Next, in
order to validate our approach, we consider various numerical experiments regarding the 2014 Ebola
epidemic. In particular, we study the ability of the model in predicting the EVD evolution at 30 days
and until the end of the epidemic. The results are compared to real data and other models outputs found
in the literature. Finally, a brief parameter sensitivity analysis is done.
