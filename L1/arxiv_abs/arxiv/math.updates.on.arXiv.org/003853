The main results of this paper provide a polynomial time algorithm for approximating the logarithm
of the number of maximal near perfect matchings in dense graphs. By dense we mean that $|E(G)|\geq\alpha|V(G)|^2$
for some fixed $\alpha>0$, and a maximal $\varepsilon$-near perfect matching is a maximal matching
which covers at least $(1-\varepsilon)|V(G)|$ vertices. More precisely, we provide a deterministic
algorithm that for a given (dense) graph $G$ of order $n$ and a real number $\varepsilon>0$, returns
either a conclusion that $G$ has no $\varepsilon$-near perfect matching, or a positive real number
$m\leq1/2$, such that the logarithm of the number of maximal $\varepsilon$-near perfect matchings
in $G$ is at least $mn\log n$. The upper bound of such graphs is always $1/2(n\log n)$. The running
time of this algorithm is $O(f(\varepsilon)n^{5/2})$, where $f(\cdot)$ is an explicit function.
Additionally, for a special class of dense graphs, we show that $(1+\varepsilon)mn\log n$ is an
upper bound on the number of maximal near perfect matchings. Our algorithm is based on analysis of
counting the number of maximal near perfect matchings of generalized quasirandom graphs. We start
with an algorithmic version of the Szemer\'edi Regularity Lemma, then we partition our graph into
bounded number of quasirandom subgraphs. The way we partition the graph is determined by solving
a system of linear inequalities whose size is bounded by $f^\prime(\varepsilon)$ depending only
on $\varepsilon$. The proof of this result is of independent interest in graph theory.
