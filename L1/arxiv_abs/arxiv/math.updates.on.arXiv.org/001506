Classical finite association schemes lead to a finite-dimensional algebras which are generated
by finitely many stochastic matrices. Moreover, there exist associated finite hypergroups. The
notion of classical discrete association schemes can be easily extended to the possibly infinite
case. Moreover, the notion of association schemes can be relaxed slightly by using suitably deformed
families of stochastic matrices by skipping the integrality conditions. This leads to larger class
of examples which are again associated to discrete hypergroups. In this paper we propose a topological
generalization of the notion of association schemes by using a locally compact basis space $X$ and
a family of Markov-kernels on $X$ indexed by a further locally compact space $D$ where the supports
of the associated probability measures satisfy some partition property. These objects, called
continuous association schemes, will be related to hypergroup structures on $D$. We study some
basic results for this new notion and present several classes of examples. It turns out that for a
given commutative hypergroup the existence of an associated continuous association scheme implies
that the hypergroup has many features of a double coset hypergroup. We in particular show that commutative
hypergroups, which are associated with commutative continuous association schemes, carry dual
positive product formulas for the characters. On the other hand, we prove some rigidity results
in particular in the compact case which say that for given spaces $X,D$ there are only a few continuous
association schemes.
