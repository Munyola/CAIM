Consider the problem of choosing a set of actions to optimize an objective function that is a real-valued
polymatroid function subject to matroid constraints. The greedy strategy provides an approximate
solution to the optimization problem, and it is known to satisfy some performance bounds in terms
of the total curvature under matroid constraints. The total curvature depends on the value of objective
function on sets outside the constraint matroid. If we are given a function defined only on the matroid,
the problem still makes sense, but the existing bounds involving the total curvature do not apply.
This is puzzling: If the optimization problem is perfectly well defined, why should the bounds no
longer apply? This motivates an alternative formulation of such bounds. To this end, we provide
necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of an extension of a polymatroid function
defined on the matroid to a polymatroid function defined on the whole power set. Our results give
rise to bounds for systems satisfying the necessary and sufficient conditions, which apply to problems
where the objective function is defined only on the matroid. When the objective function is defined
on the entire power set, the bounds we derive are in general improved over the previous ones. We also
define a new curvature involving only sets in the matroid and provide necessary and sufficient conditions
for the existence of bounds in terms of the curvature. Moreover, we prove that the bounds in terms
of the new curvature definition are improved over the previous ones.....
