Recent years have witnessed the rapid development of block coordinate update (BCU) methods, which
are particularly suitable for problems involving large-sized data and/or variables. In optimization,
BCU first appears as the coordinate descent method that works well for smooth problems or those with
separable nonsmooth terms and/or separable constraints. As nonseparable constraints exist,
BCU can be applied under primal-dual settings. In the literature, it has been shown that for weakly
convex problems with nonseparable linear constraint, BCU with fully Gauss-Seidel updating rule
may fail to converge and that with fully Jacobian rule can converge sublinearly. However, empirically
the method with Jacobian update is usually slower than that with Gauss-Seidel rule. To maintain
their advantages, we propose a hybrid Jacobian and Gauss-Seidel BCU method for solving linearly
constrained multi-block structured convex programming, where the objective may have a nonseparable
quadratic term and separable nonsmooth terms. At each primal block variable update, the method
approximates the augmented Lagrangian function at an affine combination of the previous two iterates,
and the affinely mixing matrix with desired nice properties can be chosen through solving a semidefinite
programming. We show that the hybrid method enjoys the theoretical convergence guarantee as Jacobian
BCU. In addition, we numerically demonstrate that the method can perform as well as Gauss-Seidel
method and better than a recently proposed randomized primal-dual BCU method.
