We present a robust numerical method for solving incompressible, immiscible two-phase flows.
The method extends the monolithic phase conservative level set method with embedded redistancing
by Quezada de Luna et al. [38] and a semi-implicit high-order projection scheme for variable-density
flows by Guermond and Salgado [17]. The level set method can be initialized conveniently via a simple
phase indicator field, which is pre-processed to obtain an approximate signed distance function.
To do this, we propose a new PDE-based redistancing method. We also improve the scheme in [38] to provide
more accuracy and robustness in full two-phase flow simulations. Specifically, we perform an extra
step to ensure convergence to the signed distance level set function and simplify other aspects
of the original scheme. Lastly, we introduce consistent artificial viscosity to stabilize the
momentum equations in the context of the projection scheme. This stabilization is algebraic, has
no tunable parameters and is suitable for unstructured meshes and arbitrary refinement levels.
The overall methodology includes few numerical tuning parameters; however, for the wide range
of problems that we solve, we identify only one parameter that strongly affects performance of the
computational model and provide a value that provides accurate results across all the benchmarks
presented. The result is a robust, accurate, and efficient two-phase flow model, which is mass-
and volume-conserving on unstructured meshes and has low user input requirements for real applications.
