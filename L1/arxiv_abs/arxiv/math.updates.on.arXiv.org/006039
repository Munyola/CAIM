We propose a probabilistic Las Vegas variant of Brill-Noether's algorithm for computing a basis
of the Riemann-Roch space $L(D)$ associated to a divisor $D$ on a projective nodal plane curve $\mathcal
C$ over a sufficiently large perfect field $k$. Our main result shows that this algorithm requires
at most $O(\max(\mathrm{deg}(\mathcal C)^{2\omega}, \mathrm{deg}(D_+)^\omega))$ arithmetic
operations in $k$, where $\omega$ is a feasible exponent for matrix multiplication and $D_+$ is
the smallest effective divisor such that $D_+\geq D$. This improves the best known upper bounds
on the complexity of computing Riemann-Roch spaces. Our algorithm may fail, but we show that provided
that a few mild assumptions are satisfied, the failure probability is bounded by $O(\max(\mathrm{deg}(\mathcal
C)^4, \mathrm{deg}(D_+)^2)/\lvert \mathcal E\rvert)$, where $\mathcal E$ is a finite subset
of $k$ in which we pick elements uniformly at random. We provide a freely available C++/NTL implementation
of the proposed algorithm and we present experimental data. In particular, our implementation
enjoys a speed-up larger than 7 (and up to 45 for large finite fields) on several examples compared
to the reference implementation in the Magma computer algebra system. As a by-product, our algorithm
also yields a method for computing the group law on the Jacobian of a smooth plane curve of genus $g$
within $O(g^\omega)$ operations in $k$, which slightly improves in this context the best known
complexity $O(g^{\omega+\varepsilon})$ of Khuri-Makdisi's algorithm.
