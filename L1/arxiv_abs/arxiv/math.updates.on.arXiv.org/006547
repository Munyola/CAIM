Phase retrieval in real or complex Hilbert spaces is the task of recovering a vector, up to an overall
unimodular multiplicative constant, from magnitudes of linear quantities. In this paper, we assume
that the vector is normalized, but retain only qualitative, binary information about the measured
quantities by comparing them with a threshold. In more specific, geometric terms, we choose a sequence
of random subspaces in a real or complex Hilbert space and only record whether a given vector is closer
to the subspace than to the complementary subspace. The subspaces have half the dimension of the
Hilbert space and are independent, uniformly distributed with respect to the action of the orthogonal
or unitary groups. The main goal of this paper is to find a feasible algorithm for approximate recovery
based on the information gained about the vector from these binary questions and to establish error
bounds for its approximate recovery. We provide a pointwise bound for fixed input vectors and a uniform
bound that controls the worst-case scenario among all inputs. Both bounds hold with high probability
with respect to the choice of the subspaces. For real or complex vectors of dimension $n$, the pointwise
bound requires $m \ge C \delta^{-2} n \log(n)$ and the uniform bound $m \ge C \delta^{-2} n^2 \log(\delta^{-1}
n)$ binary questions in order to achieve an accuracy of $\delta$. The accuracy $\delta$ is measured
by the operator norm of the difference between the rank-one orthogonal projections corresponding
to the normalized input vector and its approximate recovery.
