Millimeter wave (mmW) bands between 30 and 300 GHz are considered a promising candidate for next-generation
cellular networks to relieve spectral congestion in conventional cellular frequencies. However,
cellular communication at these frequencies will likely require highly directional transmissions
to achieve suitable signal range. This reliance on directional beamforming complicates initial
cell search since the mobile and base station must jointly search over a potentially large angular
directional space to locate a suitable path to initiate communication. This paper proposes a directional
cell search procedure where each base station periodically transmits synchronization signals
in randomly varying directions. Detectors are derived for this synchronization signal based on
a Generalized Likelihood Ratio Test (GLRT) for the case where (i) the mobile has only analog beamforming
(where the mobile can "look" in only direction at a time) and (ii) digital beamforming where the mobile
has access to digital samples from all antennas. Simulations under realistic parameters demonstrate
that mobiles may not be able to achieve suitable detection performance with analog beamforming
alone. In contrast, digital beamforming offers dramatically better performance. We argue that
the additional power consumption cost of digital beamforming can be offset by using very low quantization
rates with minimal performance loss, thus arguing that low-rate fully digital front-ends may be
a better design choice for directional cell search.
