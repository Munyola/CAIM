Given any polytope $P$ and any generic linear functional ${\bf c} $, one obtains a directed graph
$G(P,{\bf c})$ by taking the 1-skeleton of $P$ and orienting each edge $e(u,v)$ from $u$ to $v$ for
${\bf c} (u) <{\bf c} ( v)$. This paper examines the question of finding sufficient conditions on
a polytope $P$ and generic cost vector $\bf{ c}$ so that the graph $G(P, {\bf c} )$ will not have any
directed paths which revisit a face of $P$ after departing from it. This is equivalent to the question
of finding conditions on $P$ and ${\bf c} $ under which the simplex method for linear programming
will be efficient under all choices of pivot rules. Conditions are given which provably yield a corollary
of the desired directed graph face nonrevisiting property and which could perhaps suffice to give
the desired property itself. One of the conditions proposed is that $G(P,{\bf c} )$ be the Hasse diagram
of a partially ordered set, which is equivalent to requiring nonrevisiting of 1-dimensional faces.
This opens the door to the usage of poset-theoretic techniques. This also leads to a result for simple
polytopes in which $G(P,{\bf c})$ is the Hasse diagram of a lattice $L$ that the order complex of each
open interval in $L$ is homotopy equivalent to a ball or a sphere of some dimension. Applications
are given to the weak Bruhat order, the Tamari lattice, and more generally to the Cambrian lattices,
using realizations of the Hasse diagrams of these posets as 1-skeleta of permutahedra, associahedra,
and generalized associahedra.
