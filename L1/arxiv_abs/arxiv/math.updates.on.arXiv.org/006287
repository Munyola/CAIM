The classical persistence algorithm virtually computes the unique decomposition of a persistence
module implicitly given by an input simplicial filtration. Based on matrix reduction, this algorithm
is a cornerstone of the emergent area of topological data analysis. Its input is a simplicial filtration
defined over integers $\mathbb{Z}$ giving rise to a $1$-parameter persistence module. It has been
recognized that multi-parameter version of persistence modules given by simplicial filtrations
over $d$-dimensional integer grids $\mathbb{Z}^d$ is equally or perhaps more important in data
science applications. However, in the multi-parameter setting, one of the main bottlenecks is
that topological summaries such as barcodes and distances among them cannot be as efficiently computed
as in the $1$-parameter case because there is no known generalization of the persistence algorithm
for computing the decomposition of multi-parameter persistence modules. The Meataxe algorithm,
a popular one known for computing such a decomposition runs in $\tilde{O}(n^{12d})$ time where
$n$ is the size of the input filtration. We present for the first time a generalization of the persistence
algorithm based on a generalized matrix reduction technique that runs in $O(n^{2\omega+1})$ time
for $d=2$ and in $O(n^{d(2\omega +1)})$ time for $d>2$ where $\omega<2.373$ is the exponent for
matrix multiplication. Various structural and computational results connecting the graded modules
from commutative algebra to matrix reductions are established through the course.
