In this paper we prove the existence of a new type of relaxation oscillation occurring in a one-block
Burridge-Knopoff model with Ruina rate-and-state friction law. In the relevant parameter regime,
the system is slow-fast with two slow variables and one fast. The oscillation is special for several
reasons: Firstly, its singular limit is unbounded, the amplitude of the cycle growing like $\log
\epsilon^{-1}$ as $\epsilon\rightarrow 0$. As a consequence of this estimate, the unboundedness
of the cycle cannot be captured by a simple $\epsilon$-dependent scaling of the variables, see e.g.
\cite{Gucwa2009783}. We therefore obtain its limit on the Poincar\'e sphere. Here we find that
the singular limit consists of a slow part on an attracting critical manifold, and a fast part on the
equator (i.e. at $\infty$) of the Poincar\'e sphere, which includes motion along a center manifold.
The reduced flow on this center manifold runs out along the manifold's boundary, in a special way,
leading to a complex return to the slow manifold. We prove the existence of the limit cycle by showing
that a return map is a contraction. The main technical difficulty in this part is due to the fact that
the critical manifold loses hyperbolicity at an exponential rate at infinity. We therefore use
the method in \cite{kristiansen2017a}, applying the standard blowup technique in an extended
phase space. In this way we identify a singular cycle, consisting of $12$ pieces, all with desirable
hyperbolicity properties, that enables the perturbation into an actual limit cycle for $0<\epsilon\ll
1$.
