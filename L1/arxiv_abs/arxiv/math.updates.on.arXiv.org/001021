Parisi's formal replica-symmetry--breaking (RSB) scheme for mean-field spin glasses has long
been interpreted in terms of many pure states organized ultrametrically. However, the early version
of this interpretation, as applied to the short-range Edwards-Anderson model, runs into problems
because as shown by Newman and Stein (NS) it does not allow for chaotic size dependence, and predicts
non-self-averaging that cannot occur. NS proposed the concept of the metastate (a probability
distribution over infinite-size Gibbs states in a given sample that captures the effects of chaotic
size dependence) and a non-standard interpretation of the RSB results in which the metastate is
non-trivial and is responsible for what was called non-self-averaging. Here we use the effective
field theory of RSB, in conjunction with the rigorous definitions of pure states and the metastate
in infinite-size systems, to show that the non-standard picture follows directly from the RSB mean-field
theory. In addition, the metastate-averaged state possesses power-law correlations throughout
the low temperature phase; the corresponding exponent $\zeta$ takes the value $4$ according to
the field theory in high dimensions $d$, and describes the effective fractal dimension of clusters
of spins. Further, the logarithm of the number of pure states in the decomposition of the metastate-averaged
state that can be distinguished if only correlations in a window of size $W$ can be observed is of order
$W^{d-\zeta}$. These results extend the non-standard picture quantitatively; we show that arguments
against this scenario are inconclusive.
