We study the length of the longest increasing and longest decreasing subsequences of random permutations
drawn from the Mallows measure. Under this measure, the probability of a permutation pi in S_n is
proportional to q^{inv(pi)} where q is a real parameter and inv(pi) is the number of inversions in
pi. The case q=1 corresponds to uniformly random permutations. The Mallows measure was introduced
by Mallows in connection with ranking problems in statistics. We determine the typical order of
magnitude of the lengths of the longest increasing and decreasing subsequences, as well as large
deviation bounds for them. We also provide a simple bound on the variance of these lengths, and prove
a law of large numbers for the length of the longest increasing subsequence. Assuming without loss
of generality that q<1, our results apply when q is a function of n satisfying n(1-q) -> infty.
The case that n(1-q)=O(1) was considered previously by Mueller and Starr. In our parameter range,
the typical length of the longest increasing subsequence is of order n(1-q)^(1/2), whereas the
typical length of the longest decreasing subsequence has four possible behaviors according to
the precise dependence of n and q. We show also that in the graphical representation of a Mallows-distributed
permutation, most points are found in a symmetric strip around the diagonal whose width is of order
1/(1-q). This suggests a connection between the longest increasing subsequence in the Mallows
model and the model of last passage percolation in a strip.
