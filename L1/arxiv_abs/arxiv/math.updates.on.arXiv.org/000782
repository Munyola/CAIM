The groundbreaking work of Rothvo{\ss} [arxiv: 1311.2369 ] established that every linear program
expressing the matching polytope has an exponential number of inequalities (formally, the matching
polytope has exponential extension complexity). Apart from providing an alternative, simple
information-theoretic proof, we derive strong bounds on the polyhedral inapproximability of
the matching polytope: for fixed $0 < \varepsilon < 1$, every polyhedral $(1 + \varepsilon
/ n)$-approximation requires an exponential number of inequalities, where $n$ is the number of
vertices. This is sharp given the well-known $\rho$-approximation of size $O(\binom{n}{\rho/(\rho-1)})$
provided by the odd-sets of size up to $\rho/(\rho-1)$. Thus matching is the first problem in $P$,
whose natural linear encoding does not admit a \emph{fully polynomial-size relaxation scheme}
(the polyhedral equivalent of an FPTAS), which provides a sharp separation from the \emph{polynomial-size
relaxation scheme} obtained e.g., via constant-sized odd-sets mentioned above. Our approach
reuses ideas from Rothvo{\ss} [arxiv: 1311.2369 ] however the main lower bounding technique is
different: the original proof is based on the hyperplane separation bound (also called the rectangle
corruption bound), whereas we employ common information instead as introduced in Braun and Pokutta
[ this http URL ]. By using common information, it turns out that the high extension complexity for
both, the matching polytope and the correlation polytope, stem from the same source of hardness:
a direct sum structure.
