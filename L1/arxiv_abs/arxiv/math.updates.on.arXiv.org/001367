We propose a nonparametric method to explicitly model and represent the derivatives of smooth underlying
trajectories for longitudinal data. This representation is based on a direct Karhunen--Lo\`eve
expansion of the unobserved derivatives and leads to the notion of derivative principal component
analysis, which complements functional principal component analysis, one of the most popular
tools of functional data analysis. The proposed derivative principal component scores can be obtained
for irregularly spaced and sparsely observed longitudinal data, as typically encountered in biomedical
studies, as well as for functional data which are densely measured. Novel consistency results and
asymptotic convergence rates for the proposed estimates of the derivative principal component
scores and other components of the model are derived under a unified scheme for sparse or dense observations
and mild conditions. We compare the proposed representations for derivatives with alternative
approaches in simulation settings and also in a wallaby growth curve application. It emerges that
representations using the proposed derivative principal component analysis recover the underlying
derivatives more accurately compared to principal component analysis-based approaches especially
in settings where the functional data are represented with only a very small number of components
or are densely sampled. In a second wheat spectra classification example, derivative principal
component scores were found to be more predictive for the protein content of wheat than the conventional
functional principal component scores.
