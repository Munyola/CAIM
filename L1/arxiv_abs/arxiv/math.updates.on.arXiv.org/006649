This paper concerns a high-dimensional stochastic programming problem of minimizing a function
of expected cost with a matrix argument. To this problem, one of the most widely applied solution
paradigms is the sample average approximation (SAA), which uses the average cost over sampled scenarios
as a surrogate to approximate the expected cost. Traditional SAA theories require the sample size
to grow rapidly when the problem dimensionality increases. Indeed, for a problem of optimizing
over a $p$-by-$p$ matrix, the sample complexity of the SAA is given by $\tilde O(1)\cdot \frac{p^2}{\epsilon^2}\cdot{polylog}(\frac{1}{\epsilon})$
to achieve an $\epsilon$-suboptimality gap, for some poly-logarithmic function ${polylog}(\,\cdot\,)$
and some quantity $\tilde O(1)$ independent of dimensionality $p$ and sample size $n$. In contrast,
this paper considers a regularized SAA (RSAA) with a low-rankness-inducing penalty. We demonstrate
that the sample complexity of RSAA is $\tilde O(1)\cdot \frac{p}{\epsilon^3}\cdot {polylog}(p,\,\frac{1}{\epsilon})$,
which is almost linear in $p$ and thus indicates a substantially lower dependence on dimensionality.
Therefore, RSAA can be more advantageous than SAA especially for larger scale and higher dimensional
problems. Due to the close correspondence between stochastic programming and statistical learning,
our results also indicate that high-dimensional low-rank matrix recovery is possible generally
beyond a linear model, even if the common assumption of restricted strong convexity is completely
absent.
