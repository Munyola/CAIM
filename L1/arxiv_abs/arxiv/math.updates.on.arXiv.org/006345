This paper develops boundary observer for estimation of congested freeway traffic states based
on Aw-Rascle-Zhang (ARZ) partial differential equations (PDE) model. Traffic state estimation
refers to acquisition of traffic state information from partially observed traffic data. This
problem is relevant for freeway due to its limited accessibility to real-time traffic information.
We propose a model-driven approach in which estimation of aggregated traffic states in a freeway
segment are obtained simply from boundary measurement of flow and velocity without knowledge of
the initial states. The macroscopic traffic dynamics is represented by the ARZ model, consisting
of $2 \times 2$ coupled nonlinear hyperbolic PDEs for traffic density and velocity. Analysis of
the linearized ARZ model leads to the study of a hetero-directional hyperbolic PDE model for congested
traffic regime. Using spatial transformation and PDE backstepping method, we construct a boundary
observer consisting of a copy of the nonlinear plant with output injections from boundary measurement
errors. The output injection gains are designed for the estimation error system so that the exponential
stability of the error system in the $L^2$ norm and finite-time convergence to zero are guaranteed.
Numerical simulations are conducted to validate the boundary observer design for estimation of
the nonlinear ARZ model. In data validation, we calibrate model parameters of the ARZ model and then
use vehicle trajectory data to test the performance of the observer design.
