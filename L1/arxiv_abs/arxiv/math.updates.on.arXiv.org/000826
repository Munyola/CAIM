Content distribution networks, enabled through replicated caching, have enabled broadband content
delivery over the wired Internet. In this paper we propose a wireless content distribution scheme
based on a new multi-level storage, access, and distribution architecture that is tailored for
next generation wireless networks. This scheme significantly outperforms conventional translation
of ideas from the wired Internet to wireless. Our starting point is the observation that wireless
network architecture is converging towards a dense deployment of wireless access points (APs)
with small coverage, combined with cellular base-stations (BS) with larger coverage. The consequence
of this heterogeneous architecture is that a user could access the BS as well as multiple APs. Therefore
an optimal design is to trade-off the cost (transmission rate) at the BS, with the caching cost (memory)
at the APs and the access cost of connecting to multiple APs at the user, for a given content popularity
profile. In this paper we propose a caching scheme with provable performance trading off these costs
and theoretically demonstrate its order optimality with respect to information-theoretic bounds.
Our solution is to use coded cache storage and the inherent broadcast property of wireless through
network coding. We also validate the scheme on several real datasets and quantify the trade-off
in rate, memory, and access. These numerical evaluations also suggest an intriguing possibility
that categorizing content into a small number of popularity levels is sufficient.
