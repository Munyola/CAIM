The aim of the present paper is to provide a new aspect of the $p$-adic Teichm\"{u}ller theory established
by S. Mochizuki. We study the symplectic geometry of the $p$-adic formal stacks $\widehat{\mathcal{M}}_{g,
\mathbb{Z}_p}$ (= the moduli classifying $p$-adic formal curves of fixed genus $g>1$) and $\widehat{\mathcal{S}}_{g,
\mathbb{Z}_p}$ (= the moduli classifying $p$-adic formal curves of genus $g$ equipped with an indigenous
bundle). A major achievement in the (classical) $p$-adic Teichm\"{u}ller theory is the construction
of the locus $\widehat{\mathcal{N}}_{g, \mathbb{Z}_p}^{\mathrm{ord}}$ in $\widehat{\mathcal{S}}_{g,
\mathbb{Z}_p}$ classifying $p$-adic canonical liftings of ordinary nilpotent indigenous bundles.
The formal stack $\widehat{\mathcal{N}}_{g, \mathbb{Z}_p}^{\mathrm{ord}}$ embodies a $p$-adic
analogue of uniformization of hyperbolic Riemann surfaces, as well as a hyperbolic analogue of
Serre-Tate theory of ordinary abelian varieties. In the present paper, the canonical symplectic
structure on the cotangent bundle $T^\vee_{\mathbb{Z}_p} \widehat{\mathcal{M}}_{g, \mathbb{Z}_p}$
of $\widehat{\mathcal{M}}_{g, \mathbb{Z}_p}$ is compared to Goldman's symplectic structure
defined on $\widehat{\mathcal{S}}_{g, \mathbb{Z}_p}$ after base-change by the projection $\widehat{\mathcal{N}}_{g,
\mathbb{Z}_p}^{\mathrm{ord}} \rightarrow \widehat{\mathcal{M}}_{g, \mathbb{Z}_p}$. We
can think of this comparison as a $p$-adic analogue of certain results in the theory of projective
structures on Riemann surfaces proved by S. Kawai and other mathematicians.
