Local cancer invasion of tissue is a complex, multiscale process which plays an essential role in
tumour progression. Occurring over many different temporal and spatial scales, the first stage
of invasion is the secretion of matrix degrading enzymes (MDEs) by the cancer cells that consequently
degrade the surrounding extracellular matrix (ECM). This process is vital for creating space in
which the cancer cells can progress and it is driven by the activities of specific matrix metalloproteinases
(MMPs). In this paper, we consider the key role of two MMPs by developing further the novel two-part
multiscale model introduced in [33] to better relate at micro-scale the two micro-scale activities
that were considered there, namely, the micro-dynamics concerning the continuous rearrangement
of the naturally oriented ECM fibres within the bulk of the tumour and MDEs proteolytic micro-dynamics
that take place in an appropriate cell-scale neighbourhood of the tumour boundary. Focussing primarily
on the activities of the membrane-tethered MT1-MMP and the soluble MMP-2 with the fibrous ECM phase,
in this work we investigate the MT1-MMP/MMP-2 cascade and its overall effect on tumour progression.
To that end, we will propose a new multiscale modelling framework by considering the degradation
of the ECM fibres not only to take place at macro-scale in the bulk of the tumour but also explicitly
in the micro-scale neighbourhood of the tumour interface as a consequence of the interactions with
molecular fluxes of MDEs that exercise their spatial dynamics at the invasive edge of the tumour.
