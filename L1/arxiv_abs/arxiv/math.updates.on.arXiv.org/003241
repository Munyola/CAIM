Flutter instability in elastic structures subject to follower load, the most important cases being
the famous Beck's and Pfluger's columns (two elastic rods in a cantilever configuration, with an
additional concentrated mass at the end of the rod in the latter case), have attracted, and still
attract, a thorough research interest. In this field, the most important issue is the validation
of the model itself of follower force, a nonconservative action which was harshly criticized and
never realized in practice for structures with diffused elasticity. An experimental setup to introduce
follower tangential forces at the end of an elastic rod was designed, realized, validated, and tested,
in which the follower action is produced by exploiting Coulomb friction on an element (a freely-rotating
wheel) in sliding contact against a flat surface (realized by a conveyor belt). It is therefore shown
that follower forces can be realized in practice and the first experimental evidence is given for
both the flutter and divergence instabilities occurring in the Pfluger's column. In particular,
load thresholds for the two instabilities are measured and the detrimental effect of dissipation
on the critical load for flutter is experimentally demonstrated, while a slight increase in load
is found for the divergence instability. The presented approach to follower forces discloses new
horizons for testing self-oscillating structures and for exploring and documenting dynamic instabilities
possible when nonconservative loads are applied.
