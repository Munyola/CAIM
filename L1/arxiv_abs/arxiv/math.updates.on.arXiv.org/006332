In the setting of high-frequency data, where a continuous time process is only observed at discrete
times, simplifying assumptions are often imposed on the relation between the observation times
and the process being monitored. As is well known, these assumptions often do not hold in practice,
and many authors have studied models for, and the consequences of, the observation times being endogenous
in the sense that they depend on the observable process itself. The impetus for the current paper
is that the observation times might depend on other features of the observable process than its level,
such as its (non-observable) spot-volatility process. In this paper we introduce an estimator
of the quadratic covariation between the spot-volatility process and the intensity process of
the observation times, both taken to be semimartingales. The estimator we introduce is not limited
to estimating the covariation of the spot-volatility and observation time intensity, but applies
under mild regularity conditions to the quadratic covariation between any two spot-process semimartingales.
We derive a convergence rate for our estimator, and prove a central limit theorem. Both these results
apply quite generally to estimators of quadratic (co)variations that are based on rolling and overlapping
sums of squared semimartingale increments. We illustrate the use of the estimator by a simulation
study, and conduct an empirical analysis of the Apple stock over $21$ trading days. This analysis
indicates a rather strong correlation between the spot volatility and the observation times.
