Given a smooth potential function $V : \mathbf{R}^m \to \mathbf{R}$, one can consider the ODE $\partial_t^2
u = -(\nabla V)(u)$ describing the trajectory of a particle $t \mapsto u(t)$ in the potential well
$V$. We consider the question of whether the dynamics of this family of ODE are \emph{universal}
in the sense that they contain (as embedded copies) any first-order ODE $\partial_t u = X(u)$ arising
from a smooth vector field $X$ on a manifold $M$. Assuming that $X$ is nonsingular and $M$ is compact,
we show (using the Nash embedding theorem) that this is possible precisely when the flow $(M,X)$
supports a geometric structure which we call a \emph{strongly adapted $1$-form}; many smooth flows
do have such a $1$-form, but we give an example (due to Bryant) of a flow which does not, and hence cannot
be modeled by the dynamics of a potential well. As one consequence of this embeddability criterion,
we construct an example of a (coercive) potential well system which is \emph{Turing complete} in
the sense that the halting of any Turing machine with a given input is equivalent to a certain bounded
trajectory in this system entering a certain open set. In particular, this system contains trajectories
for which it is undecidable whether that trajectory enters such a set. Remarkably, the above results
also hold if one works instead with the nonlinear wave equation $\partial_t^2 u - \Delta u = -(\nabla
V)(u)$ on a torus instead of a particle in a potential well, or if one replaces the target domain $\mathbf{R}^m$
by a more general Riemannian manifold.
