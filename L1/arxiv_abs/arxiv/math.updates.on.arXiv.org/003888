Roll damping is an important problem of ship motion control since excessive roll motion may cause
motion sickness of human occupants and damage fragile cargo. Actuators used for roll damping (fins,
rudders and thrusters) inevitably create a rotating yaw moment, interfering thus with the vessel's
autopilot (heading control system). To reach and maintain the "trade-off" between the concurrent
goals of accurate vessel steering and roll damping, an optimization procedure in general needs
to take place where the cost functional penalizes the roll angle, the steering error and the control
effort. Since the vessel's motion is influenced by the uncertain wave disturbance, the optimal
value of this functional and the resulting optimal process are also uncertain. Standard approaches,
prevailing in the literature, approximate the wave disturbance by the "colored noise" with a known
spectral density, reducing the optimization problem to conventional loop-shaping, LQG or $\mathcal{H}_\infty$
control. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to optimal roll damping, approximating the disturbance
by a \emph{polyharmonic} signal with known frequencies yet uncertain amplitudes and phase shifts.
For this class of external disturbances, an optimal \emph{universal} controller (OUC) can be found,
delivering the optimal solution \emph{for any} uncertain parameters of the signal. Using numerical
simulations, we compare our design method with classical approaches to optimal roll damping and
show that OUC controllers exhibit better performance.
