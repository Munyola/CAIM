Hurwitz numbers count genus $g$, degree $d$ covers of the complex projective line with fixed branched
locus and fixed ramification data. An equivalent description is given by factorisations in the
symmetric group. Simple double Hurwitz numbers are a class of Hurwitz-type counts of specific interest.
In recent years a related counting problem in the context of random matrix theory was introduced
as so-called monotone Hurwitz numbers. These can be viewed as a desymmetrised version of the Hurwitz-problem.
A combinatorial interpolation between simple and monotone double Hurwitz numbers was introduced
as mixed double Hurwitz numbers and it was proved that these objects are piecewise polynomial in
a certain sense. Moreover, the notion of strictly monotone Hurwitz numbers has risen interest as
it is equivalent to a certain Grothendieck dessins d'enfant count. In this paper, we introduce a
combinatorial interpolation between simple, monotone and strictly monotone double Hurwitz numbers
as \textit{triply interpolated Hurwitz numbers}. Our aim is twofold: Using a connection between
triply interpolated Hurwitz numbers and tropical covers in terms of so-called monodromy graphs,
we give algorithms to compute the polynomials for triply interpolated Hurwitz numbers in all genera
using Erhart theory. We further use this approach to study the wall-crossing behaviour of triply
interpolated Hurwitz numbers in genus $0$ in terms of related Hurwitz-type counts. All those results
specialise to the extremal cases of simple, monotone and Grothendieck dessins d'enfants Hurwitz
numbers.
