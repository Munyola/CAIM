In a convex mosaic in $\mathbb{R}^d$ we denote the average number of vertices of a cell by $\bar v$
and the average number of cells meeting at a node by $\bar n$. Except for the $d=2$ planar case, there
is no known formula prohibiting points in any range of the $[\bar n, \bar v]$ plane (except for the
unphysical $\bar n, \bar v \leq d+1$ stripes). Nevertheless, in $d=3$ dimensions if we plot the 28
points corresponding to convex uniform honeycombs, the 28 points corresponding to their duals
and the 3 points corresponding to Poisson-Voronoi, Poisson-Delaunay and random hyperplane mosaics,
then these points appear to accumulate on a narrow stripe of the $[\bar n, \bar v]$ plane. Our construction
of an average cell leads to a mean field formula which provides a good approximation to that stripe.
We call this approximation the (virtual or real) Platonic mosaic associated to the geometric mosaic
in $d=3$ dimensions. We introduce the harmonic degree $\bar h= \bar n\bar v/(\bar n + \bar v)$ of a
$d$-dimensional mosaic to measure the error of our approximation in $d=3$ dimensions. We show that
the observed narrow stripe on the $[\bar n, \bar v]$ plane corresponds to a narrow range of $\bar h$
and we conjecture that for $d$-dimensional mosaics this range is $\bar h \in (d, 2^{d-1}]$. We also
show that the harmonic degree has deeper geometric interpretations. In particular, in case of Euclidean
mosaics it is related to the average of the sum of vertex angles and their polars, and in case of mosaics
in planes of constant curvature, it is related to the average excess angle.
