We construct ladder operators, $\tilde{C}$ and $\tilde{C^\dagger}$, for a multi-step rational
extension of the harmonic oscillator on the half plane, $x\ge0$. These ladder operators connect
all states of the spectrum in only infinite-dimensional representations of their polynomial Heisenberg
algebra. For comparison, we also construct two different classes of ladder operator acting on this
system that form finite-dimensional as well as infinite-dimensional representations of their
respective polynomial Heisenberg algebras. For the rational extension, we construct the position
wavefunctions in terms of exceptional orthogonal polynomials. For a particular choice of parameters,
we construct the coherent states, eigenvectors of $\tilde{C}$ with generally complex eigenvalues,
$z$, as superpositions of a subset of the energy eigenvectors. Then we calculate the properties
of these coherent states, looking for classical or non-classical behaviour. We calculate the energy
expectation as a function of $|z|$. We plot position probability densities for the coherent states
and for the even and odd cat states formed from these coherent states. We plot the Wigner function
for a particular choice of $z$. For these coherent states on one arm of a beamsplitter, we calculate
the two excitation number distribution and the linear entropy of the output state. We plot the standard
deviations in $x$ and $p$ and find no squeezing in the regime considered. By plotting the Mandel $Q$
parameter for the coherent states as a function of $|z|$, we find that the number statistics is sub-Poissonian.
