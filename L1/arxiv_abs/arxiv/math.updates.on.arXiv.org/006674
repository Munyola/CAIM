Block maxima methods constitute a fundamental part of the statistical toolbox in extreme value
analysis. However, most of the corresponding theory is derived under the simplifying assumption
that block maxima are independent observations from a genuine extreme value distribution. In practice
however, block sizes are finite and observations from different blocks are dependent. Theory respecting
the latter complications is not well developed, and, in the multivariate case, has only recently
been established for disjoint blocks of a single block size. We show that using overlapping blocks
instead of disjoint blocks leads to a uniform improvement in the asymptotic variance of the multivariate
empirical distribution function of rescaled block maxima and any smooth functionals thereof (such
as the empirical copula), without any sacrifice in the asymptotic bias. We further derive functional
central limit theorems for multivariate empirical distribution functions and empirical copulas
that are uniform in the block size parameter, which seems to be the first result of this kind for estimators
based on block maxima in general. The theory allows for various aggregation schemes over multiple
block sizes, leading to substantial improvements over the single block length case and opens the
door to further methodology developments. In particular, we consider bias correction procedures
that can improve the convergence rates of extreme-value estimators and shed some new light on estimation
of the second-order parameter when the main purpose is bias correction.
