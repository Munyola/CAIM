In matching theory, one of the most fundamental and classical branches of combinatorics, {\em canonical
decompositions} of graphs are powerful and versatile tools that form the basis of this theory. However,
the abilities of the known canonical decompositions, that is, the {\em Dulmage-Mendelsohn}, {\em
Kotzig-Lov\'asz}, and {\em Gallai-Edmonds} decompositions, are limited because they are only
applicable to particular classes of graphs, such as bipartite graphs, or they are too sparse to provide
sufficient information. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a new canonical decomposition
that is applicable to all graphs and provides much finer information. We focus on the notion of {\em
factor-components} as the fundamental building blocks of a graph; through the factor-components,
our new canonical decomposition states how a graph is organized and how it contains all the maximum
matchings. The main results that constitute our new theory are the following: (i) a canonical partial
order over the set of factor-components, which describes how a graph is constructed from its factor-components;
(ii) a generalization of the Kotzig-Lov\'asz decomposition, which shows the inner structure of
each factor-component in the context of the entire graph; and (iii) a canonically described interrelationship
between (i) and (ii), which integrates these two results into a unified theory of a canonical decomposition.
These results are obtained in a self-contained way, and our proof of the generalized Kotzig-Lov\'asz
decomposition contains a shortened and self-contained proof of the classical counterpart.
