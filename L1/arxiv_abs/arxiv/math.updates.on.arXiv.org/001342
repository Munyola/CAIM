In nuclei with valence nucleons are say identical nucleons and say these nucleons occupy several-$j$
orbits, then it is possible to consider pair creation operator $S_+$ to be a sum of the single-$j$
shell pair creation operators $S_+(j)$ with arbitrary phases, $S_+=\sum_j \alpha_j S_+(j); \alpha_j=\pm
1$. In this situation, it is possible to define multi-orbit or generalized seniority that corresponds
to the quasi-spin $SU(2)$ algebra generated by $S_+$, $S_-=(S_+)^\dagger$ and $S_0=(\hat{n}
-\Omega)/2$ operators; $\hat{n}$ is number operator and $\Omega=[\sum_j (2j+1)]/2$. There are
now multiple pairing quasi-spin $SU(2)$ algebras. Also, the $\alpha_j$'s and the generators of
the corresponding generalized seniority generating sympletic algebras $Sp(2\Omega)$ in $U(2\Omega)
\supset Sp(2\Omega)$ have one-to-one correspondence. Using these, derived are the special seniority
selection rules for electromagnetic transitions. A particular choice for $\alpha_j$'s as advocated
by Arvieu and Moszkowski (AM) in the past gives pairing Hamiltonians having maximum correlation
with well known effective interactions. The various results derived for identical fermion systems
are shown to extend to identical boson systems with the bosons occupying several-$\ell$ orbits
as for example in $sd$, $sp$, $sdg$ and $sdpf$ IBM's. The quasi-spin algebra here is $SU(1,1)$ and
the generalized seniority quantum number is generated by $SO(2\Omega)$ in $U(2\Omega) \supset
SO(2\Omega)$. The different $SO(2\Omega)$ algebras here will be important in the study of quantum
phase transitions and order-chaos transitions in nuclei.
