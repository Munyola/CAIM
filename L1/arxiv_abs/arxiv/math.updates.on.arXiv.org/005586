In this work, we present a class of new efficient models for water flow in shallow unconfined aquifers,
giving an alternative to the classical but less tractable 3D-Richards model. Its derivation is
guided by two ambitions: any new model should be low cost in computational time and should still give
relevant results at every time scale. We thus keep track of two types of flow occurring in such a context
and which are dominant when the ratio thickness over longitudinal length is small: the first one
is dominant in a small time scale and is described by a vertical 1D-Richards problem; the second one
corresponds to a large time scale, when the evolution of the hydraulic head turns to become independent
of the vertical variable. These two types of flow are appropriately modelled by, respectively,
a one-dimensional and a two-dimensional system of PDEs boundary value problems. They are coupled
along an artificial level below which the Dupuit hypothesis holds true (i.e. the vertical flow is
instantaneous) in a way ensuring that the global model is mass conservative. Tuning the artificial
level, which even can depend on an unknown of the problem, we browse the new class of models. We prove
using asymptotic expansions that the 3D-Richards problem and each model of the class behaves the
same at every considered time scale (short, intermediate and large) in thin aquifers. The results
are illustrated by numerical simulations, showing especially that the new models results fit well
with the ones obtained with the original 3d-Richards problem even in non-thin aquifers.
