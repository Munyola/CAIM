Although the spinor field in (1+1) dimensions has the right structure to model a dispersive bimodal
system with gain and loss, the plain addition of gain to one component of the field and loss to the other
one results in an unstable dispersion relation. In this paper, we advocate a different recipe for
the $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric extension of spinor models --- the recipe that does not produce instability
of the linear Dirac equation. Having exemplified the physical origins of the $\mathcal P$- and $\mathcal
T$-breaking terms, we consider the extensions of three U(1)-invariant spinor models with cubic
nonlinearity. Of these, the \PT-symmetric extension of the Thirring model is shown to be completely
integrable and possess infinitely many conserved quantities. The \PT-symmetric Gross-Neveu
equation conserves energy and momentum but does not conserve charge. The third model is introduced
for the purpose of comparison with the previous two; its \PT-symmetric extension has no conservation
laws at all. Despite this dramatic difference in the integrability and conservation properties,
all three \PT-symmetric models are shown to have exact soliton solutions. Similar to the solitons
of the extended Thirring and Gross-Neveu equations, the solitons of the new model are found to be
stable --- except for a narrow band of frequencies adjacent to the soliton existence boundary. The
persistence under the $\mathcal P$- and $\mathcal T$-breaking perturbations as well as the prevalence
of stability highlight a remarkable sturdiness of spinor solitons in (1+1) dimensions.
