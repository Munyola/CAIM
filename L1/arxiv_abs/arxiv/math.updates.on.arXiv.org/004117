The field perturbation induced by an elastic or electrical inclusion admits the multipolar expansion
in terms of the outgoing potential functions. In the classical expansion, the basis functions are
defined independently of the inclusion. In this paper, we introduce the new concept of the geometric
multipolar expansion for the two dimensional conductivity (or, equivalently, anti-plane elasticity)
of which the basis functions are associated with the inclusion's geometry. We use the series expansion
for the complex logarithm by the Faber polynomials that are associated with the exterior conformal
mapping of the inclusion. %the basis functions are monomials in terms of the exterior conformal
mapping. %We call the coefficients of this expansion the Faber generalized polarization tensors
(FPTs) to highlight that they are defined in terms of the Faber polynomials associated with the inclusion.
The virtue of this method is that one can express the field perturbation for an inclusion of arbitrary
shape in a simple series expansion. Regarding the computation of the exterior conformal mapping,
one can use the integral formula for the conformal mapping coefficients obtained in \cite{2018JL_conductivity}.
As an application, we construct multi-coated neutral inclusions of arbitrary shape that do not
perturb low-order polynomial loadings. These inclusions are layered structures composed of level
curves of one exterior conformal mapping; material parameters in each layer are determined for
the low-order terms in the geometric multipolar expansion to vanish. We provide numerical examples
to validate the results.
