Flexibility of energy consumption can be harnessed for the purposes of ancillary services in a large
power grid. In prior work by the authors a randomized control architecture is introduced for individual
loads for this purpose. In examples it is shown that the control architecture can be designed so that
control of the loads is easy at the grid level: Tracking of a balancing authority reference signal
is possible, while ensuring that the quality of service (QoS) for each load is acceptable on average.
The analysis was based on a mean field limit (as the number of loads approaches infinity), combined
with an LTI-system approximation of the aggregate nonlinear model. This paper examines in depth
the issue of individual risk in these systems. The main contributions of the paper are of two kinds:
Risk is modeled and quantified: (i) The average performance is not an adequate measure of success.
It is found empirically that a histogram of QoS is approximately Gaussian, and consequently each
load will eventually receive poor service. (ii) The variance can be estimated from a refinement
of the LTI model that includes a white-noise disturbance; variance is a function of the randomized
policy, as well as the power spectral density of the reference signal. Additional local control
can eliminate risk: (iii) The histogram of QoS is truncated through this local control, so that strict
bounds on service quality are guaranteed. (iv) This has insignificant impact on the grid-level
performance, beyond a modest reduction in capacity of ancillary service.
