Distinct quantum vacua of topologically ordered states can be tunneled into each other via extended
operators. The possible applications include condensed matter and quantum cosmology. We present
a straightforward approach to calculate the partition function on various manifolds and ground
state degeneracy (GSD), mainly based on continuum/cochain Topological Quantum Field Theories
(TQFT), in any dimensions. This information can be related to the counting of extended operators
of bosonic/fermionic TQFT. On the lattice scale, anyonic particles/strings live at the ends of
line/surface operators. Certain systems in different dimensions are related to each other through
dimensional reduction schemes, analogous to decategorification. We consider situations where
a TQFT lives on (1) a closed spacetime or (2) a spacetime with boundary, such that both the bulk and
boundary are fully-gapped and long-range entangled (LRE). Anyonic excitations can be deconfined
on the boundary. We describe such new exotic topological interfaces on which neither particle nor
string excitation alone condensed, but only composite objects of extended operators can end (e.g.
a string-like composite object formed by a set of particles can end on a special 2+1D boundary of 3+1D
bulk). We explore the relations between group extension constructions and partially breaking
constructions (e.g. 0-form/higher-form/"composite" breaking) of topological boundaries,
after gauging. We comment on the implications of entanglement entropy for some of such LRE systems.
