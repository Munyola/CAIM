We consider a linear elliptic system in divergence form with random coefficients and study the random
fluctuations of large-scale averages of the field and the flux of the solution. In a previous contribution,
for discrete elliptic equations with independent and identically distributed conductances,
we developed a theory of fluctuations based on the notion of homogenization commutator, defined
as the flux minus the homogenized coefficients times the field of the solution: we proved that the
two-scale expansion of this special quantity is accurate at leading order when averaged on large
scales (as opposed to the two-scale expansion of the field and flux taken separately) and that the
large-scale fluctuations of both the field and the flux can be recovered from those of the commutator.
This implies that the large-scale fluctuations of the commutator of the corrector drive all other
large-scale fluctuations to leading order, which we refer to as the pathwise structure of fluctuations
in stochastic homogenization. In the present contribution we extend this result in two directions:
we treat continuum elliptic (possibly non-symmetric) systems and with strongly correlated coefficient
fields (Gaussian-like with a covariance function that displays an arbitrarily slow algebraic
decay at infinity). Our main result shows that the two-scale expansion of the homogenization commutator
is still accurate to leading order when averaged on large scales, which illustrates the robustness
of the pathwise structure of fluctuations.
