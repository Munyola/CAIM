Upon the recent development of the quasi-reversibility method for terminal value parabolic problems
in \cite{Nguyen2019}, it is imperative to investigate the convergence analysis of this regularization
method in the stochastic setting. In this paper, we positively unravel this open question by focusing
on a coupled system of Dirichlet reaction-diffusion equations with additive white Gaussian noise
on the terminal data. In this regard, the approximate problem is designed by adding the so-called
perturbing operator to the original problem and by exploiting the Fourier reconstructed terminal
data. Furthermore, we no longer need the decay behaviour of the perturbation, relying on a variant
of the classical quasi-reversibility regime. By this way, Sobolev- and Gevrey-type source conditions
are easily included, while we successfully maintain the logarithmic stability estimate of the
corresponding stabilized operator, which is necessary for the error analysis. As the main theme
of this work, we prove the error bounds for the concentrations and for the concentration gradients,
driven by a large amount of weighted energy-like controls involving the expectation operator.
Compared to the classical error bounds in $L^2$ and $H^1$ that we obtained in the previous studies,
our analysis here needs a higher smoothness of the true terminal data to ensure their reconstructions
from the stochastic fashion. Especially, using finer energy estimates our method is valid for any
finite time. Two numerical examples are provided to corroborate the theoretical results.
