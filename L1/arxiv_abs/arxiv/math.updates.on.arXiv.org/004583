Construction of volumetric parametrizations for computational domains is a key step in the pipeline
of isogeometric analysis. Here we propose an alternative solution to this problem that uses the
nonlinear elasticity analogy. The desired domain is modeled as a deformed configuration of an initial
simple geometry. Assuming that the parametrization of the initial domain is bijective and that
it is possible to find a locally invertible displacement field, the method yields a bijective parametrization
of the target domain. We show that, in many cases, an unknown deformation can be computed using the
Saint Venant-Kirchhoff model. Moreover, if sufficiently small incremental steps for the deformation
are used, a linear elasticity solver is enough to produce high quality parametrizations for nontrivial
domains, what makes the methodology less demanding on implementation and computational time.
Additionally, a great control over the resulting parametrization can be exerted by varying the
material properties used in the elasticity model. Experiments indicate that when the material
is close to being incompressible and the initial domain has uniformly sized elements, the method
yields parametrizations with uniformly sized elements as well. The method is not restricted to
a single patch scenario but can be utilized to construct multi-patch parametrizations with naturally
looking boundaries between neighboring patches. We illustrate the performance of the method and
study the quality of the resulting computational meshes on a range of two-dimensional and three-dimensional
examples.
