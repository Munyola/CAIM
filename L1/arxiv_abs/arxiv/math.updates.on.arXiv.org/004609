We consider settings in which the distribution of a multivariate random variable is partly ambiguous.
We assume the ambiguity lies on the level of dependence structure, and that the marginal distributions
are known. Furthermore, a current best guess for the distribution, called reference measure, is
available. We work with the set of distributions that are both close to the given reference measure
in a transportation distance (e.g. the Wasserstein distance), and additionally have the correct
marginal structure. The goal is to find upper and lower bounds for integrals of interest with respect
to distributions in this set. The described problem appears naturally in the context of risk aggregation.
When aggregating different risks, the marginal distributions of these risks are known and the task
is to quantify their joint effect on a given system. This is typically done by applying a meaningful
risk measure to the sum of the individual risks. For this purpose, the stochastic interdependencies
between the risks need to be specified. In practice the models of this dependence structure are however
subject to relatively high model ambiguity. The contribution of this paper is twofold: Firstly,
we derive a dual representation of the considered problem and prove that strong duality holds. Secondly,
we propose a generally applicable and computationally feasible method, which relies on neural
networks, in order to numerically solve the derived dual problem. The latter method is tested on
a number of toy examples, before it is finally applied to perform robust risk aggregation in a real
world instance.
