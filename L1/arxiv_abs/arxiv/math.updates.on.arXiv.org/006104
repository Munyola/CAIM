Classical mechanical systems are defined by their kinetic and potential energies. They generate
a Lie algebra under the canonical Poisson bracket. This Lie algebra, which is usually infinite dimensional,
is useful in analyzing the system, as well as in geometric numerical integration. But because the
kinetic energy is quadratic in the momenta, the Lie algebra obeys identities beyond those implied
by skew symmetry and the Jacobi identity. Some Poisson brackets, or combinations of brackets, are
zero for all choices of kinetic and potential energy, regardless of the dimension of the system.
Therefore, we study the universal object in this setting, the `Lie algebra of classical mechanics'
modelled on the Lie algebra generated by kinetic and potential energy of a simple mechanical system
with respect to the canonical Poisson bracket. We show that it is the direct sum of an abelian algebra
$\mathcal X$, spanned by `modified' potential energies isomorphic to the free commutative nonassociative
algebra with one generator, and an algebra freely generated by the kinetic energy and its Poisson
bracket with $\mathcal X$. We calculate the dimensions $c_n$ of its homogeneous subspaces and determine
the value of its entropy $\lim_{n\to\infty} c_n^{1/n}$. It is $1.8249\dots$, a fundamental constant
associated to classical mechanics. We conjecture that the class of systems with Euclidean kinetic
energy metrics is already free, i.e., the only linear identities satisfied by the Lie brackets of
all such systems are those satisfied by the Lie algebra of classical mechanics.
