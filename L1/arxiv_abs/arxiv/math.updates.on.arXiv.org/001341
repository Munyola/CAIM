Determination of the most economic strategies for supply and transmission of electricity is a daunting
computational challenge. Due to theoretical barriers, so-called NP-hardness, the amount of effort
to optimize the schedule of generating units and route of power, can grow exponentially with the
number of decision variables. Practical approaches to this problem involve legacy approximations
and ad-hoc heuristics that may undermine the efficiency and reliability of power system operations,
that are ever growing in scale and complexity. Therefore, the development of powerful optimization
methods for detailed power system scheduling is critical to the realization of smart grids and has
received significant attention recently. In this paper, we propose for the first time a computational
method, which is capable of solving large-scale power system scheduling problems with thousands
of generating units, while accurately incorporating the nonlinear equations that govern the flow
of electricity on the grid. The utilization of this accurate nonlinear model, as opposed to its linear
approximations, results in a more efficient and transparent market design, as well as improvements
in the reliability of power system operations. We design a polynomial-time solvable third-order
semidefinite programming (TSDP) relaxation, with the aim of finding a near globally optimal solution
for the original NP-hard problem. The proposed method is demonstrated on the largest available
benchmark instances from real-world European grid data, for which provably optimal or near-optimal
solutions are obtained.
