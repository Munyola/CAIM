Recent technological advances in microgrids powered by Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) make
them an attractive response mechanism for improving the resilience of electricity distribution
networks (DNs) to reliability and security failures. This paper presents an approach to evaluate
the value of implementing a timely response using microgrid operations and DER dispatch in the aftermath
of a disruption event, which involves strategic compromise of multiple DN components. Firstly,
we refine the modeling and resiliency assessment framework in \cite{part1} and develop a sequential
(bilevel) formulation which models attacker-operator interactions on a radial DN with one or more
microgrids. Particularly, the operator response model includes microgrid operations under various
islanding configurations (regimes), and single- or multi-master operation of DERs in providing
grid-forming services as well as frequency and voltage regulation. Secondly, we introduce a restoration
problem in which the operator gradually reconnects the disrupted components over multiple periods
to restore the nominal performance of the DN. The first problem, formulated as a bilevel mixed-integer
problem, is solved using Benders decomposition method. The second problem, formulated as a multi-period
mixed-integer problem, can be solved using a greedy algorithm. Our computational results illustrate
the benefit of using microgrids in reducing the post-contingency losses, both immediately after
the disruption event and during the restoration process.
