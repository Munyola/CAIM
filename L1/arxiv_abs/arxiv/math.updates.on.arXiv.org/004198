There is an increasing need for monitoring and controlling uncertainties brought by distributed
energy resources in distribution grids. For such goal, accurate three-phase topology is the basis
for correlating and exterminating measurements in unbalanced distribution networks. Unfortunately,
such topology knowledge is often unavailable due to limited investment, especially for secondary
distribution grids. Also, the bus phase connectivity information is inaccurate due to human errors
or outdated records. For this challenge, we utilize smart meter data at different phases for an information-theoretic
approach to learn the structures. Specifically, we convert the system of three unbalanced phasors
into symmetrical components, namely the positive, negative, and zero sequences. Then, we prove
that Chow-Liu algorithm can find the optimal topology by utilizing power flow equation and the conditional
independence relationships implied by the radial three-phase structure of distribution grids
with the presence of incorrect bus phase labels. At last, by utilizing Carson's equation, we prove
that the bus phase connection can be correctly identified using voltage measurements. For validation,
we extensively simulate on IEEE $37$- and $123$-bus systems using real data from PG\&E, ADRES Project,
and Pecan Street. We observe that the algorithm is highly accurate for finding three-phase topology
in distribution grids even with strong load unbalancing condition and DERs. This ensures close
monitoring and controlling DERs in distribution grids.
