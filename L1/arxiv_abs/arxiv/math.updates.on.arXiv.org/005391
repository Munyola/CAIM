Here we present an ergodic theorem which adapts a Theorem by J. Elton to the classical thermodynamical
formalism and to ergodic transport. First, we discuss how Elton's theorem can be used to characterise
Gibbs measures for expanding maps. Such characterisation will be done by constructing a stochastic
process, defined by a iterated function system (IFS), whose empirical measure converges to the
Gibbs measure, in the sense that the mean of any test function evaluated in the outcomes of this stochastic
process converges to the integral of such test function with respect to the Gibbs measure. In this
way we present a stochastic algorithm that compute integrals of functions. After this, we turn our
attention to ergodic transport: given two sets $X$ and $\Omega$, a measure $\mu$ on $X$ and a dynamics
$T$ on $\Omega$, we consider the set of probability measures on $X \times \Omega$ whose projections
on the second coordinate are $T$-invariant, while the projections on the first coordinate are $\mu$.
Such measures are called transport plans. We call Gibbs plan any transport plan that maximizes a
pressure functional that is defined by a potential function added to an entropy term. As in the classical
thermodynamical formalism case, we adapt Elton's theorem to define a stochastic process (using
a IFS) whose empirical measures converges to the Gibbs plan. We provide examples and show explicitly
calculations in the case where $X$ has two elements and the cost function depends on the two first
coordinates of $\Omega$.
