This article develops a framework for testing general hypothesis in high-dimensional models where
the number of variables may far exceed the number of observations. Existing literature has considered
less than a handful of hypotheses, such as testing individual coordinates of the model parameter.
However, the problem of testing general and complex hypotheses remains widely open. We propose
a new inference method developed around the hypothesis adaptive projection pursuit framework,
which solves the testing problems in the most general case. The proposed inference is centered around
a new class of estimators defined as $l_1$ projection of the initial guess of the unknown onto the
space defined by the null. This projection automatically takes into account the structure of the
null hypothesis and allows us to study formal inference for a number of long-standing problems.
For example, we can directly conduct inference on the sparsity level of the model parameters and
the minimum signal strength. This is especially significant given the fact that the former is a fundamental
condition underlying most of the theoretical development in high-dimensional statistics, while
the latter is a key condition used to establish variable selection properties. Moreover, the proposed
method is asymptotically exact and has satisfactory power properties for testing very general
functionals of the high-dimensional parameters. The simulation studies lend further support
to our theoretical claims and additionally show excellent finite-sample size and power properties
of the proposed test.
