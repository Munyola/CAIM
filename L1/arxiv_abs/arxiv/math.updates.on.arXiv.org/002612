We have developed a new fully anisotropic 3D FDTD Maxwell solver for arbitrary electrically and
magnetically anisotropic media for piecewise constant electric and magnetic materials that are
co-located over the primary computational cells. Two numerical methods were developed that are
called non-averaged and averaged methods, respectively. The non-averaged method is first order
accurate, while the averaged method is second order accurate for smoothly-varying materials and
reduces to first order for discontinuous material distributions. For the standard FDTD field locations
with the co-location of the electric and magnetic materials at the primary computational cells,
the averaged method require development of the different inversion algorithms of the constitutive
relations for the electric and magnetic fields. We provide a mathematically rigorous stability
proof followed by extensive numerical testing that includes long-time integration, eigenvalue
analysis, tests with extreme, randomly placed material parameters, and various boundary conditions.
For accuracy evaluation we have constructed a test case with an explicit analytic solution. Using
transformation optics, we have constructed complex, spatially inhomogeneous geometrical object
with fully anisotropic materials and a large dynamic range of $\underline{\epsilon}$ and $\underline{\mu}$,
such that a plane wave incident on the object is perfectly reconstructed downstream. In our implementation,
the considerable increase in accuracy of the averaged method only increases the computational
run time by 20\%.
