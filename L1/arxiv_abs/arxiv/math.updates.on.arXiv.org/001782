The global regularity problem for the Boussinesq system is a well known open problem in mathematical
fluid dynamics. As a follow up to our work \cite{EJSI}, we give examples of finite-energy and Lipschitz
continuous velocity field and density $(u_0,\rho_0)$ which are $C^\infty$-smooth away from the
origin and belong to a natural local well-posedness class for the Boussinesq equation whose corresponding
local solution becomes singular in finite time. That is, while the sup norm of the gradient of the
velocity field and the density remain finite on the time interval $t\in [0,1)$, both quantities
become infinite as $t\rightarrow 1$. The key is to use scale-invariant solutions similar to those
introduced in \cite{EJSI}. The proof consists of three parts: local well-posedness for the Boussinesq
equation in critical spaces, the analysis of certain special infinite-energy solutions belonging
to those critical spaces, and finally a cut-off argument to ensure finiteness of energy. All of this
is done on spatial domains $\{(x_1,x_2): x_1 \ge \gamma|x_2|\}$ for any $\gamma > 0$ so that we can
get arbitrarily close to the half-space case. We remark that the $2D$ Euler equation is globally
well-posed in all of the situations we look at, so that the singularity is not coming from the domain
or the lack of smoothness on the data but from the vorticity amplification due to the presence of a
density gradient. It is conceivable that our methods can be adapted to produce finite-energy $C^\infty$
solutions on $\mathbb{R}^2_+$ which become singular in finite time.
