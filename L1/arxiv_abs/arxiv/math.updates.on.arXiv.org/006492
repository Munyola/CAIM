Uniqueness of positive solutions to viscous Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equations of the form
$-\Delta u(x) + \frac{1}{\gamma} |D{u}(x)|^\gamma = f(x) - \lambda$, with $f$ a coercive function
and $\lambda$ a constant, in the subquadratic case, that is, $\gamma\in(1,2)$, appears to be an
open problem. Barles and Meireles [Comm. Partial Differential Equations 41 (2016)] show uniqueness
in the case that $f(x) \approx |x|^\beta$ and $|D f(x)|\lessapprox |x|^{(\beta-1)_+}$ for some
$\beta>0$, essentially matching earlier results of Ichihara, who considered more general Hamiltonians
but with better regularity for $f$. Without enforcing this assumption, to our knowledge, there
are no results on uniqueness in the literature. In this short article, we show that the equation has
a unique positive solution for any locally Lipschitz continuous, coercive $f$ which satisfies
$|D f(x)| \le \kappa\bigl(1 +|f(x)|^{2-\frac{1}{\gamma}}\bigr)$ for some positive constant
$\kappa$. Since $2-\frac{1}{\gamma}>1$, this assumption imposes very mild restrictions on the
growth of the potential $f$. We also show that this solution fully characterizes optimality for
the associated ergodic problem. Our method involves the study of an infinite dimensional linear
program for elliptic equations for measures, and is very different from earlier approaches. It
also applies to the larger class of Hamiltonians studied by Ichihara, and we show that it is well suited
to provide verification of optimality results for the associated ergodic control problems, even
in a pathwise sense, and without resorting to the parabolic problem.
