This paper studies the sensor placement problem in a networked control system for improving its
security against cyber-physical attacks. The problem is formulated as a zero-sum game between
an attacker and a detector. The attacker's decision is to select $f$ nodes of the network to attack
whereas the detector's decision is to place $f$ sensors to detect the presence of the attack signals.
In our formulation, the attacker minimizes its visibility, defined as the system $L_2$ gain from
the attack signals to the deployed sensors' outputs, and the detector maximizes the visibility
of the attack signals. The equilibrium strategy of the game determines the optimal locations of
the sensors. The existence of Nash equilibrium for the attacker-detector game is studied when the
underlying connectivity graph is a directed or an undirected tree. When the game does not admit a
Nash equilibrium, it is shown that the Stackelberg equilibrium of the game, with the detector as
the game leader, can be computed efficiently. Finally, the attacker-detector game is studied in
a cooperative adaptive cruise control algorithm for vehicle platooning problem. The existence
of Nash equilibrium is investigated for both directed and undirected platoons and the effect of
the position of the reference vehicle on the game value is studied. Our results show that, under the
optimal sensor placement strategy, an undirected topology provides a higher security level for
a networked control system compared with its corresponding directed topology.
