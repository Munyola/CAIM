During natural or anthropogenic disasters, humanitarian organizations (HO) are faced with the
time sensitive task of sending critical resources from multiple depots to the affected areas that
can be scattered across a region. This responsibility includes the quick acquisition of vehicles
from the local market and the preparation of pickup and delivery schedules and vehicle routes. During
crises, the supply of vehicle is often limited, their acquisition cost is steep, and acquired vehicles
are restricted by rental periods. Moreover, the affected areas suffer from a dire need for aid materials
and they must be reached within due time. Therefore, it is imperative that the decisions of acquiring,
scheduling, and routing of vehicles are made optimally and quickly. In this paper, we consider a
variant of a truckload open vehicle routing problem with time windows which exhibits vehicle routing
operations characteristics in a humanitarian crisis. We present two integer linear programming
models to formulate the problem. The first model is an arc-based mixed integer linear programming
model. The second model is a path-based integer linear programming model; we design two fast path
generation algorithms to formulate this model. The first model is solved exactly using the commercial
solver, while we design a column generation algorithm to solve the second model. We compare the results
obtained from the two models and show that the path-based model with column generation algorithm
outperforms the arc-based model when solved exactly in terms of solution time without sacrificing
the solution quality.
