This paper studies the problem of constructing control Lyapunov functions (CLFs) and feedback
stabilization strategies for deterministic nonlinear control systems described by ordinary
differential equations. Many numerical methods for solving the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman partial
differential equations specifying CLFs typically require dense state space discretizations
and consequently suffer from the curse of dimensionality. A relevant direction of attenuating
the curse of dimensionality concerns reducing the computation of the values of CLFs and associated
feedbacks at any selected states to finite-dimensional nonlinear programming problems. In this
work, exit-time optimal control is used for that purpose. First, we state an exit-time optimal control
problem with respect to a sublevel set of an appropriate local CLF and establish that, under a number
of reasonable conditions, the concatenation of the corresponding value function and the local
CLF is a global CLF in the whole domain of asymptotic null-controllability. This leads to a curse-of-dimensionality-free
approach to feedback stabilization. We also investigate the formulated optimal control problem.
A modification of these constructions for the case when one does not find a suitable local CLF is provided
as well. Supporting numerical simulation results that illustrate our development are subsequently
presented and discussed. Furthermore, it is pointed out that the curse of complexity may cause significant
issues in practical implementation even if the curse of dimensionality is mitigated.
