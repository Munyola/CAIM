In this article we establish novel decompositions of Gaussian fields taking values in suitable
spaces of generalized functions, and then use these decompositions to prove results about Gaussian
multiplicative chaos. We prove two decomposition theorems. The first one is a global one and says
that if the difference between the covariance kernels of two Gaussian fields, taking values in some
Sobolev space, has suitable Sobolev regularity, then these fields differ by a H\"older continuous
Gaussian process. Our second decomposition theorem is more specialized and is in the setting of
Gaussian fields whose covariance kernel has a logarithmic singularity on the diagonal -- or log-correlated
Gaussian fields. The theorem states that any log-correlated Gaussian field $X$ can be decomposed
locally into a sum of a H\"older continuous function and an independent almost $\star$-scale invariant
field (a special class of stationary log-correlated fields with 'cone-like' white noise representations).
This decomposition holds whenever the term $g$ in the covariance kernel $C_X(x,y)=\log(1/|x-y|)+g(x,y)$
has locally $H^{d+\varepsilon}$ Sobolev smoothness. We use these decompositions to extend several
results that have been known basically only for $\star$-scale invariant fields to general log-correlated
fields. These include the existence of critical multiplicative chaos, analytic continuation
of the subcritical chaos in the so-called inverse temperature parameter $\beta$, as well as generalised
Onsager-type covariance inequalities which play a role in the study of imaginary multiplicative
chaos.
