We present a new approach to showing that random graphs are nearly optimal expanders. This approach
is based on recent deep results in combinatorial group theory. It applies to both regular and irregular
random graphs. Let G be a random d-regular graph on n vertices, and let \lambda be the largest absolute
value of a non-trivial eigenvalue of its adjacency matrix. It was conjectured by Alon [86'] that
a random d-regular graph is almost Ramanujan, in the following sense: for every e>0, \lambda<2\sqrt{d-1}
+ e asymptotically almost surely. Friedman famously presented a proof of this conjecture in [08'].
Here we suggest a new, substantially simpler proof of a nearly-optimal result: we show that for d
even, a random d-regular graph satisfies \lambda < 2\sqrt{d-1} + 1 a.a.s. A main advantage of
our approach is that it is applicable to a generalized conjecture: A d-regular graph on n vertices
is an n-covering space of a bouquet of d/2 loops. More generally, fixing an arbitrary base graph H,
we study the spectrum of G, a random n-covering of H. Let \lambda be the largest absolute value of a
non-trivial eigenvalue of G. Extending Alon's conjecture to this more general model, Friedman
[03'] conjectured that for every e>0, a.a.s. \lambda<\rho+e, where \rho is the spectral
radius of the universal cover of H. When H is regular we get the same bound as before: \rho+1, and for
an arbitrary H, we prove a nearly optimal upper bound of \sqrt{3}\rho . This is a substantial improvement
upon all known results (by Friedman, Linial-Puder, Lubetzky-Sudakov-Vu and Addario-Berry-Griffiths).
