The problem of determining those multiplets of forces, or sets of force multiplets, acting at a set
of points, such that there exists a truss structure, or wire web, that can support these force multiplets
with all the elements of the truss or wire web being under tension, is considered. The two-dimensional
problem where the points are at the vertices of a convex polygon is essentially solved: each multiplet
of forces must be such that the net anticlockwise torque around any vertex of the forces summed over
any number of consecutive points clockwise past the vertex must be non-negative; and one can find
a truss structure that supports under tension, and only supports, those force multiplets in a convex
polyhedron of force multiplets that is generated by a finite number of force multiplets each satisfying
the torque condition. Progress is also made on the problem where only a subset of the points are at
the vertices of a convex polygon, and the other points are inside. In particular, in the case where
only one point is inside, an explicit procedure is described for constructing a suitable truss,
if one exists. An alternative recipe to that provided by Guevara-Vasquez, Milton, and Onofrei (2011),
based on earlier work of Camar Eddine and Seppecher (2003), is given for constructing a truss structure,
with elements under either compression or tension, that supports an arbitrary collection of balanced
forces at the vertices of a convex polygon. Finally some constraints are given on the forces that
a three-dimension truss, or wire web, under tension must satisfy.
