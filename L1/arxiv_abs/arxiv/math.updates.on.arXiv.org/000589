Many real world systems are at risk of undergoing critical transitions, leading to sudden qualitative
and sometimes irreversible regime shifts \cite{Schefferetal,Lentonetal}. Because these transitions
are often detrimental, the development of early warning signals is recognized as a major challenge
\cite{BoettingerRossHastings}. Recent progress \cite{CarpenterBrock,KuehnCT1,AshwinWieczorekVitoloCox}
builds on a mathematical framework in which the real-world system at hand is described by a low-dimensional
equation system that captures the dynamics in terms of a small number of key variables. In this framework
the critical transition often corresponds to a bifurcation. Here we show that in high-dimensional
systems, containing many variables, we frequently encounter an additional non-bifurcative mechanism
that can lead to critical transitions. We develop a simple and intuitive early warning sign and illustrate
both, mechanism and warning sign, in a range of examples, including network models of epidemics
\cite{GrossDLimaBlasius} and cooperation \cite{ZschalerTraulsenGross} and epidemiological
data \cite{BjornstadFinkenstaedtGrenfell,GrenfellBjornstadFinkenstaedt}. This work thus
establishes a connection between critical transitions and network science and provides an early
warning sign for a new type of critical transition that could be relevant for many real world systems.
In particular, in the light of the perspective to move to more complex models and utilize big data
sources it can be anticipated that this new type of transition will be encountered frequently in
the future.
