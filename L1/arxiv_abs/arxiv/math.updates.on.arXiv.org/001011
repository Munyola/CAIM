We study mixed integer conic sets involving a general regular (closed, convex, full dimensional,
and pointed) cone K such as the nonnegative orthant, the Lorentz cone or the positive semidefinite
cone. In a unified framework, we introduce K-minimal inequalities and show that under mild assumptions,
these inequalities together with the trivial cone-implied inequalities are sufficient to describe
the convex hull. We study the properties of K-minimal inequalities by establishing necessary conditions
for an inequality to be K-minimal. This characterization leads to a broader class of K-sublinear
inequalities, which includes K-minimal inequalities as a subclass. We establish a close connection
between K-sublinear inequalities and the support functions of sets with a certain structure. This
leads to practical ways of showing that a given inequality is K-sublinear and K-minimal. We provide
examples to show how our framework can be applied. Our framework generalizes some of the results
from the mixed integer linear case. It is well known that the minimal inequalities for mixed integer
linear programs are generated by sublinear (positively homogeneous, subadditive and convex)
functions that are also piecewise linear. This result is easily recovered by our analysis. So, whenever
possible we highlight the connections to the existing literature. However, our study reveals that
such a cut generating function view is not possible for the case of general non-polyhedral cones
even when the cone involved is the Lorentz cone.
