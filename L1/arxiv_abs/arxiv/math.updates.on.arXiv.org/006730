Picard-Lefschetz theory is applied to solutions of the Helmholtz equation, formulated in terms
of sums of integrals of a proper-time, or `einbein', wave function $\Psi(\Lambda) = \exp(i\mathbb
S(\Lambda))$ along complex contours bounded by essential singularities of $\Psi$. There is a one
to one map between steepest descent paths connecting essential singularities and real or complex
eigenrays. Residues of finite $\Lambda$ poles of $\mathbb S(\Lambda)$ are shown to vanish at spatial
points corresponding to sources, provided that the pole bounds only one steepest descent path.
If the sum includes two such paths, with one beginning and the other ending at the same pole, points
of vanishing residue are not sources, but are argued to be the locus on which caustic curves may have
singularities such as cusp points. The map between $\mathbb S$ and the generating function in the
Thom--Arnold classification of catastrophes is discussed. Monodromies of the solution set with
respect to complexified parameters defining the index of refraction, or spatial endpoints of Green's
functions, are trivially determined from the singularities of $\mathbb S(\Lambda)$. We construct
a variant of a Laurent series expansion of $\mathbb S$ about a pole at finite $\Lambda$. Expressions
for the coefficients of each order in this expansion can often be given exactly. Based on the Laurent
series expansion, we propose a variation of a Pad\'e approximant for $\mathbb S$, with the intent
of capturing additional poles and the associated cusp caustics which are not visible in the Laurent
series expansion.
