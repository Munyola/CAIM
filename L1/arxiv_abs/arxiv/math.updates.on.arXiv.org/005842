Consider an anchored bundle $(E,\rho)$, i.e. a vector bundle $E\to M$ equipped with a bundle map
$\rho \colon E \to TM$ covering the identity. M.~Kapranov showed in the context of Lie-Rinehard
algebras that there exists an extension of this anchored bundle to an infinite rank universal free
Lie algebroid $FR(E)\supset E$. We adapt his construction to the case of an anchored bundle equipped
with an arbitrary connection, $(E,\nabla)$, and show that it gives rise to a unique connection $\tilde
\nabla$ on $FR(E)$ which is compatible with its Lie algebroid structure, thus turning $(FR(E),
\tilde \nabla)$ into a Cartan-Lie algebroid. Moreover, this construction is universal: any connection-preserving
vector bundle morphism from $(E,\nabla)$ to a Cartan-Lie Algebroid $(A,\bar \nabla)$ factors
through a unique Cartan-Lie algebroid morphism from $(FR(E), \tilde \nabla)$ to $(A,\bar \nabla)$.
Suppose that, in addition, $M$ is equipped with a geometrical structure defined by some tensor field
$t$ which is compatible with $(E,\rho,\nabla)$ in the sense of being annihilated by a natural $E$-connection
that one can associate to these data. For example, for a Riemannian base $(M,g)$ of an involutive
anchored bundle $(E,\rho)$, this condition implies that $M$ carries a Riemannian foliation. %In
general, the compatibility of a tensor $t$ with $(E,\rho,\nabla)$ implies its adequate invariance
transversal to $\rho(E)$. It is shown that every $E$-compatible tensor field $t$ becomes invariant
with respect to the Lie algebroid representation associated canonically to the Cartan-Lie algebroid
$(FR(E), \tilde \nabla)$.
