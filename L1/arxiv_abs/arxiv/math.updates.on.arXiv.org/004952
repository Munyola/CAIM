Continuum models for the spatial dynamics of growing cell populations have been widely used to investigate
the mechanisms underpinning tissue development and tumour invasion. These models consist of nonlinear
partial differential equations that describe the evolution of cellular densities in response
to pressure gradients generated by population growth. Little prior work has explored the relation
between such continuum models and related single-cell-based models. We present here a simple stochastic
individual-based model for the spatial dynamics of multicellular systems whereby cells undergo
pressure-driven movement and pressure-dependent proliferation.We show that nonlinear partial
differential equations commonly used to model the spatial dynamics of growing cell populations
can be formally derived from the branching random walk that underlies our discrete model. Moreover,
we carry out a systematic comparison between the individual-based model and its continuum counterparts,
both in the case of one single cell population and in the case of multiple cell populations with different
biophysical properties. The outcomes of our comparative study demonstrate that the results of
computational simulations of the individual-based model faithfully mirror the qualitative and
quantitative properties of the solutions to the corresponding nonlinear partial differential
equations. Ultimately, these results illustrate how the simple rules governing the dynamics of
single cells in our individual-based model can lead to the emergence of complex spatial patterns
of population growth observed in continuum models.
