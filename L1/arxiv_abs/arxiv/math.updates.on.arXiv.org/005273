It has long been known that the set of primitive pythagorean triples can be enumerated by descending
certain ternary trees. We unify these treatments by considering hyperbolic billiard tables in
the Poincare disk model. Our tables have m>=3 ideal vertices, and are subject to the restriction
that reflections in the table walls are induced by matrices in the triangle group PSU^\pm_{1,1}Z[i].
The resulting billiard map \tilde B acts on the de Sitter space x_1^2+x_2^2-x_3^2=1, and has a natural
factor B on the unit circle, the pythagorean triples appearing as the B-preimages of fixed points.
We compute the invariant densities of these maps, and prove the Lagrange and Galois theorems: a complex
number of unit modulus has a preperiodic (purely periodic) B-orbit precisely when it is quadratic
(and isolated from its conjugate by a billiard wall) over Q(i). Each B as above is a (m-1)-to-1 orientation-reversing
covering map of the circle, a property shared by the group character T(z)=z^{-(m-1)}. We prove that
there exists a homeomorphism Phi, unique up to postcomposition with elements in a dihedral group,
that conjugates B with T; in particular Phi ---whose prototype is the classical Minkowski function---
establishes a bijection between the set of points of degree <=2 over Q(i) and the torsion subgroup
of the circle. We provide an explicit formula for Phi, and prove that Phi is singular and Holder continuous
with exponent equal to log(m-1) divided by the maximal periodic mean free path in the associated
billiard table.
