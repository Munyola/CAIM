Is the experimental order of convergence lower when using the entropy stable DGSEM-LGL variant?
Recently, a debate on the question of the convergence behavior of the entropy stable nodal collocation
discontinuous Galerkin spectral element method (DGSEM) with Legendre-Gauss-Lobatto nodes has
emerged. Whereas it is well documented that the entropy conservative variant with no additional
interface dissipation shows an odd-even behavior when testing its experimental convergence order,
the results in the literature are less clear regarding the entropy stable version of the DGSEM-LGL,
where explicit Riemann solver type dissipation is added at the element interfaces. We contribute
to the ongoing discussion and present numerical experiments for the compressible Euler equations,
where we investigate the effect of the choice of the numerical surface flux function. In our experiments,
it turns out that the choice of the numerical surface flux has an impact on the convergence order.
Penalty type numerical fluxes with high dissipation in all waves, such as the LLF and the HLL flux,
appear to affect the convergence order negatively for odd polynomial degrees $N$, in contrast to
the entropy conserving variant, where even polynomial degrees $N$ are negatively affected. This
behavior is more pronounced in low Mach number settings. In contrast, for numerical surface fluxes
with less dissipative behavior in the contact wave such as e.g. Roe's flux, the HLLC flux and the entropy
conservative flux augmented with 5-wave matrix dissipation, optimal convergence rate of $N+1$
independent of the Mach number is observed.
