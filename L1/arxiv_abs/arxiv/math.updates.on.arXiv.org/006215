A study is conducted to evaluate four derivative estimation methods when solving a large sparse
nonlinear programming problem that arises from the approximation of an optimal control problem
using a direct collocation method. In particular, the Taylor series-based finite-difference,
bicomplex-step, and hyper-dual derivative estimation methods are evaluated and compared alongside
a well known automatic differentiation method. The performance of each derivative estimation
method is assessed based on the number of iterations, the computation time per iteration, and the
total computation time required to solve the nonlinear programming problem. The efficiency of
each of the four derivative estimation methods is compared by solving three benchmark optimal control
problems. It is found that while central finite-differencing is typically more efficient per iteration
than either the hyper-dual or bicomplex-step, the latter two methods have significantly lower
overall computation times due to the fact that fewer iterations are required by the nonlinear programming
problem when compared with central finite-differencing. Furthermore, while the bicomplex-step
and hyper-dual methods are similar in performance, the hyper-dual method is significantly easier
to implement. Moreover, the automatic differentiation method is found to be substantially less
computationally efficient than any of the three Taylor series-based methods. The results of this
study show that the hyper-dual method offers several benefits over the other three methods both
in terms of computational efficiency and ease of implementation.
