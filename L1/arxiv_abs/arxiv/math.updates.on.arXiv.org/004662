Wildfires are natural disasters capable of damaging economies and communities. When wildfires
become uncontrollable, Incident Manager Teams (IMT's) dispatch response vehicles to key assets
to undertake protective tasks and so mitigate the risk to these assets. In developing a deployment
plan under severe time pressure, IMT's need to consider the special requirements of each asset,
the resources (vehicles and their teams), as well as uncertainties associated with the wildfire.
A common situation that arises in southern Australian wildfires is a wind change. There is a reliable
forecast of a wind change, but some uncertainty around the timing of that change. To assist IMT's
to deal with this situation we develop a two-stage stochastic model to integrate such an uncertainty
with the complexities of asset protection operations. This is the first time a mathematical model
is proposed which considers uncertainty in the timing of a scenario change. The model is implemented
for a case study that uses the context of the 2009 Black Saturday bushfires in Victoria. A new set of
benchmark instances is generated using realistic wildfire attributes to test the computational
tractability of our model and the results compared to a dynamic rerouting approach. The computations
reveal that, compared with dynamic rerouting, the new model can generate better deployment plans.
The model can achieve solutions in operational time for realistic-sized problems, although for
larger problems the sub-optimal rerouting algorithm would still need to be deployed.
