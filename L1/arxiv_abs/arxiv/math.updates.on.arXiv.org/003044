The star discrepancy $D_N^*(\mathcal{P})$ is a quantitative measure for the irregularity of distribution
of a finite point set $\mathcal{P}$ in the multi-dimensional unit cube which is intimately related
to the integration error of quasi-Monte Carlo algorithms. It is known that for every integer $N \ge
2$ there are point sets $\mathcal{P}$ in $[0,1)^d$ with $|\mathcal{P}|=N$ and $D_N^*(\mathcal{P})
=O((\log N)^{d-1}/N)$. However, for small $N$ compared to the dimension $d$ this asymptotically
excellent bound is useless (e.g. for $N \le {\rm e}^{d-1}$). In 2001 it has been shown by Heinrich,
Novak, Wasilkowski and Wo\'{z}niakowski that for every integer $N \ge 2$ there exist point sets
$\mathcal{P}$ in $[0,1)^d$ with $|\mathcal{P}|=N$ and $D_N^*(\mathcal{P}) \le C \sqrt{d/N}$.
Although not optimal in an asymptotic sense in $N$, this upper bound has a much better (and even optimal)
dependence on the dimension $d$. Unfortunately the result by Heinrich et al. and also later variants
thereof by other authors are pure existence results and until now no explicit construction of point
sets with the above properties are known. Quite recently L\"obbe studied lacunary subsequences
of Kronecker's $(n \boldsymbol{\alpha})$-sequence and showed a metrical discrepancy bound of
the form $C \sqrt{d (\log d)/N}$ with implied absolute constant $C>0$ independent of $N$ and $d$.
In this paper we show a corresponding result for digital Kronecker sequences, which are a non-archimedean
analog of classical Kronecker sequences.
