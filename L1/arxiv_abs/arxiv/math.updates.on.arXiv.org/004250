We consider the problem of defining a strategy consisting of a set of facilities taking into account
also the location where they have to be assigned and the time in which they have to be activated. The
facilities are evaluated with respect to a set of criteria. The plan has to be devised respecting
some constraints related to different aspects of the problem such as precedence restrictions due
to the nature of the facilities. Among the constraints, there are some related to the available budget.
We consider also the uncertainty related to the performances of the facilities with respect to considered
criteria, and plurality of stakeholders participating to the decision. The considered problem
can be seen as the combination of some prototypical operations research problems: knapsack problem,
location problem and project scheduling. Indeed, the basic brick of our model is a variable $x_{ilt}$
which takes value 1 if facility $i$ is activated in location $l$ at time $t$, and $0$ otherwise. Due
to the conjoint consideration of a location and a time in the decision variables, what we propose
can be seen as a general space-time model for operations research problems. We discuss how such a
model permits to handle complex problems using several methodologies including multiple attribute
value theory and multiobjective optimization. With respect to the latter point, without any loss
of the generality, we consider the compromise programming and an interactive methodology based
on the Dominance-based Rough Set Approach. We illustrate the application of our model with a simple
didactic example.
