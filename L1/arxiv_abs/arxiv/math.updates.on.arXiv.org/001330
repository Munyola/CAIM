This paper proposes a strategic model of pollution control. A firm, representative of the productive
sector of a country, aims at maximizing its profits by expanding its production. Assuming that the
output of production is proportional to the level of pollutants' emissions, the firm increases
the level of pollution. The government of the country aims at minimizing the social costs due to the
pollution, and introduces regulatory constraints on the emissions' level, which then effectively
cap the output of production. Supposing that the firm and the government face both proportional
and fixed costs in order to adopt their policies, we model the previous problem as a stochastic impulse
two-person nonzero-sum game. The state variable of the game is the level of the output of production
which evolves as a general linearly controlled one-dimensional It\^o-diffusion. Following an
educated guess, we first construct a pair of candidate equilibrium policies and of corresponding
equilibrium values, and we then provide a set of sufficient conditions under which they indeed realize
an equilibrium. Our results are complemented by a numerical study when the (uncontrolled) output
of production evolves as a geometric Brownian motion, and the firm's operating profit and the government's
running cost functions are of power type. An analysis of the dependency of the equilibrium policies
and values on the model parameters yields interesting new behaviors that we explain as a consequence
of the strategic interaction between the firm and the government.
