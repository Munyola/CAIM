We consider holomorphic twists of arbitrary supersymmetric theories in four dimensions. Working
in the BV formalism, we rederive classical results characterizing the holomorphic twist of chiral
and vector supermultiplets, computing the twist explicitly as a family over the space of nilpotent
supercharges in minimal supersymmetry. The BV formalism allows one to work with or without auxiliary
fields, according to preference; for chiral superfields, we show that the result of the twist is
an identical BV theory, the holomorphic $\beta\gamma$ system with superpotential, independent
of whether or not auxiliary fields are included. We compute the character of local operators in this
holomorphic theory, demonstrating agreement of the free local operators with the usual index of
free fields. The local operators with superpotential are computed via a spectral sequence, and
are shown to agree with functions on a formal mapping space into the derived critical locus of the
superpotential. We consider the holomorphic theory on various geometries, including Hopf manifolds
and products of arbitrary pairs of Riemann surfaces, and offer some general remarks on dimensional
reductions of holomorphic theories along the $(n-1)$-sphere to topological quantum mechanics.
We also study an infinite-dimensional enhancement of the flavor symmetry in this example, to a recently-studied
central extension of the derived holomorphic functions with values in the original Lie algebra
that generalizes the familiar Kac--Moody enhancement in two-dimensional chiral theories.
