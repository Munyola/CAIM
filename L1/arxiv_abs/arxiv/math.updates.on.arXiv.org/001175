This article analyses a new class of advanced particle Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms recently
introduced by Andrieu, Doucet, and Holenstein (2010). We present a natural interpretation of these
methods in terms of well known unbiasedness properties of Feynman-Kac particle measures, and a
new duality with many-body Feynman-Kac models. This perspective sheds a new light on the foundations
and the mathematical analysis of this class of methods. A key consequence is the equivalence between
the backward and ancestral particle Markov chain Monte Carlo methods, and Gibbs sampling of a many-body
Feynman-Kac target distribution. Our approach also presents a new stochastic differential calculus
based on geometric combinatorial techniques to derive explicit non-asymptotic Taylor type series
of the semigroup of a class of particle Markov chain Monte Carlo models around their invariant measures
with respect to the population size of the auxiliary particle sampler. These results provide sharp
quan- titative estimates of the convergence properties of conditional particle Markov chain models
with respect to the time horizon and the size of the systems. We illustrate the implication of these
results with sharp estimates of the contraction coefficient and the Lyapunov exponent of conditional
particle samplers, and explicit and non-asymptotic Lp-mean error decompositions of the law of
the random states around the limiting invariant measure. The abstract framework developed in the
article also allows the design of natural extensions to island (also called SMC2) type particle
methodologies.
