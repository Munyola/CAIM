Motivated by multi-user optimization problems and non-cooperative Nash games in stochastic regimes,
we consider stochastic variational inequality (SVI) problems on matrix spaces where the variables
are positive semidefinite matrices and the mapping is merely monotone. Much of the interest in the
theory of variational inequality (VI) has focused on addressing VIs on vector spaces.Yet, most
existing methods either rely on strong assumptions, or require a two-loop framework where at each
iteration, a projection problem, i.e., a semidefinite optimization problem needs to be solved.
Motivated by this gap, we develop a stochastic mirror descent method where we choose the distance
generating function to be defined as the quantum entropy. This method is a single-loop first-order
method in the sense that it only requires a gradient-type of update at each iteration. The novelty
of this work lies in the convergence analysis that is carried out through employing an auxiliary
sequence of stochastic matrices. Our contribution is three-fold: (i) under this setting and employing
averaging techniques, we show that the iterate generated by the algorithm converges to a weak solution
of the SVI; (ii) moreover, we derive a convergence rate in terms of the expected value of a suitably
defined gap function; (iii) we implement the developed method for solving a multiple-input multiple-output
multi-cell cellular wireless network composed of seven hexagonal cells and present the numerical
experiments supporting the convergence of the proposed method.
