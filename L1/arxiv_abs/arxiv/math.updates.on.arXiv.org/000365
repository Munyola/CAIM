Continuous-time Markov chains are a standard tool in phylogenetic inference. If homogeneity is
assumed, the chain is formulated by specifying time-independent rates of substitutions between
states in the chain. In applications, there are usually extra constraints on the rates, depending
on the situation. If a model is formulated in this way, it is possible to generalise it and allow for
an inhomogeneous process, with time-dependent rates satisfying the same constraints. It is then
useful to require that there exists a homogeneous average of this inhomogeneous process within
the same model. This leads to the definition of "Lie Markov models", which are precisely the class
of models where such an average exists. These models form Lie algebras and hence concepts from Lie
group theory are central to their derivation. In this paper, we concentrate on applications to phylogenetics
and nucleotide evolution, and derive the complete hierarchy of Lie Markov models that respect the
grouping of nucleotides into purines and pyrimidines -- that is, models with purine/pyrimidine
symmetry. We also discuss how to handle the subtleties of applying Lie group methods, most naturally
defined over the complex field, to the stochastic case of a Markov process, where parameter values
are restricted to be real and positive. In particular, we explore the geometric embedding of the
cone of stochastic rate matrices within the ambient space of the associated complex Lie algebra.
