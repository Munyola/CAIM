Coalescing random walks is a fundamental stochastic process, where a set of particles perform independent
discrete-time random walks on an undirected graph. Whenever two or more particles meet at a given
node, they merge and continue as a single random walk. The {\em coalescence time} is defined as the
expected time until only one particle remains, starting from one particle at every node. Despite
recent progress such as by Cooper et al. and Berenbrink et al., the coalescence time for graphs such
as binary trees, $d$-dimensional tori, hypercubes and more generally, vertex-transitive graphs,
remains unresolved. We provide a powerful toolkit that results in tight bounds for various topologies
including the aforementioned ones. The meeting time is defined as the worst-case expected time
required for two random walks to arrive at the same node at the same time. As a general result, we establish
that for graphs whose meeting time is only marginally larger than the mixing time (a factor of $\log^{2}
n$), the coalescence time of $n$ random walks equals the meeting time up to constant factors. This
upper bound is complemented by the construction of a graph family demonstrating that this result
is the best possible up to constant factors. For almost-regular graphs, we bound the coalescence
time by the hitting time, resolving the discrete-time variant of a conjecture by Aldous for this
class of graphs. Finally, we prove that for any graph the coalescence time is bounded by $O(n^3)$.
By duality, our results give bounds on the voter model.
