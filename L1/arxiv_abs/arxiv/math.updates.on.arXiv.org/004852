In this paper, we study the theory of linearized gravity and prove the linear stability of Schwarzschild
black holes as solutions of the vacuum Einstein equations. In particular, we prove that solutions
to the linearized vacuum Einstein equations centered at a Schwarzschild metric, with suitably
regular initial data, remain uniformly bounded and decay to a linearized Kerr metric on the exterior
region. We employ Hodge decomposition to split the solution into closed and co-closed portions,
respectively identified with even-parity and odd-parity solutions in the physics literature.
For the co-closed portion, we extend previous results by the first two authors, deriving Regge-Wheeler
type equations for two gauge-invariant master quantities without the earlier paper's need of axisymmetry.
For the closed portion, we build upon earlier work of Zerilli and Moncrief, wherein the authors derive
an equation for a gauge-invariant master quantity in a spherical harmonic decomposition. We work
with gauge-invariant quantities at the level of perturbed connection coefficients, with the initial
value problem formulated on Cauchy data sets. With the choice of an appropriate gauge in each of the
two portions, decay estimates on these decoupled quantities are used to establish decay of the metric
coefficients of the solution, completing the proof of linear stability. Our result differs from
that of Dafermos-Holzegel-Rodnianski, both in our choice of gauge and in our identification and
utilization of lower-level gauge-invariant master quantities.
