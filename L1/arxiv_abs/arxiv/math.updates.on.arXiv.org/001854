A graph $G$ is said to be $\alpha$-resilient with respect to some property ${\cal P}$, if for every
spanning subgraph $H \subseteq G$ with $d_H(v) \le \alpha d_G(v)$ for all $v\in V(G)$, the graph
$G - H$ still satisfies property ${\cal P}$. Determining the largest possible parameter $\alpha$
for a given property in the case $G = K_n$, the complete graph with $n$ vertices, is one of the central
topics in extremal combinatorics, pioneered by Dirac in the 1950s and yielding celebrated results
such as the Hajnal-Szemer\'edi theorem. An increasing trend in the past two decades has been to transfer
results which hold for dense graphs, such as $K_n$, to the setting of sparse random graphs. In the
case of resilience this raises two questions: how many edges does a random graph need to have in order
to typically exhibit $\alpha$-resilience with respect to $\mathcal{P}$? And for which parameter
$\alpha$? We fully resolve these questions for the case of Hamiltonicity and the existence of a perfect
matching. In particular, we show that for $m \ge (\tfrac16 + o(1))n \log n$ edges the $2$-core of the
random graph $G_{n,m}$ is $(\tfrac12-o(1))$-resilient with respect to being Hamiltonian. Moreover,
we show that in the random graph process in which edges are added randomly one at a time, the graph becomes
resiliently Hamiltonian as soon as the minimum degree reaches $2$, the necessary condition for
being Hamiltonian. This establishes a resilience version of the classical `hitting-time' result
of Ajtai, Koml\'os, and Szemer\'edi and independently, Bollob\'as. Similar results are obtained
for perfect matchings.
