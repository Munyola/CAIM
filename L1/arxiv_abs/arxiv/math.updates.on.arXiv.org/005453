We study a family of polynomials which are orthogonal with respect to the varying, highly oscillatory
complex weight function $e^{ni\lambda z}$ on $[-1,1]$, where $\lambda$ is a positive parameter.
This family of polynomials has appeared in the literature recently in connection with complex quadrature
rules, and their asymptotics have been previously studied when $\lambda$ is smaller than a certain
critical value, $\lambda_c$. Our main goal is to compute their asymptotics when $\lambda>\lambda_c$.
We first provide a geometric description, based on the theory of quadratic differentials, of the
curves in the complex plane which will eventually support the asymptotic zero distribution of these
polynomials. Next, using the powerful Riemann-Hilbert formulation of the orthogonal polynomials
due to Fokas, Its, and Kitaev, along with its method of asymptotic solution via Deift-Zhou nonlinear
steepest descent, we provide uniform asymptotics of the polynomials throughout the complex plane.
Although much of this asymptotic analysis follows along the lines of previous works in the literature,
the main obstacle appears in the construction of the so-called global parametrix. This construction
is carried out in an explicit way with the help of certain integrals of elliptic type. In stark contrast
to the situation one typically encounters in the presence of real orthogonality, an interesting
byproduct of this construction is that there is a discrete set of values of $\lambda$ for which one
cannot solve the model Riemann-Hilbert problem, and as such the corresponding polynomials fail
to exist.
