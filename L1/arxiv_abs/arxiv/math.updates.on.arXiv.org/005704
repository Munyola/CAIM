A doubly group-labeled graph is an oriented graph with its edges labeled by elements of the direct
sum of two groups $\Gamma_1,\Gamma_2$. A cycle in a doubly group-labeled graph is $(\Gamma_1,\Gamma_2)$-non-zero
if it is non-zero in both coordinates. Our main result is a generalization of the Flat Wall Theorem
of Robertson and Seymour to doubly group-labeled graphs. As an application, we determine all canonical
obstructions to the Erd\H{o}s-P\'osa property for $(\Gamma_1,\Gamma_2)$-non-zero cycles in
doubly group-labeled graphs. The obstructions imply that the half-integral Erd\H{o}s-P\'osa
property always holds for $(\Gamma_1,\Gamma_2)$-non-zero cycles. Moreover, our approach gives
a unified framework for proving packing results for constrained cycles in graphs. For example,
as immediate corollaries we recover the Erd\H{o}s-P\'osa property for cycles and $S$-cycles and
the half-integral Erd\H{o}s-P\'osa property for odd cycles and odd $S$-cycles. Furthermore,
we recover Reed's Escher-wall Theorem. We also prove many new packing results as immediate corollaries.
For example, we show that the half-integral Erd\H{o}s-P\'osa property holds for cycles not homologous
to zero, odd cycles not homologous to zero, and $S$-cycles not homologous to zero. Moreover, the
(full) Erd\H{o}s-P\'osa property holds for $S_1$-$S_2$-cycles and cycles not homologous to zero
on an orientable surface. Finally, we also describe the canonical obstructions to the Erd\H{o}s-P\'osa
property for cycles not homologous to zero and for odd $S$-cycles.
