We focus on the estimates on the selection constant in the following geometric selection theorem
by Pach: For every positive integer $d$ there is a constant $c_d > 0$ such that whenever $X_1, \dots,
X_{d+1}$ are $n$-element subsets of $\mathbb{R}^d$, then we can find a point $p \in \mathbb{R}^d$
and subsets $Y_i \subseteq X_i$ for every $i \in [d+1]$, each of size at least $c_d n$, such that $p$
belongs to all rainbow $d$-simplices determined by $Y_1, \dots, Y_{d+1}$, that is, simplices with
one vertex in each $Y_i$. We show an exponentially decreasing upper bound $c_d\leq \kappa^{d}$
for a suitable constant $\kappa < 1$. The ideas used in the proof of the upper bound also help us
prove Pach's theorem with $c_d>2^{-2^{d^2 + O(d)}}$, which is a lower bound doubly exponentially
decreasing in $d$ (up to a polynomial in the exponent). For comparison, Pach's original approach
yields a triply exponentially decreasing lower bound. On the other hand, Fox, Pach, and Suk recently
announced a hypergraph density result implying a proof of Pach's theorem with $c_d>2^{-O(d^3\log
d)}$. In our construction for the upper bound, we use the fact that the minimum solid angle of every
$d$-simplex is exponentially small. This fact was previously unknown and might be of independent
interest. For the lower bound, we improve the `separation' part of the argument by showing that in
one of the key steps only $d+1$ separations are necessary, compared to $2^d$ separations in the original
proof. We also provide a measure version of Pach's theorem.
