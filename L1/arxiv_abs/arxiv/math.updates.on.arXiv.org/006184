Let $\mathbf{X}=(\mathbf{X}_t)_{t \geq 0}$ be a stochastic process issued from $x \in \mathbb
R$ that admits a marginal stationary measure $\nu$, i.e. $\nu \mathbf{P}_t f = \nu f$ for all $t \geq
0$, where $\mathbf{P}_t f(x)= \mathbb{E}_x[f(\mathbf{X}_t)]$. In this paper, we introduce the
(resp. biorthogonal) spectral projections correlation functions which are expressed in terms
of projections into the eigenspaces of $\mathbf{P}_t$ (resp. and of its adjoint in the weighted
Hilbert space $L^2(\nu)$). We obtain closed-form expressions involving eigenvalues, the condition
number and/or the angle between the projections in the following different situations: when $\mathbf{X}=X$
with $X=(X_t)_{t \geq 0}$ is a Markov process, $\mathbf{X}$ is the subordination of $X$ in the sense
of Bochner, and $\mathbf X$ is a non-Markovian process which is obtained by time-changing $X$ with
an inverse of a subordinator. It turns out that these spectral projections correlation functions
have different expressions with respect to these classes of processes which enables to identify
substantial and deep properties about their dynamics. This interesting fact can be used to design
original statistical tests to make inferences, for example, about the path properties of the process
(presence of jumps), distance from symmetry (self-adjoint or non-self-adjoint) and short-to-long-range
dependence. To reveal the usefulness of our results, we apply them to a class of non-self-adjoint
Markov semigroups studied in Patie and Savov [28], and then time-change by subordinators and their
inverses.
