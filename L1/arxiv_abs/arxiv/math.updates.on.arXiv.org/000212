We study the convergence of different multigrid schemes for the Helmholtz equation, focusing in
particular on the choice of the coarse scale operator. Assuming that the coarse scale solutions
should approximate the true solutions, the coarse level grid must have a minimum number, say $G_c$,
of points per wavelength. The oscillating nature of the solutions implies the requirement $G_c
> 2$. However, in examples the requirement can be more like $G_c \gtrsim 8$, in a trade-off involving
also the amount of damping present and the number of multigrid iterations. We find that the main factor
affecting $G_c$ is the difference in phase speeds between the coarse, and fine scale operators.
The 5-point operator in 2-D is our main example. A new coarse scale 9-point operator is designed to
match its dispersion relation. We then compare dispersion relations and multigrid performance
of standard multigrid schemes with schemes using the new operator. The required $G_c$ can be reduced
from about 8 to about 4, while at the same time reducing the damping so that the waves propagate over
~ 100 wavelengths in the new scheme. In 3-D comparable results are obtained with standard 7 point
differences and an optimized 15 point coarse grid operator, leading to an order of magnitude reduction
in the number of unknows for the coarse scale linear system. Matching coarse scale operators can
easily be constructed for other discretizations. The method is therefore potentially useful for
a large class of discretized high-frequency Helmholtz equations.
