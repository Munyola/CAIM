Measures of tree balance play an important role in various research areas, for example in phylogenetics.
There they are for instance used to test whether an observed phylogenetic tree differs significantly
from a tree generated by the Yule model of speciation. One of the most popular indices in this regard
is the Colless index, which measures the degree of balance for rooted binary trees. While many statistical
properties of the Colless index (e.g. asymptotic results for its mean and variance under different
models of speciation) have already been discussed in different contexts, we focus on its extremal
properties. While it is relatively straightforward to characterize trees with maximal Colless
index, the analysis of the minimal value of the Colless index and the characterization of trees that
achieve it, are much more involved. In this note, we therefore focus on the minimal value of the Colless
index for any given number of leaves. We derive both a recursive formula for this minimal value, as
well as an explicit expression, which shows a surprising connection between the Colless index and
the so-called Blancmange curve, a fractal curve that is also known as the Takagi curve. Moreover,
we characterize two classes of trees that have minimal Colless index, consisting of the set of so-called
\emph{maximally balanced trees} and a class of trees that we call \emph{greedy from the bottom trees}.
Furthermore, we derive an upper bound for the number of trees with minimal Colless index by relating
these trees with trees with minimal Sackin index (another well-studied index of tree balance).
