Wireless communication applications has acquired a vastly increasing range over the past decade.
This rapidly increasing demand implies limitations on utilizing wireless resources. One of the
most important resources in wireless communication is frequency spectrum. This thesis provides
different solutions towards increasing the spectral efficiency. The first solution provided
in this thesis is to use a more accurate optimization metric: maximal acheivable rate (compared
to traditional metric: ergodic capacity) to optimize training data size in wireless communication.
Training data symbols are previously known symbols to the receiver inserted in data packets which
are used by receiver to acquire channel state information (CSI). Optimizing training data size
with respect to our proposed tight optimization metric, we could achieve higher rates especially
for short packet and ultra reliable applications. Our second proposed solution to increase spectral
efficiency is to design a multifunction communication and sensing platform utilizing a special
training sequence design. We proposed a platform where two training sequences are designed, one
for the base-station and the other for the user. By designing these two training sequence such that
they are uncorrelated to each other, the base station will be able to distinguish between the two
training sequence. Having one of the sequences especially designed for radar purposes (by designing
it such that it has an impulse-like autocorrelation), the system will be able to sense the environment,
transmit and receive the communication data simultaneously.
