We study weakly stable hyperbolic boundary problems with highly oscillatory coefficients that
are large, $O(1)$, compared to the small wavelength $\eps$ of oscillations. Such problems arise,
for example, in the study of classical questions concerning the stability of Mach stems and compressible
vortex sheets. For such applications one seeks to prove energy estimates that are in an appropriate
sense "uniform" with respect to the small wavelength $\eps$, but the large oscillatory coefficients
are a formidable obstacle to obtaining such estimates. In this paper we analyze a simplified form
of the linearized problems that are relevant to the above stability questions, and obtain results
that are both positive and negative. On the one hand we identify favorable structural conditions
under which it is possible to prove uniform estimates, and then do so by a new approach. We also construct
examples showing that large oscillatory coefficients can give rise to an instantaneous \emph{multiple}
amplification of the amplitude of solutions relative to data; for example, boundary data of a given
amplitude $O(1)$ can \emph{immediately} give rise to a solution of amplitude $O(\frac{1}{\eps^K})$,
where $K>1$.\footnote{Examples of first-order amplification, where $K=1$, are well-known \cite{MA,CG}.}
We use the examples of multiple amplification to confirm the optimality of our uniform estimates
when the favorable structural conditions hold. When those conditions do not hold, we explain how
multiple amplification of infinite order may rule out useful estimates.
