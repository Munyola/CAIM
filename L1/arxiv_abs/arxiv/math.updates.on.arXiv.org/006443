In this paper we continue the formal analysis of the long-time asymptotics of the homoenergetic
solutions for the Boltzmann equation that we began in [18]. They have the form $f\left( x,v,t\right)
=g\left(v-L\left( t\right) x,t\right) $ where $L\left( t\right) =A\left(I+tA\right) ^{-1}$
where $A$ is a constant matrix. Homoenergetic solutions satisfy an integro-differential equation
which contains, in addition to the classical Boltzmann collision operator, a linear hyperbolic
term. Depending on the properties of the collision kernel the collision and the hyperbolic terms
might be of the same order of magnitude as $t\to\infty$, or the collision term could be the dominant
one for large times, or the hyperbolic term could be the largest. The first case has been rigorously
studied in [17]. Formal asymptotic expansions in the second case have been obtained in [18]. All
the solutions obtained in this case can be approximated by Maxwellian distributions with changing
temperature. In this paper we focus in the case where the hyperbolic terms are much larger than the
collision term for large times (hyperbolic-dominated behavior). In the hyperbolic-dominated
case it does not seem to be possible to describe in a simple way all the long time asymptotics of the
solutions, but we discuss several physical situations and formulate precise conjectures. We give
explicit formulas for the relationship between density, temperature and entropy for these solutions.
These formulas differ greatly from the ones at equilibrium.
