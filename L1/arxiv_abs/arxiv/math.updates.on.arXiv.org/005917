Many natural and engineered dynamical systems, including all living objects, exhibit signatures
of what can be called spontaneous dynamical long-range order (DLRO). This order's omnipresence
has long been recognized by the scientific community, as evidenced by a myriad of related concepts,
theoretical and phenomenological frameworks, and experimental phenomena such as turbulence,
$1/f$ noise, dynamical complexity, chaos and the butterfly effect, the Richter scale for earthquakes
and the scale-free statistics of other sudden processes, self-organization and pattern formation,
self-organized criticality, etc. Although several successful approaches to various realizations
of DLRO have been established, the universal theoretical understanding of this phenomenon remained
elusive. The possibility of constructing a unified theory of DLRO has emerged recently within the
approximation-free supersymmetric theory of stochastics (STS). There, DLRO is the spontaneous
breakdown of the topological or de Rham supersymmetry that all stochastic differential equations
(SDEs) possess. This theory may be interesting to researchers with very different backgrounds
because the ubiquitous DLRO is a truly interdisciplinary entity. The STS is also an interdisciplinary
construction. This theory is based on dynamical systems theory, cohomological field theories,
the theory of pseudo-Hermitian operators, and the conventional theory of SDEs. Reviewing the literature
on all these mathematical disciplines can be time-consuming. As such, a concise and self-contained
introduction to the STS, the goal of this paper, may be useful.
