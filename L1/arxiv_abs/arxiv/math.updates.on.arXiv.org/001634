In 1959, P. Hall introduced the locally finite group $\mathcal{U}$, today known as Hall's universal
group. This group is countable, universal, simple, and any two finite isomorphic subgroups are
conjugate in $\mathcal{U}$. It can be explicitly described as a direct limit of finite symmetric
groups. It is homogeneous in the model-theoretic sense since it is the Fraisse limit of the class
of all finite groups. Since its introduction Hall's group, and several natural generalisations,
have been widely studied. In this article we use a generalisation of Fraisse theory to construct
a countable, universal, locally finite semigroup $\mathcal{T}$, that arises as a direct limit
of finite full transformation semigroups, and has the highest possible degree of homogeneity.
We prove that it is unique up to isomorphism among semigroups satisfying these properties. We prove
an analogous result for inverse semigroups, constructing a maximally homogeneous universal locally
finite inverse semigroup $\mathcal{I}$ which is a direct limit of finite symmetric inverse semigroups
(semigroups of partial bijections). The semigroups $\mathcal{T}$ and $\mathcal{I}$ are the natural
counterparts of Hall's universal group for semigroups and inverse semigroups, respectively.
While these semigroups are not homogeneous, they still exhibit a great deal of symmetry. We study
the structural features of these semigroups and locate several well-known homogeneous structures
within them, such as the countable generic semilattice, the countable random bipartite graph,
and Hall's group itself.
