We study the dynamics in the neighborhood of simple and double unstable periodic orbits in a rotating
3D autonomous Hamiltonian system of galactic type. In order to visualize the four dimensional spaces
of section we use the method of color and rotation. We investigate the structure of the invariant
manifolds that we found in the neighborhood of simple and double unstable periodic orbits in the
4D spaces of section. We consider orbits in the neighborhood of the families x1v2, belonging to the
x1 tree, and the z-axis (the rotational axis of our system). Close to the transition points from stability
to simple instability, in the neighborhood of the bifurcated simple unstable x1v2 periodic orbits
we encounter the phenomenon of stickiness as the asymptotic curves of the unstable manifold surround
regions of the phase space occupied by rotational tori existing in the region. For larger energies,
away from the bifurcating point, the consequents of the chaotic orbits form clouds of points with
mixing of color in their 4D representations. In the case of double instability, close to x1v2 orbits,
we find clouds of points in the four dimensional spaces of section. However, in some cases of double
unstable periodic orbits belonging to the z-axis family we can visualize the associated unstable
eigensurface. Chaotic orbits close to the periodic orbit remain sticky to this surface for long
times (of the order of a Hubble time or more). Among the orbits we studied we found those close to the
double unstable orbits of the x1v2 family having the largest diffusion speed.
