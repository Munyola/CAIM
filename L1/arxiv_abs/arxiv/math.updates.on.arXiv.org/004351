We present new integer linear programming (ILP) models for NP-hard optimisation problems in instances
of the Stable Marriage problem with Ties and Incomplete lists (SMTI) and its many-to-one generalisation,
the Hospitals / Residents problem with Ties (HRT). These models can be used to efficiently solve
these optimisation problems when applied to (i) instances derived from real-world applications,
and (ii) larger instances that are randomly-generated. In the case of SMTI, we consider instances
arising from the pairing of children with adoptive families, where preferences are obtained from
a quality measure of each possible pairing of child to family. In this case we seek a maximum weight
stable matching. We present new algorithms for preprocessing instances of SMTI with ties on both
sides, as well as new ILP models. Algorithms based on existing state-of-the-art models only solve
6 of our 22 real-world instances within an hour per instance, and our new models solve all 22 instances
within a mean runtime of 60 seconds. For HRT, we consider instances derived from the problem of assigning
junior doctors to foundation posts in Scottish hospitals. Here we seek a maximum size stable matching.
We show how to extend our models for SMTI to the HRT case. For the real instances, we reduce the mean
runtime from an average of 144 seconds when using state-of-the-art methods, to 3 seconds when using
our new ILP-based algorithms. We also show that our models outperform considerably state-of-the-art
models on larger randomly-generated instances of SMTI and HRT.
