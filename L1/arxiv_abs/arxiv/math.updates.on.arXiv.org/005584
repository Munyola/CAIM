Fix $n \geq 2$ an integer, and let $F$ be a totally real number field. We derive nonvanishing estimates
for the finite parts of the $L$-functions of irreducible cuspidal $\operatorname{GL}_n({\bf{A}}_F)$-automorphic
representations twisted by class group characters or ring class characters of a totally imaginary
quadratic extensions $K$ of $F$, evaluated at central values $s=1/2$ or more generally values $s
\in {\bf{C}}$ within the strip $\frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{n^2 + 1} < \Re(s) < 1$. Assuming the generalized
Ramanujan conjecture at infinity, we obtain estimates for all arguments in the critical strip $0
< \Re(s) < 1$. We also derive finer nonvanishing estimates for central values $s=1/2$ twisted by
ring class characters of $K$. The key idea in our approach is to derive exact integral presentations
for the averages in terms specializations of constant coefficients of certain $L^2$-automorphic
forms on $\operatorname{GL}_2({\bf{A}}_F)$. In the setting where the representation is cohomological
and the dimension $n \geq 2$ even, we then use these to generalize the well-known theorems of Greenberg,
Rohrlich, Vatsal, and Cornut-Vatsal for $\operatorname{GL}_2$. The latter result uses existing
rationality theorems in the direction of Deligne's rationality conjecture, which allows us to
reinterpret our averages in terms of Galois conjugacy. It also has various arithmetic applications,
including to Deligne's conjecture itself for automorphic motives over CM fields via recent works
of Harris et alia, as we explain.
