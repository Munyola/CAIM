We provide a degree condition on a regular $n$-vertex graph $G$ which ensures the existence of a near
optimal packing of any family $\mathcal H$ of bounded degree $n$-vertex $k$-chromatic separable
graphs into $G$. In general, this degree condition is best possible. Here a graph is separable if
it has a sublinear separator whose removal results in a set of components of sublinear size. Equivalently,
the separability condition can be replaced by that of having small bandwidth. Thus our result can
be viewed as a version of the bandwidth theorem of B\"ottcher, Taraz and Schacht in the setting of
approximate decompositions. More precisely, let $\delta_k$ be the infimum over all $\delta\ge
1/2$ ensuring an approximate $K_k$-decomposition of any sufficiently large regular $n$-vertex
graph $G$ of degree at least $\delta n$. Now suppose that $G$ is an $n$-vertex graph which is close
to $r$-regular for some $r \ge (\delta_k+o(1))n$ and suppose that $H_1,\dots,H_t$ is a sequence
of bounded degree $n$-vertex $k$-chromatic separable graphs with $\sum_i e(H_i) \le (1-o(1))e(G)$.
We show that there is an edge-disjoint packing of $H_1,\dots,H_t$ into $G$. If the $H_i$ are bipartite,
then $r\geq (1/2+o(1))n$ is sufficient. In particular, this yields an approximate version of the
tree packing conjecture in the setting of regular host graphs $G$ of high degree. Similarly, our
result implies approximate versions of the Oberwolfach problem, the Alspach problem and the existence
of resolvable designs in the setting of regular host graphs of high degree.
