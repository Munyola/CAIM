We study phase transition and percolation at criticality for three planar random graph models,
viz., the homogeneous and inhomogeneous enhanced random connection models (RCM) and the Poisson
stick model. These models are built on a homogeneous Poisson point process $\mathcal{P}_{\lambda}$
in $\mathbb{R}^2$ of intensity $\lambda$. In the homogenous RCM, the vertices at $x,y$ are connected
with probability $g(|x-y|)$, independent of everything else, where $g:[0,\infty) \to [0,1]$
and $| \cdot |$ is the Euclidean norm. In the inhomogenous version of the model, points of $\mathcal{P}_{\lambda}$
are endowed with weights that are non-negative independent random variables with distribution
$P(W>w)= w^{-\beta}1_{[1,\infty)}(w)$, $\beta>0$. Vertices located at $x,y$ with weights $W_x,W_y$
are connected with probability $1 - \exp\left( - \frac{\eta W_xW_y}{|x-y|^{\alpha}} \right)$,
$\eta, \alpha > 0$, independent of all else. The edges of the graph are viewed as straight line segments
starting and ending at points of $\mathcal{P}_{\lambda}$. A path in the graph is a continuous curve
that is a subset of the collection of all these line segments. The Poisson stick model consists of
line segments of independent random lengths and orientation with the mid point of each line located
at a distinct point of $\mathcal{P}_{\lambda}$. Intersecting lines then form a path in the graph.
A graph is said to percolate if there is an infinite connected component or path. We derive conditions
for the existence of a phase transition and show that under some additional conditions that there
is no percolation at criticality.
