Regular semisimple Hessenberg varieties are subvarieties of the flag variety $\mathrm{Flag}(\mathbb{C}^n)$
arising naturally in the intersection of geometry, representation theory, and combinatorics.
Recent results of Abe-Horiguchi-Masuda-Murai-Sato and Abe-DeDieu-Galetto-Harada relate the
volume polynomials of regular semisimple Hessenberg varieties to the volume polynomial of the
Gelfand-Zetlin polytope $\mathrm{GZ}(\lambda)$ for $\lambda=(\lambda_1,\lambda_2,\ldots,\lambda_n)$.
The main results of this manuscript use and generalize tools developed by Anderson-Tymoczko, Kiritchenko-Smirnov-Timorin,
and Postnikov, in order to derive an explicit formula for the volume polynomials of regular semisimple
Hessenberg varieties in terms of the volumes of certain faces of the Gelfand-Zetlin polytope, and
also exhibit a manifestly positive, combinatorial formula for their coefficients with respect
to the basis of monomials in the $\alpha_i := \lambda_i-\lambda_{i+1}$. In addition, motivated
by these considerations, we carefully analyze the special case of the permutohedral variety, which
is also known as the toric variety associated to Weyl chambers. In this case, we obtain an explicit
decomposition of the permutohedron (the moment map image of the permutohedral variety) into combinatorial
$(n-1)$-cubes, and also give a geometric interpretation of this decomposition by expressing the
cohomology class of the permutohedral variety in $\mathrm{Flag}(\mathbb{C}^n)$ as a sum of the
cohomology classes of a certain set of Richardson varieties.
