Hybrid energy storage system (HESS) composed of lithium-ion battery and supercapacitors has been
recognized as one of the most promising solutions to face against the high cost, low power density
and short cycle life of the battery-only energy storage system, which is the major headache hindering
the further penetration of electric vehicles. In this work, the HESS sizing and energy management
problem of an electric race car is investigated as a case study to improve the driving mileage and
battery cycle life performance. Compared with the existing research, the distinctive features
of this work are: (1) A dynamic model and a degradation model of the battery are employed to describe
the dynamic behavior and to predict the cycle life of the battery more precisely; (2) Considering
the fact that the design and control problems are coupled in most cases, in order to achieve a global
optimal design solution and an implementable real-time energy management system, a Bi-level multi-objective
sizing and control framework based on non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II and fuzzy logic
control (FLC) is proposed to size the HESS and to optimize the membership functions of a FLC based
EMS at the same time; (3) In order to improve the optimization efficiency, a vectorized fuzzy inference
system which allows large scale of fuzzy logic controllers operating in parallel is devised. At
last, the Pareto optimal solutions of different HESSs are obtained and compared to show the achieved
enhancements of the proposed Bi-level optimal sizing and energy management framework.
