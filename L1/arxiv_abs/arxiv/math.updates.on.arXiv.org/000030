We present a multiscale asymptotic framework for the analysis of the macroscopic behaviour of periodic
two-material composites with high contrast in a finite-strain setting. Our derivation starts
with the geometrically nonlinear description of a composite consisting of a stiff material matrix
and soft, periodically distributed inclusions, where the contrast between the components is coupled
with the period $\varepsilon.$ We assume that the deformation field is a rigid-body motion on some
part of the boundary of the composite, and consider various loading regimes, which are controlled
by an additional parameter $\lambda_\varepsilon.$ We show that for particular regimes the elastic
displacements are small throughout the material as $\varepsilon\to0$ and that the deformation
gradients in the stiff material are situated in the vicinity of the rigid-body motion specified
by the boundary condition. This allows to replace, in the homogenisation limit, the nonlinear material
law of the stiff component by its linearised version. The behaviour of the deformation gradients
on the soft component depends on the asymptotics of $\lambda_\varepsilon.$ In particular, in the
case $\lambda_\varepsilon\sim1$ they are shown to be of order one, and the related contribution
to the homogenised energy is expressed via the quasiconvex envelope of the original stored-energy
density defined on suitably rescaled gradient fields. As a main result we derive, in the spirit of
$\Gamma$-convergence, a limit energy functional and establish a precise two-scale expansion
for minimising sequences.
