Let $G$ be a countably infinite group, and let $\mu$ be a generating probability measure on $G$. We
study the space of $\mu$-stationary Borel probability measures on a topological $G$ space, and
in particular on $Z^G$, where $Z$ is any perfect Polish space. We also study the space of $\mu$-stationary,
measurable $G$-actions on a standard, nonatomic probability space. Equip the space of stationary
measures with the weak* topology. When $\mu$ has finite entropy, we show that a generic measure is
an essentially free extension of the Poisson boundary of $(G,\mu)$. When $Z$ is compact, this implies
that the simplex of $\mu$-stationary measures on $Z^G$ is a Poulsen simplex. We show that this is
also the case for the simplex of stationary measures on $\{0,1\}^G$. We furthermore show that if
the action of $G$ on its Poisson boundary is essentially free then a generic measure is isomorphic
to the Poisson boundary. Next, we consider the space of stationary actions, equipped with a standard
topology known as the weak topology. Here we show that when $G$ has property (T), the ergodic actions
are meager. We also construct a group $G$ without property (T) such that the ergodic actions are not
dense, for some $\mu$. Finally, for a weaker topology on the set of actions, which we call the very
weak topology, we show that a dynamical property (e.g., ergodicity) is topologically generic if
and only if it is generic in the space of measures. There we also show a Glasner-King type 0-1 law stating
that every dynamical property is either meager or residual.
