The Adaptive Lasso(Alasso) was proposed by Zou [\textit{J. Amer. Statist. Assoc. \textbf{101}
(2006) 1418-1429}] as a modification of the Lasso for the purpose of simultaneous variable selection
and estimation of the parameters in a linear regression model. Zou (2006) established that the Alasso
estimator is variable-selection consistent as well as asymptotically Normal in the indices corresponding
to the nonzero regression coefficients in certain fixed-dimensional settings. In an influential
paper, Minnier, Tian and Cai [\textit{J. Amer. Statist. Assoc. \textbf{106} (2011) 1371-1382}]
proposed a perturbation bootstrap method and established its distributional consistency for
the Alasso estimator in the fixed-dimensional setting. In this paper, however, we show that this
(naive) perturbation bootstrap fails to achieve second order correctness in approximating the
distribution of the Alasso estimator. We propose a modification to the perturbation bootstrap
objective function and show that a suitably studentized version of our modified perturbation bootstrap
Alasso estimator achieves second-order correctness even when the dimension of the model is allowed
to grow to infinity with the sample size. As a consequence, inferences based on the modified perturbation
bootstrap will be more accurate than the inferences based on the oracle Normal approximation. We
give simulation studies demonstrating good finite-sample properties of our modified perturbation
bootstrap method as well as an illustration of our method on a real data set.
