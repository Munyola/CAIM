A graph $G$ covers a graph $H$ if there exists a locally bijective homomorphism from $G$ to $H$. We
deal with regular coverings in which this homomorphism is prescribed by an action of a semiregular
subgroup $\Gamma$ of $\textrm{Aut}(G)$; so $H \cong G / \Gamma$. In this paper, we study the behaviour
of regular graph covering with respect to 1-cuts and 2-cuts in $G$. We describe reductions which
produce a series of graphs $G = G_0,\dots,G_r$ such that $G_{i+1}$ is created from $G_i$ by replacing
certain inclusion minimal subgraphs with colored edges. The process ends with a primitive graph
$G_r$ which is either 3-connected, or a cycle, or $K_2$. This reduction can be viewed as a non-trivial
modification of reductions of Mac Lane (1937), Trachtenbrot (1958), Tutte (1966), Hopcroft and
Tarjan (1973), Cuningham and Edmonds (1980), Walsh (1982), and others. A novel feature of our approach
is that in each step all essential information about symmetries of $G$ are preserved. A regular covering
projection $G_0\to H_0$ induces regular covering projections $G_i \to H_i$ where $H_i$ is the $i$-th
quotient reduction of $H_0$. This property allows to construct all possible quotients $H_0$ of
$G_0$ from the possible quotients $H_r$ of $G_r$. By applying this method to planar graphs, we give
a proof of Negami's Theorem (1988). Our structural results are also used in subsequent papers for
regular covering testing when $G$ is a planar graph and for an inductive characterization of the
automorphism groups of planar graphs (see Babai (1973) as well).
