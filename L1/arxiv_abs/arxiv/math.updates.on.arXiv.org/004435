In this paper, we construct a theory of integration of Voevodsky motives over a perfect field $k$,
and show that it circumvents some of the complications of motivic integration, leading to new arithmetic
and geometric results concerning K-equivalent $k$-varieties. One main application is that up
to direct summing a common Chow motive, K-equivalent smooth projective $k$-varieties have the
same $\mathbb{Z}[1/p]$-Chow motives ($p$ is the characteristic exponent of $k$), partially answering
a conjecture of Chin-Lung Wang. In addition to generalizing a theorem of Kontsevich on the equality
of Hodge numbers of K-equivalent smooth projective complex varieties, we show that such varieties
have isomorphic \textit{integral} singular cohomology groups. On the arithmetic side, we show
that K-equivalent smooth $k$-varieties have isomorphic $\ell$-adic Galois representations
up to semi-simplification. Furthermore, we connect this theory of integration of Voevodsky motives
to the existence of motivic $t$-structures for geometric Voevodsky motives; we show that if the
expected motivic $t$-structure on rational geometric Voevodsky motives exists, then K-equivalent
smooth projective varieties, in particular birational Calabi-Yau smooth projective varieties
over a field admitting resolution of singularities, have equivalent rational (Chow) motives.
We also connect this to a conjecture of Orlov concerning bounded derived categories of coherent
sheaves. This makes progress on showing that all cohomology theories (considering only their \textit{group}
structures) should agree for K-equivalent varieties.
