$G$ be a group, and $S(G)$ be the group of permutations on the set $G$. Define the holomorph of $G$ to
be the normalizer of the image in $S(G)$ of the right regular representation, \begin{equation*}
\Hol(G) = N_{S (G)}(\rho(G)) = \Aut(G) \rho(G). \end{equation*} If $N$ is any regular subgroup
of $S(G)$, then $N_{S(G)}(N)$ is isomorphic to the holomorph of $N$. G.A. Miller has shown that the
group \begin{equation*} T(G) = N_{S(G)}(\Hol(G))/\Hol(G) \end{equation*} acts regularly on
the set of the regular subgroups $N$ of $S(G)$ which are isomorphic to $G$, and have the same holomorph
as $G$, in the sense that $N_{S(G)}(N) = \Hol(G)$. If $G$ is non-abelian, inversion on $G$ yields
an involution in $T(G)$. Other regular subgroups $N$ of $S(G)$ yield (other) involutions in $T(G)$.
In the cases studied in the literature, $T(G)$ turns out to be a finite $2$-group, which is often elementary
abelian. In this paper we exhibit an example of a finite $p$-group $\Gp$ of class $2$, for $p > 2$ a prime,
such that $T(\Gp)$ is non-abelian, and not a $2$-group. Moreover, $T(\Gp)$ is not generated by involutions
when $p > 3$. More generally, we develop some aspects of a theory of $T(G)$ for $G$ a finite $p$-group
of class $2$, for $p > 2$. In particular, we show that for such a group $G$ there is an element of order
$p-1$ in $T(G)$, and exhibit examples where $\Size{T(G)} = p - 1$, and others where $T(G)$ contains
a large elementary abelian $p$-subgroup.
