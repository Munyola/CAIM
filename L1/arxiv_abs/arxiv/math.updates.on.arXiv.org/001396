Let $M$ be a compact one--manifold. We prove that the class of finitely generated subgroups of the
group $\mathrm{Diff}^{1+bv}(M)$, the group of $C^1$ orientation preserving diffeomorphisms
of $M$ whose first derivatives have bounded variation, is not closed under taking finite free products.
By contrast, if the level of regularity is decreased to mere continuity, then the corresponding
class of finitely generated groups of homeomorphisms is closed under taking free products. More
precisely, let $G$ be a group which is not virtually metabelian. We show that the group $(G\times\mathbb{Z})*\mathbb{Z}$
is not a subgroup of $\mathrm{Diff}^{1+bv}(M)$. As a corollary, many common groups of homeomorphisms
cannot be realized as groups of $C^{1+bv}$ diffeomorphisms, for example $F*\mathbb{Z}$, where
$F$ denotes Thompson's group $F$. We also complete the classification of right-angled Artin groups
which can act smoothly on $M$ and recover the main result of the joint work of the authors with Baik.
Namely, a right-angled Artin group $A(\Gamma)$ either admits a faithful $C^{\infty}$ action on
$M$, or $A(\Gamma)$ admits no faithful $C^{1+bv}$ action on $M$. In the former case, $A(\Gamma)\cong
A(\Gamma_1)\times\cdots\times A(\Gamma_k)$, where $\Gamma_i$ is possibly empty for $i\geq
2$, and where each connected component of $\Gamma_i$ is complete for $1\leq i\leq k$. Finally, we
develop a hierarchy of right-angled Artin groups, with the levels of the hierarchy corresponding
to the number of semi-conjugacy classes of possible actions of these groups on the circle.
