This paper describes Switch 2.0, an open-source modeling platform for planning transitions to
low-emission electric power grids, designed to satisfy 21st century grid planning requirements.
Switch is capable of long-, medium- and short-term planning of investments and operations with
conventional or smart grids, integrating large shares of renewable power, storage and/or demand
response. Applications include integrated resource planning, investment planning, economic
and policy analyses as well as basic research. Potential users include researchers, educators,
industry and regulators. Switch formulates generation and transmission capacity planning as
a mixed integer linear program where investment and operation are co-optimized across sampled
time series during multiple investment periods. High-resolution production cost modeling is
supported by freezing investment decisions and including longer time series and more operational
details. Modeling features include unit commitment, part-load efficiency, planning and operating
reserves, fuel supply curves, storage, hydroelectric networks, policy constraints and demand
response. Switch has a modular architecture that allows users to flexibly compose models by choosing
built-in modules 'a la carte' or writing custom modules. This paper describes the software architecture
and model formulation of Switch 2.0 and provides a case study in which the model was used to identify
the best options for obtaining load-shifting and reserve services from batteries and demand response
in a 100% renewable power system.
