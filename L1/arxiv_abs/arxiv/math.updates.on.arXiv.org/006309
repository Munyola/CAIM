Robust real-time monitoring of high-dimensional data streams has many important real-world applications
such as industrial quality control, signal detection, biosurveillance, but unfortunately it
is highly non-trivial to develop efficient schemes due to two challenges: (1) the unknown sparse
number or subset of affected data streams and (2) the uncertainty of model specification for high-dimensional
data. In this article, motivated by the detection of smaller persistent changes in the presence
of larger transient outliers, we develop a family of efficient real-time robust detection schemes
for high-dimensional data streams through monitoring feature spaces such as PCA or wavelet coefficients
when the feature coefficients are from Tukey-Huber's gross error models with outliers. We propose
to construct a new local detection statistic for each feature called $L_{\alpha}$-CUSUM statistic
that can reduce the effect of outliers by using the Box-Cox transformation of the likelihood function,
and then raise a global alarm based upon the sum of the soft-thresholding transformation of these
local $L_{\alpha}$-CUSUM statistics so that to filter out unaffected features. In addition, we
propose a new concept called false alarm breakdown point to measure the robustness of online monitoring
schemes, and also characterize the breakdown point of our proposed schemes. Asymptotic analysis,
extensive numerical simulations and case study of nonlinear profile monitoring are conducted
to illustrate the robustness and usefulness of our proposed schemes.
