This paper is concerned with resolvent estimates on the real axis for the Helmholtz equation posed
in the exterior of a bounded obstacle with Dirichlet boundary conditions when the obstacle is trapping.
There are two resolvent estimates for this situation currently in the literature: (i) in the case
of elliptic trapping the general "worst case" bound of exponential growth applies, and examples
show that this growth can be realised through some sequence of wavenumbers, (ii) in the case of hyperbolic
trapping (the prototypical example of which is the Helmholtz equation posed in the exterior of two
strictly convex obstacles) the nontrapping resolvent estimate holds with a logarithmic loss.
This paper proves the first resolvent estimate for parabolic trapping by obstacles, studying a
class of obstacles the prototypical example of which is the exterior of two squares (in 2-d), or two
cubes (in 3-d), whose sides are parallel. We show, via a novel application of Morawetz's identities,
that a resolvent estimate holds with a polynomial loss over the nontrapping estimate. We use this
bound, along with the other trapping resolvent estimates, to prove results about integral-equation
formulations of the boundary value problem in the case of trapping, and to obtain convergence proofs
for standard numerical methods (finite and boundary element methods) applied to these problems,
these are the first wavenumber-explicit proofs of convergence for any numerical method for solving
the Helmholtz equation in the exterior of a trapping obstacle.
