We analyze the effect of adding a weak, localized, inhomogeneity to a two dimensional array of oscillators
with nonlocal coupling. We propose and also justify a model for the phase dynamics in this system.
Our model is a generalization of a viscous eikonal equation that is known to describe the phase modulation
of traveling waves in reaction-diffusion systems. We show the existence of a branch of target pattern
solutions that bifurcates from the spatially homogeneous state when $\varepsilon$, the strength
of the inhomogeneity, is nonzero and we also show that these target patterns have an asymptotic wavenumber
that is small beyond all orders in $\varepsilon$. The strategy of our proof is to pose a good ansatz
for an approximate form of the solution and use the implicit function theorem to prove the existence
of a solution in its vicinity. The analysis presents two challenges. First, the linearization about
the homogeneous state is a convolution operator of diffusive type and hence not invertible on the
usual Sobolev spaces. Second, a regular perturbation expansion in $\varepsilon$ does not provide
a good ansatz for applying the implicit function theorem since the nonlinearities play a major role
in determining the relevant approximation, which also needs to be "correct" to all orders in $\varepsilon$.
We overcome these two points by proving Fredholm properties for the linearization in appropriate
Kondratiev spaces and using a refined ansatz for the approximate solution, which obtained using
matched asymptotics.
