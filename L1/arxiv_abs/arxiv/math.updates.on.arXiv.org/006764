The HANDY model of Motesharrei, Rivas, and Kalnay examines interactions with the environment by
human populations, both between poor and rich people, i.e., "Commoners" and "Elites". The Elites
control the society's wealth and consume it at a higher rate than Commoners, whose work produces
the wealth. We say a model is "Elite-dominated" when the Elites' per capita population change rate
is always at least as large as the Commoners'. We can show the HANDY model always exhibits population
crashes for all choices of parameter values for which it is Elite-dominated. But any such model with
explicit equations raises questions of how the resulting behaviors depend on the details of the
models. How important are the particular design features codified in the differential equations?
In this paper, we first replace the explicit equations of HANDY with differential equations that
are only described conceptually or qualitatively - using only conditions that can be verified for
explicit systems. Next, we discard the equations entirely, replacing them with qualitative conditions,
and we prove these conditions imply population collapse must occur. In particular, one condition
is that the model is Elite-dominated. We show that the HANDY model with Elite-dominated parameters
satisfies our hypotheses and thus must undergo population collapse. Our approach of introducing
qualitative mathematical hypotheses can better show the underlying features of the model that
lead to collapse. We also ask how societies can avoid collapse.
