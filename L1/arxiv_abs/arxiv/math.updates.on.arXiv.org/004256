The boundary behavior of continuous-state branching processes with quadratic competition is
studied in whole generality. We first observe that despite competition, explosion can occur for
certain branching mechanisms. We obtain a necessary and sufficient condition for $\infty$ to be
accessible in terms of the branching mechanism and the competition parameter $c>0$. We show that
when $\infty$ is inaccessible, it is always an entrance boundary. In the case where $\infty$ is accessible,
explosion can occur either by a single jump to $\infty$ (the process at $z$ jumps to $\infty$ at rate
$\lambda z$ for some $\lambda>0$) or by accumulation of large jumps over finite intervals. We construct
a natural extension of the minimal process and show that when $\infty$ is accessible and $0\leq \frac{2\lambda}{c}<1$,
the extended process is reflected at $\infty$. In the case $\frac{2\lambda}{c}\geq 1$, $\infty$
is an exit of the extended process. When the branching mechanism is not the Laplace exponent of a subordinator,
we show that the process with reflection at $\infty$ get extinct almost-surely. Moreover absorption
at $0$ is almost-sure if and only if Grey's condition is satisfied. When the branching mechanism
is the Laplace exponent of a subordinator, necessary and sufficient conditions are given for a stationary
distribution to exist. The Laplace transform of the latter is provided. The study is based on classical
time-change arguments and on a new duality method relating logistic CSBPs with certain generalized
Feller diffusions.
