A graph G is called $(a:b)$-choosable if for any list assignment $L$ which assigns to each vertex
$v$ a set $L(v)$ of $a$ permissible colors, there is a $b$-tuple $L$-coloring of $G$. An $(a:1)$-choosable
graph is also called $a$-choosable. In the pioneering paper on list coloring of graphs by Erd\H{o}s,
Rubin, and Taylor, 2-choosable graphs are characterized. Confirming a special case of a conjecture
in that paper, Tuza and Voigt proved that 2-choosable graphs are $(2m:m)$-choosable for any positive
integer $m$. On the other hand, Voigt proved that if $m$ is an odd integer, then these are the only $(2m:m)$-choosable
graphs; however, when $m$ is even, there are $(2m:m)$-choosable graphs that are not 2-choosable.
A graph is called 3-choosable-critical if it is not 2-choosable, but all its proper subgraphs are
$2$-choosable. Voigt conjectured that for every positive integer $m$, all 3-choosable-critical
bipartite graphs are $(4m:2m)$-choosable. In this paper, we determine which 3-choosable-critical
graphs are $(4:2)$-choosable, refuting Voigt's conjecture in the process. Nevertheless, a weaker
version of the conjecture is true: we prove that there is an even integer $k$ such that for any positive
integer $m$, every 3-choosable-critical bipartite graph is $(2km:km)$-choosable. Moving beyond
3-choosable-critical graphs, we present an infinite family of non-3-choosable-critical graphs
which have been shown by computer analysis to be $(4:2)$-choosable, which shows that the family
of all $(4:2)$-choosable graphs has rich structure.
