We consider the following $k$-coupled nonlinear Schr\"odinger system: \begin{align*} \begin{cases}
&-\Delta u_j + \lambda_j u_j = \mu_j u_j^3 + \sum_{i=1, i\not=j}^k \beta_{i,j} u_i^2 u_j \quad {\rm
in}\ \mathbb{R}^N,\\ &u_j>0 \quad {\rm in}\ \mathbb{R}^N, \quad u_j(x) \to 0 \quad \text{as }|x|\to
+\infty, \quad j=1,2,\cdots,k, \end{cases} \end{align*} where $N\leq 3$, $k\geq3$, $\lambda_j,\mu_j>0$
are constants and $\beta_{i,j}=\beta_{j,i}\not=0$ are parameters. There have been intensive
studies for the above system when $k=2$ or the system is purely attractive ($ \beta_{i,j}>0, \forall
i \not = j$) or purely repulsive ($\beta_{i,j}<0, \forall i\not = j $); however very few results are
available for $k\geq 3$ when the system admits {\bf mixed couplings}, i.e., there exist $(i_1,j_1)$
and $(i_2,j_2)$ such that $\beta_{i_1,j_1}\beta_{i_2,j_2}<0$. In this paper we give the first
systematic and an (almost) complete study on the existence of ground states when the system admits
mixed couplings. We first divide this system into {\bf repulsive-mixed} and {\bf total-mixed}
cases. In the first case we prove nonexistence of ground states. In the second case we give an necessary
condition for the existence of ground states and also provide estimates for the Morse index. The
key idea is the {\bf block decomposition} of the system ({\bf optimal block decompositions, eventual
block decompositions}), and the measure of total interaction forces between different {\bf blocks}.
Finally the assumptions on the existence of ground states are shown to be {\bf optimal} in some special
cases.
