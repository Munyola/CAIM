Millimeter-wave (mmWave) cloud radio access networks (CRANs) provide new opportunities for accurate
cooperative localization, in which large bandwidths, large antenna arrays, and increased densities
of base stations allow for their unparalleled delay and angular resolution. Combining localization
into communications and designing simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithms are
challenging problems. This study considers the joint position and velocity estimation and environment
mapping problem in a three-dimensional mmWave CRAN architecture. We first embed cooperative localization
into communications and establish the joint estimation and mapping model with hybrid delay and
angle measurements. Then, we propose a closed-form weighted least square (WLS) solution for the
joint estimation and mapping problems. The proposed WLS estimator is proven asymptotically unbiased
and confirmed by simulations as effective in achieving the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) and the
desired decimeter-level accuracy. Furthermore, we propose a WLS-Net-based SLAM algorithm by
embedding neural networks into the proposed WLS estimators to replace the linear approximations.
The solution possesses both powerful learning ability of the neural network and robustness of the
proposed geometric model, and the ensemble learning is applied to further improve positioning
accuracy. A public ray-tracing dataset is used in the simulations to test the performance of the
WLS-Net-based SLAM algorithm, which is proven fast and effective in attaining the centimeter-level
accuracy.
