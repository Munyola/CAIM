We present a solution of the algebraic version of Birkhoff Conjecture on integrable billiards.
Namely we show that every polynomially integrable real bounded convex planar billiard with smooth
boundary is an ellipse. We also extend this result to the case of piecewise-smooth and not necessarily
convex polynomially integrable billiards: we show that the boundary is a union of confocal conical
arcs and straight-line segments lying in some special lines defined by the foci. We also present
a complexification of these results. The proof, which is obtained by Mikhail Bialy, Andrey Mironov
and the author, is split into two parts. The first part is the paper by Bialy and Mironov, where they
prove the following theorems: 1) the polar duality transforms a polynomially integrable planar
billiard to a rationally integrable angular billiard; 2) the singularities and inflection points
of each irreducible component of the complexified curve polar-dual to the billiard boundary lie
in the two complex isotropic lines through the origin; 3) the Hessian Formula: appropriately defined
Hessian of the integral of the angular billiard being restricted to the curve polar-dual to the boundary
is a constant multiple of a power $(x^2+y^2)^s$. The present paper provides the second part of the
proof. Namely, we prove that each irreducible component of the polar-dual curve that is not a line
is a conic. This together with S.V.Bolotin's theorem implies the main results: solution of the Algebraic
Birkhoff Conjecture in both convex smooth and non-convex piecewise smooth cases.
