We consider the random directed graph $\vec{G}(n,p)$ with vertex set $\{1,2,\ldots,n\}$ in which
each of the $n(n-1)$ possible directed edges is present independently with probability $p$. We
are interested in the strongly connected components of this directed graph. A phase transition
for the emergence of a giant strongly connected component is known to occur at $p = 1/n$, with critical
window $p= 1/n + \lambda n^{-4/3}$ for $\lambda \in \mathcal{R}$. We show that, within this critical
window, the strongly connected components of $\vec{G}(n,p)$, ranked in decreasing order of size
and rescaled by $n^{-1/3}$, converge in distribution to a sequence $(\mathcal{C}_1,\mathcal{C}_2,\ldots)$
of finite strongly connected directed multigraphs with edge lengths which are either 3-regular
or loops. The convergence occurs the sense of an $\ell^1$ sequence metric for which two directed
multigraphs are close if there are compatible isomorphisms between their vertex and edge sets which
roughly preserve the edge-lengths. Our proofs rely on a depth-first exploration of the graph which
enables us to relate the strongly connected components to a particular spanning forest of the undirected
Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graph $G(n,p)$, whose scaling limit is well understood. We show that
the limiting sequence $(\mathcal{C}_1,\mathcal{C}_2,\ldots)$ contains only finitely many
components which are not loops. If we ignore the edge lengths, any fixed finite sequence of 3-regular
strongly connected directed multigraphs occurs with positive probability.
