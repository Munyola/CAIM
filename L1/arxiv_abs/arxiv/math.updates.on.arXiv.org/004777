We construct optimal arrangements in the sets of purity-limited classical or quantum states on
a finite-dimensional Hilbert space. In more concrete mathematical terms, we consider a set of trace-normalized
non-negative operators in a Hilbert-Schmidt ball of a given radius that maximize their mutual Hilbert-Schmidt
distance. The radius of the ball bounds the purity of a state and raises its mimimal rank. Classical
states are understood to be represented by diagonal matrices, with the diagonal entries forming
a probability vector. We also introduce the concept of spectrahedron arrangements which provides
a unified framework for classical and quantum arrangements and the flexibility to define new types
of optimal packings. As in a prior work, we combine combinatorial structures and line packings associated
with frames to arrive at the optimal arrangements of higher-rank quantum states. One new construction
that is presented involves generating an optimal arrangement we call a Gabor-Steiner equiangular
tight frame as the orbit of a projective representation of the Weyl-Heisenberg group over any finite
abelian group. The minimal sets of linearly dependent vectors, the so-called binder, of the Gabor-Steiner
equiangular tight frames are then characterized; under certain conditions these form combinatorial
block designs and in one case generate a new class of block designs. The projections onto the span
of minimal linearly dependent sets in the Gabor-Steiner equiangular tight frame are then used to
generate further optimal arrangements of higher-rank quantum states.
