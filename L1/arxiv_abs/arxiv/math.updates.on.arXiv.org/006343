A result (Corollary 4.3) in an article by Uhlenbeck (1985) asserts that the $W^{1,p}$-distance
between the gauge-equivalence class of a connection $A$ and the moduli subspace of flat connections
$M(P)$ on a principal $G$-bundle $P$ over a closed Riemannian manifold $X$ of dimension $d\geq 2$
is bounded by a constant times the $L^p$ norm of the curvature, $\|F_A\|_{L^p(X)}$, when $G$ is a
compact Lie group, $F_A$ is $L^p$-small, and $p>d/2$. While we prove that this estimate holds when
the Yang-Mills energy function on the space of Sobolev connections is Morse-Bott along the moduli
subspace $M(P)$ of flat connections, it does not hold when the Yang-Mills energy function fails
to be Morse-Bott, such as at the product connection in the moduli space of flat $\mathrm{SU}(2)$
connections over a real two-dimensional torus. However, we prove that a useful modification of
Uhlenbeck's estimate always holds provided one replaces $\|F_A\|_{L^p(X)}$ by a suitable power
$\|F_A\|_{L^p(X)}^\lambda$, where the positive exponent $\lambda$ reflects the structure of
non-regular points in $M(P)$. The proof of our refinement involves gradient flow and Morse theory
for the Yang-Mills energy function on the quotient space of Sobolev connections and a Lojasiewicz
distance inequality for the Yang-Mills energy function. A special case of our estimate, when $X$
has dimension four and the connection $A$ is anti-self-dual, was proved by Fukaya (1998) by entirely
different methods. Lastly, we prove that if $A$ is a smooth Yang-Mills connection with small enough
energy, then $A$ is necessarily flat.
