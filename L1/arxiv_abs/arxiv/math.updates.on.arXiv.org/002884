Let $M$ be a Riemannian manifold with a smooth boundary. The main question we address in this article
is: "When is the Laplace-Beltrami operator $\Delta\colon H^{k+1}(M)\cap H^1_0(M) \to H^{k-1}(M)$,
$k\in \mathbb{N}_0$, invertible?" We consider also the case of mixed boundary conditions. The
study of this main question leads us to the class of manifolds with boundary and bounded geometry
introduced by Schick (Math. Nach. 2001). We begin with some needed results on the geometry of manifolds
with boundary and bounded geometry. Let $\partial_D M \subset \partial M$ be an open and closed subset
of the boundary of $M$. We say that $(M, \partial_D M)$ has \emph{finite width} if, by definition,
$M$ is a manifold with boundary and bounded geometry such that the distance $d(x, \partial_D M)$
from a point $x \in M$ to $\partial_D M \subset \partial M$ is bounded uniformly in $x$ (and hence,
in particular, $\partial_D M$ intersects all connected components of $M$). For manifolds $(M,
\partial_D M)$ with finite width, we prove a Poincar\'e inequality for functions vanishing on $\partial_D
M$, thus generalizing an important result of Sakurai (Osaka J. Math, 2017). The Poincar\'e inequality
then leads, as in the classical case to results on the spectrum of $\Delta$ with domain given by mixed
boundary conditions, in particular, $\Delta$ is invertible for manifolds $(M, \partial_D M)$
with finite width. The bounded geometry assumption then allows us to prove the well-posedness of
the Poisson problem with mixed boundary conditions in higher Sobolev spaces $H^s(M)$, $s \ge 0$.
