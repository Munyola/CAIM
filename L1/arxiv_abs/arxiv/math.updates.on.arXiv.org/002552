Modeling the dynamics of biological networks introduces many challenges, among them the lack of
first principle models, the size of the networks, and difficulties with parameterization. Discrete
time Boolean networks and related continuous time switching systems provide a computationally
accessible way to translate the structure of the network to predictions about the dynamics. Recent
work has shown that the parameterized dynamics of switching systems can be captured by a combinatorial
object, called a DSGRN database, that consists of a parameter graph characterizing a finite parameter
space decomposition, whose nodes are assigned a Morse graph that captures global dynamics for all
corresponding parameters. We show that for a given network there is a way to associate the same type
of object by considering a continuous time ODE system with a continuous right-hand side, which we
call an L-system. The main goal of this paper is to compare the two DSGRN databases for the same network.
Since the L-systems can be thought of as perturbations (not necessarily small) of the switching
systems, our results address the correspondence between global parameterized dynamics of switching
systems and their perturbations. We show that, at corresponding parameters, there is an order preserving
map from the Morse graph of the switching system to that of the L-system that is surjective on the set
of attractors and bijective on the set of fixed point attractors. We provide important examples
showing why this correspondence cannot be strengthened.
