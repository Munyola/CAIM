Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) has become one of the major tools of likelihood-free statistical
inference in complex mathematical models. Simultaneously, stochastic differential equations
(SDEs) have developed to an established tool for modelling time dependent, real world phenomena
with underlying random effects. When applying ABC to stochastic processes, two major difficulties
arise. First, different realisations from the output process with the same choice of parameters
may show a large variability due to the stochasticity of the model. Second, exact simulation schemes
are rarely available, requiring the derivation of suitable numerical methods for the synthetic
data generation. To reduce the randomness in the data coming from the SDE, we propose to build up the
statistical method (e.g., the choice of the summary statistics) on the underlying structural properties
of the model. Here, we focus on the existence of an invariant measure and we map the data to their estimated
invariant density and invariant spectral density. Then, to ensure that the model properties are
kept in the synthetic data generation, we adopt a structure-preserving numerical scheme. The derived
property-based and measure-preserving ABC method is illustrated on the broad class of partially
observed Hamiltonian SDEs, both with simulated data and with real electroencephalography (EEG)
data. The proposed ABC method can be directly applied to all SDEs that are characterised by an invariant
distribution and for which a measure-preserving numerical method can be derived.
