We develop a provably energy stable discontinuous Galerkin spectral element method (DGSEM) approximation
of the perfectly matched layer (PML) for the three and two space dimensional (3D and 2D) linear acoustic
wave equations, in first order form, subject to well-posed linear boundary conditions. First,
using the well-known complex coordinate stretching, we derive an efficient un-split modal PML
for the 3D acoustic wave equation. Second, we prove asymptotic stability of the continuous PML by
deriving energy estimates in the Laplace space, for the 3D PML in a heterogeneous acoustic medium,
assuming piece-wise constant PML damping. Third, we develop a DGSEM for the wave equation using
physically motivated numerical flux, with penalty weights, which are compatible with all well-posed,
internal and external, boundary conditions. When the PML damping vanishes, by construction, our
choice of penalty parameters yield an upwind scheme and a discrete energy estimate analogous to
the continuous energy estimate. Fourth, to ensure numerical stability when PML damping is present,
it is necessary to systematically extend the numerical numerical fluxes, and the inter-element
and boundary procedures, to the PML auxiliary differential equations. This is critical for deriving
discrete energy estimates analogous to the continuous energy estimates. Finally, we propose a
procedure to compute PML damping coefficients such that the PML error converges to zero, at the optimal
convergence rate of the underlying numerical method. Numerical experiments are presented in 2D
and 3D corroborating the theoretical results.
