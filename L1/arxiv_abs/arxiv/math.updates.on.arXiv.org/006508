Let $p$ be an odd prime, $\mathbb{F}$ a finite field of characteristic $p$ and let $\bar{\rho}:\text{G}_{\mathbb{Q}}\rightarrow
\text{GL}_2(\mathbb{F})$ be a continuous Galois representation. Denote by $\bar{\chi}$ the
mod $p$ cyclotomic character. We assume that the local representation $\bar{\rho}_{\restriction
\text{G}_{\mathbb{Q}_p}}$ is flat and irreducible and $\text{det}\bar{\rho}=\bar{\chi}$.
The celebrated theorem of Khare and Wintenberger asserts that if $\bar{\rho}$ satisfies some natural
conditions, there exists a normalized Hecke-eigenform $f=\sum_{n\geq 1} a_n q^n$ and a prime $\mathfrak{p}|p$
in its field of Fourier coefficients such that the associated $\mathfrak{p}$-adic representation
${\rho}_{f,\mathfrak{p}}$ lifts $\bar{\rho}$. In this manuscript we prove a refined lifting
theorem. Let $\iota_{\mathfrak{p}}$ be the inclusion of the field of Fourier coefficients $\mathbb{Q}(f)$
of $f$ into $\mathbb{Q}(f)_{\mathfrak{p}}$ and let $v_p$ be a $p$-adic valuation on $\bar{\mathbb{Q}}_p$
normalized by $v_p(p)=1$. We show that for any choice of $\lambda\in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 1}$, there
exists a cuspidal Hecke eigenform $f$ of weight $2$ over $\Gamma_1(N)$ for $(N,p)=1$ and a prime
$\mathfrak{p}|p$ such that $v_p(\iota_{\mathfrak{p}}(a_p))=\lambda$ and the residual representation
$\bar{\rho}$ lifts to $\rho_{f,\mathfrak{p}}$. Thus all slopes $\mathbb{Z}_{\geq 1}\subset
\mathbb{Q}_{>0}$ are realized as we vary over all Galois representations associated to cuspidal
Hecke eigenforms which lift $\bar{\rho}$.
