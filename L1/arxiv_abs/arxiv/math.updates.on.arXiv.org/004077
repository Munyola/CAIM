Donaldon constructed a hyperk\"ahler moduli space $\mathcal{M}$ associated to a closed oriented
surface $\Sigma$ with $\textrm{genus}(\Sigma) \geq 2$. This embeds naturally into the cotangent
bundle $T^*\mathcal{T}(\Sigma)$ of Teichm\"uller space or can be identified with the almost-Fuchsian
moduli space associated to $\Sigma$. The later is the moduli space of quasi-Fuchsian threefolds
which contain a unique incompressible minimal surface with principal curvatures in $(-1,1)$.
Donaldson outlined various remarkable properties of this moduli space for which we provide complete
proofs in this paper: On the cotangent-bundle of Teichm\"uller space, the hyperk\"ahler structure
on $\mathcal{M}$ can be viewed as the Feix--Kaledin hyperk\"ahler extension of the Weil--Petersson
metric. The almost-Fuchsian moduli space embeds into the $\textrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{C})$-representation
variety of $\Sigma$ and the hyperk\"ahler structure on $\mathcal{M}$ extends the Goldman holomorphic
symplectic structure. Here the natural complex structure corresponds to the second complex structure
in the first picture. Moreover, the area of the minimal surface in an almost-Fuchsian manifold provides
a K\"ahler potential for the hyperk\"ahler metric. The various identifications are obtained using
the work of Uhlenbeck on germs of hyperbolic $3$-manifolds, an explicit map from $\mathcal{M}$
to $\mathcal{T}(\Sigma)\times \overline{\mathcal{T}(\Sigma)}$ found by Hodge, the simultaneous
uniformization theorem of Bers, and the theory of Higgs bundles introduced by Hitchin.
