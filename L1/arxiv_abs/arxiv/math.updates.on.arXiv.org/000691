We will present qualitative and numerical results on a partial differential equation (PDE) system
which models a certain fluid-structure dynamics. The wellposedness of this PDE model is established
by means of constructing for it a nonstandard semigroup generator representation; this representation
is essentially accomplished by an appropriate elimination of the pressure. This coupled PDE model
involves the Stokes system which evolves on a three dimensional domain $\mathcal{O}$ being coupled
to a fourth order plate equation, possibly with rotational inertia parameter $\rho >0$, which
evolves on a flat portion $\Omega$ of the boundary of $\mathcal{O}$. The coupling on $\Omega$ is
implemented via the Dirichlet trace of the Stokes system fluid variable - and so the no-slip condition
is necessarily not in play - and via the Dirichlet boundary trace of the pressure, which essentially
acts as a forcing term on this elastic portion of the boundary. We note here that inasmuch as the Stokes
fluid velocity does not vanish on $\Omega$, the pressure variable cannot be eliminated by the classic
Leray projector; instead, the pressure is identified as the solution of a certain elliptic boundary
value problem. Eventually, wellposedness of this fluid-structure dynamics is attained through
a certain nonstandard variational (``inf-sup") formulation. Subsequently we show how our constructive
proof of wellposedness naturally gives rise to a certain mixed finite element method for numerically
approximating solutions of this fluid-structure dynamics.
