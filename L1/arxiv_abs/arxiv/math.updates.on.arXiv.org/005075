In this paper we study the evolution problem \[ \left\lbrace\begin{array}{ll} u_t (x,t)- \lambda_j(D^2
u(x,t)) = 0, & \text{in } \Omega\times (0,+\infty), \\ u(x,t) = g(x,t), & \text{on } \partial \Omega
\times (0,+\infty), \\ u(x,0) = u_0(x), & \text{in } \Omega, \end{array}\right. \] where $\Omega$
is a bounded domain in $\mathbb{R}^N$ (that verifies a suitable geometric condition on its boundary)
and $\lambda_j(D^2 u)$ stands for the $j-$st eigenvalue of the Hessian matrix $D^2u$. We assume
that $u_0 $ and $g$ are continuous functions with the compatibility condition $u_0(x) = g(x,0)$,
$x\in \partial \Omega$. We show that the (unique) solution to this problem exists in the viscosity
sense and can be approximated by the value function of a two-player zero-sum game as the parameter
measuring the size of the step that we move in each round of the game goes to zero. In addition, when
the boundary datum is independent of time, $g(x,t) =g(x)$, we show that viscosity solutions to this
evolution problem stabilize and converge exponentially fast to the unique stationary solution
as $t\to \infty$. For $j=1$ the limit profile is just the convex envelope inside $\Omega$ of the boundary
datum $g$, while for $j=N$ it is the concave envelope. We obtain this result with two different techniques:
with PDE tools and and with game theoretical arguments. Moreover, in some special cases (for affine
boundary data) we can show that solutions coincide with the stationary solution in finite time (that
depends only on $\Omega$ and not on the initial condition $u_0$).
