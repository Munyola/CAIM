We found in 2016 a few results on the mathematical structure of the conformal Killing differential
sequence in arbitrary dimension $n$, in particular the rank and order changes of the successive
differential operators for $n=3,n=4$ or $n\geq 5$. They were so striking that we did not dare to publish
them before our former PhD student A. Quadrat (INRIA) could confirm them while using new computer
algebra packages that he developped for studying extension modules in differential homological
algebra. In the meantime, as a complementary result, we found in 2017 the "missing link" justifying
the doubts we had since a long time on the origin and existence of Gravitational Waves in General Relativity.
In both cases, the main tool is the explicit computation of certain extension modules for the classical
or conformal Killing differential sequences. These results therefore lead to revisit the work
of C. Lanczos and successors on the existence of a parametrization of the Riemann or Weyl operators
and their respective formal adjoint operators. We also provide an example showing how these extension
modules are depending on the structure constants appearing in the Vessiot structure equations
(1903), still not acknowledged after one century even though they generalize the constant Riemannian
curvature integrability condition of L.P. Eisenhart (1926) for the Killing equations. The present
paper is written from a lecture gven at the recent 24 th conference on Applications of Computer Algebra
(ACA 2018) held in Santiago de Compostela, Spain, june 18-22, 2018.
