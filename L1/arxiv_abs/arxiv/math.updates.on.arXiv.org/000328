Many natural simulation tasks, such as generating a partition of a large integer $n$, choosing uniformly
over the $p_n$ conceivable choices, might be done by proposing a random object from a larger set,
and then checking for membership in the desired target set. The success probability, i.e., the probability
that a proposed random object hits the target, may be very small. The cost of this simple strategy,
waiting-to-get-lucky, is the reciprocal of the small probability. The usual method of rare event
simulation, the exponential shift or Cram\'er twist, is analogous to the saddle point method, and
can remove the exponentially decaying part of the success probability. But even after this, the
success probability may still be so small as to be an obstacle to simulation. Here, we propose a new
method, probabilistic divide-and-conquer, for dealing with the remaining small probability.
For the example of integer partitions, there is an ideal recursive scheme, which improves the remaining
cost from asymptotically order $n^{3/4}$ to O(1). There are other examples, including $k$-cores,
set partitions, and plane partitions, for which there is no recursive scheme, but nevertheless
a one-time application of divide-and-conquer, with a "trivial second half," removes a substantial
fraction of the remaining cost. The cost of traditional sampling is linear in the number of samples.
Another variation of the probabilistic divide-and-conquer idea exploits features of the coupon
collector's problem, and has cost that is sublinear in the number of samples.
