A random set is a generalisation of a random variable, i.e. a set-valued random variable. The random
set theory allows a unification of other uncertainty descriptions such as interval variable, mass
belief function in Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence, possibility theory, and set of probability
distributions. The aim of this work is to develop a non-deterministic inference framework, including
theory, approximation and sampling method, that deals with the inverse problems in which uncertainty
is represented using random sets. The proposed inference method yields the posterior random set
based on the intersection of the prior and the measurement induced random sets. That inference method
is an extension of Dempster's rule of combination, and a generalisation of Bayesian inference as
well. A direct evaluation of the posterior random set might be impractical. We approximate the posterior
random set by a random discrete set whose domain is the set of samples generated using a proposed probability
distribution. We use the capacity transform density function of the posterior random set for this
proposed distribution. This function has a special property: it is the posterior density function
yielded by Bayesian inference of the capacity transform density function of the prior random set.
The samples of such proposed probability distribution can be directly obtained using the methods
developed in the Bayesian inference framework. With this approximation method, the evaluation
of the posterior random set becomes tractable.
