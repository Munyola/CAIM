Approximate Bayesian computing is a powerful likelihood-free method that has grown increasingly
popular since early applications in population genetics. However, complications arise in the
theoretical justification for Bayesian inference conducted from this method with a non-sufficient
summary statistic. In this paper, we seek to re-frame approximate Bayesian computing within a frequentist
context and justify its performance by standards set on the frequency coverage rate. In doing so,
we develop a new computational technique called approximate confidence distribution computing,
yielding theoretical support for the use of non-sufficient summary statistics in likelihood-free
methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate that approximate confidence distribution computing extends
the scope of approximate Bayesian computing to include data-dependent priors without damaging
the inferential integrity. This data-dependent prior can be viewed as an initial "distribution
estimate" of the target parameter which is updated with the results of the approximate confidence
distribution computing method. A general strategy for constructing an appropriate data-dependent
prior is also discussed and is shown to often increase the computing speed while maintaining statistical
guarantees. We supplement the theory with simulation studies illustrating the benefits of the
confidence distribution method, namely the potential for broader applications than the Bayesian
method and the increased computing speed compared to approximate Bayesian computing.
