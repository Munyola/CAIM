The minimum-cost mass transport problem for a set of discrete probability measures, called the
discrete barycenter problem, can be solved exactly using exponential-sized linear programs.
In applications, the support sets of the probability measures have two common settings that exhibit
the extremes of the problem's complexity: all support points lie on the same regular grid, or all
support points are unique and dispersed without structure. In the first, best-case setting, the
discrete barycenter problem is well understood and solvable through a polynomial-sized linear
program. We are interested in the second, worst-case setting, in which the underlying linear program
is exponential in the number of variables, but contains an extremely low number of constraints,
making it a prime candidate for column generation. In this paper, we devise a column generation strategy
for this setting through a Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition of the underlying linear program. We produce
an efficiently solvable pricing problem - a classical transportation problem - by assigning all
constraints associated with exactly two measures to the pricing problem. We give a vertex formulation
for the master problem, and describe two efficient methods for constructing an initial feasible
restricted master problem. Further, we use the structure of the constraints for a memory-efficient
implementation of both the pricing and the master problem. We conclude with some computational
experiments, demonstrating significant improvement in the memory requirements and running times
compared to a computation using the full linear program.
