This paper is about how to partition decision variables while decomposing a large-scale optimization
problem for the best performance of distributed solution methods. Solving a large-scale optimization
problem sequen- tially can be computationally challenging. One classic approach is to decompose
the problem into smaller sub-problems and solve them in a distributed fashion. However, there is
little discussion in the literature on which variables should be grouped together to form the sub-problems,
especially when the optimization formulation involves complex constraints. We focus on one of
the most popular distributed approaches, dual decomposition and distributed sub-gradient methods.
Based on a theoretical guarantee on its convergence rate, we explain that a partition of variables
can critically affect the speed of convergence and highlight the importance of the number of dualized
constraints. Then, we introduce a novel approach to find a partition that reduces the number of dualized
constraints by utilizing a community detection algorithm from physics literature. Roughly speaking,
the proposed method groups decision variables that appear together in con- straints and solves
the resulting sub-problems with blocks of variables in parallel. Empirical experiments on a real
application show that the proposed method significantly accelerates the convergence of the distributed
sub-gradient method. The advantage of our approach becomes more significant as the size of the problem
increases and each constraint involves more variables.
