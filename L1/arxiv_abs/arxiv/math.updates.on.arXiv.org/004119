Many-body perturbation theory (MBPT) is widely used in quantum physics, chemistry, and materials
science. At the heart of MBPT is the Feynman diagrammatic expansion, which is, simply speaking,
an elegant way of organizing the combinatorially growing number of terms of a certain Taylor expansion.
In particular, the construction of the `bold Feynman diagrammatic expansion' involves the partial
resummation to infinite order of possibly divergent series of diagrams. This procedure demands
investigation from both the combinatorial (perturbative) and the analytical (non-perturbative)
viewpoints. In Part I of this two-part series, we illustrate how the combinatorial properties of
Feynman diagrams in MBPT can be studied in the simplified setting of Gibbs measures (known as the
Euclidean lattice field theory in the physics literature) and provide a self-contained explanation
of Feynman diagrams in this setting. We prove the combinatorial validity of the bold diagrammatic
expansion, with methods generalizable to several types of field theories and interactions. Our
treatment simplifies the presentation and numerical study of known techniques in MBPT such as the
self-consistent Hartree-Fock approximation (HF), the second-order Green's function approximation
(GF2), and the GW approximation. The bold diagrams are closely related to the Luttinger-Ward (LW)
formalism, which was proposed in 1960 but whose analytic properties have not been rigorously established.
The analytical study of the LW formalism in the setting of Gibbs measures will be the topic of Part
II.
