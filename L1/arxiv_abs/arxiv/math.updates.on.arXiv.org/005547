In this paper we derive new sufficient conditions for a linear system matrix $$S(\lambda):=\left[\begin{array}{ccc}
T(\lambda) & -U(\lambda) \\ V(\lambda) & W(\lambda) \end{array}\right],$$ where $T(\lambda)$
is assumed regular, to be strongly irreducible. In particular, we introduce the notion of strong
minimality, and the corresponding conditions are shown to be sufficient for a polynomial system
matrix to be strongly minimal. A strongly irreducible or minimal system matrix has the same structural
elements as the rational matrix $R(\lambda)= W(\lambda) + V(\lambda)T(\lambda)^{-1}U(\lambda)$,
which is also known as the transfer function connected to the system matrix $S(\lambda)$. The pole
structure, zero structure and null space structure of $R(\lambda)$ can be then computed with the
staircase algorithm and the $QZ$ algorithm applied to pencils derived from $S(\lambda)$. We also
show how to derive a strongly minimal system matrix from an arbitrary linear system matrix by applying
to it a reduction procedure, that only uses unitary equivalence transformations. This implies
that numerical errors performed during the reduction procedure remain bounded. Finally, we show
how to perform diagonal scalings to an arbitrary pencil such that its row and column norms are all
of the order of 1. Combined with the fact that we use unitary transformation in both the reduction
procedure and the computation of the eigenstructure, this guarantees that we computed the exact
eigenstructure of a perturbed linear system matrix, but where the perturbation is of the order of
the machine precision.
