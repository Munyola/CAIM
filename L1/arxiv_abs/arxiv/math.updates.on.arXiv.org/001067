In this paper we show that if a K\"ahler manifold is furnished with a closed conformal vector field,
then, in suitable open subsets, its K\"ahler structure can be deformed into a different one. This
deformation can be applied to the whole class of K\"ahler manifolds that arise as Riemannian cones
over Sasaki manifolds, and gives an infinite family of new examples of K\"ahler manifolds, in each
complex dimension greater than $2$. Moreover, if we deform the K\"ahler metric of the cone over an
Einstein-Sasaki manifold, then a particular class of such deformations presents the same phenomenon
of sectional holomorphic curvature decay that takes place when we deform the metric of the complex
Euclidean space into that of the complex hyperbolic space. We also establish the completeness of
the new K\"ahler metric in sufficient generality to encompass all of the above examples. Back to
the general example of the Riemannian cone over a Sasaki manifold, we prove that, as a hypersurface
of the cone furnished with its new K\"ahler structure, the Sasaki manifold has parallel mean curvature
vector. Finally, we stress that all of the above can be applied to the Riemannian cones over the two
infinite families of Einstein-Sasaki manifolds constructed by Cvetic, Lu, Page and Pope, one in
dimension $5$ and the other in each odd dimension greater than $5$. This way, we get two infinite families
of new examples of complete K\"ahler manifolds, one in complex dimension $3$ and the other in each
complex dimension greater than $3$.
