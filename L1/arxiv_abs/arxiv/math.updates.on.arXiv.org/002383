In the article we present a general theory of augmented Lagrangian functions for cone constrained
optimization problems that allows one to study almost all known augmented Lagrangians for cone
constrained programs within a unified framework. We develop a new general method for proving the
existence of global saddle points of augmented Lagrangian functions, called the localization
principle. The localization principle unifies, generalizes and sharpens most of the known results
on existence of global saddle points, and, in essence, reduces the problem of the existence of saddle
points to a local analysis of optimality conditions. With the use of the localization principle
we obtain first necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a global saddle point of
an augmented Lagrangian for cone constrained minimax problems via both second and first order optimality
conditions. In the second part of the paper, we present a general approach to the construction of
globally exact augmented Lagrangian functions. The general approach developed in this paper allowed
us not only to sharpen most of the existing results on globally exact augmented Lagrangians, but
also to construct first globally exact augmented Lagrangian functions for equality constrained
optimization problems, for nonlinear second order cone programs and for nonlinear semidefinite
programs. These globally exact augmented Lagrangians can be utilized in order to design new superlinearly
(or even quadratically) convergent optimization methods for cone constrained optimization problems.
