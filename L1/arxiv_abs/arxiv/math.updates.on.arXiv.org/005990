This work presents a new network optimization framework for cellular networks using neighborhood-based
optimization. Under this optimization framework resources are allocated within virtual cells
encompassing several base-stations and the users within their coverage areas. We form the virtual
cells using hierarchical clustering with a minimax linkage criterion given a particular number
of such cells. Once the virtual cells are formed, we consider an interference coordination model
in which base-stations in a virtual cell jointly allocate the channels and power to users within
the virtual cell. We propose two new schemes for solving this mixed integer NP-hard resource allocation
problem. The first scheme transforms the problem into a continuous variables problem; the second
scheme proposes a new channel allocation method and then alternately solves the channel allocation
problem using this new method, and the power allocation problem. We evaluate the average system
sum rate of these schemes for a variable number of virtual cells. These results quantify the sum-rate
along a continuum of fully-centralized versus fully-distributed optimization for different
clustering and resource allocation strategies. These results indicate that the penalty of fully-distributed
optimization versus fully-centralized (cloud RAN) can be as high as 50%. However, if designed properly,
a few base stations within a virtual cell using neighborhood-based optimization have almost the
same performance as fully-centralized optimization.
