Miculescu and Mihail in 2008 introduced a concept of a generalized iterated function system (GIFS
in short), a particular extension of classical IFS. Instead of families of selfmaps of a metric space
$X$, they considered families of mappings defined on finite Cartesian product $X^m$. It turned
out that a great part of the classical Hutchinson--Barnsley theory has natural counterpart in this
GIFSs' case. Recently, Secelean extended these considerations to mappings defined on the space
$\ell_\infty(X)$ of all bounded sequences of elements of $X$ and obtained versions of the Hutchinson--Barnsley
theorem for appropriate families of such functions. In the paper we study some further aspects of
Secelean's setting. In particular, we introduce and investigate a bit more restrictive framework
and we show that some problems of the theory have more natural solutions within such a case. Finally,
we present an example which shows that this extended theory of GIFSs gives us fractal sets that cannot
be obtained by any IFSs or even by any GIFSs.%In a recent paper of the authors and Jachymski we itroduced
fixed point theory for mappings defined on $\ell_\infty(X)$ product of a metric space $X$. In this
note we use this approach to study a version of Hutchinson--Barnsley theory of fractals for function
systems consisting of such mappings. In particular, we generalize the earlier concept of generalized
generated function systems introduced by Mihail and Miculescu in 2008, in which mappings defined
on finite Cartesian product are considered, and compare our approach with the one introduced recently
by Secelean.
