Mean field games (MFGs) describe the limit, as $n$ tends to infinity, of stochastic differential
games with $n$ players interacting with one another through their common empirical distribution.
Under suitable smoothness assumptions that guarantee uniqueness of the MFG equilibrium, a form
of law of large of numbers (LLN), also known as propagation of chaos, has been established to show
that the MFG equilibrium arises as the limit of the sequence of empirical measures of the $n$-player
game Nash equilibria, including the case when player dynamics are driven by both idiosyncratic
and common sources of noise. The proof of convergence relies on the so-called master equation for
the value function of the MFG, a partial differential equation on the space of probability measures.
In this work, under additional assumptions, we establish a functional central limit theorem (CLT)
that characterizes the limiting fluctuations around the LLN limit as the unique solution of a linear
stochastic PDE. The key idea is to use the solution to the master equation to construct an associated
McKean-Vlasov interacting $n$-particle system that is sufficiently close to the Nash equilibrium
dynamics of the $n$-player game for large $n$. We then derive the CLT for the latter from the CLT for
the former. Along the way, we obtain a new multidimensional CLT for McKean-Vlasov systems. We also
illustrate the broader applicability of our methodology by applying it to establish a CLT for a specific
linear-quadratic example that does not satisfy our main assumptions, and we explicitly solve the
resulting stochastic PDE in this case.
