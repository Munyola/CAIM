In this paper we investigate the problem of order batching for picker routing. Our approach is applicable
to warehouses (storage areas) arranged in the standard rectangular grid layout, so with parallel
aisles and two or more cross-aisles. The motivation underlying our work is online grocery shopping
in which orders may be composed of dozens of items. The approach presented directly addresses order
batching, but uses a distance approximation to influence the batching of orders without directly
addressing the routing problem. We present a basic formulation based on deciding the orders to be
batched together so as to optimise an objective that approximates the picker routing distance travelled
(both the distance travelled within aisles and the distance travelled within cross-aisles). We
extend our formulation by improving the cross-aisle distance approximation for cases where we
have more than one block in the warehouse. We also extend the aisle distance approximation and present
constraints to remove symmetry in order to lessen the computational effort required. Once order
batching has been decided we optimally route each individual picker using a previous approach presented
in the literature. Publicly available test problems involving up to 30 orders are solved using our
distance approximation formulation to proven optimality. We consider both single and multiple
block warehouse configurations. Our results indicate that our distance approximation approach
yields very good estimates of the underlying routing distance, and hence very good assignments
of orders to batches.
