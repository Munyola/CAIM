We analyze a random algorithm for numerical integration of $d$-variate functions from weighted
Sobolev spaces with dominating mixed smoothness $\alpha\ge 0$ and product weights $1\ge\gamma_1\ge\gamma_2\ge\cdots>0$.
The algorithm is based on rank-$1$ lattice rules with a random number of points~$n$. For the case
$\alpha>1/2$, we prove that the algorithm achieves almost the optimal order of convergence of $\mathcal{O}(n^{-\alpha-1/2})$,
where the implied constant is independent of~$d$ if the weights satisfy $\sum_{j=1}^\infty \gamma_j^{1/\alpha}<\infty$.
The same rate of convergence holds for the more general case $\alpha>0$ by adding a random shift to
the lattice rule with random $n$. This shows, in particular, that the exponent of strong tractability
in the randomized setting equals $1/(\alpha+1/2)$, if the weights decay fast enough. We obtain
a lower bound to indicate that our results are essentially optimal. This paper is a significant advancement
over previous related works with respect to the ease of implementation and the independence of error
bounds on the problem dimension. Other known algorithms which achieve the optimal error bounds,
such as those based on Frolov's method, are very difficult to implement especially in high dimensions.
Here we adapt a lesser-known randomization technique introduction by Bakhvalov in 1961. This algorithm
is based on rank-$1$ lattice rules which are very easy to implement given the integer generating
vectors. A simple probabilistic approach can be used to obtain suitable generating vectors.
