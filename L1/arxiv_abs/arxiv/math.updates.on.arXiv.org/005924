This paper studies the parameter tuning problem of positive linear systems for optimizing their
stability properties. We specifically show that, under certain regularity assumptions on the
parametrization, the problem of finding the minimum-cost parameters that achieve a given requirement
on a system norm reduces to a \emph{geometric program}, which in turn can be exactly and efficiently
solved by convex optimization. The flexibility of geometric programming allows the state, input,
and output matrices of the system to simultaneously depend on the parameters to be tuned. The class
of system norms under consideration includes the $H^2$ norm, $H^\infty$ norm, Hankel norm, and
Schatten $p$-norm. Also, the parameter tuning problem for ensuring the robust stability of the
system under structural uncertainties is shown to be solved by geometric programming. The proposed
optimization framework is further extended to delayed positive linear systems, where it is shown
that the parameter tunning problem jointly constrained by the exponential decay rate, the $\mathcal
L^1$-gain, and the $\mathcal L^\infty$-gain can be solved by convex optimization. The assumption
on the system parametrization is stated in terms of posynomial functions, which form a broad class
of functions and thus allow us to deal with various interesting positive linear systems arising
from, for example, dynamical buffer networks and epidemic spreading processes. We present numerical
examples to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed optimization framework.
