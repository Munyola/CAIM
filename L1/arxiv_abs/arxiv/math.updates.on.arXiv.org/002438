The quasi-potential is a key concept of the Large Deviation Theory for Stochastic Differential
Equations (SDEs). Once the quasi-potential with respect to an attractor of the corresponding deterministic
system is found, one can readily obtain maximum likelihood exit paths and estimate the exit rate
from the basin of attraction and the invariant probability density near the attractor. The quasi-potential
for a linear SDE with asymptotically stable equilibrium at the origin is a quadratic form whose matrix
was found by Z. Chen and M. Freidlin (2005). Their formula involves an integral of certain matrix
exponentials and is inconvenient for numerical evaluation. In this work, I propose a different
approach for constructing the quasi-potential matrix for linear SDEs based on a certain easy-to-obtain
hierarchy of orthogonal decompositions inspired by those used by M. Tao (2018). A number of properties
of these decompositions, named false quasi-potential decompositions, is established. A geometric
recursive algorithm implementing this approach is presented. It involves only numerically stable
sub-algorithms such as the computation of Schur decompositions and solving systems of linear equations
or quadratic least squares problems. This work is motivated by the need to initialize the quasi-potential
solvers near asymptotically stable equilibria. An accurate way to do it is to linearize the SDE near
the equilibrium and set the values of the quasi-potential at the neighboring mesh points to the exact
quasi-potential of the linearized system.
