A CR manifold $M$, with CR distribution $\mathcal D^{10}\subset T^\mathbb C M$, is called {\it totally
nondegenerate of depth $\mu$} if: (a) the complex tangent space $T^\mathbb C M$ is generated by all
complex vector fields that might be determined by iterated Lie brackets between at most $\mu$ fields
in $\mathcal D^{10} + \overline{\mathcal D^{10}}$; (b) for each integer $2 \leq k \leq \mu-1$, the
families of all vector fields that might be determined by iterated Lie brackets between at most $k$
fields in $\mathcal D^{10} + \overline{\mathcal D^{10}}$ generate regular complex distributions;
(c) the ranks of the distributions in (b) have the {\it maximal values} that can be obtained amongst
all CR manifolds of the same CR dimension and satisfying (a) and (b) -- this maximality property is
the {\it total nondegeneracy} condition. In this paper, we prove that, for any Tanaka symbol $\frak
m = \frak m^{-\mu}+ \ldots + \frak m^{-1}$ of a totally nondegenerate CR manifold of depth $\mu \geq
4$, the full Tanaka prolongation of $\frak m$ has trivial subspaces of degree $k \geq 1$, i.e. it has
the form $\frak m^{-\mu}+ \ldots + \frak m^{-1} + \frak g^0$. This result has various consequences.
For instance it implies that any (local) CR automorphism of a regular totally nondegenerate CR manifold
is uniquely determined by its first order jet at a fixed point of the manifold. It also gives a complete
proof of a conjecture by Beloshapka on the group of automorphisms of homogeneous totally nondegenerate
CR manifolds.
