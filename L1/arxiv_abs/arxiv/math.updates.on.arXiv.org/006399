By the continuous mapping theorem, if a sequence of $d$-dimensional random vectors $(\mathbf{W}_n)_{n\geq1}$
converges in distribution to a multivariate normal random variable $\Sigma^{1/2}\mathbf{Z}$,
then the sequence of random variables $(g(\mathbf{W}_n))_{n\geq1}$ converges in distribution
to $g(\Sigma^{1/2}\mathbf{Z})$ if $g:\mathbb{R}^d\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ is continuous.
In this paper, we develop Stein's method for the problem of deriving explicit bounds on the distance
between $g(\mathbf{W}_n)$ and $g(\Sigma^{1/2}\mathbf{Z})$ with respect to smooth probability
metrics. We obtain several bounds for the case that the $j$-component of $\mathbf{W}_n$ is given
by $W_{n,j}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}\sum_{i=1}^nX_{ij}$, where the $X_{ij}$ are independent. In
particular, provided $g$ satisfies certain differentiability and growth rate conditions, we
obtain an order $n^{-(p-1)/2}$ bound, for smooth test functions, if the first $p$ moments of the
$X_{ij}$ agree with those of the normal distribution. If $p$ is an even integer and $g$ is an even function,
this convergence rate can be improved further to order $n^{-p/2}$. These convergence rates are
shown to be of optimal order. We apply our general bounds to some examples, which include the distributional
approximation of asymptotically chi-square distributed statistics; the approximation of expectations
of smooth functions of binomial and Poisson random variables; rates of convergence in the delta
method; and a quantitative variance-gamma approximation of the $D_2^*$ statistic for alignment-free
sequence comparison in the case of binary sequences.
