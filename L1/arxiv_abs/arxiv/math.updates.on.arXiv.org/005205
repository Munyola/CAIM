This paper considers the problem of quantitative group testing with a non-adaptive testing strategy.
In a quantitative group testing scheme, a set of tests are designed to identify defective items among
a large population of items, where the outcome of a test shows the number of defective items in the
tested group. There are two models for the defective items: (i)$~$deterministic, and (ii) randomized.
In the deterministic model, the exact number of the defective items, $K$, is known, whereas in the
randomized model each item is defective with probability $\frac{K}{N}$, independent of the other
items, where $N$ is the total number of items. In this work, we propose a quantitative non-adaptive
group testing algorithm using sparse graph codes over bi-regular bipartite graphs with left-degree
$\ell$ and right degree $r$ and binary $t$-error-correcting BCH codes. We show that for both the
deterministic and randomized models, our algorithm requires at most ${m=c(t)K(t\log(\frac{\ell
N}{c(t)K}+1)+1)+1}$ tests to recover all the defective items with probability approaching one
(as $N$ and $K$ grow unbounded), where $c(t)$ is a constant that depends only on $t$. The results of
our theoretical analysis reveal that using a $t$-error-correcting binary BCH code for $t\in \{1,2,3\}$,
when compared to $t\geq 4$, leads to a fewer number of tests. Simulation results show that the proposed
strategy significantly reduces the required number of tests for identifying all the defective
items with probability approaching one compared to a recently proposed scheme.
