An almost Robinson structure on an $n$-dimensional Lorentzian manifold $(\mathcal{M},g)$, where
$n=2m+\epsilon$, $\epsilon \in \{ 0 ,1 \}$, is a complex $m$-plane distribution $\mathcal{N}$
that is totally null with respect to the complexified metric, and intersects its complex conjugate
in a real null line distribution $\mathcal{K}$, say. When the almost Robinson structure is integrable,
in the sense that $\mathcal{N}$, and its orthogonal complement $\mathcal{N}^\perp$ are in involution,
the line distribution $\mathcal{K}$ is tangent to a congruence of null geodesics, and the quotient
of $\mathcal{M}$ by this flow acquires the structure of a CR manifold. In four dimensions, such a
congruence of null geodesics is shearfree. We give classifications of the tracefree Ricci tensor,
the Cotton-York tensor and the Weyl tensor, which are invariant under the stabiliser of an almost
Robinson structure. This is one generalisation of the Petrov classification of the Weyl tensor
to higher dimensions, and includes a refinement of the classification of the Weyl tensor based on
the null alignment formalism. Since an almost Robinson structure is equivalent to a projective
pure spinor field of real index $1$, the present work can also be viewed as spinorial classifications
of curvature tensors. We illustrate these algebraic classifications by a number of examples of
higher-dimensional general relativity that admit integrable almost Robinson manifolds, emphasising
the degeneracy type of the Weyl tensor in each case.
