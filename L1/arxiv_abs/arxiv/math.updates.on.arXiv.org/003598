The challenge of quantifying uncertainty propagation in real-world systems is rooted in the high-dimensionality
of the stochastic input and the frequent lack of explicit knowledge of its probability distribution.
Traditional approaches show limitations for such problems, especially when the size of the training
data is limited. To address these difficulties, we have developed a general framework of constructing
surrogate models on spaces of stochastic input with arbitrary probability measure irrespective
of dependencies and the analytical form. This framework includes a data-driven basis construction
for arbitrary probability measure and a sparsity enhancement rotation procedure. This sparsity-enhancing
rotation method was initially proposed in our previous work \cite{Lei_Yang_MMS_2015} for Gaussian
density distributions, which may not be feasible for non-Gaussian distributions due to the loss
of orthogonality after the rotation. This work builds on the previous rotation method, ensuring
that the developed basis construction approach maintains the orthogonality/near-orthogonality
with respect to the density of the rotated random vector. The developed framework leads to accurate
recovery, with only limited training data, of a sparse representation of target functions depending
on high-dimensional inputs. The effectiveness of our method is demonstrated in challenging problems
such as PDE systems and realistic biomolecular systems where the underlying density is implicitly
represented by a collection of sampling data, as well as systems with explicitly given non-Gaussian
probabilistic measures.
