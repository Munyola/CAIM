Existing decentralized coded caching solutions cannot guarantee small loads in the general scenario
with arbitrary file sizes and cache sizes. In this paper, we propose an optimization framework for
decentralized coded caching in the general scenario to minimize the worst-case load and average
load (under an arbitrary file popularity), respectively. Specifically, we first propose a class
of decentralized coded caching schemes for the general scenario, which are specified by a general
caching parameter and include several known schemes as special cases. Then, we optimize the caching
parameter to minimize the worst-case load and average load, respectively. Each of the two optimization
problems is a challenging nonconvex problem with a nondifferentiable objective function. For
each optimization problem, we develop an iterative algorithm to obtain a stationary point using
techniques for solving Complementary Geometric Programming (GP). We also obtain a low-complexity
approximate solution by solving an approximate problem with a differentiable objective function
which is an upper bound on the original nondifferentiable one, and characterize the performance
loss caused by the approximation. Finally, we present two information-theoretic converse bounds
on the worst-case load and average load (under an arbitrary file popularity) in the general scenario,
respectively. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that provides optimization-based
decentralized coded caching schemes and information-theoretic converse bounds for the general
scenario.
