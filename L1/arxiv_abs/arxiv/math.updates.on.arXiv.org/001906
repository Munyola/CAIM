We consider the sums $S(k)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{(-1)^{nk}}{(2n+1)^k}$ and $\zeta(2k)=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n^{2k}}$
with $k$ being a positive integer. We evaluate these sums with multiple integration, a modern technique.
First, we start with three different double integrals that have been previously used in the literature
to show $S(2)=\pi^2/8,$ which implies Euler's identity $\zeta(2)=\pi^2/6.$ Then, we generalize
each integral in order to find the considered sums. The $k$ dimensional analogue of the first integral
is the density function of the quotient of $k$ independent, nonnegative Cauchy random variables.
In seeking this function, we encounter a special logarithmic integral that we can directly relate
to $S(k).$ The $k$ dimensional analogue of the second integral, upon a change of variables, is the
volume of a convex polytope, which can be expressed as a probability involving certain pairwise
sums of $k$ independent uniform random variables. We use combinatorial arguments to find the volume,
which in turn gives new closed formulas for $S(k)$ and $\zeta(2k).$ The $k$ dimensional analogue
of the last integral, upon another change of variables, is an integral of the joint density function
of $k$ Cauchy random variables over a hyperbolic polytope. This integral can be expressed as a probability
involving certain pairwise products of these random variables, and it is equal to the probability
from the second generalization. Thus, we specifically highlight the similarities in the combinatorial
arguments between the second and third generalizations.
