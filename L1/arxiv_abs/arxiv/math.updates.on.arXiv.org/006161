Cooperative relaying is utilized as an efficient method for data communication in wireless sensor
networks and Internet of Things (IoT). However, sometimes due to the necessity of multi-hop relaying
in such communication networks, it is challenging to guarantee the secrecy of cooperative transmissions
when the relays may themselves be eavesdroppers, i.e., we may face with the untrusted relaying scenario
where the relays are both necessary helpers and potential eavesdroppers. To obviate this issue,
a new cooperative jamming scheme is proposed in this paper, in which the data can be confidentially
communicated from the source to the destination through multi-hop untrusted relays. Toward this
end, we first consider a two successive untrusted relaying network, i.e, a three-hop communication
network. In our proposed secure transmission scheme, all the legitimate nodes contribute to provide
secure communication by smartly injecting artificial noises to the network in different communication
phases. Given this system model, a novel closed-form expression is presented in the high signal-to-noise
ratio (SNR) regime for the ergodic secrecy rate (ESR). Furthermore, we evaluate the high SNR slope
and power offset of the ESR to gain a basic comparison of the proposed secure transmission scheme
and the state-of-arts. Our numerical results highlight that the proposed secure transmission
scheme provides better secrecy rate compared with the two-hop untrusted relaying scheme as well
as the direct transmission scheme.
