We study ASEP in a spatially inhomogeneous environment on a torus $ \mathcal{T} \simeq \{0,1,\ldots,N-1\}
$ of $ N $ sites. A given inhomogeneity $ \widetilde{\mathsf{a}}(x)\in(0,\infty) $, $ x\in\mathcal{T}
$, perturbs the overall asymmetric jumping rates $ r<\ell\in(0,1) $ at bonds, so that particles
jump from site $x$ to $x+1$ with rate $r\widetilde{\mathsf{a}}(x)$ and from $x+1$ to $x$ with rate
$\ell \widetilde{\mathsf{a}}(x)$ (subject to the exclusion rule in both cases). Under the limit
$ N\to\infty $, we suitably tune the asymmetry $ (\ell-r) $ to zero and the inhomogeneity $ \widetilde{\mathsf{a}}
$ to unity, so that the two compete on equal footing. At the level of the G\"{a}rtner (or microscopic
Hopf--Cole) transform, we show convergence to a new SPDE --- the Stochastic Heat Equation with a
mix of spatial and spacetime multiplicative noise (or, equivalently, at the level of the height
function we show convergence to the Kardar--Parisi--Zhang equation with a mix of spatial and spacetime
additive noise). Our method applies to a very general class of inhomogeneity $ \widetilde{\mathsf{a}}
$, and in particular includes i.i.d., long-range correlated, and periodic inhomogeneities. The
key component of our analysis consists of a host of new estimates on the \emph{kernel} of the semigroup
$ \mathcal{Q}:=e^{t\mathcal{Q}} $ for a Hill-type operator $ \mathcal{H}:= \frac12\partial_{xx}
+ \mathcal{A}'(x) $, and its discrete analog, where $ \mathcal{A} $ (and its discrete analog) is
a generic H\"{o}lder continuous function.
