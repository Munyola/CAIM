An empty simplex is a lattice simplex with only its vertices as lattice points. Their classification
in dimension three was completed by White in 1964. In dimension four, the same task was started in
1988 by Mori, Morrison, and Morrison, with their motivation coming from the close relationship
between empty simplices and terminal quotient singularities. They conjectured a classification
of empty simplices of prime volume, modulo finitely many exceptions. Their conjecture was proved
by Sankaran (1990) with a simplified proof by Bober (2009). The same classification was claimed
by Barile et al. in 2011 for simplices of non-prime volume, but this statement was proved wrong by
Blanco et al. (2016+). We here complete the classification of $4$-dimensional empty simplices.
In doing so we correct and complete the classification claimed by Barile et al., and we also compute
all the finitely many exceptions, by first proving an upper bound for their volume. The whole classification
has: - One $3$-parameter family, consisting of simplices of width equal to one. - Two $2$-parameter
families (the one in Mori et al., plus a second new one). - Forty-six $1$-paramater families (the
29 in Mori et al., plus 17 new ones). - $2461$ individual simplices not belonging to the above families,
with volumes ranging betwen 29 and 419. We characterize the infinite families of empty simplices
in terms of lower dimensional point configurations that they project to, with techniques that can
be applied to higher dimensions and larger classes of lattice polytopes.
