In our earlier work, we proposed a data-driven filtered reduced order model (DDF-ROM) framework
for the numerical simulation of fluid flows, which can be formally written as \begin{equation*}
\boxed{ \text{ DDF-ROM = Galerkin-ROM + Correction } } \end{equation*} The new DDF-ROM was constructed
by using ROM spatial filtering and data-driven ROM closure modeling (for the Correction term) and
was successfully tested in the numerical simulation of a 2D channel flow past a circular cylinder
at Reynolds numbers $Re=100, Re=500$ and $Re=1000$. In this paper, we propose a {\it physically-constrained}
DDF-ROM (CDDF-ROM), which aims at improving the physical accuracy of the DDF-ROM. The new physical
constraints require that the CDDF-ROM operators satisfy the same type of physical laws (i.e., the
nonlinear operator should conserve energy and the ROM closure term should be dissipative) as those
satisfied by the fluid flow equations. To implement these physical constraints, in the data-driven
modeling step of the DDF-ROM, we replace the unconstrained least squares problem with a constrained
least squares problem. We perform a numerical investigation of the new CDDF-ROM and standard DDF-ROM
for a 2D channel flow past a circular cylinder at Reynolds numbers $Re=100, Re=500$ and $Re=1000$.
To this end, we consider a reproductive regime as well as a predictive (i.e., cross-validation)
regime in which we use as little as $50\%$ of the original training data. The numerical investigation
clearly shows that the new CDDF-ROM is significantly more accurate than the DDF-ROM in both regimes.
