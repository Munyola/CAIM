We say that an $m\times m$ matrix polynomial $P(x)=\sum_{i=0}^nP_i x^i$ is equivalent to an $mq\times
mq$ matrix polynomial $A(x)$, and write $A(x)\approx P(x)$, if there exist $mq\times mq$ matrix
polynomials $E(x)$, $F(x)$ such that $\det E(x)$ and $\det F(x)$ are nonzero constants and $E(x)A(x)F(x)=I_{m(q-1)}\oplus
P(x)$. Given $P(x)$ of degree $n$ we provide an $mq\times mq$ matrix polynomial $A(x)$ such that:
$A(x)\approx P(x)$, $A^\#(x)\approx P^\#(x)$, where $P^\#(x)=x^nP(x^{-1})$ is the reversed
polynomial of $P(x)$; $A(x)$ has the form $A(x)=D(x)+[I_m,\ldots,I_m]^t[W_1(x),\ldots,W_q(x)]$,
where $D(x)$ is a diagonal matrix defined by $D(x)=\hbox{diag}(b_1(x)I_m,\ldots,b_{q-1}(x)I_m,b_q(x)P_n+sI_m$,
the polynomials $b_1(x),\ldots,b_q(x)$ are any co-prime monic polynomials of degree $d_1,\ldots,d_q$,
respectively, while $W_1(x),\ldots,W_q(x)$ are matrix polynomials of degree less than $d_1,\ldots,d_q$
where $d_1+\cdots+d_q=n$ and $s$ is a constant which makes $b_q(x)P_n+sI_m$ nonsingular modulo
$b_i(x)$, $i=1,\ldots,q-1$. An explicit expression of the eigenvectors of $A(x)$ as functions
of the eigenvalues is proven. For $b_i(x)=(x-\beta_i)I_m$, $i=1,\ldots,n$, the matrix polynomial
$A(x)$ is a linear pencil of the form diagonal plus low-rank. Numerical experiments show that for
suitable choices of $\beta_1,\ldots,\beta_n$ obtained by means of the generalized Pellet theorem
and the use of tropical roots, the eigenvalue problem for $A(x)$ is much better conditioned than
the eigenvalue problem for $P(x)$.
