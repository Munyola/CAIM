Following an original idea of F. Guerra, in this notes we analyze the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model
from different perspectives, all sharing the underlying approach which consists in linking the
resolution of the statistical mechanics of the model (e.g. solving for the free energy) to well-known
partial differential equation (PDE) problems (in suitable spaces). The plan is then to solve the
related PDE using techniques involved in their native field and lastly bringing back the solution
in the proper statistical mechanics framework. Within this strand, after a streamlined test-case
on the Curie-Weiss model to highlight the methods more than the physics behind, we solve the SK both
at the replica symmetric and at the 1-RSB level, obtaining the correct expression for the free energy
via an analogy to a Fourier equation and for the self-consistencies with an analogy to a Burger equation,
whose shock wave develops exactly at critical noise level (triggering the phase transition). Our
approach, beyond acting as a new alternative method (with respect to the standard routes) for tackling
the complexity of spin glasses, links symmetries in PDE theory with constraints in statistical
mechanics and, as a novel result from the theoretical physics perspective, we obtain a new class
of polynomial identities (namely of Aizenman-Contucci type but merged within the Guerra's broken
replica measures), whose interest lies in understanding, via the recent Panchenko breakthroughs,
how to force the overlap organization to the ultrametric tree predicted by Parisi.
