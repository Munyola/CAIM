Motivated by a new kind of initial boundary value problem (IBVP) with a free boundary arising in wave-structure
interaction, we propose here a general approach to one-dimensional IBVP as well as transmission
problems. For general strictly hyperbolic 2x2 quasilinear hyperbolic systems, we derive new sharp
linear estimates with refined dependence on the source term and control on the traces of the solution
at the boundary. These new estimates are used to obtain sharp results for quasilinear IBVP and transmission
problems, and for fixed, moving, and free boundaries. In the latter case, two kinds of evolution
equations are considered. The first one is of "kinematic type" in the sense that the velocity of the
interface has the same regularity as the trace of the solution. Several applications that fall into
this category are considered: the interaction of waves with a lateral piston, and a new version of
the well-known stability of shocks (classical and undercompressive) that improves the results
of the general theory by taking advantage of the specificities of the one-dimensional case. We also
consider "fully nonlinear" evolution equations characterized by the fact that the velocity of
the interface is one derivative more singular than the trace of the solution. This configuration
is the most challenging; it is motivated by a free boundary problem arising in wave-structure interaction,
namely, the evolution of the contact line between a floating object and the water. This problem is
solved as an application of the general theory developed here.
