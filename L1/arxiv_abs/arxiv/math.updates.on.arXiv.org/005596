In this paper we undertake a basic study on connective commutative differential graded algebras
(CDGA), more precisely, piecewise Noetherian CDGA, which is a DG-counter part of commutative Noetherian
algebra. We establish basic results for example, Auslaner-Buchsbaum formula and Bass formula
without any unnecessary assumptions. The key notion is the sup-projective (sppj) and inf-injective
(ifij) resolutions introduced by the author, which are DG-versions of the projective and injective
resolution for ordinary modules. These are different from DG-projective and DG-injective resolutions
which is known DG-version of the projective and injective resolution. In the paper, we show that
sppj and ifij resolutions are powerful tools to study DG-modules. Many classical result about the
projective and injective resolutions can be generalized to DG-setting by using sppj and ifij resolutions.
. Among other things we prove a DG-version of Bass's structure theorem of a minimal injective resolution
holds for a minimal ifij resolution and a DG-version of the Bass numbers introduced by the same formula
with the classical case. We also prove a structure theorem of a minimal ifij resolution of a dualizing
complex $D$, which is completely analogues to the structure theorem of a minimal injective resolution
of a dualizing complex over an ordinary commutative algebra. Specializing to results about a dualizing
complex, we study a Gorenstein CDGA. We generalize a result by Felix-Halperin-Felix-Thomas and
Avramov-Foxby which gives conditions that a CDGA $R$ is Gorenstein in terms of its cohomology algebra
$\text{H}(R)$.
