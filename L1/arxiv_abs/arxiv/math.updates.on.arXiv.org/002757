This paper contributes to the modeling and analysis of unsignalized intersections. In classical
gap acceptance models vehicles on the minor road accept any gap greater than the CRITICAL gap, and
reject gaps below this threshold, where the gap is the time between two subsequent vehicles on the
major road. The main contribution of this paper is to develop a series of generalizations of existing
models, thus increasing the model's practical applicability significantly. First, we incorporate
{driver impatience behavior} while allowing for a realistic merging behavior; we do so by distinguishing
between the critical gap and the merging time, thus allowing MULTIPLE vehicles to use a sufficiently
large gap. Incorporating this feature is particularly challenging in models with driver impatience.
Secondly, we allow for multiple classes of gap acceptance behavior, enabling us to distinguish
between different driver types and/or different vehicle types. Thirdly, we use the novel M$^X$/SM2/1
queueing model, which has batch arrivals, dependent service times, and a different service-time
distribution for vehicles arriving in an empty queue on the minor road (where `service time' refers
to the time required to find a sufficiently large gap). This setup facilitates the analysis of the
service-time distribution of an arbitrary vehicle on the minor road and of the queue length on the
minor road. In particular, we can compute the MEAN service time, thus enabling the evaluation of
the capacity for the minor road vehicles.
