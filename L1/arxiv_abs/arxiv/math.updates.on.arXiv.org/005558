Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have found numerous applications and are expected to bring fertile
business opportunities in the next decade. Among various enabling technologies for UAVs, wireless
communication is essential and has drawn significantly growing attention in recent years. Compared
to the conventional terrestrial communications, UAVs' communications face new challenges due
to their high altitude above the ground and great flexibility of movement in the three-dimensional
(3D) space. Several critical issues arise, including the line-of-sight (LoS) dominant UAV-ground
channels and resultant strong aerial-terrestrial network interference, the distinct communication
quality of service (QoS) requirements for UAV control messages versus payload data, the stringent
constraints imposed by the size, weight and power (SWAP) limitations of UAVs, as well as the exploitation
of the new design degree of freedom (DoF) brought by the highly controllable 3D UAV mobility. In this
paper, we give a tutorial overview of the recent advances in UAV communications to address the above
issues, with an emphasis on how to integrate UAVs into the forthcoming fifth-generation (5G) and
future cellular networks. In particular, we partition our discussions into two promising research
and application frameworks of UAV communications, namely UAV-assisted wireless communications
and cellular-connected UAVs,where UAVs serve as aerial communication platforms and users, respectively.
Furthermore, we point out promising directions for future research and investigation.
