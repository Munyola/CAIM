We develop backstepping state feedback control to stabilize a moving shockwave in a freeway segment
under bilateral boundary actuations of traffic flow. A moving shockwave, consisting of light traffic
upstream of the shockwave and heavy traffic downstream, is usually caused by changes of local road
situations. The density discontinuity travels upstream and drivers caught in the shockwave experience
transitions from free to congested traffic. Boundary control design in this paper brings the moving
shockwave front to a static setpoint position, hindering the upstream propagation of traffic congestion.
The traffic dynamics are described with Lighthill-Whitham-Richard (LWR) model, leading to a system
of two first-order hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs). Each represents the traffic
density of a spatial domain segregated by the moving interface. By Rankine-Hugoniot condition,
the interface position is driven by flux discontinuity and thus governed by a PDE state dependent
ordinary differential equation (ODE). For the PDE-ODE coupled system. the control objective is
to stabilize both the PDE states of traffic density and the ODE state of moving shock position to setpoint
values. Using delay representation and backstepping method, we design predictor feedback controllers
to cooperatively compensate state-dependent input delays to the ODE. From Lyapunov stability
analysis, we show local stability of the closed-loop system in $H^1$ norm. The performance of controllers
is demonstrated by numerical simulation.
