Mathematical problems of optimal control of quantum systems attract high interest in connection
with both fundamental questions and existing and prospective applications. An important problem
is the development of methods for constructing controls for quantum systems. One of the widely used
methods is the Krotov method. The article is the first part of the review devoted to mathematical
aspects of this method for optimal control of quantum systems. Beyond quantum control this method
was suggested in the articles [V.F. Krotov, I.N. Feldman, Eng. Cybern. 1983. Vol. 21, 123], [A.I.
Konnov, V.F. Krotov, Automat. Remote Control, 1999], and then adopted to optimal quantum control
in papers by V.A. Kazakov, V.F. Krotov, R. Kosloff, C.P. Koch, D.J. Tannor, and others. The review
considers this method, including cases with constraints on control spectrum and on states of the
quantum system, various ways for choosing the improvement function, in particular, linear or linear-quadratic
form, etc. We also discuss GRAPE (GRadient Ascent Pulse Engineering) and CRAB (Chopped Random-Basis)
methods, as well as combined methods such as the method suggested by I. Maday and G. Turinici for generalizing
the 1st order Krotov method and the Zhu-Rabitz method. Nowadays, various versions of the Krotov
method are used as a key tool in optimal quantum control, and the review describes applications of
this method to mathematical control problems for molecular dynamics, Bose-Einstein condensate,
nuclear-magnetic resonance, quantum gates generation, etc. The first part of the review is devoted
to closed quantum systems.
