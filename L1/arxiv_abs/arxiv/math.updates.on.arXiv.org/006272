In this note we present an alternative way to obtain optimal interpolation operators for two-grid
methods applied to Hermitian positive definite linear systems. Falgout and Vassilevski in [SIAM
J. Numer. Anal, 42 (2004), pp. 1669-1693] and Zikatanov [Numer. Linear Algebra Appl., 15 (2008),
pp. 439-454] have characterized the $A$-norm of the error propagation operator of algebraic multigrid
methods. These results have been recently used by Xu and Zikatanov [Acta Numer., 26 (2017), pp. 591-721]
and Brannick, Cao et al. [SIAM J. Sci. Comp, 40 (2018), pp. 591-721] to determine optimal interpolation
operators. Here we use a characterization not of the $A$-norm but of the spectrum of the error propagation
operator of two-grid methods, which was proved by Garc\'ia Ramos, Nabben and Kehl and holds for arbitrary
matrices. For Hermitian positive definite systems this result leads to optimal interpolation
operators with respect to the $A$-norm in a short way, moreover, it also leads to optimal interpolation
operators with respect to the spectral radius. For the symmetric two-grid method (with pre- and
post-smoothing) the optimal interpolation operators are the same. But for a two-grid method with
only post-smoothing the optimal interpolations (and hence the optimal algebraic multigrid methods)
can be different. Moreover, using the characterization of the spectrum, we can show that the found
optimal interpolation operators are also optimal with respect to the condition number of the multigrid
preconditioned system.
