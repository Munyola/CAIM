The Stokes equations subject to non-homogeneous slip boundary conditions are considered in a smooth
domain $\Omega \subset \mathbb R^N \, (N=2,3)$. We propose a finite element scheme based on the nonconforming
P1/P0 approximation (Crouzeix-Raviart approximation) combined with a penalty formulation and
with reduced-order numerical integration in order to address the essential boundary condition
$u \cdot n_{\partial\Omega} = g$ on $\partial\Omega$. Because the original domain $\Omega$ must
be approximated by a polygonal (or polyhedral) domain $\Omega_h$ before applying the finite element
method, we need to take into account the errors owing to the discrepancy $\Omega \neq \Omega_h$,
that is, the issues of domain perturbation. In particular, the approximation of $n_{\partial\Omega}$
by $n_{\partial\Omega_h}$ makes it non-trivial whether we have a discrete counterpart of a lifting
theorem, i.e., right-continuous inverse of the normal trace operator $H^1(\Omega)^N \to H^{1/2}(\partial\Omega)$;
$u \mapsto u\cdot n_{\partial\Omega}$. In this paper we indeed prove such a discrete lifting theorem,
taking advantage of the nonconforming approximation, and consequently we establish the error
estimates $O(h^\alpha + \epsilon)$ and $O(h^{2\alpha} + \epsilon)$ for the velocity in the $H^1$-
and $L^2$-norms respectively, where $\alpha = 1$ if $N=2$ and $\alpha = 1/2$ if $N=3$. This improves
the previous result [T. Kashiwabara et al., Numer. Math. 134 (2016), pp. 705--740] obtained for
the conforming approximation in the sense that there appears no reciprocal of the penalty parameter
$\epsilon$ in the estimates.
