To address the issues of stability and accuracy for reaction-diffusion equations, the development
of high order and stable time-stepping methods is necessary. This is particularly true in the context
of cardiac electrophysiology, where reaction-diffusion equations are coupled with stiff ODE
systems. Many research have been led in that way in the past 15 years concerning implicit-explicit
methods and exponential integrators. In 2009, Perego and Veneziani proposed an innovative time-stepping
method of order 2. In this paper we present the extension of this method to the orders 3 and 4 and introduce
the Rush-Larsen schemes of order k (shortly denoted RL\_k). The RL\_k schemes are explicit multistep
exponential integrators. They display a simple general formulation and an easy implementation.
The RL\_k schemes are shown to be stable under perturbation and convergent of order k. Their Dahlquist
stability analysis is performed. They have a very large stability domain provided that the stabilizer
associated with the method captures well enough the stiff modes of the problem. The RL\_k method
is numerically studied as applied to the membrane equation in cardiac electrophysiology. The RL
k schemes are shown to be stable under perturbation and convergent oforder k. Their Dahlquist stability
analysis is performed. They have a very large stability domain provided that the stabilizer associated
with the method captures well enough the stiff modes of the problem. The RL k method is numerically
studied as applied to the membrane equation in cardiac electrophysiology.
