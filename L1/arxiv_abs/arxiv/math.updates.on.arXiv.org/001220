In [1] and [2], a formula, incorporating a $5F4$ hypergeometric function, for the Hilbert-Schmidt-averaged
determinantal moments $< |\rho^{PT}|^{n}|\rho|^{k}> /< |\rho|^{k}>$ of $4 \times
4$ density-matrices ($\rho$), was applied with $k=0$ to the generalized two-qubit separability-probability
question. We now observe that the formula can be viewed more broadly, taking $k = K -N$, as yielding
the "induced measures in the space of mixed quantum states" of Zyczkowski and Sommers [3], where
$N=4$ in the generalized two-qubit cases under consideration. The dimension, $K$, of the ancilla/environment
space, equals $N$ in the particular Hilbert-Schmidt instance. As in the earlier work [1,2], a high-precision
density-approximation (inverse) procedure of Provost [4], incorporating the first 11,401 such
determinantal moments, strongly indicates that the induced-measure separability probabilities
($k =1, 2,...$) assume interesting, relatively simple rational values in the two-re[al]bit ($\alpha
= \frac{1}{2}$), (standard) two-qubit ($\alpha = 1$) and two-quater[nionic]bit ($\alpha =2$)
cases, particularly so for $\alpha =1$. One striking example is that for $k=3$, the $\alpha =1$ separability
probability is found to be $\frac{27}{38}= \frac{3^3}{2 \cdot 19}$ (to fifteen decimal places).
In fact, based on extensive calculations ($k =0,...,15,...$) of this nature, we are able to deduce
rather simple companion (rebit, qubit, quaterbit) formulas that successfully reproduce the rational
values assumed for general $k$.
