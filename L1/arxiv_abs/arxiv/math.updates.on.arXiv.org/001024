This thesis is devoted to a rigorous study of interacting quantum gases. The main objects of interest
are the closely related concepts of excitation spectrum and quasiparticles. The immediate motivation
of this work is to propose a spectral point of view concerning these two concepts. In the first part
of this thesis we discuss the concepts of excitation spectrum and quasiparticles. We provide an
overview of physical motivations and based on that we propose a spectral and Hamiltonian-based
approach towards these terms. Based on that, we formulate definitions and propositions related
to these concepts. In the second part we recall the Bogoliubov and Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov approximations,
which in the physics literature are used to obtain the quasiparticle picture. We show how these two
approaches fit into a universal scheme which allows us to arrive at a quasiparticle picture in a more
general setup. This scheme is based on the minimization of Hamiltonians over the so-called Gaussian
states. Its abstract formulation is the content of Beliaev's Theorem. In the last part we present
a rigorous result concerning the justification of the Bogoliubov approximation. This justification
employs the concept of the mean-field and infinite-volume limit. We show that for a large number
of particles, a large volume and a sufficiently high density, the low-lying energy-momentum spectrum
of the homogeneous Bose gas is well described by the Bogoliubov approximation. This result, which
is formulated in the form of a theorem, can be seen as the main result of this thesis.
