Protein aggregation on the plasma membrane (PM) is of critical importance to many cellular processes
such as cell adhesion, endocytosis, fibrillar conformation, and vesicle transport. Lateral diffusion
of protein aggregates or clusters on the surface of the PM plays an important role in governing their
heterogeneous surface distribution. However, the stability behavior of the surface distribution
of protein aggregates remains poorly understood. Therefore, understanding the spatial patterns
that can emerge on the PM solely through protein-protein interaction, lateral diffusion, and feedback
is an important step towards a complete description of the mechanisms behind protein clustering
on the cell surface. In this work, we investigate the pattern formation of a reaction-diffusion
model that describes the dynamics of a system of ligand-receptor complexes. The purely diffusive
ligand in the cytosol can bind receptors in the PM, and the resultant ligand-receptor complexes
not only diffuse laterally but can also form clusters resulting in different oligomers. Finally,
the largest oligomers recruit ligands from the cytosol in a positive feedback. From a methodological
viewpoint, we provide theoretical estimates for diffusion-driven instabilities of the protein
aggregates based on the Turing mechanism. Our main result is a threshold phenomenon, in which a sufficiently
high recruitment of ligands promotes the input of new monomeric components and consequently drives
the formation of a single-patch spatially heterogeneous steady-state.
