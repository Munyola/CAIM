This article investigates emergence and complexity in complex systems that can share information
on a network. To this end, we use a theoretical approach from information theory, computability
theory, and complex networks. One key studied question is how much emergent complexity arises when
a population of computable systems is networked compared with when this population is isolated.
First, we define a general model for networked theoretical machines, which we call algorithmic
networks. Then, we narrow our scope to investigate algorithmic networks that optimize the average
fitnesses of nodes in a scenario in which each node imitates the fittest neighbor and the randomly
generated population is networked by a time-varying graph. We show that there are graph-topological
conditions that cause these algorithmic networks to have the property of expected emergent open-endedness
for large enough populations. In other words, the expected emergent algorithmic complexity of
a node tends to infinity as the population size tends to infinity. Given a dynamic network, we show
that these conditions imply the existence of a central time to trigger expected emergent open-endedness.
Moreover, we show that networks with small diameter compared to the network size meet these conditions.
We also discuss future research based on how our results are related to some problems in network science,
information theory, computability theory, distributed computing, game theory, evolutionary
biology, and synergy in complex systems.
