In this review article we discuss a number of recent results concerning wild weak solutions of the
incompressible Euler and Navier-Stokes equations. These results build on the groundbreaking
works of De Lellis and Sz\'ekelyhidi Jr., who extended Nash's fundamental ideas on $C^1$ flexible
isometric embeddings, into the realm of fluid dynamics. These techniques, which go under the umbrella
name convex integration, have fundamental analogies the phenomenological theories of hydrodynamic
turbulence. Mathematical problems arising in turbulence (such as the Onsager conjecture) have
not only sparked new interest in convex integration, but certain experimentally observed features
of turbulent flows (such as intermittency) have also informed new convex integration constructions.
First, we give an elementary construction of nonconservative $C^{0+}_{x,t}$ weak solutions of
the Euler equations, first proven by De Lellis-Sz\'ekelyhidi Jr.. Second, we present Isett's recent
resolution of the flexible side of the Onsager conjecture. Here, we in fact follow the joint work
of De Lellis-Sz\'ekelyhidi Jr. and the authors of this paper, in which weak solutions of the Euler
equations in the regularity class $C^{\frac 13-}_{x,t}$ are constructed, attaining any energy
profile. Third, we give a concise proof of the authors' recent result, which proves the existence
of infinitely many weak solutions of the Navier-Stokes in the regularity class $C^0_t L^{2+}_x
\cap C^0_t W^{1,1+}_x$. We conclude the article by mentioning a number of open problems at the intersection
of convex integration and hydrodynamic turbulence.
