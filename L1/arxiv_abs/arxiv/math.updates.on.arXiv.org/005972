In this paper, we propose an analytical framework to quantify the amount of data samples needed to
obtain accurate state estimation in a power system, a problem known as sample complexity analysis
in computer science. Motivated by the increasing adoption of distributed energy resources into
the distribution-level grids, it becomes imperative to estimate the state of distribution grids
in order to ensure stable operation. Traditional power system state estimation techniques mainly
focus on the transmission network which involve solving an overdetermined system and eliminating
bad data. However, distribution networks are typically underdetermined due to the large number
of connection points and high cost of pervasive installation of measurement devices. In this paper,
we consider the recently proposed state-estimation method for underdetermined systems that is
based on matrix completion. In particular, a constrained matrix completion algorithm was proposed,
wherein the standard matrix completion problem is augmented with additional equality constraints
representing the physics (namely power-flow constraints). We analyze the sample complexity of
this general method by proving an upper bound on the sample complexity that depends directly on the
properties of these constraints that can lower number of needed samples as compared to the unconstrained
problem. To demonstrate the improvement that the constraints add to distribution state estimation,
we test the method on a 141-bus distribution network case study and compare it to the traditional
least squares minimization state estimation method.
