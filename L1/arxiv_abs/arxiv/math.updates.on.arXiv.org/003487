In 1975, the pioneering work of J. E. Mazo showed the potential faster-than-Nyquist (FTN) gain of
single-carrier binary signal. If the inter-symbol interference is eliminated by an optimal detector,
the FTN single-carrier binary signal can transmit 24.7% more bits than the Nyquist signal without
any loss of bit error rate performance, which is known as the Mazo limit. In this paper, we apply sphere
decoder (SD) with box optimization (BO) to reduce inter-carrier interference (ICI) in FTN non-orthogonal
frequency division multiplexing (FTN-NOFDM) system. Compared with the conventional SD, SD with
BO can achieve the same performance to reduce ICI, but its average number of expanded nodes in search
process is significantly decreased especially for high-order modulation format, which can reduce
the complexity of the receiver. When the bandwidth compression factor $\alpha$ is set to 0.802,
the transmission rate of QPSK-modulated FTN-NOFDM is 24.7% faster than the Nyquist rate, and it
has almost the same performance as orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), which agrees
well with the Mazo limit. The QPSK-modulated FTN-NOFDM with $\alpha$ equal to 0.5 (the spectral
efficiency is 4 bit/s/Hz) outperforms 16QAM-modulated OFDM by about 1.5 dB. The 16QAM-modulated
FTN-NOFDM with $\alpha$ equal to 0.67 and 0.5 (the spectral efficiency is 6 bit/s/Hz and 8 bit/s/Hz,
respectively) outperforms 64QAM-modulated and 256QAM-modulated OFDM by about 1.5 dB and 2 dB,
respectively. Therefore, FTN-NOFDM will be a promising modulation scheme for the future bandwidth-limited
wireless communications.
