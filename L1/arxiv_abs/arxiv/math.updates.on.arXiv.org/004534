We investigate the connectivity of wireless sensor networks secured by the heterogeneous random
pairwise key predistribution scheme. In contrast to the homogeneous scheme proposed by Chan et
al., where each node is paired (offline) with $K$ other nodes chosen uniformly at random; herein,
each node is classified as class-$1$ with probability $\mu$ or class-$2$ with probability $1-\mu$,
for $0<\mu<1$, independently. Then, each class-$1$ (respectively, class-$2$) node is paired
(offline) with $K_1$ (respectively, $K_2$) other nodes selected uniformly at random. We consider
the particular case when $K_1=1$ and $K_2=K$. The heterogeneous random pairwise scheme induces
an inhomogeneous random K-out graph $\mathbb{H} (n;\mu,K_n)$, where $n$ denotes the number of
nodes and $K_n$ denotes a scaling of $K$ with respect to the network size $n$. Hence, establishing
the connectivity of wireless sensor networks secured by the heterogeneous random pairwise scheme
maps to deriving conditions on how to scale $K_n$ with respect to the network size $n$ such that the
graph is connected with high probability as $n$ tends to infinity. With $K_1=1$, we show that i) when
$K_n=K$ for all $n=2,3,\ldots$ for a positive, finite integer $K$ with $K\geq2$, the resulting
graph is not connected with a positive probability. In this case, we derive a tight upper bound on
the probability of connectivity and verify the results via simulations. Moreover, ii) we prove
that when $K_n$ is chosen such that $\lim_{n \to \infty} K_n=\infty$, the graph is connected with
high probability as $n$ tends to infinity.
