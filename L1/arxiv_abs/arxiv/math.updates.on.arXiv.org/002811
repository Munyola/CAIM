Pseudo-Riemannian metrics with Levi-Civita connection in the projective class of a given torsion
free affine connection can be obtained from (and are equivalent to) the maximal rank solutions of
a certain overdetermined projectively invariant differential equation often called the metrizability
equation. Dropping this rank assumption we study the solutions to this equation given less restrictive
generic conditions on its prolonged system. In this setting we find that the solution stratifies
the manifold according to the strict signature (pointwise) of the solution and does this in way that
locally generalizes the stratification of a model, where the model is, in each case, a corresponding
Lie group orbit decomposition of the sphere. Thus the solutions give curved generalizations of
such embedded orbit structures. We describe the smooth nature of the strata and determine the geometries
of each of the different strata types; this includes a metric on the open strata that becomes singular
at the strata boundary, with the latter a type of projective infinity for the given metric. The approach
reveals and exploits interesting highly non-linear relationships between different linear geometric
partial differential equations. Apart from their direct significance, the results show that,
for the metrizability equation, strong results arising for so-called normal BGG solutions, and
the corresponding projective holonomy reduction, extend to a far wider class of solutions. The
work also provides new results for the projective compactification of scalar-flat metrics.
