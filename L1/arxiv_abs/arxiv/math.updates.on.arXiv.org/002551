In this paper, the edge caching problem in fog radio access networks (F-RAN) is investigated. By
maximizing the overall cache hit rate, the edge caching optimization problem is formulated to find
the optimal edge caching policy. We consider content popularity in terms of time and space from the
perspective of regional users. Taking into account that users request the contents they are interested
in, we propose an online content popularity prediction algorithm by leveraging the content features
and user preferences, and an offline user preference learning algorithm by using the "Online Gradient
Descent" (OGD) method and the "Follow The (Proximally) Regularized Leader" (FTRL-Proximal) method.
Our proposed edge caching policy not only can promptly predict the future content popularity in
an online fashion with low computational complexity, but it also can track the content popularity
with spatial and temporal popularity dynamics in time without delay. We theoretically derive the
upper bound of the popularity prediction error, the lower bound of the cache hit rate, and the regret
bound of the overall cache hit rate of our proposed edge caching policy. Furthermore, to implement
our proposed edge caching policy, we design two learning based edge caching architectures for F-RAN,
which have the capability of flexibly setting the monitoring cycle and is effective in various edge
caching scenarios. Simulation results show that the overall cache hit rate of our proposed policy
is superior to those of the traditional policies and asymptotically approaches the optimal performance.
