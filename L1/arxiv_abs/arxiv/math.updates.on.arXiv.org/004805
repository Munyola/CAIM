We investigate the dynamics of a limit of interacting FitzHugh-Nagumo neurons in the regime of large
interaction coefficients. We consider the dynamics described by a mean-field model given by a nonlinear
evolution partial differential equation representing the probability distribution of one given
neuron in a large network. The case of weak connectivity previously studied displays a unique, exponentially
stable, stationary solution. Here, we consider the case of strong connectivities, and exhibit
the presence of possibly non-unique stationary behaviors or non-stationary behaviors. To this
end, using Hopf-Cole transformation, we demonstrate that the solutions exponentially concentrate
around a singular Dirac measure as the connectivity parameter diverges, centered at the zeros of
a time-dependent continuous function. We next characterize the points at which this measure concentrates,
and exhibit a particular solution corresponding to a Dirac measure concentrated on a time-dependent
point satisfying an ordinary differential equation identical to the original FitzHugh-Nagumo
system. This solution may thus feature multiple stable fixed points or periodic orbits, respectively
corresponding to a clumping of the whole system at rest, or a synchronization of cells on a periodic
solution. We illustrate these results with numerical simulations of neural networks with a relatively
modest number of neurons and finite coupling strength, and show that away from the bifurcations
of the limit system, the asymptotic equation recovers the main properties of more realistic networks.
