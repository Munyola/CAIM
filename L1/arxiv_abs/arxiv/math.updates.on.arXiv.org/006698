We compare and contrast information provided by the energy analysis of Kreiss and the entropy theory
of Tadmor for systems of nonlinear hyperbolic conservation laws. The two-dimensional nonlinear
shallow water equations are used to highlight the similarities and differences since the total
energy of the system is a mathematical entropy function. We demonstrate that the classical energy
method is consistent with the entropy analysis, but significantly more fundamental as it guides
proper boundary treatments. In particular, the energy analysis provides information on what type
of and how many boundary conditions are required, which is lacking in the entropy analysis. For the
shallow water system we determine the number and the type of boundary conditions needed for subcritical
and supercritical flows on a general domain. As eigenvalues are augmented in the nonlinear analysis,
we find that a flow may be classified as subcritical, but the treatment of the boundary resembles
that of a supercritical flow. Because of this, we show that the nonlinear energy analysis leads to
a different number of boundary conditions compared with the linear energy analysis. We also demonstrate
that the entropy estimate leads to erroneous boundary treatments by over specifying and/or under
specifying boundary data causing the loss of existence and/or energy bound, respectively. Our
analysis reveals that the nonlinear energy analysis is the only one that provides an estimate for
open boundaries. Both the entropy and linear energy analysis fail.
