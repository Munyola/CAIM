This thesis presents fuzzy-L1 adaptive controller and Model Reference Adaptive Control (MRAC)
with Prescribed Performance Function (PPF) as two adaptive approaches for high nonlinear systems
as two original contribution to the literature. L1 adaptive controller has a structure that allows
decoupling between robustness and adaption owing to the use of a low pass filter with adjustable
gain in the feedback loop. A practical new fuzzy based approach for the tuning of the feedback filter
of L1 adaptive controller is proposed. The fuzzy controller is optimally tuned using Particle Swarm
Optimization (PSO) to minimize the tracking error and the control signal range. An adaptive control
of multi-input multi-output uncertain high-order nonlinear system capable of guaranteeing a
predetermined prescribed performance is presented as MRAC with PPF. Keywords: Review, L1 adaptive
