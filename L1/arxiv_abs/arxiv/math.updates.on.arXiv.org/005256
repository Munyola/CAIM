Suppose $F:=(f_1,\ldots,f_n)$ is a system of random $n$-variate polynomials with $f_i$ having
degree $\leq\!d_i$ and the coefficient of $x^{a_1}_1\cdots x^{a_n}_n$ in $f_i$ being an independent
complex Gaussian of mean $0$ and variance $\frac{d_i!}{a_1!\cdots a_n!\left(d_i-\sum^n_{j=1}a_j
\right)!}$. Recent progress on Smale's 17th Problem by Lairez --- building upon seminal work of
Shub, Beltran, Pardo, B\"{u}rgisser, and Cucker --- has resulted in a deterministic algorithm
that finds a single (complex) approximate root of $F$ using just $N^{O(1)}$ arithmetic operations
on average, where $N\!:=\!\sum^n_{i=1}\frac{(n+d_i)!}{n!d_i!}$ ($=n(n+\max_i d_i)^{O(\min\{n,\max_i
d_i)\}}$) is the maximum possible total number of monomial terms for such an $F$. However, can one
go faster when the number of terms is smaller, and we restrict to real coefficient and real roots?
And can one still maintain average-case polynomial-time with more general probability measures?
We show the answer is yes when $F$ is instead a binomial system --- a case whose numerical solution
is a key step in polyhedral homotopy algorithms for solving arbitrary polynomial systems. We give
a deterministic algorithm that finds a real approximate root (or correctly decides there are none)
using just $O(n^2(\log(n)+\log\max_i d_i))$ arithmetic operations on average. Furthermore,
our approach allows Gaussians with arbitrary variance. We also discuss briefly the obstructions
to maintaining average-case time polynomial in $n\log \max_i d_i$ when $F$ has more terms.
