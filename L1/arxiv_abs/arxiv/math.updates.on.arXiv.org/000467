Arithmetic combinatorics is often concerned with the problem of bounding the behaviour of arbitrary
finite sets in a group or ring with respect to arithmetic operations such as addition or multiplication.
Similarly, combinatorial geometry is often concerned with the problem of bounding the behaviour
of arbitrary finite collections of geometric objects such as points, lines, or circles with respect
to geometric operations such as incidence or distance. Given the presence of arbitrary finite sets
in these problems, the methods used to attack these problems have primarily been combinatorial
in nature. In recent years, however, many outstanding problems in these questions have been solved
by algebraic means (and more specifically, using tools from algebraic geometry and/or algebraic
topology), giving rise to an emerging set of techniques which is now known as the polynomial method.
While various instances of the polynomial method have been known for decades (e.g. Stepanov's method,
the combinatorial nullstellensatz, or Baker's theorem), the general theory of this method is still
in the process of maturing; in particular, the limitations of the polynomial method are not well
understood, and there is still considerable scope to apply deeper results from algebraic geometry
or algebraic topology to strengthen the method further. In this survey we present several of the
known applications of these methods, focusing on the simplest cases to illustrate the techniques.
We will assume as little prior knowledge of algebraic geometry as possible.
