This paper serves as a source of examples of Rokhlin actions or approximately representable actions
of finite groups on C*-algebras satisfying a certain UHF-absorption condition. We show that given
any finite group $G$ and a separable, unital C*-algebra $A$ that absorbs $M_{|G|^\infty}$ tensorially,
one can lift any group homomorphism $G\to\operatorname{Aut}(A)/_{\approx_u}$ to an honest Rokhlin
action $\gamma$ of $G$ on $A$. Unitality may be dropped in favour of stable rank one. If $A$ belongs
to a certain class of C*-algebras that is classifiable by a suitable invariant (e.g. the Elliott
invariant), then in fact every $G$-action on the invariant lifts to a Rokhlin action of $G$ on $A$.
For the crossed product C*-algebra $A\rtimes_\gamma G$ of a Rokhlin action on a UHF-absorbing C*-algebra,
an inductive limit decomposition is obtained in terms of $A$ and $\gamma$. If $G$ is assumed to be
abelian, then the dual action $\hat{\gamma}$ is locally representable in a very strong sense. If
additionally $A$ is nuclear, simple and has a unique trace, then $\hat{\gamma}$ has finite Rokhlin
dimension. We then show how some well-known constructions of finite group actions with certain
predescribed properties can be recovered and extended by the main results of this paper, when paired
with known classification theorems. Among these is a range result of Izumi of approximately representable
cyclic group actions on $\mathcal{O}_2$ and Blackadar's famous construction of symmetries on
the CAR algebra whose fixed point algebras have non-trivial $K_1$-groups.
