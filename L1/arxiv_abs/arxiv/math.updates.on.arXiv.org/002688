For a composite containing one isotropic elastic material, with positive Lame moduli, and void,
with the elastic material occupying a prescribed volume fraction $f$, and with the composite being
subject to an average stress, ${{ {\sigma}}}^0$, Gibiansky, Cherkaev, and Allaire provided a sharp
lower bound $W_f({{ {\sigma}}}^0)$ on the minimum compliance energy $\sigma^0:\epsilon^0$,
in which ${ {\epsilon}}^0$ is the average strain. Here we show these bounds also provide sharp bounds
on the possible $({{ {\sigma}}}^0,{{ {\epsilon}}}^0)$-pairs that can coexist in such composites,
and thus solve the weak $G$-closure problem for $3d$-printed materials. The materials we use to
achieve the extremal $(\sigma^0,\epsilon^0)$-pairs are denoted as near optimal pentamodes.
We also consider two-phase composites containing this isotropic elasticity material and a rigid
phase with the elastic material occupying a prescribed volume fraction $f$, and with the composite
being subject to an average strain, $\epsilon^0$. For such composites, Allaire and Kohn provided
a sharp lower bound $\widetilde{W}_f({{ {\epsilon}}}^0)$ on the minimum elastic energy $\sigma^0:\epsilon^0$.
We show that these bounds also provide sharp bounds on the possible $({{ {\sigma}}}^0,{{ {\epsilon}}}^0)$-pairs
that can coexist in such composites of the elastic and rigid phases, and thus solve the weak $G$-closure
problem in this case too. The materials we use to achieve these extremal $({{ {\sigma}}}^0,{{ {\epsilon}}}^0)$-pairs
are denoted as near optimal unimodes.
