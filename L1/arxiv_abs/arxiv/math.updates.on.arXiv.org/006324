The cut-rank of a set $X$ of vertices in a graph $G$ is defined as the rank of the $\lvert X\rvert \times\lvert
V(G)\setminus X\rvert$ $0$-$1$ matrix over the binary field whose $(i,j)$-entry is $1$ if and only
if the $i$-th vertex in $X$ and the $j$-th vertex in $V(G)\setminus X$ are adjacent. We introduce
the graph parameter called the average cut-rank of a graph, defined as the expected value of the cut-rank
of a random set of vertices. We prove that graphs of bounded average cut-rank are well-quasi-ordered
by the induced subgraph relation. In other words, every infinite sequence of graphs $G_1,G_2,\ldots$
of bounded average cut-rank admits a pair $i<j$ such that $G_i$ is isomorphic to an induced subgraph
of $G_j$. As a corollary, we prove that every hereditary class of graphs can be characterized by a
finite list of forbidden induced subgraphs if components of graphs in the class have bounded number
of maximal cliques or maximal independent sets. Another consequence of the above well-quasi-ordering
result is that for each real $\alpha$, the list of induced-subgraph-minimal graphs having average
cut-rank larger than (or greater than) $\alpha$ is finite. We further refine this by providing an
upper bound on the size of obstruction and a lower bound on the number of obstructions for average
cut-rank at most (or smaller than) $\alpha$ for each real $\alpha\ge0$. Finally, we describe explicitly
all graphs of average cut-rank at most $3/2$ and determine up to $3/2$ all possible values that can
be realized as the average cut-rank of some graph.
