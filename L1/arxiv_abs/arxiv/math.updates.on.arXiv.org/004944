Modelling a large bundle of curves arises in a broad spectrum of real applications. However, existing
literature relies primarily on the critical assumption of independent curve observations. In
this paper, we provide a general theory for large-scale Gaussian curve time series, where the temporal
and cross-sectional dependence across multiple curve observations exist and the number of functional
variables, $p,$ may be large relative to the number of observations, $n.$ We propose a novel functional
stability measure for multivariate stationary processes based on their spectral properties and
use it to establish some useful concentration bounds on the sample covariance matrix function.
These concentration bounds serve as a fundamental tool for further theoretical analysis, in particular,
for deriving nonasymptotic upper bounds on the errors of the regularized estimates in high dimensional
settings. As {\it functional principle component analysis} (FPCA) is one of the key techniques
to handle functional data, we also investigate the concentration properties of the relevant estimated
terms under a FPCA framework. To illustrate with an important application, we consider {\it vector
functional autoregressive models} and develop a regularization approach to estimate autoregressive
coefficient functions under the sparsity constraint. Using our derived nonasymptotic results,
we investigate the theoretical properties of the regularized estimate in a "large $p,$ small $n$"
regime. The finite sample performance of the proposed method is examined through simulation studies.
