This paper is dedicated to the question of surjectivity of the Cauchy-Riemann operator on spaces
$\mathcal{EV}(\Omega,E)$ of $\mathcal{C}^{\infty}$-smooth vector-valued functions whose
growth on strips along the real axis with holes $K$ is induced by a family of continuous weights $\mathcal{V}$.
Vector-valued means that these functions have values in a locally convex Hausdorff space $E$ over
$\mathbb{C}$. We characterise the weights $\mathcal{V}$ which give a counterpart of the Grothendieck-K\"othe-Silva
duality $\mathcal{O}(\mathbb{C}\setminus K)/\mathcal{O}(\mathbb{C})\cong\mathscr{A}(K)$
with non-empty compact $K\subset\mathbb{R}$ for weighted holomorphic functions. We use this
duality to prove that the kernel $\operatorname{ker}\overline{\partial}$ of the Cauchy-Riemann
operator $\overline{\partial}$ in $\mathcal{EV}(\Omega):=\mathcal{EV}(\Omega,\mathbb{C})$
has the property $(\Omega)$ of Vogt. Then an application of the splitting theory of Vogt for Fr\'{e}chet
spaces and of Bonet and Doma\'nski for (PLS)-spaces in combination with some previous results on
the surjectivity of the Cauchy-Riemann operator $\overline{\partial}\colon\mathcal{EV}(\Omega)\to\mathcal{EV}(\Omega)$
yields the surjectivity of the Cauchy-Riemann operator on $\mathcal{EV}(\Omega,E)$ if $E:=F_{b}'$
with some Fr\'{e}chet space $F$ satisfying the condition $(DN)$ or if $E$ is an ultrabornological
(PLS)-space having the property $(PA)$. This solves the smooth (holomorphic, distributional)
parameter dependence problem for the Cauchy-Riemann operator on $\mathcal{EV}(\Omega)$.
