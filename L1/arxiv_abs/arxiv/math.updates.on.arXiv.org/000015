We examine a multidimensional optimization problem in the tropical mathematics setting. The problem
is to minimize a nonlinear function defined on a finite-dimensional semimodule over an idempotent
semifield under linear inequality constraints. Given two arbitrary matrices, the objective function
is defined by one of the matrices through the use of multiplicative conjugate transposition, whereas
the inequality constraints are given by the other matrix. We start with an overview of known tropical
optimization problems with both linear and nonlinear objective functions, subject to linear equality
and inequality constraints. A short introduction to tropical algebra is given to provide a formal
framework to solve the optimization problem under study. As a preliminary result, a general solution
to a linear inequality with an arbitrary matrix is presented. We describe an example optimization
problem drawn from project scheduling and then offer a general representation of the problem. Furthermore,
we introduce an additional unknown variable and reduce the problem to solving a linear inequality,
where the new variable plays the role of a parameter. A necessary and sufficient condition for the
inequality to hold is used to evaluate the parameter, whereas the solution of the inequality is taken
as a solution for the optimization problem. As a result, under fairly general conditions, a complete
direct solution to the problem is derived in a compact vector form. Numerical and graphical examples
for two-dimensional problems are given to illustrate obtained solutions.
