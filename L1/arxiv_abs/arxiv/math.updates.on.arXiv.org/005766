We present a monolithic parallel Newton-multigrid solver for nonlinear three dimensional fluid-structure
interactions in Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian formulation. We start with a finite element discretization
of the coupled problem, based on a remapping of the Navier-Stokes equation onto a fixed reference
framework. The strongly coupled fluid-structure interaction problem is discretized with finite
elements in time and finite differences in time. The resulting nonlinear and linear systems of equations
are large and show a very high condition number. We present a novel Newton approach that is based on
two essential ideas: First, a static condensation of solid deformation by exploiting the velocity-deformation
relation $d_t \ut = \vt$. Second, the Jacobian of the fluid-structure interaction system is simplified
by neglecting all derivatives with respect to the ALE deformation, an approximation that has shown
to have little impact. The resulting system of equation decouples into a joint momentum equation
and into two separated equations for the deformation fields in solid and fluid. Besides a reduction
of the problem sizes, the approximation has a positive effect on the conditioning of the systems
such that multigrid solvers with simple smoothers like a parallel Vanka-iteration can be applied.
We demonstrate the efficiency of the resulting solver infrastructure on a well-studied 2d test-case
and we also introduce a challenging 3d problem. For 3d problems we achieve a substantial acceleration
as compared to established approaches found in literature.
