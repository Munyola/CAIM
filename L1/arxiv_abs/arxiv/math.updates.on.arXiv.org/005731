We implement our new Separation of Variables (SoV) approach for open quantum integrable models
associated to higher rank representations of the reflection algebras. We construct the (SoV) basis
for the fundamental representations of the $Y(gl_n)$ reflection algebra associated to general
integrable boundary conditions. Moreover, we give the conditions on the boundary $K$-matrices
allowing for the transfer matrix to be diagonalizable with simple spectrum. These SoV basis are
then used to completely characterize the transfer matrix spectrum for the rank one and two reflection
algebras. The rank one case is developed for both the rational and trigonometric fundamental representations
of the 6-vertex reflection algebra. On the one hand, we extend the complete spectrum characterization
to representations previously lying outside the SoV approach, e.g. those for which the standard
Algebraic Bethe Ansatz applies. On the other hand, we show that our new SoV construction can be reduced
to the generalized Sklyanin's one whenever it is applicable. The rank two case is developed explicitly
for the fundamental representations of the $Y(gl_3)$ reflection algebra associated to general
integrable boundary conditions. For both rank one and two our SoV approach leads to a complete characterization
of the transfer matrix spectrum in terms of a set of polynomial solutions to the corresponding quantum
spectral curve equation. Those are finite difference functional equations of order equal to the
rank plus one, i.e., here two and three respectively for the $Y(gl_2)$ and $Y(gl_3)$ reflection
algebras.
