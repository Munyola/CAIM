The defining equation $(\ast):\ \dot \omega\_t=-F'(\omega\_t),$ of a gradient flow is kinetic
in essence. This article explores some dynamical (rather than kinetic) features of gradient flows
(i) by embedding equation $(\ast)$ into the family of slowed down gradient flow equations: $\dot
\omega ^{ \varepsilon}\_t=- \varepsilon F'( \omega ^{ \varepsilon}\_t),$ where $\varepsilon>0$,
and (ii) by considering the \emph{accelerations} $\ddot \omega ^{ \varepsilon}\_t$. We shall
focus on Wasserstein gradient flows. Our approach is mainly heuristic. It relies on Otto calculus.A
special formulation of the Schr{\"o}dinger problem consists in minimizing some action on the Wasserstein
space of probability measures on a Riemannian manifold subject to fixed initial and final data.
We extend this action minimization problem by replacing the usual entropy, underlying Schr{\"o}dinger
problem, with a general function of the Wasserstein space. The corresponding minimal cost approaches
the squared Wasserstein distance when some fluctuation parameter tends to zero. We show heuristically
that the solutions satisfy a Newton equation, extending a recent result of Conforti. The connection
with Wasserstein gradient flows is established and various inequalities, including evolutional
variational inequalities and contraction inequality under curvature-dimension condition,
are derived with a heuristic point of view. As a rigorous result we prove a new and general contraction
inequality for the Schr{\"o}dinger problem under a Ricci lower bound on a smooth and compact Riemannian
manifold.
