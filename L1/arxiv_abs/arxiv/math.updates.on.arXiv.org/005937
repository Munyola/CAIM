In this paper we establish an exact relationship between the asymptotic probability distributions
$\nu_0$ and $\nu_2$ of the multiple point range of the planar random walk and the proper functions
$\Gamma^{[0]}$ and $\Gamma^{[2]}$ respectively of the planar, complex $\phi^4$-theory, setting
the number of components $m=0$: The characteristic functions $\Phi_0$ and $\Phi_2$ of $\nu_0$
and $\nu_2$ have simple integral transforms $\zeta^{[0]}$ and $\zeta^{[2]}$ respectively which
turn out to be the extensions of the proper functions $\Gamma^{[0]}$ and $\Gamma^{[2]}$ onto a Riemann
surface (with infinitely many sheets) in the coupling constant $g$ and are well defined mathematically.
$\zeta^{[0]}$ and $\zeta^{[2]}$ restricted to a specific sheet have a (sectorwise) uniform asymptotic
expansion in $g=0$. The standard perturbation series of $\Gamma^{[0]}$ and $\Gamma^{[2]}$ in
$g$ have expansion coefficients $\Gamma^{[0],pt}_r$ and $\Gamma^{[2],pt}_r$ which are polynomials
in $m$. Order by order the lowest nontrivial polynomial coefficient in $m$: $\Gamma^{[0],pt}_{r,1}
= \zeta^{[0]}_{r}$ and $\Gamma^{[2],pt}_{r,0} = \zeta^{[2]}_{r}$ where $\zeta^{[0]}_{r}$
and $\zeta^{[2]}_{r}$ are the coefficients of the asymptotic series of $\zeta^{[0]}$ and $\zeta^{[2]}$
around $g=0$ respectively. $\Phi_0$ and $\Phi_2$ turn out to be modified Borel type summations
of those series. \\ As an application we derive the rising edge behaviour of $\nu_0$ and $\nu_2$ from
the large order estimates of Lipatov \citep{lipatov}. It turns out to be of the form of a Gamma distribution
with parameters known numerically.
