This paper deals with fast simulations of the haemodynamics in large arteries by considering a reduced
model of the associated fluid-structure interaction problem, which in turn allows an additional
reduction in terms of the numerical discretisation. The resulting method is both accurate and computationally
cheap. This goal is achieved by means of two levels of reduction: first, we describe the model equations
with a reduced mathematical formulation which allows to write the fluid-structure interaction
problem as a Navier-Stokes system with non-standard boundary conditions; second, we employ numerical
reduction techniques to further and drastically lower the computational costs. The numerical
reduction is obtained coupling two well-known techniques: the proper orthogonal decomposition
and the reduced basis method, in particular the greedy algorithm. We start by reducing the numerical
dimension of the problem at hand with a proper orthogonal decomposition and we measure the system
energy with specific norms; this allows to take into account the different orders of magnitude of
the state variables, the velocity and the pressure. Then, we introduce a strategy based on a greedy
procedure which aims at enriching the reduced discretization space with low offline computational
costs. As application, we consider a realistic haemodynamics problem with a perturbation in the
boundary conditions and we show the good performances of the reduction techniques presented in
the paper. The gains obtained in term of CPU time are of three orders of magnitude.
