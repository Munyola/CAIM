Many optimization problems admit a number of local optima, among which there is the global optimum.
For these problems, various heuristic optimization methods have been proposed. Comparing the
results of these solvers requires the definition of suitable metrics. In the electrical energy
systems literature, simple metrics such as best value obtained, the mean value, the median or the
standard deviation of the solutions are still used. However, the comparisons carried out with these
metrics are rather weak, and on these bases a somehow uncontrolled proliferation of heuristic solvers
is taking place. This paper addresses the overall issue of understanding the reasons of this proliferation,
showing a conceptual scheme that indicates how the assessment of the best solver may result in the
unlimited formulation of new solvers. Moreover, this paper shows how the use of more refined metrics
defined to compare the optimization result, associated with the definition of appropriate benchmarks,
may make the comparisons among the solvers more robust. The proposed metrics are based on the concept
of first-order stochastic dominance and are defined for the cases in which: (i) the globally optimal
solution can be found (for testing purposes); and (ii) the number of possible solutions is so large
that practically it cannot be guaranteed that the global optimum has been found. Illustrative examples
are provided for a typical problem in the electrical energy systems area-distribution network
reconfiguration. The conceptual results obtained are generally valid to compare the results of
other optimization problems.
