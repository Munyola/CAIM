Frolov's cubature formula on the unit hypercube has been considered important since it attains
an optimal rate of convergence for various function spaces. Its integration nodes are given by shrinking
a suitable full rank $\mathbb{Z}$-lattice in $\mathbb{R}^d$ and taking all points inside the unit
cube. The main drawback of these nodes is that they are hard to find computationally, especially
in high dimensions.In such situations, quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) rules based on digital nets have
proven to be successful. However, there is still no construction known that leads to QMC rules which
are optimal in the same generality as Frolov's. In this paper we investigate a polynomial analog
of Frolov's cubature formula, which we expect to be important in this respect. This analog is defined
in a field of Laurent series with coefficients in a finite field. A similar approach was previously
studied in [M.~B.~Levin. Adelic constructions of low discrepancy sequences. Online Journal of
Analytic Combinatorics. Issue 5, 2010.]. We show that our construction is a $(t,m,d)$-net, which
also implies bounds on its star-discrepancy and the error of the corresponding cubature rule. Moreover,
we show that our cubature rule is a QMC rule, whereas Frolov's is not, and provide an algorithm to determine
its integration nodes explicitly. To this end we need to extend the notion of $(t,m,d)$-nets to fit
the situation that the points can have infinite digit expansion and develop a duality theory. Additionally,
we adapt the notion of admissible lattices to our setting and prove its significance.
