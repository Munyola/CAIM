Let $(\Omega,\mathcal{F},\mathbb{P})$ be a probability space and $\varphi:\ \Omega\times[0,\infty)\to[0,\infty)$
be a Musielak-Orlicz function. In this article, the authors prove that the Doob maximal operator
is bounded on the Musielak-Orlicz space $L^{\varphi}(\Omega)$. Using this and extrapolation
method, the authors then establish a Fefferman-Stein vector-valued Doob maximal inequality on
$L^{\varphi}(\Omega)$. As applications, the authors obtain the dual version of the Doob maximal
inequality and the Stein inequality for $L^{\varphi}(\Omega)$, which are new even in weighted
Orlicz spaces. The authors then establish the atomic characterizations of martingale Musielak-Orlicz
Hardy spaces $H_{\varphi}^s(\Omega)$, $P_{\varphi}(\Omega)$, $Q_{\varphi}(\Omega)$, $H_{\varphi}^S(\Omega)$
and $H_{\varphi}^M(\Omega)$. From these atomic characterizations, the authors further deduce
some martingale inequalities between different martingale Musielak-Orlicz Hardy spaces, which
essentially improve the corresponding results in Orlicz space case and are also new even in weighted
Orlicz spaces. By establishing the Davis decomposition on $H_{\varphi}^S(\Omega)$ and $H_{\varphi}^M(\Omega)$,
the authors obtain the Burkholder-Davis-Gundy inequality associated with Musielak--Orlicz
functions. Finally, using the previous martingale inequalities, the authors prove that the maximal
Fej\'er operator is bounded from $H_{\varphi}[0,1)$ to $L^{\varphi}[0,1)$, which further implies
some convergence results of the Fej\'er means; these results are new even for the weighted Hardy
spaces.
