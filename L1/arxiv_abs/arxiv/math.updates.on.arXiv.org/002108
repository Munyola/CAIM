The well known associativity property of the crossed product by a semi-direct product of discrete
groups is generalized into the context of discrete quantum groups. This decomposition allows to
define an appropriate triangulated functor in such a way that if $\mathbb{F}:=\Gamma \underset{\alpha}{\ltimes}\mathbb{G}$
is a quantum semi-direct product where $\Gamma$ is a discrete group and $\mathbb{G}$ is a compact
quantum group, then we prove that the (quantum) Baum-Connes property for $\widehat{\mathbb{F}}$
with coefficients in a $\widehat{\mathbb{F}}$-$C^*$-algebra $A$ is equivalent to the Baum-Connes
property for $\Gamma$ with coefficients in $\widehat{\mathbb{G}}\underset{r}{\ltimes} A$
and the Baum-Connes property for $\widehat{\mathbb{G}}$ with coefficients in $A$ (under the torsion-freeness
assumption). The $K$-amenability connexion between $\widehat{\mathbb{F}}$, $\Gamma$ and $\widehat{\mathbb{G}}$
is investigated as well as the torsion phenomena of $\widehat{\mathbb{F}}$ in terms of the torsion
of $\Gamma$ and $\widehat{\mathbb{G}}$. The analogous strategy is applied for the dual of a quantum
direct product $\mathbb{F}:=\mathbb{G}\times \mathbb{H}$. Moreover, we obtain a relation between
the Baum-Connes property for $\widehat{\mathbb{F}}$ and the K\"{u}nneth formula. Again the $K$-amenability
connexion between $\widehat{\mathbb{F}}$, $\widehat{\mathbb{G}}$ and $\widehat{\mathbb{H}}$
is investigated as well as the torsion phenomena of $\widehat{\mathbb{F}}$ in terms of the torsion
of $\widehat{\mathbb{G}}$ and $\widehat{\mathbb{H}}$.
