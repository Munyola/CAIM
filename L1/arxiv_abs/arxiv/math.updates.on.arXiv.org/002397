In this work we consider a class of nonlocal non-autonomous evolution problems, which arise in neuronal
activity, \[ \begin{cases} \partial_t u(t,x) =- a(t)u(t,x) + b(t) \displaystyle\int_{\mathbb{R}^N}
J(x,y)f(t,u(t,y))dy -h +S(t,x) ,\ t\geq\tau \in \mathbb{R},\ x \in \Omega, u(\tau,x)=u_\tau(x),\
x\in\Omega u(t,x)= 0,\ t\geq\tau,\ x \in\mathbb{R}^N\backslash\Omega. \end{cases} \] Under
suitable assumptions on the nonlinearity $f: \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R} \to\mathbb{R}$ and
constraints on the functions $J: \mathbb{R}^N \times \mathbb{R}^{N}\to \mathbb{R}$;\, $S: \mathbb{R}
\times \mathbb{R}^{N}\to\mathbb{R}$ and $a,b:\mathbb{R} \to\mathbb{R}$, we study the assimptotic
behavior of the evolution process, generated by this problem, in an appropriated Banach space.%
and we present a brief discussion on the model with a biological interpretation. We prove results
on existence, uniqueness and smoothness of the solutions and the existence of pullback attracts
for the evolution process associated to this problem. We also prove a continuous dependence of the
evolution process with respect to stimulus function $S$, which allows us to conclude that the neuronal
activity depends continuously on the sum of external stimulus involved in the neuronal system,
reinforcing the need for intensive therapies to stimulate people with poor neuronal activity as
in some cases of autism, microcephaly or other neurological desorders. Furthermore, using the
result of continuous dependence of the evolution process, we also prove the upper semicontinuity
of pullback attracts with respect to stimulus function, $S$.
