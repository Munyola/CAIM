The two-sender groupcast index coding problem (TGICP) consists of a set of receivers, where all
the messages demanded by the set of receivers are distributed among the two senders. The senders
can possibly have a set of messages in common. Each message can be demanded by more than one receiver.
Each receiver has a subset of messages (known as its side information) and demands a message it does
not have. The objective is to design scalar linear codes at the senders with the minimum aggregate
code length such that all the receivers are able to decode their demands, by leveraging the knowledge
of the side information of all the receivers. In this work, optimal scalar linear codes of three sub-problems
(considered as single-sender groupcast index coding problems (SGICPs)) of the TGICP are used to
construct optimal scalar linear codes for some classes of the TGICP. We introduce the notion of joint
extensions of a finite number of SGICPs, which generalizes the notion of extensions of a single SGICP
introduced in a prior work. An SGICP $\mathcal{I}_E$ is said to be a joint extension of a finite number
of SGICPs if all the SGICPs are disjoint sub-problems of $\mathcal{I}_E$. We identify a class of
joint extensions, where optimal scalar linear codes of the joint extensions can be constructed
using those of the sub-problems. We then construct scalar linear codes for some classes of the TGICP,
when one or more sub-problems of the TGICP belong to the above identified class of joint extensions,
and provide some necessary conditions for the optimality of the construction.
