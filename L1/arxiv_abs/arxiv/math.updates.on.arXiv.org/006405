Dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) is a data-driven method that models high-dimensional time series
as a sum of spatiotemporal modes, where the temporal modes are constrained by linear dynamics. For
nonlinear dynamical systems exhibiting strongly coherent structures, DMD can be a useful approximation
to extract dominant, interpretable modes. In many domains with large spatiotemporal data---including
fluid dynamics, video processing, and finance---the dynamics of interest are often perturbations
about fixed points or equilibria, which motivates the application of DMD to centered (i.e. mean-subtracted)
data. In this work, we show that DMD with centered data is equivalent to incorporating an affine term
in the dynamic model and is not equivalent to computing a discrete Fourier transform. Importantly,
DMD with centering can always be used to compute eigenvalue spectra of the dynamics. However, in
many cases DMD without centering cannot model the corresponding dynamics, most notably if the dynamics
have full effective rank. Additionally, we generalize the notion of centering to extracting arbitrary,
but known, fixed frequencies from the data. We corroborate these theoretical results numerically
on three nonlinear examples: the Lorenz system, a surveillance video, and brain recordings. Since
centering the data is simple and computationally efficient, we recommend it as a preprocessing
step before DMD; furthermore, we suggest that it can be readily used in conjunction with many other
popular implementations of the DMD algorithm.
