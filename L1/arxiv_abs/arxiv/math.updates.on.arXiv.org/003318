This project investigates numerical methods for solving fully coupled forward-backward stochastic
differential equations (FBSDEs) of McKean-Vlasov type. Having numerical solvers for such mean
field FBSDEs is of interest because of the potential application of these equations to optimization
problems over a large population, say for instance mean field games (MFG) and optimal mean field
control problems. Theory for this kind of problems has met with great success since the early works
on mean field games by Lasry and Lions, see \cite{Lasry_Lions}, and by Huang, Caines, and Malham\'{e},
see \cite{Huang}. Generally speaking, the purpose is to understand the continuum limit of optimizers
or of equilibria (say in Nash sense) as the number of underlying players tends to infinity. When approached
from the probabilistic viewpoint, solutions to these control problems (or games) can be described
by coupled mean field FBSDEs, meaning that the coefficients depend upon the own marginal laws of
the solution. In this note, we detail two methods for solving such FBSDEs which we implement and apply
to five benchmark problems. The first method uses a tree structure to represent the pathwise laws
of the solution, whereas the second method uses a grid discretization to represent the time marginal
laws of the solutions. Both are based on a Picard scheme; importantly, we combine each of them with
a generic continuation method that permits to extend the time horizon (or equivalently the coupling
strength between the two equations) for which the Picard iteration converges.
