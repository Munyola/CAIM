As the sequel of the previous work, we investigate the variational calculus in the study of modular
geometry on noncommutative (two) tori, oriented by conceptual interpretations of the celebrated
Connes-Moscovici functional relation. Starting with Lesch's work, we introduce several operators
acting on the space of spectral functions coming from the first variation of the modular derivation
and integration by parts with respect to the volume weight. The new contribution is some internal
relations which allow us to use only two operators to generate the whole variational calculus. In
particular, these two operators indeed generate the Connes-Moscovici functional relation which
makes the symmetries behind the relation observed before more transparent. For the geometric side,
we compute, on noncommutative tori, the first variation of the Einstein-Hilbert and the Osgood-Phillips-Sarnak
functional (later one holds only in dimension two) in two ways and derive a family of Connes-Moscovici
functional relation parametrized by the dimension. In the previous work, we have provided explicit
solutions of those functional relations using Gauss and Appell hypergeometric functions. A surprising
discovery is that the functional relation still holds when the dimension parameter takes real-value.
Last but not least, we perform parallel variational computation in terms of both the Weyl factor
and its logarithm and give detailed comparison. A significant consequence is to show that the new
structure that we reveal in the functional relation transforms accordingly with respect to the
noncommutative change of variable.
