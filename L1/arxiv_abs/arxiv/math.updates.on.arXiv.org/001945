We develop a method for incorporating relevant non-Euclidean geometric information into a broad
range of classical filtering and statistical or machine learning algorithms. We apply these techniques
to approximate the solution of the non-Euclidean filtering problem to arbitrary precision. We
then extend the particle filtering algorithm to compute our asymptotic solution to arbitrary precision.
Moreover, we find explicit error bounds measuring the discrepancy between our locally triangulated
filter and the true theoretical non-Euclidean filter. Our methods are motivated by certain fundamental
problems in mathematical finance. In particular we apply these filtering techniques to incorporate
the non-Euclidean geometry present in stochastic volatility models and optimal Markowitz portfolios.
We also extend Euclidean statistical or machine learning algorithms to non-Euclidean problems
by using the local triangulation technique, which we show improves the accuracy of the original
algorithm. We apply the local triangulation method to obtain improvements of the (sparse) principal
component analysis and the principal geodesic analysis algorithms and show how these improved
algorithms can be used to parsimoniously estimate the evolution of the shape of forward-rate curves.
While focused on financial applications, the non-Euclidean geometric techniques presented in
this paper can be employed to provide improvements to a range of other statistical or machine learning
algorithms and may be useful in other areas of application.
