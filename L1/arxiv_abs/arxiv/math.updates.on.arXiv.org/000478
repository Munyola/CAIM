We consider a class of discrete q-state spin models defined in terms of a translation-invariant
quasilocal specification with discrete clock-rotation invariance which have extremal Gibbs
measures labelled by the uncountably many values in the one-dimensional sphere (introduced by
van Enter, Opoku, Kuelske). In the present paper we construct an associated Markov jump process
with quasilocal rates whose semigroup acts by a continuous rotation. The jump rates are given in
terms of certain expectations w.r.t. continuous-spin Gibbs measures constrained to take prescribed
discretization values, which yields quasilocality in a regime of fine discretizations. We then
show that the infinite-volume discretization map is an equivariant bijection for the rotation
action on continuous-spin Gibbs measures and discrete Gibbs measures. As a further consequence
our construction provides examples of interacting particle systems with unique invariant measure,
which is not long-time limit of all starting measures, answering an old question (compare Liggett's
book question four chapter one.) The construction of this particle system is inspired by recent
conjectures of Maes and Shlosman about the intermediate temperature regime of the nearest neighbor
clock-model. We define our generator of the interacting particle system as a (non-commuting) sum
of the rotation part and a Glauber part. Technically the paper rests on the control of the spread of
weak non-localities and relative entropy-methods, both in equilibrium and dynamically, based
on Dobrushin-uniqueness bounds for conditional measures.
