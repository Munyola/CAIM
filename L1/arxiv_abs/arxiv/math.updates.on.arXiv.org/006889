The paper deals with a three-parameter family of special double confluent Heun equations that was
introduced and studied by V.M.Buchstaber and S.I.Tertychnyi as an equivalent presentation of
a model of overdamped Josephson junction in superconductivity. The parameters are $l,\lambda,\mu\in\mathbb
R$. Buchstaber and Tertychnyi described those parameter values, for which the corresponding equation
has a polynomial solution. They have shown that for $\mu\neq0$ this happens exactly when $l\in\mathbb
N$ and the parameters $(\lambda,\mu)$ lie on an algebraic curve $\Gamma_l\subset\mathbb C^2_{(\lambda,\mu)}$
called the {\it $l$-determinantal curve} and defined as zero locus of determinant of a remarkable
three-diagonal $l\times l$-matrix. In the present paper we prove irreducibility of the determinantal
curve $\Gamma_l$ for every $l$. We also calculate its genus for $l\leqslant20$ and present a conjecture
on general genus formula. We apply the irreducibility result to the phase-lock areas of the mentioned
above model of Josephson effect, which is a family of dynamical systems on 2-torus. The {\it phase-lock
areas} are those level sets of the rotation number function $\rho$ in the parameter space that have
non-empty interiors. The family of their boundaries is a countable union of analytic surfaces.
We show that, unexpectedly, its complexification is a complex analytic subset consisting of just
{\it four} irreducible components, and we describe them. We present a Monotonicity Conjecture
on the evolution of the phase-lock area portraits and a partial positive result towards its confirmation.
