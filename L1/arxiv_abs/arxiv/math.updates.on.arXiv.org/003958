Reduced-order modeling (ROM) commonly refers to the construction, based on a few solutions (referred
to as snapshots) of an expensive discretized partial differential equation (PDE), and the subsequent
application of low-dimensional discretizations of partial differential equations (PDEs) that
can be used to more efficiently treat problems in control and optimization, uncertainty quantification,
and other settings that require multiple approximate PDE solutions. In this work, a ROM is developed
and tested for the treatment of nonlinear PDEs whose solutions bifurcate as input parameter values
change. In such cases, the parameter domain can be subdivided into subregions, each of which corresponds
to a different branch of solutions. Popular ROM approaches such as proper orthogonal decomposition
(POD), results in a global low-dimensional basis that does no respect not take advantage of the often
large differences in the PDE solutions corresponding to different subregions. Instead, in the
new method, the k-means algorithm is used to cluster snapshots so that within cluster snapshots
are similar to each other and are dissimilar to those in other clusters. This is followed by the construction
of local POD bases, one for each cluster. The method also can detect which cluster a new parameter
point belongs to, after which the local basis corresponding to that cluster is used to determine
a ROM approximation. Numerical experiments show the effectiveness of the method both for problems
for which bifurcation cause continuous and discontinuous changes in the solution of the PDE.
