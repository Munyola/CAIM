This note is mostly based on the lecture delivered at the conference "Algebraic Analysis and Representation
Theory" in honor of Professor Masaki Kashiwara's 70th birthday. Its main topic is the project aimed
at obtaining the Plancherel formula for the regular representation of Affine Hecke Algebras (AHA)
as the limit $q\to 0$ of the integral-type formulas for DAHA inner products in the polynomial and
related modules. The integrals for the latter as $\Re k>0$ (in the DAHA parameters) must be analytically
continued to negative $\Re k$, which is a $q$-generalization of "picking up residues" due to Arthur,
Heckman, Opdam and others, which can be traced back to Hermann Weyl. We arrive at finite sums of integrals
over double affine residual subtori. This is not related to the DAHA reducibility of the polynomial
and similar modules; the procedure is nontrivial for any $\Re k<0$. Though such formulas can be used
for the DAHA stratification when these modules become reducible for singular (negative) $k$. The
decomposition of the regular AHA representation in terms of (unitary) irreducible modules is an
important part of algebraic harmonic analysis, involving deep geometric methods (Kazhdan- Lusztig
and others). As a possible application, our approach would allow to interpret formal degrees of
AHA discrete series via DAHA. We mainly discuss the spherical case and provide explicit analytic
continuations only for $A_1$. The key is that the uniqueness of the DAHA inner product fixes the $q$-generalization
of the corresponding AHA decomposition (and $q$-counterparts of formal degrees) uniquely.
