We consider extensions of the language of Peano arithmetic by transfinitely iterated truth definitions
satisfying uniform Tarskian biconditionals. Without further axioms, such theories are known
to be conservative extensions of the original system of arithmetic. Much stronger systems, however,
are obtained by adding either induction axioms or reflection axioms on top of them. Theories of this
kind can interpret some well-known predicatively reducible fragments of second-order arithmetic
such as iterated arithmetical comprehension. We obtain sharp results on the proof-theoretic strength
of these systems using methods of provability logic. Reflection principles naturally define unary
operators acting on the semilattice of axiomatizable extensions of our basic theory of iterated
truth. The substructure generated by the top element of this algebra provides a canonical ordinal
notation system for the class of theories under investigation. Using these notations we obtain
conservativity relationships for iterated reflection principles of different logical complexity
levels corresponding to the levels of the hyperarithmetical hierarchy, i.e., the analogs of Schmerl's
formulas. These relationships, in turn, provide proof-theoretic analysis of our systems and of
some related predicatively reducible theories. In particular, we uniformly calculate the ordinals
characterizing the standard measures of their proof-theoretic strength, such as provable well-orderings,
classes of provably recursive functions, and $\Pi_1^0$-ordinals.
