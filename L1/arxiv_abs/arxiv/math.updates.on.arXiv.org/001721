Networks capture pairwise interactions between entities and are frequently used in applications
such as social networks, food networks, and protein interaction networks, to name a few. Communities,
cohesive groups of nodes, often form in these applications, and identifying them gives insight
into the overall organization of the network. One common quality function used to identify community
structure is modularity. In Hu et al. [SIAM J. App. Math., 73(6), 2013], it was shown that modularity
optimization is equivalent to minimizing a particular nonconvex total variation (TV) based functional
over a discrete domain. They solve this problem---assuming the number of communities is known---using
a Merriman, Bence, Osher (MBO) scheme. We show that modularity optimization is equivalent to minimizing
a convex TV-based functional over a discrete domain---again, assuming the number of communities
is known. Furthermore, we show that modularity has no convex relaxation satisfying certain natural
conditions. Despite this, we partially relax the discrete constraint using a Ginzburg Landau functional,
yielding an optimization problem that is more nearly convex. We then derive an MBO algorithm with
fewer parameters than in Hu et al. and which is 7 times faster at solving the associated diffusion
equation due to the fact that the underlying discretization is unconditionally stable. Our numerical
tests include a hyperspectral video whose associated graph has 29 million edges, which is roughly
37 times larger than was handled in the paper of Hu et al.
