A new symbolic algorithmic implementation of the functional-discrete (FD-) method is developed
and justified for the Sturm-Liouville problem on a finite interval in the Hilbert space for the fourth
order ordinary differential equation with polynomial coefficients. The sufficient conditions
of an exponential convergence rate of the proposed approach are received. The obtained estimates
of the absolute errors of FD-method significantly improve the accuracy of the estimates obtained
earlier. The proposed algorithm of our method is developed when the potential functions are approximated
by the identically zero, and for this case, FD-method can be considered as one of the variants of the
homotopy method. Our algorithm is symbolic and operates with the decomposition coefficients of
the eigenfunction corrections in some basis. The number of summands in these decompositions depends
on the degree of the potential coefficients and the correction number. Our method uses only the algebraic
operations and basic operations on $(2\times 1)$ column vectors and $(2\times 2)$ matrices and
does not need solutions of any boundary value problems and computations of any integrals, unlike
the previous variants of FD-method. The corrections to eigenpairs are computed exactly as analytical
expressions, and we have no rounding errors. The numerical examples illustrate the theoretical
results. The numerical results obtained with the FD-method are compared with the numerical test
results obtained with other existing numerical techniques.
