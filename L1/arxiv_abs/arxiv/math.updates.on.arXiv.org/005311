Recent innovations in Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) provide new opportunities
and challenges for integration of distributed energy resources (DERs) into the energy supply system
as active market players. By increasing integration of DERs, novel market platform should be designed
for these new market players. The designed electricity market should maximize market surplus for
consumers and suppliers and provide correct incentives for them to join the market and follow market
rules. In this paper, a feeder-based market is proposed for local energy trading among prosumers
and consumers in the distribution system. In this market, market players are allowed to share energy
with other players in the local market and with neighborhood areas. A Two-StepMarket Clearing (2SMC)
mechanism is proposed for market clearing, in which in the first step, each local market is cleared
independently to determine the market clearing price and in the second step, players can trade energy
with neighborhood areas. In comparison to a centralized market, the proposed method is scalable
and reduces computation overheads, because instead of clearing market for a large number of players,
the market is cleared for a fewer number of players. Also, by applying distributed method and Lagrangian
multipliers for market clearing, there is no need for a central computation centre and private information
of market players. Case studies demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed market
clearing method in increasing social welfare and reducing computation time.
