An $N$-tiling of triangle $ABC$ by triangle $T$ (the "tile") is a way of writing $ABC$ as a union of
$N$ copies of $T$ overlapping only at their boundaries. Let the tile $T$ have angles $(\alpha,\beta,\gamma)$,
and sides $(a,b,c)$. This paper takes up the case when $3\alpha + 2\beta = \pi$. Then there are (as
was already known) exactly five possible shapes of $ABC$: either $ABC$ is isosceles with base angles
$\alpha$, $\beta$, or $\alpha+\beta$, or the angles of $ABC$ are $(2\alpha,\beta,\alpha+\beta)$,
or the angles of $ABC$ are $(2\alpha, \alpha, 2\beta)$. In each of these cases, we have discovered,
and here exhibit, a family of previously unknown tilings. These are tilings that, as far as we know,
have never been seen before. We also discovered, in each of the cases, a Diophantine equation involving
$N$ and the (necessarily rational) number $s = a/c$ that has solutions if, and in some cases only if,
there is a tiling using tile $T$ of some $ABC$ not similar to $T$. By means of these Diophantine equations,
some conclusions about the possible values of $N$ are drawn, in particular there are no tilings possible
for values of $N$ of certain forms. These equations also imply that for each $N$, there is a finite
set of possibilities for the tile $(a,b,c)$ and the triangle $ABC$. (Usually, but not always, there
is just one possible tile.) These equations provide necessary conditions for the existence of $N$-tilings,
and they imply the non-existence of $N$-tilings with $3\alpha + 2\beta = \pi$ for many values of $N$,
including for example $N=7, 11, 19, 31,41, \ldots$.
