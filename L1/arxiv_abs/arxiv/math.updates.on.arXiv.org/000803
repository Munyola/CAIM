In this paper, we investigate the prescribed scalar curvature problem on a non-compact Riemannian
manifold, namely the existence of a conformal deformation of the metric realizing a given function
as its scalar curvature. In particular, our work focuses on the case when the prescribed curvature
changes sign, where a satisfactory theory seems to be still missing. The main achievement is a new
existence result requiring minimal assumptions on the underlying manifold, and ensuring a control
on the stretching factor of the conformal deformation in such a way that the conformally deformed
metric be quasi-isometric to the original one. The topological-geometrical requirements we need
are all encoded in the spectral properties of the standard and conformal Laplacians, which are just
assumed to be subcritical (i.e. they both admit a minimal positive Green kernel on the whole manifold).
Moreover, our techniques are flexible enough to be extended to investigate the existence of entire
positive solutions of quasilinear Yamabe type equations, (Y), driven by a weighted p-Laplacian.
These equations are of interest, for example, in some branches of Physics. In the process of collecting
the necessary material for the proof of our main theorem in the above generality, we have the opportunity
to give some new insight on the subcriticality theory for the Schr\"odinger type operator characterizing
the homogeneous part of (Y), its relations with an appropriate capacity theory, with p-Hardy inequalities
and the p-parabolicity, which might be of independent interest.
