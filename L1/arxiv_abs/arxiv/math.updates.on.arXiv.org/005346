Suppose $(X,\Omega,g)$ is a compact Spin(7)-manifold, e.g. a Riemannian 8-manifold with holonomy
Spin(7), or a Calabi-Yau 4-fold. Let $G$ be U$(m)$ or SU$(m)$, and $P\to X$ be a principal $G$-bundle.
We show that the infinite-dimensional moduli space ${\mathcal B}_P$ of all connections on $P$ modulo
gauge is orientable, in a certain sense. We deduce that the moduli space ${\mathcal M}_P^{Spin(7)}\subset{\mathcal
B}_P$ of irreducible Spin(7)-instanton connections on $P$ modulo gauge, as a manifold or derived
manifold, is orientable. This improves theorems of Cao and Leung arXiv:1502.01141 and Mu\~noz
and Shahbazi arXiv:1707.02998. If $X$ is a Calabi-Yau 4-fold, the derived moduli stack $\boldsymbol{\mathscr
M}$ of (complexes of) coherent sheaves on $X$ is a $-2$-shifted symplectic derived stack $(\boldsymbol{\mathcal
M},\omega)$ by Pantev-To\"en-Vaqui\'e-Vezzosi arXiv:1111.3209, and so has a notion of orientation
by Borisov-Joyce arXiv:1504.00690. We prove that $(\boldsymbol{\mathscr M},\omega)$ is orientable,
by relating algebro-geometric orientations on $(\boldsymbol{\mathscr M},\omega)$ to differential-geometric
orientations on ${\mathcal B}_P$ for U$(m)$-bundles $P\to X$, and using orientability of ${\mathcal
B}_P$. This has applications to the programme of defining Donaldson-Thomas type invariants counting
moduli spaces of (semi)stable coherent sheaves on a Calabi-Yau 4-fold, as in Donaldson and Thomas
1998, Cao and Leung arXiv:1407.7659, and Borisov and Joyce arXiv:1504.00690. This is the third
in a series arXiv:1811.01096, arXiv:1811.02405 on orientations of gauge-theoretic moduli spaces.
