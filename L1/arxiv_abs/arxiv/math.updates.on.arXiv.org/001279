A generic model for the shape optimization problems we consider in this paper is the optimization
of the Dirichlet eigenvalues of the Laplace operator with a volume constraint. We deal with an obstacle
placement problem which can be formulated as the following eigenvalue optimization problem: Fix
two positive real numbers $r_1$ and $A$. We consider a disk $B\subset \mathbb{R}^2$ having radius
$r_1$. We want to place an obstacle $P$ of area $A$ within $B$ so as to maximize or minimize the fundamental
Dirichlet eigenvalue $\lambda_1$ for the Laplacian on $B\setminus P$. That is, we want to study
the behaviour of the function $\rho \mapsto \lambda_1(B\setminus\rho(P))$, where $\rho$ runs
over the set of all rigid motions of the plane fixing the center of mass for $P$ such that $\rho(P)\subset
B$. In this paper, we consider this obstacle placement problem for the case where (i) the obstacle
$P$ is invariant under the action of a dihedral group $\mathbb{D}_n, n >= 3,$ $n$ even, (ii) $P$ and
$B$ have distinct centers, and (iii) the boundary $\partial P$ of $P$ satisfy certain monotonicity
condition between each pair of consecutive axes of symmetry of $P$. The extremal configurations
correspond to the cases where an axis of symmetry of $P$ coincide with an axis of symmetry of $B$. We
also characterize the maximizing and the minimizing configurations in our main result, viz., Theorem
4.1. Further, we give many different generalizations of our result. At the end, we provide some numerical
evidence to validate our main theorem for the case where the obstacle $P$ has $\mathbb{D}_4$ symmetry.
