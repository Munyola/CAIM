In empirical work in economics it is common to report standard errors that account for clustering
of units. Typically, the motivation given for the clustering adjustments is that unobserved components
in outcomes for units within clusters are correlated. However, because correlation may occur across
more than one dimension, this motivation makes it difficult to justify why researchers use clustering
in some dimensions, such as geographic, but not others, such as age cohorts or gender. It also makes
it difficult to explain why one should not cluster with data from a randomized experiment. In this
paper, we argue that clustering is in essence a design problem, either a sampling design or an experimental
design issue. It is a sampling design issue if sampling follows a two stage process where in the first
stage, a subset of clusters were sampled randomly from a population of clusters, while in the second
stage, units were sampled randomly from the sampled clusters. In this case the clustering adjustment
is justified by the fact that there are clusters in the population that we do not see in the sample.
Clustering is an experimental design issue if the assignment is correlated within the clusters.
We take the view that this second perspective best fits the typical setting in economics where clustering
adjustments are used. This perspective allows us to shed new light on three questions: (i) when should
one adjust the standard errors for clustering, (ii) when is the conventional adjustment for clustering
appropriate, and (iii) when does the conventional adjustment of the standard errors matter.
