Two-level domain decomposition methods are very powerful techniques for the efficient numerical
solution of partial differential equations (PDEs). A two-level domain decomposition method requires
two main components: a one-level preconditioner (or its corresponding smoothing iterative method),
which is based on domain decomposition techniques, and a coarse correction step, which relies on
a coarse space. The coarse space must properly represent the error components that the chosen one-level
method is not capable to deal with. In the literature most of the works introduced efficient coarse
spaces obtained as the span of functions defined on the entire space domain of the considered PDE.
Therefore, the corresponding two-level preconditioners and iterative methods are defined in
volume. In this paper, a new class of substructured two-level methods is introduced, for which both
domain decomposition smoothers and coarse correction steps are defined on the interfaces. This
approach has several advantages. On the one hand, the required computational effort is cheaper
than the one required by classical volumetric two-level methods. On the other hand, it allows one
to use some of the well-known efficient coarse spaces proposed in the literature. Moreover, our
new substructured framework can be efficiently extended to a multi-level framework, which is always
desirable when the high dimension or the scarce quality of the coarse space prevent the efficient
numerical solution. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed new
numerical framework.
