By making use of our generalization of Barrucand and Cohn's theory of principal factorizations
in pure cubic fields \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[3]{D})\) and their Galois closures \(\mathbb{Q}(\zeta_3,\sqrt[3]{D})\)
with \(3\) possible types to pure quintic fields \(L=\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[5]{D})\) and their pure
metacyclic normal fields \(N=\mathbb{Q}(\zeta_5,\sqrt[5]{D})\) with \(13\) possible types,
we compile an extensive database with arithmetical invariants of the \(900\) pairwise non-isomorphic
fields \(N\) having normalized radicands in the range \(2\le D<10^3\). Our classification is based
on the Galois cohomology of the unit group \(U_N\), viewed as a module over the automorphism group
\(\mathrm{Gal}(N/K)\) of \(N\) over the cyclotomic field \(K=\mathbb{Q}(\zeta_5)\), by employing
theorems of Hasse and Iwasawa on the Herbrand quotient of the unit norm index \((U_K:N_{N/K}(U_N))\)
by the number \(\#(\mathcal{P}_{N/K}/\mathcal{P}_K)\) of primitive ambiguous principal ideals,
which can be interpreted as principal factors of the different \(\mathfrak{D}_{N/K}\). The precise
structure of the \(\mathbb{F}_5\)-vector space of differential principal factors is expressed
in terms of norm kernels and central orthogonal idempotents. A connection with integral representation
theory is established via class number relations by Parry and Walter involving the index of subfield
units \((U_N:U_0)\). The statistical distribution of the \(13\) principal factorization types
and their refined splitting into similarity classes with representative prototypes is discussed
thoroughly.
