The spectral radius of a graph is the largest eigenvalue of its adjacency matrix. Let $\mathcal{F}(\lambda)$
be the family of connected graphs of spectral radius $\le \lambda$. We show that $\mathcal{F}(\lambda)$
can be defined by a finite set of forbidden subgraphs for every $\lambda < \lambda^* := \sqrt{2+\sqrt{5}}
\approx 2.058$, whereas $\mathcal{F}(\lambda)$ cannot for every $\lambda \ge \lambda^*$. The
study of forbidden subgraphs characterization for $\mathcal{F}(\lambda)$ is motivated by the
problem of estimating the maximum cardinality of equiangular lines in the $n$-dimensional Euclidean
space $\mathbb{R}^n$ --- a family of lines through the origin such that the angle between any pair
of them is the same. Denote by $N_\alpha(n)$ the maximum number of equiangular lines in $\mathbb{R}^n$
with angle $\arccos\alpha$. We establish an approach to determine the constant $c_\alpha$ in $N_\alpha(n)
= c_\alpha n + O_\alpha(1)$ for every $\alpha > \frac{1}{1+2\lambda^*}$. In particular, $N_{1/3}(n)
= 2n+O(1)$ and $N_{1/5}(n), N_{1/(1+2\sqrt{2})}(n) = \frac{3}{2}n+O(1)$. Besides we prove that
for every graph $G$ of average degree $d \ge 2$, there exists a vertex $v_0$ of $G$ such that $\lambda_1(H)
\ge 2\cos(\tfrac{\pi}{k+2})\sqrt{d-1}$, where $H$ is the subgraph consisting of all vertices
within distance $k$ of $v_0$. Combining this with the proof strategy used to pin down the constant
$c_\alpha$, we show that $N_\alpha(n) \le 1.49n + O_\alpha(1)$ for every $\alpha \neq \tfrac{1}{3},
\tfrac{1}{5}, \tfrac{1}{1+2\sqrt{2}}$, which improves a recent result of Balla, Dr\"axler,
Keevash and Sudakov.
