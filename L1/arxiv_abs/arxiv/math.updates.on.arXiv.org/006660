Graph matching aims at finding the vertex correspondence between two unlabeled graphs that maximizes
the total edge weight correlation. This amounts to solving a computationally intractable quadratic
assignment problem. In this paper we propose a new spectral method, GRAph Matching by Pairwise eigen-Alignments
(GRAMPA). Departing from prior spectral approaches that only compare top eigenvectors, or eigenvectors
of the same order, GRAMPA first constructs a similarity matrix as a weighted sum of outer products
between all pairs of eigenvectors of the two graphs, with weights given by a Cauchy kernel applied
to the separation of the corresponding eigenvalues, then outputs a matching by a simple rounding
procedure. The similarity matrix can also be interpreted as the solution to a regularized quadratic
programming relaxation of the quadratic assignment problem. For the Gaussian Wigner model in which
two complete graphs on $n$ vertices have Gaussian edge weights with correlation coefficient $1-\sigma^2$,
we show that GRAMPA exactly recovers the correct vertex correspondence with high probability when
$\sigma = O(\frac{1}{\log n})$. This matches the state of the art of polynomial-time algorithms,
and significantly improves over existing spectral methods which require $\sigma$ to be polynomially
small in $n$. The superiority of GRAMPA is also demonstrated on a variety of synthetic and real datasets,
in terms of both statistical accuracy and computational efficiency. Universality results, including
similar guarantees for dense and sparse Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi graphs, are deferred to the companion
paper.
