An upper quasi-density on $\bf H$ (the integers or the non-negative integers) is a subadditive function
$\mu^\ast: \mathcal{P}(\mathbf{H}) \to \bf R$ such that $\mu^\ast(X) \le \mu^\ast(\mathbf{H})
= 1$ and $\mu^\ast(k \cdot X + h) = \frac{1}{k}\, \mu^\ast(X)$ for all $X \subseteq \mathbf{H}$ and
$h,k \in \mathbf{N}^+$, where $k \cdot X := \{kx: x \in X\}$. Then an upper density (on $\bf H$) is a
non-decreasing upper quasi-density, and a set $X \subseteq \bf H$ is uqd-small if $\mu^\ast(X)
= 0$ for every upper quasi-density $\mu^\ast$ on $\bf H$. Main examples of upper densities are the
upper analytic, upper Banach, upper Buck, and upper P\'olya densities, as well as the uncountable
family of upper $\alpha$-densities, where $\alpha$ is a real parameter $\ge -1$ (most notably,
$\alpha = -1$ corresponds to the upper logarithmic density, and $\alpha = 0$ to the upper asymptotic
density). We show that a subset of $\mathbf H$ is uqd-small if and only if it belongs to the zero set
of the upper Buck density on $\mathbf Z$. This characterization, combined with a generalization
of an inequality of R.C. Buck, allows us to show that many interesting sets (including the image of
$\mathbf{Z}$ through a non-linear integral polynomial in one variable, or the numbers represented
by a binary quadratic form with integer coefficients whose discriminant is not a perfect square)
are uqd-small. Overall, we can thus strengthen, extend, and unify several ``independent results''
previously known for some of the ``classical upper densities'' studied in the literature.
