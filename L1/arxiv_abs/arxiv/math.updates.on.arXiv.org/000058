Let k be a base field, R a commutative ring of coefficients, Chow(k)_R the category of Chow motives,
and Hmo(k)_R the category of noncommutative motives. Following Gorchinskiy-Orlov, a Chow motive
is called of Lefschetz R-type if it decomposes in Chow(k)_R into a direct sum of tensor powers of the
Lefschetz motive. In the same vein, a noncommutative motive is called of unit R-type if it decomposes
in Hmo(k)_R into a direct sum of copies of the tensor unit. Let X be an irreducible smooth projective
k-scheme of dimension d. Our first main result shows that if the noncommutative motive of X is of unit
R-type (with Z a subring of R), then the Chow motive of X is of Lefschetz R[1/(2d)!]-type. As an application,
this decomposition of the Chow motive holds whenever the derived category of perfect complexes
of X admits a full exceptional collection. Examples include projective spaces and rational surfaces
(when k is arbitrary), smooth quadric hypersurfaces, Grassmannians, flag varieties, Fano threefolds
with vanishing odd cohomology, and toric varieties (when k is the field of complex numbers), and
conjecturally all homogeneous spaces of the form G/P with P a parabolic subgroup of a semisimple
algebraic group G. Our second main result shows that if the Chow motive of X with R[1/(2d)!]-coefficients
is decomposable, then the noncommutative motive of X with R[1/(2d)!]-coefficients is also decomposable.
Using Severi-Brauer varieties, we show also that the converse implication is false whenever R[1/(2d)!]
is replaced by a ring where d is not invertible.
