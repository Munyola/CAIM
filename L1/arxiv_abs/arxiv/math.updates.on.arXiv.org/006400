Biological and advanced cyberphysical control systems often have limited, sparse, uncertain,
and distributed communication and computing in addition to sensing and actuation. Fortunately,
the corresponding plants and performance requirements are also sparse and structured, and this
must be exploited to make constrained controller design feasible and tractable. We introduce a
new "system level" (SL) approach involving three complementary SL elements. System Level Parameterizations
(SLPs) generalize state space and Youla parameterizations of all stabilizing controllers and
the responses they achieve, and combine with System Level Constraints (SLCs) to parameterize the
largest known class of constrained stabilizing controllers that admit a convex characterization,
generalizing quadratic invariance (QI). SLPs also lead to a generalization of detectability and
stabilizability, suggesting the existence of a rich separation structure, that when combined
with SLCs, is naturally applicable to structurally constrained controllers and systems. We further
provide a catalog of useful SLCs, most importantly including sparsity, delay, and locality constraints
on both communication and computing internal to the controller, and external system performance.
The resulting System Level Synthesis (SLS) problems that arise define the broadest known class
of constrained optimal control problems that can be solved using convex programming. An example
illustrates how this system level approach can systematically explore tradeoffs in controller
performance, robustness, and synthesis/implementation complexity.
