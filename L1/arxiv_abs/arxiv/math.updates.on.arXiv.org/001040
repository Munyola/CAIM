Given a category C of a combinatorial nature, we study the following fundamental question: how does
the combinatorial behavior of C affect the algebraic behavior of representations of C? We prove
two general results. The first gives a combinatorial criterion for representations of C to admit
a theory of Gr\"obner bases. From this, we obtain a criterion for noetherianity of representations.
The second gives a combinatorial criterion for a general "rationality" result for Hilbert series
of representations of C. This criterion connects to the theory of formal languages, and makes essential
use of results on the generating functions of languages, such as the transfer-matrix method and
the Chomsky-Sch\"utzenberger theorem. Our work is motivated by recent work in the literature on
representations of various specific categories. Our general criteria recover many of the results
on these categories that had been proved by ad hoc means, and often yield cleaner proofs and stronger
statements. For example: we give a new, more robust, proof that FI-modules (originally introduced
by Church-Ellenberg-Farb), and a family of natural generalizations, are noetherian; we give an
easy proof of a generalization of the Lannes-Schwartz artinian conjecture from the study of generic
representation theory of finite fields; we significantly improve the theory of $\Delta$-modules,
introduced by Snowden in connection to syzygies of Segre embeddings; and we establish fundamental
properties of twisted commutative algebras in positive characteristic.
