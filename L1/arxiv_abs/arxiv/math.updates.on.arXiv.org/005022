We establish a Hadamard-Stoker type theorem combined with a Cohn-Vossen rigidity type theorem
for complete connected hypersurfaces $f:M^n\rightarrow\mathscr{H}^n\times\mathbb{R},$
where $\mathscr{H}^n$ is a Hadamard manifold. Namely, we prove that if such an $f$ has positive extrinsic
curvature and its height function has a critical point, then it is an embedding and $M$ is homeomorphic
to $S^n$ or $\mathbb{R}^n.$ Furthermore, $f(M)$ bounds a convex set in $\mathscr{H}^n\times\mathbb{R}$
and, in the particular case where $\mathscr{H}^n$ is the hyperbolic space $\mathbb{H}^n,$ $f$
is rigid (i.e., unique up to isometries of $\mathbb{H}^n\times\mathbb{R}$) in the class of hypersurfaces
of $\mathbb{H}^n\times\mathbb{R}$ whose extrinsic curvature coincides with that of $f.$ It is
shown that, except for the assumption on convexity, this result is valid for hypersurfaces in $S^n\times\mathbb{R}$
as well. We apply these theorems to show that a compact connected constant mean curvature hypersurface
in $\mathbb{H}^n\times\mathbb{R}$ or $S^n\times\mathbb{R}$ with positive extrinsic curvature
is a rotational sphere. We also prove that a complete connected proper hypersurface $f:M^n\rightarrow
S^n \times\mathbb{R}$ with nonnegative extrinsic curvature is embedded and homeomorphic to $S^{n-1}\times\mathbb{R},$
provided its height function has no critical points. Analogous theorems for hypersurfaces in warped
product spaces $\mathbb{R}\times_\rho\mathscr{H}^n$ and $\mathbb{R}\times_\rho S^n$ are
obtained. In all of these results, the manifold $M^n$ is assumed to have dimension $n\ge 3.$
