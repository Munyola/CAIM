Mixing by cutting-and-shuffling can be understood and predicted using dynamical systems based
tools and techniques. In existing studies, mixing is generated by maps that repeat the same cut-and-shuffle
process at every iteration, in a "fixed" manner. However, mixing can be greatly improved by varying
the cut-and-shuffle parameters at each step, using a "variable" approach. To demonstrate this
approach, we show how to optimize mixing by cutting-and-shuffling on the one-dimensional line
interval, known as an interval exchange transformation (IET). Mixing can be significantly improved
by optimizing variable protocols, especially for initial conditions more complex than just a simple
two-color line interval. While we show that optimal variable IETs can be found analytically for
arbitrary numbers of iterations, for more complex cutting-and-shuffling systems, computationally
expensive numerical optimization methods would be required. Furthermore, the number of control
parameters grows linearly with the number of iterations in variable systems. Therefore, optimizing
over large numbers of iterations is generally computationally prohibitive. We demonstrate an
ad hoc approach to cutting-and-shuffling that is computationally inexpensive and guarantees
the mixing metric is within a constant factor of the optimum. This ad hoc approach yields significantly
better mixing than fixed IETs which are known to produce weak-mixing, because cut pieces never reconnect.
The heuristic principles of this method can be applied to more general cutting-and-shuffling systems.
