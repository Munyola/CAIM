Numerous multi-objective evolutionary algorithms have been designed for constrained optimisation
in last two decades. This method is to transform a constrained optimisation problem into a multi-objective
optimisation problem, then solve it by an evolutionary algorithm. In this paper, we propose a new
multi-objective method for constrained optimisation, which is to convert a constrained optimisation
problem into a problem with helper and equivalent objectives. An equivalent objective means that
its optimal solution set is the same as that to the constrained problem but a helper objective not.
Then this multi-objective optimisation problem is decomposed into a group of sub-problems using
the weighted sum approach. Weights are dynamically adjusted so that each subproblem eventually
tends to a problem with an equivalent objective. We theoretically analyse the computation time
of the helper and equivalent objective method on a hard problem called "wide gap". The "wide gap"
problem means that an algorithm needs exponential time to cross between two fitness levels. We prove
that using helper and equivalent objectives may shorten the time of crossing the "wide gap". We conduct
a case study for validating our method. An algorithm with helper and equivalent objectives is implemented.
Experimental results show that its overall performance is ranked first when compared with other
eight state-of-art evolutionary algorithms. The case study proves the efficiency of the helper
and equivalent objective method for constrained optimisation.
