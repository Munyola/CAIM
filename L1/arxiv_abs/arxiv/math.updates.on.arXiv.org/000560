In this paper we extend the recently introduced reduced basis-hierarchical model reduction framework
for the application to nonlinear partial differential equations. The major new ingredient to accomplish
this goal is the introduction of the Empirical Projection Method, which is an adaptive integration
algorithm based on empirical interpolation. We project both the variational formulation and the
range of the nonlinear operator onto reduced spaces. Those combine the full dimensional space in
an identified dominant spatial direction and a reduction space or collateral basis space spanned
by modal orthonormal basis functions in the transverse direction. Both the reduction and the collateral
basis space are constructed in a highly nonlinear fashion by introducing a parametrized problem
in the transverse direction and associated parametrized operator evaluations, and by applying
reduced basis methods to select the bases from the corresponding snapshots. Rigorous a priori and
a posteriori error estimators which do not require additional regularity of the nonlinear operator
are proven for the Empirical Projection Method and then used to derive a rigorous a posteriori error
estimator for the resulting hierarchical model reduction approach. Numerical experiments for
an elliptic nonlinear diffusion equation demonstrate a fast convergence of the proposed dimensionally
reduced approximation to the solution of the full-dimensional problem. Run-time experiments
verify a linear scaling of the reduction method in the number of degrees of freedom used for the computations
in the dominant direction.
