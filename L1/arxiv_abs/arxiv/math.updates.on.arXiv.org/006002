In this paper, we present a conservative semi-Lagrangian finite-difference scheme for the BGK
model. Classical semi-Lagrangian finite difference schemes, coupled with an L-stable treatment
of the collision term, allow large time steps, for all the range of Knudsen number. Unfortunately,
however, such schemes are not conservative. There are two main sources of lack of conservation.
First, when using classical continuous Maxwellian, conservation error is negligible only if velocity
space is resolved with sufficiently large number of grid points. However, for a small number of grids
in velocity space such error is not negligible, because the parameters of the Maxwellian do not coincide
with the discrete moments. Secondly, the non-linear reconstruction used to prevent oscillations
destroys the translation invariance which is at the basis of the conservation properties of the
scheme. As a consequence the schemes show a wrong shock speed in the limit of small Knudsen number.
To treat the first problem and ensure machine precision conservation of mass, momentum and energy
with a relatively small number of velocity grid points, we replace the continuous Maxwellian with
the discrete Maxwellian introduced by Mieussens. The second problem is treated by implementing
a conservative correction procedure based on the flux difference form. In this way we can construct
a conservative semi-Lagrangian scheme which is Asymptotic Preserving (AP) for the underlying
Euler limit, as the Knudsen number vanishes. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is demonstrated
by extensive numerical tests.
