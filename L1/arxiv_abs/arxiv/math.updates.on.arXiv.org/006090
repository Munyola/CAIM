Hybrid analog-digital precoding is challenging for broadband millimeter-wave (mmWave) massive
MIMO systems, since the analog precoder is frequency-flat but the mmWave channels are frequency-selective.
In this paper, we propose a principal component analysis (PCA)-based broadband hybrid precoder/combiner
design, where both the fully-connected array and partially-connected subarray (including the
fixed and adaptive subarrays) are investigated. Specifically, we first design the hybrid precoder/combiner
for fully-connected array and fixed subarray based on PCA, whereby a low-dimensional frequency-flat
precoder/combiner is acquired based on the optimal high-dimensional frequency-selective precoder/combiner.
Meanwhile, the near-optimality of our proposed PCA approach is theoretically proven. Moreover,
for the adaptive subarray, a low-complexity shared agglomerative hierarchical clustering algorithm
is proposed to group the antennas for the further improvement of spectral efficiency (SE) performance.
Besides, we theoretically prove that the proposed antenna grouping algorithm is only determined
by the slow time-varying channel parameters in the large antenna limit. Simulation results demonstrate
the superiority of the proposed solution over state-of-the-art schemes in SE, energy efficiency
(EE), bit-error-rate performance, and the robustness to time-varying channels. Our work reveals
that the EE advantage of adaptive subarray over fully-connected array is obvious for both active
and passive antennas, but the EE advantage of fixed subarray only holds for passive antennas.
