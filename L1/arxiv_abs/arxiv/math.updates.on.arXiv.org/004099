This paper is concerned with a posteriori error bounds for linear transport equations and related
questions of contriving corresponding adaptive solution strategies in the context of Discontinuous-Petrov-Galerkin
schemes. After indicating our motivation for this investigation in a wider context the first major
part of the paper is devoted to the derivation and analysis of reliable and efficient a posteriori
error bounds under mild conditions on variable convection fields. In particular, it is shown that
these error estimators are computed at a cost that stays uniformly proportional to the problem size.
The remaining part of the paper is then concerned with the question whether typical bulk criteria
known from adaptive strategies for elliptic problems entail a fixed error reduction rate also in
the context of transport equations. This turns out to be significantly more difficult than for elliptic
problems and at this point we can give a complete affirmative answer for a single spatial dimension.
For the general multidimensional case we provide partial results which we find of interest in their
own right. An essential distinction from known concepts is that global arguments enter the issue
of error reduction. An important ingredient of the underlying analysis, which is perhaps interesting
in its own right, is to relate the derived error indicators to the residuals that naturally arise
in related least squares formulations. This reveals a close interrelation between both settings
regarding error reduction in the context of adaptive refinements.
