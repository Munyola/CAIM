The incompressible Navier-Stokes (NS) equation is known to govern the hydrodynamic limit of essentially
any fluid and its rich non-linear structure has critical implications in both mathematics and physics.
The employability of the methods of Riemannian geometry to the study of hydrodynamical flows has
been previously explored from a purely mathematical perspective. In this work, we propose a bulk
metric in $(p+2)$-dimensions with the construction being such that the induced metric is flat on
a timelike $r = r_c$ (constant) slice. We then show that the equations of {\it parallel transport}
for an appropriately defined bulk velocity vector field along its own direction on this manifold
when projected onto the flat timelike hypersurface requires the satisfaction of the incompressible
NS equation in $(p+1)$-dimensions. Additionally, the incompressibility condition of the fluid
arises from a vanishing expansion parameter $\theta$, which is known to govern the convergence
(or divergence) of a congruence of arbitrary timelike curves on a given manifold. In this approach
Einstein's equations do not play any role and this can be regarded as an {\it off-shell} description
of fluid-gravity correspondence. We argue that {\it our metric effectively encapsulates the information
of forcing terms in the governing equations as if a free fluid is parallel transported on this curved
background}. We finally discuss the implications of this interesting observation and its potentiality
in helping us to understand hydrodynamical flows in a probable new setting.
