We establish a Hadamard--Stoker type theorem combined with a Cohn-Vossen rigidity type theorem
for complete connected hypersurfaces $f:M^n\rightarrow\mathscr{H}^n\times\mathbb{R},$
where $\mathscr{H}^n$ is a Hadamard manifold. Namely, we prove that if such an $f$ has positive extrinsic
curvature and its height function has a critical point, then it is an embedding and $M$ is homeomorphic
to $S^n$ or $\mathbb{R}^n.$ Furthermore, $f(M)\subset\mathscr{H}^n\times\mathbb{R}$ bounds
a convex set and, in the particular case where $\mathscr{H}^n$ is the hyperbolic space $\mathbb{H}^n,$
$f$ is rigid in a certain class of hypersurfaces of $\mathbb{H}^n\times\mathbb{R}.$ It is shown
that, except for the assumption on convexity, this result is valid for hypersurfaces in $S^n\times\mathbb{R},$
and for some hypersurfaces in warped product spaces $\mathbb{R}\times_\rho \mathscr{H}^n$ and
$\mathbb{R}\times_\rho S^n$ as well. We also prove that a complete connected proper hypersurface
$f:M^n\rightarrow S^n \times\mathbb{R}$ with nonnegative extrinsic curvature is embedded and
homeomorphic to $S^{n-1}\times\mathbb{R},$ provided its height function has no critical points.
In addition, an analogous result for hypersurfaces $f:M^n\rightarrow\mathbb{R}\times_\rho
S^n$ is obtained. Finally, we apply our main theorems to show that a compact connected constant mean
curvature hypersurface in $\mathbb{H}^n\times\mathbb{R}$ or $S^n\times\mathbb{R}$ with positive
extrinsic curvature is a rotational sphere. In all of these results, the hypersurface is assumed
to have dimension $n\ge 3.$
