Let $G$ be a compact connected semisimple Lie group, let $K$ be a closed subgroup of $G$, let $\Gamma$
be a finite subgroup of $G$, and let $\tau$ be a finite dimensional representation of $K$. For $\pi$
in the unitary dual $\widehat G$ of $G$, denote by $n_\Gamma(\pi)$ its multiplicity in $L^2(\Gamma\backslash
G)$. We prove a (finite) strong multiplicity one theorem in the spirit of Bhagwat and Rajan, for the
$n_\Gamma(\pi)$ for $\pi$ in the set $\widehat G_\tau$ of irreducible $\tau$-spherical representations
of $G$. More precisely, when $\widehat G_\tau$ can be written as a finite union of strings of representations,
we prove that for any finite subset $\widehat {F}_{\tau}$ of $\widehat G_{\tau}$ verifying some
mild conditions, the values of the $n_\Gamma(\pi)$ for $\pi\in\widehat F_{\tau}$ determine the
$n_\Gamma(\pi)$'s for all $\pi \in \widehat G_\tau$. In particular, for two finite subgroups $\Gamma$
and $\Gamma'$ of $G$, if $n_\Gamma(\pi) = n_{\Gamma'}(\pi)$ for all $\pi\in \widehat F_{\tau}$
then the equality holds for every $\pi \in \widehat G_\tau$. We use algebraic methods involving
generating functions and several facts from the representation theory of $G$. We apply our results
to spectra of locally homogeneous spaces of compact type, proving a result that gives general conditions
on $G$, $K$ and $\tau$ so that an adequate finite part of the $\tau$-spectrum of $\Gamma \backslash
G/K$ determines the whole $\tau$-spectrum. We analyze different situations in the case of the sphere,
exhibiting a number of examples and counterexamples.
