Comparisons of experimental observation of heat and moisture transfer through porous building
materials with numerical results have been presented in numerous studies reported in literature.
However, some discrepancies have been observed, highlighting underestimation of sorption process
and overestimation of desorption process. Some studies intend to explain the discrepancies by
analysing the importance of hysteresis effects as well as carrying out sensitivity analyses on
the input parameters as convective transfer coefficients. This article intends to investigate
the accuracy and efficiency of the coupled solution by adding advective transfer of both heat and
moisture in the physical model. In addition, the efficient Scharfetter and Gummel numerical scheme
is proposed to solve the system of advection-diffusion equations, which has the advantages of being
well-balanced and asymptotically preserving. Moreover, the scheme is particularly efficient
in terms of accuracy and reduction of computational time when using large spatial discretisation
parameters. Several linear and non-linear cases are studied to validate the method and highlight
its specific features. At the end, an experimental benchmark from the literature is considered.
The numerical results are compared to the experimental data for a pure diffusive model and also for
the proposed model. The latter presents better agreement with the experimental data. The influence
of the hysteresis effects on the moisture capacity is also studied, by adding a third differential
equation.
