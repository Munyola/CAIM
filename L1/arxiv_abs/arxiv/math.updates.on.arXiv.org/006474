In this paper, we formulate a new problem to cope with the transmission of extra bits over an existing
coded transmission link (referred to as coded payload link) without any cost of extra transmission
energy or extra bandwidth. This is possible since a gap to the channel capacity typically exists
for a practical code. A new concept, termed as accessible capacity, is introduced to specify the
maximum rate at which the superposition transmission of extra bits is reliable and has a negligible
effect on the performance of the coded payload link. For a binary-input output-symmetric (BIOS)
memoryless channel, the accessible capacity can be characterized as the difference between the
channel capacity and the mutual information rate of the coded payload link, which can be numerically
evaluated for very short payload codes. For a general payload code, we present a simple lower bound
on the accessible capacity, given by the channel capacity minus the coding rate of the payload code.
We then focus on the scenarios where low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes are implemented for
the payload link. We propose to transmit extra bits by random superposition for encoding, and exhaustive
search (with the aid of statistical learning) for decoding. We further propose, by establishing
an auxiliary channel (called syndrome channel) induced from "zero-forcing" over the binary field,
to transmit extra bits with structured codes such as repetition codes and first-order Reed-Muller
(RM) codes. Numerical results show that up to 60 extra bits can be reliably transmitted along with
a rate-1/2 LDPC code of length 8064.
