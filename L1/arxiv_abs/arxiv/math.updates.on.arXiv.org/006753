A combined technique of interference alignment (IA) and interference cancellation (IC), known
as interference alignment and cancellation (IAC) scheme, has been proposed to improve the total
achievable degrees of freedom (DoFs) over IA. Since it is NP-hard to solve the transceiver under
a given tuple of DoFs or to maximize the total achievable DoFs in the general system configuration
by IA (or IAC), the optimal transceiver cannot be obtained in polynomial time. Meanwhile, it has
been known that a closed-form yet suboptimal transceiver can be designed for IAC by employing a symbol-to-symbol
(STS) alignment structure. As its performance has not been known yet, we aim to derive the total DoFs
that can be achieved by such suboptimal but closed-form IAC transceivers for Gaussian interference
multiple access channels with K receivers and J users (transmitters), each with M antennas. Our
analysis shows that the closed-form IAC transceivers under consideration can achieve a maximum
total achievable DoFs of 2M, which turns out to be larger than those achieved in classical IA, e.g.,
2MK/(K+1) DoFs by a specific configuration where each link has the same target DoFs. Moreover, considering
the NP-hardness of deriving the maximum total achievable DoFs with the optimal IAC transceiver,
its upper bound has been derived for comparison with the results of our closed-form IAC transceiver.
Numerical results illustrate that its performance can be guaranteed within 20% of the upper bound
when the number of multiple access channels are relatively small, e.g., K <=4.
