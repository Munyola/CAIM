Gradient descent is commonly used to solve optimization problems arising in machine learning,
such as training neural networks. Although it seems to be effective for many different neural network
training problems, it is unclear if the effectiveness of gradient descent can be explained using
existing performance guarantees for the algorithm. We argue that existing analyses of gradient
descent rely on assumptions that are too strong to be applicable in the case of multi-layer neural
networks. To address this, we propose an algorithm, duality structure gradient descent (DSGD),
that is amenable to a non-asymptotic performance analysis, under mild assumptions on the training
set and network architecture. The algorithm can be viewed as a form of layer-wise coordinate descent,
where at each iteration the algorithm chooses one layer of the network to update. The decision of
what layer to update is done in a greedy fashion, based on a rigorous lower bound of the function decrease
for each possible choice of layer. In the analysis, we bound the time required to reach approximate
stationary points, in both the deterministic and stochastic settings. The convergence is measured
in terms of a Finsler geometry that is derived from the network architecture and designed to confirm
a Lipschitz-like property on the gradient of the training objective function. Numerical experiments
in both the full batch and mini-batch settings suggest that the algorithm is a promising step towards
methods for training neural networks that are both rigorous and efficient.
