In this paper we deal with a notion of Banach space-valued mappings defined on a set consisting of
finite graphs with uniformly bounded vertex degree. These functions will be endowed with certain
boundedness and additivity criteria. We examine their normalized long-term behaviour along a
particular class of graph sequences. Using techniques developed by Elek, we show convergence in
the topology of the Banach space if the corresponding graph sequence possesses a hyperfinite structure.
These considerations extend and complement the corresponding results for amenable groups. As
an application, we verify the uniform approximation of the integrated density of states for bounded,
finite range operators on discrete structures. Further, we generalize the results concerning
an abstract version of Fekete's Lemma for cancellative, amenable (semi-)groups to the geometric
situation of convergent graph sequences. To complete the geometric picture, it will also be demonstrated
that the conditions on the functions under consideration are not appropriate for convergence along
graph sequences with non-hyperfinite geometries. However, as far as the question of pointwise
convergence of spectral distribution functions is concerned, we can bypass this problem by extending
parts of the algebraic eigenvalue conjecture proven for sofic groups by Thom to the general geometric
case of graph sequences. More precisely, we derive the uniform existence of the integrated density
of states for bounded, integer coefficient operators on all approximable, discrete structures
with uniform vertex degree bound.
