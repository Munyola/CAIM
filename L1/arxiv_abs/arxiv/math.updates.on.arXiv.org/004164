Given a state transition matrix (STM), we reinvestigate the problem of constructing the sparest
input matrix with a fixed number of inputs to guarantee controllability. We give a new and simple
graph theoretic characterization for the sparsity pattern of input matrices to guarantee controllability
for a general STM admitting multiple eigenvalues, and provide a deterministic procedure with polynomial
time complexity to construct real valued input matrices with arbi- trarily prescribed sparsity
pattern satisfying controllability. Based on this criterion, some novel results on sparsely controlling
a system are obtained. It is proven that the minimal number of inputs to guarantee controllability
equals to the maximum geometric multiplicity of the STM under the constraint that some states are
actuated-forbidden, extending the results of [28]. The minimal sparsity of input matrices with
a fixed number of inputs is not necessarily equal to the minimal number of actuated states to ensure
controllability. Furthermore, a graphic sub- modular function is built, leading to a greedy algorithm
to efficiently approximate the minimal actuated states to assure controllability for general
STMs. For the problem of approximating the sparsest input matrices with a fixed number of inputs,
we propose a simple greedy algo- rithm (non-submodular) and a two-stage algorithm, and demonstrate
that the latter algorithm, inspired from techniques in dynamic coloring, has a provable approximation
guarantee. Finally, we present numerical results to show the efficiency and effectiveness of our
approaches.
