We provide evidence for this conclusion: given a finite Galois cover $f: X \rightarrow \mathbb{P}^1_\mathbb{Q}$
of group $G$, almost all (in a density sense) realizations of $G$ over $\mathbb{Q}$ do not occur as
specializations of $f$. We show that this holds if the number of branch points of $f$ is sufficiently
large, under the abc-conjecture and, possibly, the lower bound predicted by the Malle conjecture
for the number of Galois extensions of $\mathbb{Q}$ of given group and bounded discriminant. This
widely extends a result of Granville on the lack of $\mathbb{Q}$-rational points on quadratic twists
of hyperelliptic curves over $\mathbb{Q}$ with large genus, under the abc-conjecture (a diophantine
reformulation of the case $G=\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$ of our result). As a further evidence, we
exhibit a few finite groups $G$ for which the above conclusion holds unconditionally for almost
all covers of $\mathbb{P}^1_\mathbb{Q}$ of group $G$. We also introduce a local-global principle
for specializations of Galois covers $f: X \rightarrow \mathbb{P}^1_\mathbb{Q}$ and show that
it often fails if $f$ has abelian Galois group and sufficiently many branch points, under the abc-conjecture.
On the one hand, such a local-global conclusion underscores the "smallness" of the specialization
set of a Galois cover of $\mathbb{P}^1_\mathbb{Q}$. On the other hand, it allows to generate conditionally
"many" curves over $\mathbb{Q}$ failing the Hasse principle, thus generalizing a recent result
of Clark and Watson devoted to the hyperelliptic case.
