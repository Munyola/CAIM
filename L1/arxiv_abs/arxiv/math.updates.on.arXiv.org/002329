In this paper, we study algorithmic problems for automaton semigroups and automaton groups related
to freeness and finiteness. In the course of this study, we also exhibit some connections between
the algebraic structure of automaton (semi)groups and their dynamics on the boundary. First, we
show that it is undecidable to check whether the group generated by a given invertible automaton
has a positive relation, i. e. a relation p = 1 such that p only contains positive generators. Besides
its obvious relation to the freeness of the group, the absence of positive relations has previously
been studied and is connected to the triviality of some stabilizers of the boundary. We show that
the emptiness of the set of positive relations is equivalent to the dynamical property that all (directed
positive) orbital graphs centered at non-singular points are acyclic. Our approach also works
to show undecidability of the freeness problem for automaton semigroups; in fact, it shows undecidability
of a strengthened version where the input automaton is complete and invertible. Gillibert showed
that the finiteness problem for automaton semigroups is undecidable. In the second part of the paper,
we show that this undecidability result also holds if the input is restricted to be bi-reversible
and invertible (but, in general, not complete). As an immediate consequence, we obtain that the
finiteness problem for automaton subsemigroups of semigroups generated by invertible, yet partial
automata, so called automaton-inverse semigroups, is also undecidable.
