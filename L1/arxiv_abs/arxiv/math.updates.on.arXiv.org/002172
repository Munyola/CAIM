This paper has expounded the serious defects and incomplete in mathematical structure of generalized
Hamilton system on the connection space. GHS known as $\frac{dx}{dt}=J\left( x \right)\nabla
H\left( x \right)$ which is only for the flat Euclidean space, as for the general non-Euclidean space
which often carries the connection structure, the GHS cannot well apply. Hence a complete dynamical
system needs to be rebuilt for the non Euclidean space. We can use GCHS as a real dynamical system which
is mathematically well-defined as $$\frac{\mathcal{D}x}{dt}=W\left( x \right)DH\left( x \right)$$by
using the covariant derivative $D_{k}$ to replace the ordinary derivative $\partial_{k}$. The
GHS is only a special case of GCHS, we get some results based on GCHS including the general covariant
Possion bracket (GCPB), generalized covariant Jacobi identity (GCJI), by studying the stability
properties of GCHS which lead to more abundant results. Synchronously, we have successfully obtained
a new operator--Wang operator $\widehat{W}$ which has similar functions to GCPB, GCPB is mathematically
described by \[\left\{ F,G \right\}=\widehat{W}\left( FG \right)+{{\left\{ F,G \right\}}_{GHS}}\]then
GCHS can be shown as $\frac{\mathcal{D}{{x}_{k}}}{dt}=\left\{ {{x}_{k}},H \right\}$, GCHS
is a new theoretical framework built on Wang operator $\widehat{W}$, we also define a new dynamics--Wang
dynamics\[w=\widehat{W}H\]built on the Wang operator along with Hamiltonian system $H$. Naturally,
we have spontaneously deduced the acceleration flow as the second order form of GCHS.
