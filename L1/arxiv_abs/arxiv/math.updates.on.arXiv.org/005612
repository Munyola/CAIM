Let $\Omega$ be a Polish space with Borel $\sigma$-field $\mathcal{F}$ and countably generated
sub $\sigma$-field $\mathcal{G}\subset\mathcal{F}$. Denote by $\mathcal{L}(\mathcal{F})$
the set of all bounded $\mathcal{F}$-upper semianalytic functions from $\Omega$ to the reals and
by $\mathcal{L}(\mathcal{G})$ the subset of $\mathcal{G}$-upper semianalytic functions. Let
$\mathcal{E}(\cdot|\mathcal{G})\colon\mathcal{L}(\mathcal{F})\to\mathcal{L}(\mathcal{G})$
be a sublinear increasing functional which leaves $\mathcal{L}(\mathcal{G})$ invariant. It
is shown that there exists a $\mathcal{G}$-analytic set-valued mapping $\mathcal{P}_{\mathcal{G}}$
from $\Omega$ to the set of probabilities which are concentrated on atoms of $\mathcal{G}$ with
compact convex values such that $\mathcal{E}(X|\mathcal{G})(\omega)=$ $\sup_{P\in\mathcal{P}_{\mathcal{G}}(\omega)}
E_P[X]$ if and only if $\mathcal{E}(\cdot |\mathcal{G})$ is pointwise continuous from below and
continuous from above on the continuous functions. Further, given another sublinear increasing
functional $\mathcal{E}(\cdot)\colon\mathcal{L}(\mathcal{F})\to\mathbb{R}$ which leaves
the constants invariant, the tower property $\mathcal{E}(\cdot)=\mathcal{E}(\mathcal{E}(\cdot|\mathcal{G}))$
is characterized via a pasting property of the representing sets of probabilities, and the importance
of analytic functions is explained. Finally, it is characterized when a nonlinear version of Fubini's
theorem holds true and when the product of a set of probabilities and a set of kernels is compact.
