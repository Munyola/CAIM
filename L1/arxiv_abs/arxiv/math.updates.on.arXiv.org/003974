We investigate asynchronous distributed algorithms with delayed information for seeking generalized
Nash equilibrium over multi-agent networks. The considered game model has all players' local decisions
coupled with a shared affine constraint. We assume each player can only access its local objective
function, local constraint, and a local block matrix of the affine constraint. We first give the
algorithm for the case when each agent is able to fully access all other players' decisions. With
the help of auxiliary edge variables and edge Laplacian matrix, each player can carry on its local
iteration in an asynchronous manner, using only local data and possibly delayed neighbour information.
And then we investigate the case when the agents cannot know all other players' decisions, which
is called a partial decision case. We introduce a local estimation of the overall decisions for each
agent in the partial decision case, and develop another asynchronous algorithm by incorporating
consensus dynamics on the local estimations of the overall decisions. Since both algorithms do
not need any centralized clock coordination, the algorithms fully exploit the local computation
resource of each player, and remove the idle time due to waiting for the "slowest" agent. Both algorithms
are developed by a preconditioned forward-backward operator splitting method, while convergence
is shown with the help of asynchronous fixed-point iterations under proper assumptions and fixed
step-size choices. Numerical studies verify both algorithms' convergence and efficiency.
