In the study of complex physical and biological systems represented by multivariate stochastic
processes, an issue of great relevance is the description of the system dynamics spanning multiple
temporal scales. While methods to assess the dynamic complexity of individual processes at different
time scales are well-established, multiscale analysis of directed interactions has never been
formalized theoretically, and empirical evaluations are complicated by practical issues such
as filtering and downsampling. Here we extend the very popular measure of Granger causality (GC),
a prominent tool for assessing directed lagged interactions between joint processes, to quantify
information transfer across multiple time scales. We show that the multiscale processing of a vector
autoregressive (AR) process introduces a moving average (MA) component, and describe how to represent
the resulting ARMA process using state space (SS) models and to combine the SS model parameters for
computing exact GC values at arbitrarily large time scales. We exploit the theoretical formulation
to identify peculiar features of multiscale GC in basic AR processes, and demonstrate with numerical
simulations the much larger estimation accuracy of the SS approach compared with pure AR modeling
of filtered and downsampled data. The improved computational reliability is exploited to disclose
meaningful multiscale patterns of information transfer between global temperature and carbon
dioxide concentration time series, both in paleoclimate and in recent years.
