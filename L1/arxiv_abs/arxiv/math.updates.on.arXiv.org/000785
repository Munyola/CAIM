We consider the computational challenges associated with uncertainty quantification in high-dimensional
parameter estimation using geostatistical approach inverse problems. Traditional approaches
to uncertainty quantification involve sampling from the high-dimensional posterior probability
density function. However, due to the high computational costs associated with sampling, we consider
an efficient representation of the posterior covariance matrix at the maximum a posteriori (MAP)
point as the sum of the prior covariance matrix and a low-rank update that contains information from
the dominant generalized eigenmodes of the data misfit part of the Hessian and the inverse covariance
matrix. The rank of the low-rank update is typically independent of the dimension of the unknown
parameter. We provide an efficient algorithm for computing the dominant eigenmodes of the generalized
eigenvalue problem (and as a result, the low-rank decomposition) that avoids forming square-roots
of the covariance matrix or its inverse. As a result, we have a method that scales almost linearly
with the dimension of unknown parameter space and the data dimension. Further, we show how to efficiently
compute some measures of uncertainty that are based on scalar invariants of the posterior covariance
matrix. The resulting uncertainty measures can be used in the context of optimal experimental design.
The performance of our algorithms is demonstrated by application to model problems in synthetic
travel-time tomography and steady-state hydraulic tomography.
