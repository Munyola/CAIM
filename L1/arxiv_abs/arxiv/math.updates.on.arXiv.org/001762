This paper explores the information-theoretic limitations of graph property testing in zero-field
Ising models. Instead of learning the entire graph structure, sometimes testing a basic graph property
such as connectivity, cycle presence or maximum clique size is a more relevant and attainable objective.
Since property testing is more fundamental than graph recovery, any necessary conditions for property
testing imply corresponding conditions for graph recovery, while custom property tests can be
statistically and/or computationally more efficient than graph recovery based algorithms. Understanding
the statistical complexity of property testing requires the distinction of ferromagnetic (i.e.,
positive interactions only) and general Ising models. Using combinatorial constructs such as
graph packing and strong monotonicity, we characterize how target properties affect the corresponding
minimax upper and lower bounds within the realm of ferromagnets. On the other hand, by studying the
detection of an antiferromagnetic (i.e., negative interactions only) Curie-Weiss model buried
in Rademacher noise, we show that property testing is strictly more challenging over general Ising
models. In terms of methodological development, we propose two types of correlation based tests:
computationally efficient screening for ferromagnets, and score type tests for general models,
including a fast cycle presence test. Our correlation screening tests match the information-theoretic
bounds for property testing in ferromagnets.
