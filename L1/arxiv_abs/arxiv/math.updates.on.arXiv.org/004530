Applications in shape analysis and object classification often require maps between metric spaces
which preserve geometry as much as possible. In this paper, we combine the Monge formulation of optimal
transport with the Gromov-Hausdorff construction to define a measure of the minimum amount of geometric
distortion required to map one metric measure space onto another. We show that the resulting quantity,
called Gromov-Monge distance, defines an extended quasi-metric on the space of isomorphism classes
of metric measure spaces and that it can be promoted to a true metric on certain subclasses of mm-spaces.
We also give precise comparisons between Gromov-Monge distance and several other metrics which
have appeared previously, such as the Gromov-Wasserstein metric and the continuous Procrustes
metric. Finally, we derive polynomial-time computable lower bounds for Gromov-Monge distance.
These lower bounds are expressed in terms of classical invariants of mm-spaces called distance
distributions. In the second half of the paper, which may be of independent interest, we study the
discriminative power of these lower bounds for simple subclasses of metric measure spaces. We first
consider the case of planar curves, where we give a counterexample to the Curve Histogram Conjecture
of Brinkman and Olver. Next we show that one of our lower bounds distinguishes metric trees locally---trees
which lie sufficiently close to one another in Gromov-Hausdorff distance are always distinguished---and
generically with respect to a natural measure on the space of trees.
