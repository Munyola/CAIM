In this paper, we introduce a new performance metric in the framework of status updates that we will
refer to as the Age of Incorrect Information (AoII). This new metric deals with the shortcomings
of both the Age of Information (AoI) and the conventional error penalty functions as it neatly extends
the notion of fresh updates to that of fresh "informative" updates. The word informative in this
context refers to updates that bring new and correct information to the monitor side. After properly
motivating the new metric, and with the aim of minimizing its average, we formulate a Markov Decision
Process (MDP) in a transmitter-receiver pair scenario where packets are sent over an unreliable
channel. We show that a simple "always update" policy minimizes the aforementioned average penalty
along with the average age and prediction error. We then tackle the general, and more realistic case,
where the transmitter cannot surpass a certain power budget. The problem is formulated as a Constrained
Markov Decision Process (CMDP) for which we provide a Lagrangian approach to solve. After characterizing
the optimal transmission policy of the Lagrangian problem, we provide a rigorous mathematical
proof to showcase that a mixture of two Lagrange policies is optimal for the CMDP in question. Equipped
with this, we provide a low complexity algorithm that finds the optimal operating point of the constrained
scenario. Lastly, simulation results are laid out to showcase the performance of the proposed policy
and highlight the differences with the AoI framework.
