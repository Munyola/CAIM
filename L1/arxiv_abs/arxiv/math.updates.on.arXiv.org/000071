We present a method to control gonality of nonarchimedean curves based on graph theory. Let k denote
the fraction field of an excellent discrete valuation ring. We first prove a lower bound for the gonality
of a curve over the algebraic closure of k in terms of the minimal degree of a class of graph maps, namely:
one should minimize over all so-called finite harmonic graph morphisms to trees, that originate
from any refinement of the dual graph of the stable model of the curve. Next comes our main result:
we prove a lower bound for the degree of such a graph morphism in terms of the first eigenvalue of the
Laplacian and some "volume" of the original graph; this can be seen as a substitute for graphs of the
Li-Yau inequality from differential geometry, although we also prove that the strict analogue
of this conjecture fails for general graphs. Finally, we apply the results to give a lower bound for
the gonality of arbitrary Drinfeld modular curves over finite fields and for general congruence
subgroups Gamma of Gamma(1) that is linear in the index [Gamma(1):Gamma], with a constant that only
depends on the residue field degree and the degree of the chosen "infinite" place. This is a function
field analogue of a theorem of Abramovich for classical modular curves. We present applications
to uniform boundedness of torsion of rank two Drinfeld modules that improve upon existing results,
and to lower bounds on the modular degree of certain elliptic curves over function fields that solve
a problem of Papikian.
