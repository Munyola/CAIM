In this paper, we consider the problems of minimizing sum power and maximizing sum rate for multi-cell
networks with non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA). For sum power minimization, we transform
it into an equivalent linear problem with fewer variables and obtain the optimal power allocation
strategy for users in closed-form expression. To solve the noconvex sum rate maximization problem,
we prove that the power allocation problem for a single cell is a convex problem. Further, by analyzing
the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions, we reveal that the optimal power allocation strategy
for each base station (BS) is to allocate additional power to its served user with the highest channel
gain, while other users served by this BS are allocated with minimum power to maintain their rate
requirements. Based on this observation, the original sum rate maximization problem can be simplified
to an equivalent problem with variables in dimension of the total number of BSs. It is shown that the
objective function of the simplified problem can be readily rewritten as a minimization of a difference
of convex functions (DC). By using this representation, DC programming approach is applied to transform
and approximate the simplified problem to convex optimization problems. By solving this set of
approximately convex problems iteratively, a suboptimal solution to the sum rate maximization
problem can be obtained. Numerical results illustrate the theoretical findings, showing the superiority
of our solutions compared to orthogonal frequency multiple division multiple access (OFDMA).
