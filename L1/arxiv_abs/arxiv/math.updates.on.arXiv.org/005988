Consider $F$ an element of the second Wiener chaos with variance one. In full generality, we show
that, for every integer $p\ge 1$, there exists $\eta_p>0$ such that if $\kappa_4(F)<\eta_p$ then
the Malliavin derivative of $F$ admits a negative moment of order $p$. This entails that any sequence
of random variables in the second Wiener chaos converging in distribution to a non--degenerated
Gaussian is getting more regular as its distribution is getting close to the normal law. This substantially
generalizes some recent findings contained in \cite{hu2014convergence,hu2015density,nourdin2016fisher}
where analogous statements were given with additional assumptions which we are able to remove here.
Moreover, we provide a multivariate version of this Theorem. Our main contribution concerns the
case of the third Wiener chaos which is notoriously more delicate as one cannot anymore decompose
the random variables into a linear combination of i.i.d. random variables. We still prove that the
same phenomenon of regularization along central convergence occurs. Unfortunately, we are not
able to provide a statement as strong as the previous one, but we can show that the usual non--degeneracy
estimates of the Malliavin derivative given by the Carbery-Wright inequality can be improved by
a factor three. Our proof introduces new techniques such that a specific Malliavin gradient enabling
us to encode the distribution of the Malliavin derivative by the spectrum of some Gaussian matrix.
This allows us to revisit the fourth moment phenomenon in terms of the behavior of its spectral radius.
