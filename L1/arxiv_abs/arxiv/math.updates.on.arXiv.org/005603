The use of flying platforms such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), popularly known as drones,
is rapidly growing. In particular, with their inherent attributes such as mobility, flexibility,
and adaptive altitude, UAVs admit several key potential applications in wireless systems. On the
one hand, UAVs can be used as aerial base stations to enhance coverage, capacity, reliability, and
energy efficiency of wireless networks. On the other hand, UAVs can operate as flying mobile terminals
within a cellular network. Such cellular-connected UAVs can enable several applications ranging
from real-time video streaming to item delivery. In this paper, a comprehensive tutorial on the
potential benefits and applications of UAVs in wireless communications is presented. Moreover,
the important challenges and the fundamental tradeoffs in UAV-enabled wireless networks are thoroughly
investigated. In particular, the key UAV challenges such as three-dimensional deployment, performance
analysis, channel modeling, and energy efficiency are explored along with representative results.
Then, open problems and potential research directions pertaining to UAV communications are introduced.
Finally, various analytical frameworks and mathematical tools such as optimization theory, machine
learning, stochastic geometry, transport theory, and game theory are described. The use of such
tools for addressing unique UAV problems is also presented. In a nutshell, this tutorial provides
key guidelines on how to analyze, optimize, and design UAV-based wireless communication systems.
