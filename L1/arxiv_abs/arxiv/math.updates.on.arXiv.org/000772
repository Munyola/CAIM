This paper is devoted to establish quantitative and qualitative estimates related to the notion
of chaos as firstly formulated by M. Kac in his study of mean-field limit for systems of $N$ undistinguishable
particles. First, we quantitatively liken three usual measures of Kac's chaos, some involving
the all $N$ variables, other involving a finite fixed number of variables. Next, we define the notion
of entropy chaos and Fisher information chaos in a similar way as defined by Carlen et al (KRM 2010).
We show that Fisher information chaos is stronger than entropy chaos, which in turn is stronger than
Kac's chaos. More importantly, with the help of the HWI inequality of Otto-Villani, we establish
a quantitative estimate between these quantities, which in particular asserts that Kac's chaos
plus Fisher information bound implies entropy chaos. We then extend the above quantitative and
qualitative results about chaos in the framework of probability measures with support on the Kac's
spheres. Additionally to the above mentioned tool, we use and prove an optimal rate local CLT in $L^\infty$
norm for distributions with finite 6-th moment and finite $L^p$ norm, for some $p>1$. Last, we
investigate how our techniques can be used without assuming chaos, in the context of probability
measures mixtures introduced by De Finetti, Hewitt and Savage. In particular, we define the (level
3) Fisher information for mixtures and prove that it is l.s.c. and affine, as that was done previously
for the level 3 Boltzmann's entropy.
