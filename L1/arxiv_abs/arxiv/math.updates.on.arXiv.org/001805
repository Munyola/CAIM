The central problem of quantum statistics is to devise measurement schemes for the estimation of
an unknown state, given an ensemble of $n$ independent identically prepared systems. For locally
quadratic loss functions, the risk of standard procedures has the usual scaling of $1/n$. However,
it has been noticed that for fidelity based metrics such as the Bures distance, the risk of conventional
(non-adaptive) qubit tomography schemes scales as $1/\sqrt{n}$ for states close to the boundary
of the Bloch sphere. Several proposed estimators appear to improve this scaling, and our goal is
to analyse the problem from the perspective of the maximum risk over all states. We propose qubit
estimation strategies based on separate and adaptive measurements, that achieve $1/n$ scalings
for the maximum Bures risk. The estimator involving local measurements uses a fixed fraction of
the available resource $n$ to estimate the Bloch vector direction; the length of the Bloch vector
is then estimated from the remaining copies by measuring in the estimator eigenbasis. The estimator
based on collective measurements uses local asymptotic normality techniques which allows us derive
upper and lower bounds to its maximum Bures risk. We also discuss how to construct a minimax optimal
estimator in this setup. Finally, we consider quantum relative entropy and show that the risk of
the estimator based on collective measurements achieves a rate $O(n^{-1}\log n)$ under this loss
function. Furthermore, we show that no estimator can achieve faster rates, in particular the `standard'
rate $1/n$.
