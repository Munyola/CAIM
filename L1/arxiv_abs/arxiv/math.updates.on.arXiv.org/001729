Let G be a group, and let M=(m_n) be a sequence of finitely supported probability measures on G. Consider
the probability that two elements chosen independently according to m_n commute. Antolin, Martino
and Ventura define the 'degree of commutativity' dc_M(G) of G with respect to this sequence to be
the lim sup of this probability. The main results of the present paper give quantitative algebraic
consequences of the degree of commutativity being above certain thresholds. For example, if m_n
is the distribution of the nth step of a symmetric random walk on G, or if G is amenable and (m_n) is a
sequence of almost-invariant measures on G, we show that if dc_M(G)>5/8 then G is abelian; if it is
at least 1/2+c then the centre of G has index at most 1/c; and if it is at least a>0 then G contains a normal
subgroup G' of index O_a(1) and a normal subgroup H of cardinality at most O_a(1) such that G'/H is
abelian. We also describe some general conditions on (m_n) under which such theorems hold. These
results generalise results for finite groups due to Gustafson and P. M. Neumann, and generalise
and quantify a result for certain residually finite groups of subexponential growth due to Antolin,
Martino and Ventura. We also present an application to conjugacy ratios, showing that if the sequence
of word-metric balls in a finitely generated group is both left- and right-Folner then the conjugacy
ratio is equal to the degree of commutativity. Combined with our main results, this generalises
a result of Ciobanu, Cox and Martino.
