We study the list chromatic number of Cartesian products of graphs through the Alon-Tarsi number
as defined by Jensen and Toft (1995) in their seminal book on graph coloring problems. The Alon-Tarsi
number of $G$, $AT(G)$, is the smallest $k$ for which there is an orientation, $D$, of $G$ with max
indegree $k\!-\!1$ such that the number of even and odd circulations contained in $D$ are different.
It is known that $\chi(G) \leq \chi_\ell(G) \leq \chi_p(G) \leq AT(G)$, where $\chi(G)$ is the chromatic
number, $\chi_\ell(G)$ is the list chromatic number, and $\chi_p(G)$ is the paint number of $G$.
In this paper we find families of graphs $G$ and $H$ such that $\chi(G \square H) = AT(G \square H)$,
reducing this sequence of inequalities to equality. We show that the Alon-Tarsi number of the Cartesian
product of an odd cycle and a path is always equal to 3. This result is then extended to show that if $G$
is an odd cycle or a complete graph and $H$ is a graph on at least two vertices containing the Hamilton
path $w_1, w_2, \ldots, w_n$ such that for each $i$, $w_i$ has a most $k$ neighbors among $w_1, w_2,
\ldots, w_{i-1}$, then $AT(G \square H) \leq \Delta(G)+k$ where $\Delta(G)$ is the maximum degree
of $G$. We discuss other extensions for $G \square H$, where $G$ is such that $V(G)$ can be partitioned
into odd cycles and complete graphs, and $H$ is a graph containing a Hamiltonian path. We apply these
bounds to get chromatic-choosable Cartesian products, in fact we show that these families of graphs
have $\chi(G) = AT(G)$, improving previously known bounds.
