In this article, we conduct a study of integral operators defined in terms of non-convolution type
kernels with singularities of various degrees. The operators that fall within our scope of research
include fractional integrals, fractional derivatives, pseudodifferential operators, Calder\'on-Zygmund
operators, and many others. The main results of this article are built around the notion of an operator
calculus that connects operators with different kernel singularities via vanishing moment conditions
and composition with fractional derivative operators. We also provide several boundedness results
on weighted and unweighted distribution spaces, including homogeneous Sobolev, Besov, and Triebel-Lizorkin
spaces, that are necessary and sufficient for the operator's vanishing moment properties, as well
as certain behaviors for the operator under composition with fractional derivative and integral
operators. As applications, we prove $T1$ type theorems for singular integral operators with different
singularities, boundedness results for pseudodifferential operators belonging to the forbidden
class $S_{1,1}^0$, fractional order and hyper-singular paraproduct boundedness, a smooth-oscillating
decomposition for singular integrals, sparse domination estimates that quantify regularity
and oscillation, and several operator calculus results. It is of particular interest that many
of these results do not require $L^2$-boundedness of the operator, and furthermore, we apply our
results to some operators that are known not to be $L^2$-bounded.
