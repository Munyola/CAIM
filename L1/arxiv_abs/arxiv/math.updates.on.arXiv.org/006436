This paper studies index coding with two senders. In this setup, source messages are distributed
among the senders possibly with common messages. In addition, there are multiple receivers, with
each receiver having some messages a priori, known as side-information, and requesting one unique
message such that each message is requested by only one receiver. Index coding in this setup is called
two-sender unicast index coding (TSUIC). The main goal is to find the shortest aggregate normalized
codelength, which is expressed as the optimal broadcast rate. In this work, firstly, for a given
TSUIC problem, we form three independent sub-problems each consisting of the only subset of the
messages, based on whether the messages are available only in one of the senders or in both senders.
Then we express the optimal broadcast rate of the TSUIC problem as a function of the optimal broadcast
rates of those independent sub-problems. In this way, we discover the structural characteristics
of TSUIC. For the proofs of our results, we utilize confusion graphs and coding techniques used in
single-sender index coding. To adapt the confusion graph technique in TSUIC, we introduce a new
graph-coloring approach that is different from the normal graph coloring, which we call two-sender
graph coloring, and propose a way of grouping the vertices to analyze the number of colors used. We
further determine a class of TSUIC instances where a certain type of side-information can be removed
without affecting their optimal broadcast rates. Finally, we generalize the results of a class
of TSUIC problems to multiple senders.
