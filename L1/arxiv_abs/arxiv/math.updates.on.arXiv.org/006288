Some systems of nonlinear wave equations admit global solutions for all sufficiently small initial
data, while others do not. The (classical) null condition guarantees that such a result holds, but
it is too strong to capture certain systems -- most famously the Einstein equations -- which nevertheless
admit global solutions for small initial data. The weak null condition has been proposed as a sufficient
condition for such a result to hold; it takes the form of a condition on a related set of nonlinear ODEs
known as the "asymptotic system". Previous results in this direction have required certain structural
conditions on the asymptotic system in addition to the weak null condition. In this work we show that,
if the solutions to the asymptotic system are bounded (given small initial data), and, in addition,
if these solutions are stable against rapidly decaying perturbations, then the corresponding
system of nonlinear wave equations admits global solutions for all sufficiently small initial
data. This avoids any direct assumptions on the structure of the nonlinear terms. We also give an
example of a class of systems obeying this condition but not obeying previously identified structural
conditions. For this class the asymptotic system arises as a generalisation of the "Euler equations"
for rigid body motion, associated with a left-invariant Hamiltonian flow on a finite dimensional
Lie group. This work relies heavily on the author's previous work, "The weak null condition and global
existence using the p-weighted energy method".
