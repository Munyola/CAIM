We derive bounds on the distribution function, therefore also on the Value-at-Risk, of $\varphi(\mathbf
X)$ where $\varphi$ is an aggregation function and $\mathbf X = (X_1,\dots,X_d)$ is a random vector
with known marginal distributions and partially known dependence structure. More specifically,
we analyze three types of available information on the dependence structure: First, we consider
the case where extreme value information, such as the distributions of partial minima and maxima
of $\mathbf X$, is available. In order to include this information in the computation of Value-at-Risk
bounds, we utilize a reduction principle that relates this problem to an optimization problem over
a standard Fr\'echet class, which can then be solved by means of the rearrangement algorithm or using
analytical results. Second, we assume that the copula of $\mathbf X$ is known on a subset of its domain,
and finally we consider the case where the copula of $\mathbf X$ lies in the vicinity of a reference
copula as measured by a statistical distance. In order to derive Value-at-Risk bounds in the latter
situations, we first improve the Fr\'echet--Hoeffding bounds on copulas so as to include this additional
information on the dependence structure. Then, we translate the improved Fr\'echet--Hoeffding
bounds to bounds on the Value-at-Risk using the so-called improved standard bounds. In numerical
examples we illustrate that the additional information typically leads to a significant improvement
of the bounds compared to the marginals-only case.
