Let $G$ be a discrete countable group, and let $\Gamma$ be an almost normal subgroup. In this paper
we analyze the classification of (projective) unitary representations $\pi$ of $G$ on $l^2(\Gamma)$,
extending the left regular representation of $\Gamma$. Let $K$ be the canonical profinite completion
of the subgroup $\Gamma$ and let $\mathcal S$ be the corresponding profinite extension of $G$. Let
$\mathcal{M}$ be the reduced, von Neumann algebra, crossed product ${L(G \rtimes L^{\infty}(\mathcal
S,\nu))}$, with respect Haar measure on $\mathcal S$. Let $G^{\rm op}$ be the group $G$ with opposite
multiplication acting canonically on $\mathcal{M}$. We establish a correspondence between unitary
representations as above and ${G^{\rm op}}$-equivariant splittings of the crossed product von
Neumann algebra $\mathcal{M}$. Let $P = {L(\Gamma \rtimes L^{\infty}(K,\mu))}$ be the von Neumann
algebra, reduced crossed product. Let $\rho_{\; \Gamma \backslash G}$ be the right quasi-regular
representation of ${G^{\rm op}}$ on $l^2(\Gamma \backslash G)$. Then, given a representation
$\pi$ as above, there exists a representation $\alpha_g$ of $G$ into the automorphism group of $P$
(unique up to cocycle perturbation), such that, $G^{\rm op}$ equivariantly, we have that $\mathcal{M}
\cong P \otimes B(l^2(\Gamma \backslash G))$, where on the left side of the above isomorphism, the
group $G^{\rm op}$ acts trivially on $L(G)$ and it acts by right translations, on $\mathcal S$. On
the right side we have the action of ${G^{\rm op}}$ defined by $g \to \alpha_g \otimes {\rm Ad}\rho_{\;
\Gamma/G}(g)$, $g \in G$.
