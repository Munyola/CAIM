Since the seminal work of Scarf (1958) [A min-max solution of an inventory problem, Studies in the
Mathematical Theory of Inventory and Production, pages 201-209] on the newsvendor problem with
ambiguity in the demand distribution, there has been a growing interest in the study of the distributionally
robust newsvendor problem. The optimal order quantity is computed by accounting for the worst possible
distribution from a set of demand distributions that is characterized by partial information,
such as moments. The model is criticized at times for being overly conservative since the worst-case
distribution is discrete with a few support points. However, it is the order quantity from the model
that is typically of practical relevance. A simple observation shows that the optimal order quantity
in Scarf's model with known first and second moment is also optimal for a heavy-tailed censored student-t
distribution with degrees of freedom 2. In this paper, we generalize this "heavy-tail optimality"
property of the distributionally robust newsvendor to a more general ambiguity set where information
on the first and the $n$th moment is known, for any real number $n > 1$. We provide a characterization
of the optimal order quantity under this ambiguity set by showing that for high critical ratios,
the order quantity is optimal for a regularly varying distribution with an approximate power law
tail with tail index $n$. We illustrate the applicability of the model by calibrating the ambiguity
set from data and comparing the performance of the order quantities computed via various methods
in a dataset.
