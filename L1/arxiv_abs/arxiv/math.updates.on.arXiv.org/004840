The homogenization of periodic elastic composites is addressed through the reformulation of the
local equations of the mechanical problem in a geometric functional setting. This relies on the
definition of Hilbert spaces of kinematically and statically admissible tensor fields, whose
orthogonality and duality properties are recalled. These are endowed with specific energetic
scalar products that make use of a reference and uniform elasticity tensor. The corresponding strain
and stress Green's operators are introduced and interpreted as orthogonal projection operators
in the admissibility spaces. In this context and as an alternative to classical minimum energy principles,
two geometric variational principles are investigated with the introduction of functionals that
aim at measuring the discrepancy of arbitrary test fields to the kinematic, static or material admissibility
conditions of the problem. By relaxing the corresponding local equations, this study aims in particular
at laying the groundwork for the homogenization of composites whose constitutive properties are
only partially known or uncertain. The local fields in the composite and their macroscopic responses
are computed through the minimization of the proposed geometric functionals. To do so, their gradients
are computed using the Green's operators and gradient-based optimization schemes are discussed.
A FFT-based implementation of these schemes is proposed and they are assessed numerically on a canonical
example for which analytical solutions are available.
