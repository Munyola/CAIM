The continuous wavelet transform (CWT) is a linear time-frequency representation and a powerful
tool for analyzing non-stationary signals. The synchrosqueezing transform (SST) is a special
type of the reassignment method which not only enhances the energy concentration of CWT in the time-frequency
plane, but also separates the components of multicomponent signals. The "bump wavelet" and Morlet's
wavelet are commonly used continuous wavelets for the wavelet-based SST. There is a parameter in
these wavelets which controls the widths of the time-frequency localization window. In most literature
on SST, this parameter is a fixed positive constant. In this paper, we consider the CWT with a time-varying
parameter (called the adaptive CWT) and the corresponding SST (called the adaptive SST) for multicomponent
signal separation. We also introduce the second-order adaptive SST. We analyze the separation
conditions for non-stationary multicomponent signals with the local approximation of linear
frequency modulation mode. We derive well-separated conditions of a multicomponent signal based
on the adaptive CWT. We propose methods to select the time-varying parameter so that the corresponding
adaptive SSTs of the components of a multicomponent signal have sharp representations and are well-separated,
and hence the components can be recovered more accurately. We provide comparison experimental
results to demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of the proposed adaptive CWT and adaptive
SST in separating components of multicomponent signals with fast varying frequencies.
