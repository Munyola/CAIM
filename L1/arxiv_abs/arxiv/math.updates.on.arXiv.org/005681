Given a graph $H$, the extremal number $\mathrm{ex}(n,H)$ is the largest number of edges in an $H$-free
graph on $n$ vertices. We make progress on a number of conjectures about the extremal number of bipartite
graphs. First, writing $K'_{s,t}$ for the subdivision of the bipartite graph $K_{s,t}$, we show
that $\mathrm{ex}(n, K'_{s,t}) = O(n^{3/2 - \frac{1}{2s}})$. This proves a conjecture of Kang,
Kim and Liu and is tight up to the implied constant for $t$ sufficiently large in terms of $s$. Second,
for any integers $s, k \geq 1$, we show that $\mathrm{ex}(n, L) = \Theta(n^{1 + \frac{s}{sk+1}})$
for a particular graph $L$ depending on $s$ and $k$, answering another question of Kang, Kim and Liu.
This result touches upon an old conjecture of Erd\H{o}s and Simonovits, which asserts that every
rational number $r \in (1,2)$ is realisable in the sense that $\mathrm{ex}(n,H) = \Theta(n^r)$
for some appropriate graph $H$, giving infinitely many new realisable exponents and implying that
$1 + 1/k$ is a limit point of realisable exponents for all $k \geq 1$. Writing $H^k$ for the $k$-subdivision
of a graph $H$, this result also implies that for any bipartite graph $H$ and any $k$, there exists
$\delta > 0$ such that $\mathrm{ex}(n,H^{k-1}) = O(n^{1 + 1/k - \delta})$, partially resolving
a question of Conlon and Lee. Third, extending a recent result of Conlon and Lee, we show that any bipartite
graph $H$ with maximum degree $r$ on one side which does not contain $C_4$ as a subgraph satisfies
$\mathrm{ex}(n, H) = o(n^{2 - 1/r})$.
