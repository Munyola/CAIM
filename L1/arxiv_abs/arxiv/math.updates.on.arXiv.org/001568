Classical dimensional analysis has two limitations: (i) the computed dimensionless groups are
not unique, and (ii) the analysis does not measure relative importance of the dimensionless groups.
We propose two algorithms for estimating unique and relevant dimensionless groups assuming the
experimenter can control the system's independent variables and evaluate the corresponding dependent
variable; e.g., computer experiments provide such a setting. The first algorithm is based on a response
surface constructed from a set of experiments. The second algorithm uses many experiments to estimate
finite differences over a range of the independent variables. Both algorithms are semi-empirical
because they use experimental data to complement the dimensional analysis. We derive the algorithms
by combining classical semi-empirical modeling with active subspaces, which---given a probability
density on the independent variables---yield unique and relevant dimensionless groups. The connection
between active subspaces and dimensional analysis also reveals that all empirical models are ridge
functions, which are functions that are constant along low-dimensional subspaces in its domain.
We demonstrate the proposed algorithms on the well-studied example of viscous pipe flow---both
turbulent and laminar cases. The results include a new set of two dimensionless groups for turbulent
pipe flow that are ordered by relevance to the system; the precise notion of relevance is closely
tied to the derivative based global sensitivity metric from Sobol' and Kucherenko.
