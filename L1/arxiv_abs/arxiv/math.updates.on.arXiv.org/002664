We study the perturbed sine-Gordon equation $\theta_{tt}-\theta_{xx}+\sin \theta= F(\varepsilon,x)$,
where we assume that the perturbation $F$ is analytic in $\varepsilon$ and that its derivatives
with respect to $\varepsilon$ satisfy certain bounds at $\varepsilon=0$. We construct implicitly
an, adjusted to the perturbation $F$, virtual solitary manifold, which is invariant in the following
sense: The initial value problem for the perturbed sine-Gordon equation with an appropriate initial
state on the constructed manifold has a unique solution, which follows a trajectory on the virtual
solitary manifold. The trajectory is precisely described by two parameters, which satisfy a specific
system of ODEs. The approach is based on the work of Mashkin (arXiv:1705.05713), where we constructed
by an iteration scheme a virtual solitary manifold for the perturbed sine-Gordon equation. In arXiv:1705.05713
we proved a stability result for the perturbed sine-Gordon equation with initial data close to the
virtual solitary manifold. The employed iteration scheme produces a sequence of virtual solitary
manifolds such that the accuracy of the corresponding stability statements increases after each
iteration step, as long as the perturbation $F$ is sufficiently often differentiable. The invariant
virtual solitary manifold constructed in this work is generated as a limit of the virtual solitary
manifolds produced by the iteration scheme. The method and the kind of result presented in this paper
is to our knowledge a novelty in the field of stability of solitons.
