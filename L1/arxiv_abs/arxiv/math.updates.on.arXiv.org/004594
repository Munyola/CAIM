Hybrid digital analog (HDA) beamforming has attracted considerable attention in practical implementation
of millimeter wave (mmWave) multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) systems due
to its low power consumption with respect to its digital baseband counterpart. The implementation
cost, performance, and power efficiency of HDA beamforming depends on the level of connectivity
and reconfigurability of the analog beamforming network. In this paper, we investigate the performance
of two typical architectures for HDA MU-MIMO, i.e., the fully-connected (FC) architecture where
each RF antenna port is connected to all antenna elements of the array, and the one-stream-per-subarray
(OSPS) architecture where the RF antenna ports are connected to disjoint subarrays. We jointly
consider the initial beam acquisition phase and data communication phase, such that the latter
takes place by using the beam direction information obtained in the former phase. For each phase,
we propose our own BA and precoding schemes that outperform the counterparts in the literature.
We also evaluate the power efficiency of the two HDA architectures taking into account the practical
hardware impairments, e.g., the power dissipation at different hardware components as well as
the potential power backoff under typical power amplifier (PA) constraints. Numerical results
show that the two architectures achieve similar sum spectral efficiency, but the OSPS architecture
outperforms the FC case in terms of hardware complexity and power efficiency, only at the cost of
a slightly longer time of initial beam acquisition.
