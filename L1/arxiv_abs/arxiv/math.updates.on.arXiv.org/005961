We study signal-to-interference plus noise ratio (SINR) percolation for Cox point processes,
i.e., Poisson point processes with a random intensity measure. SINR percolation was first studied
by Dousse et al. in the case of a two-dimensional Poisson point process. It is a version of continuum
percolation where the connection between two points depends on the locations of all points of the
point process. Continuum percolation for Cox point processes was recently studied by Hirsch, Jahnel,
and Cali. We study the SINR graph model for a stationary Cox point process in two or higher dimensions,
in case of a bounded and integrable path-loss function. We show that if this function has compact
support or if the stationary intensity measure evaluated at a unit box has some exponential moments,
then the SINR graph has an infinite connected component in case the spatial density of points is large
enough and the interferences are sufficiently reduced (without vanishing). This holds if the intensity
measure is asymptotically essentially connected, and also if the intensity measure is only stabilizing
but the connection radius is large. We also provide estimates on the critical interference cancellation
factor. A prominent example of the intensity measure is the two-dimensional Poisson--Voronoi
tessellation, which is used for modelling real-world street systems. We show that its total edge
length in a unit square has some exponential moments. We conclude that its SINR graph percolates
for any bounded path-loss function with power-law decay of exponent larger than 2.
