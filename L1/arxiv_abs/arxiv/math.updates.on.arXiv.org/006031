Given a digraph $G$, a parameter $\alpha\in(0,1)$ and a distribution $\lambda$ over the vertices
of $G$, the generalised PageRank surf on $G$ with parameters $\alpha$ and $\lambda$ is the Markov
chain on the vertices of $G$ such that at each step with probability $\alpha$ the state is updated
with an independent sample from $\lambda$, while with probability $1-\alpha$ the state is moved
to a uniformly random vertex in the out-neighbourhood of the current state. The stationary distribution
is the so-called PageRank vector. We analyse convergence to stationarity of this Markov chain when
$G$ is a large sparse random digraph with given degree sequences, in the limit of vanishing parameter
$\alpha$. We identify three scenarios: when $\alpha$ is much smaller than the inverse of the mixing
time of $G$ the relaxation to equilibrium is dominated by the simple random walk and displays a cutoff
behaviour; when $\alpha$ is much larger than the inverse of the mixing time of $G$ on the contrary
one has pure exponential decay with rate $\alpha$; when $\alpha$ is comparable to the inverse of
the mixing time of $G$ there is a mixed behaviour interpolating between cutoff and exponential decay.
This trichotomy is shown to hold uniformly in the starting point and for a large class of distributions
$\lambda$, including widespread as well as strongly localized measures. Our results are crucially
based on recent progress in the analysis of mixing times for the simple random walk on sparse random
digraphs by Bordenave-Caputo-Salez.
