We propose random walks on suitably defined graphs as a framework for finescale modeling of particle
motion in an obstructed environment where the particle may have interactions with the obstructions
and the mean path length of the particle may not be negligible in comparison to the finescale. This
motivates our study of a periodic, directed, and weighted graph embedded in ${\mathbb R}^d$ and
the scaling limit of the associated continuous-time random walk $Z(t)$ on the graph's nodes, which
jumps along the graph's edges with jump rates given by the edge weights. We show that the scaled process
$\varepsilon^2 Z(t/\varepsilon^2)$ converges to a linear drift $\bar{U}t$ and the case of interest
to us is that of null drift $\bar{U}=0$. In this case, we show that $\varepsilon Z(t/\varepsilon^2)$
converges weakly to a Brownian motion. The diffusivity of the limiting Brownian motion can be computed
by solving a set of linear algebra problems. As we allow for jump rates to be irreversible, our framework
allows for the modeling of very general forms of interactions such as attraction, repulsion, and
bonding. We provide some sufficient conditions for null drift that include certain symmetries
of the graph. We also provide a formal asymptotic derivation of the effective diffusivity in analogy
with homogenization theory for PDEs. For the case of reversible jump rates, we derive an equivalent
variational formulation. This derivation involves developing notions of gradient for functions
on the graph's nodes, divergence for ${\mathbb R}^d$-valued functions on the graph's edges, and
a divergence theorem.
