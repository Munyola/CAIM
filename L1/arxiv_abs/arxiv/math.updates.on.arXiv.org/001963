Our main goal is to study a class of processes whose increments are generated via a cellular automata
rule. Given the increments of a simple biased random walk, a new sequence of (dependent) Bernoulli
random variables is produced. It is built, from the original sequence, according to a cellular automata
rule. Equipped with these two sequences, we construct two more according to the same cellular automata
rule. The construction is repeated a fixed number of times yielding an infinite array ($\{-K,\ldots,K\}\times\N$)
of (dependent) Bernoulli random variables. %In turn, using this new sequence as input, we reiterate
a construction of a new sequence. %This process is repeated a finite number of times resulting in
an infinite array, herein called the "downward process", of highly dependent Bernoulli random
variables. The process of taking partial products can be reversed allowing to construct new sequences,
herein called the "upward process", the characteristics of which are different from the downward
process. Taking partial sums of these sequences, we obtain a $(2K+1)$-dimensional process whose
increments belong to the state space $\{-1,1\}^{2K+1}$. The aim of the paper is to study the long
term behaviour of this process. In particular, we establish transience/recurrence properties
and prove an invariance principle. The limiting behaviour of these processes depends strongly
on the direction of the iteration, and exhibits few surprising features. This work is motivated
by an earlier investigation in which the starting sequence is symmetric.
