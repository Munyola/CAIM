The ability to dynamically and efficiently allocate resources to meet the need of growing diversity
in services and user behavior marks the future of wireless communications, giving rise to intelligent
processing, which aims at enabling the system to perceive and assess the available resources, to
autonomously learn to adapt to the perceived wireless environment, and to reconfigure its operating
mode to maximize the utility of the available resources. The perception capability and reconfigurability
are the essential features of cognitive radio technology while modern machine learning techniques
project effectiveness in system adaptation. In this paper, we discuss the development of the cognitive
radio technology and machine learning techniques and emphasize their roles in improving spectrum
and energy efficiency of wireless communication systems. We describe in detail the state-of-the-art
of cognitive radio technology, covering spectrum sensing and access approaches that may enhance
spectrum utilization and curtail energy consumption. We discuss powerful machine learning algorithms
that enable spectrum- and energy-efficient communications in dynamic wireless environments.
We also present practical applications of these techniques to the existing and future wireless
communication systems, such as heterogeneous networks and device-to-device communications,
and identify some research opportunities and challenges in cognitive radio and machine learning
as applied to future wireless communication systems.
