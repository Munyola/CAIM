Given a knot $K$ inside an integer homology sphere $Y$, the Casson-Lin-Herald invariant can be interpreted
as a signed count of conjugacy classes of irreducible representations of the knot complement into
$SU(2)$ which map the meridian of the knot to a fixed conjugacy class. It has the interesting feature
that it determines the Tristram-Levine signature of the knot associated to the conjugacy class
chosen. Turning things around, given a 4-manifold $X$ with the integral homology of $S^{1}\times
S^{3}$, and an embedded torus $T$ inside $X$ such that $H_{1}(T;\mathbb{Z})$ surjects onto $H_{1}(X;\mathbb{Z})$,
we define a signed count of conjugacy classes of irreducible representations of the torus complement
into $SU(2)$ which satisfy an analogous fixed conjugacy class condition to the one mentioned above
for the knot case. Our count recovers the Casson-Lin-Herald invariant of the knot in the product
case, thus it can be regarded as implicitly defining a Tristram-Levine signature for tori. This
count can also be considered as a singular Furuta-Ohta invariant, and it is a special case of a larger
family of Donaldson invariants which we also define. In particular, when $(X,T)$ is obtained from
a self-concordance of a knot $(Y,K)$ satisfying an admissibility condition, these Donaldson invariants
are related to the Lefschetz number of an Instanton Floer homology for knots which we construct.
Moreover, from these Floer groups we obtain Fr{\o}yshov invariants for knots which allows us to
assign a Fr{\o}yshov invariant to an embedded torus whenever it arises from such a self-concordance.
