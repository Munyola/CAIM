We study the qualitative properties of the unique global viscosity solution of the superquadratic
diffusive Hamilton-Jacobi equation with (generalized) homogeneous Dirichlet conditions. We
are interested in the phenomena of gradient blow-up (GBU), loss of boundary conditions (LBC), recovery
of boundary conditions and eventual regularization, and in their mutual connections. In any space
dimension, we establish the sharp minimal rate of GBU. Only partial results were previously known
except in one space dimension. We also obtain the corresponding minimal regularization rate. In
one space dimension, under suitable conditions on the initial data, we give a quite detailed description
of the behavior of solutions for all $t>0$. In particular, we show that nonminimal GBU solutions
immediately lose the boundary conditions after the blow-up time and are immediately regularized
after recovering the boundary data. Moreover, both GBU and regularization occur with the minimal
rates, while loss and recovery of boundary data occur with linear rate. We describe further the intermediate
singular life of those solutions in the time interval between GBU and regularization. We also study
minimal GBU solutions, for which GBU occurs {\it without} LBC: those solutions are immediately
regularized, but their GBU and regularization rates are more singular. Most of our one-dimensional
results crucially depend on zero-number arguments, which do not seem to have been used so far in the
context of viscosity solutions of Hamilton-Jacobi equations.
