Max-renewal processes, or Continuous Time Random Maxima, assume that events arrive according
to a renewal process, and track the running maximum of the magnitudes of events up to time $t$. In many
complex systems of interest, notably earthquakes, trades and neuron voltages, inter-arrival
times exhibit heavy-tailed distributions. The dynamics of events then exhibits memory, which
affects the rate at which events occur: rates are highly variable in some time intervals, while other
intervals have long quiescent periods, a behaviour which has been dubbed "bursty" in the physics
literature. This article provides a statistical model for the exceedances $X(\ell)$ and interexceedance
times $T(\ell)$ of events whose magnitude exceeds a given threshold $\ell$. We derive limit theorems
for the distribution of $X(\ell)$ and $T(\ell)$ as $\ell$ approaches extreme values. The standard
Peaks Over Threshold inference approach in extreme value theory is based on the fact that $X(\ell)$
is approximately generalized Pareto distributed, and models the threshold crossing times as a
standard Poisson process. We show that for waiting times with infinite mean, the threshold crossing
times approach a fractional Poisson process in the limit of high thresholds. The inter-arrival
times of threshold crossings scale with $p^{1/\beta}$, where $p$ is the threshold crossing probability
and $\beta \in(0,1)$ is the tail parameter for the waiting times. We provide graphical means of estimating
model parameters, and show that these methods provide useful results on simulated and real-world
datasets.
