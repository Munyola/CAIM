We aim to find a solution $\bm{x}\in\mathbb{C}^n$ to a system of quadratic equations of the form
$b_i=\lvert\bm{a}_i^*\bm{x}\rvert^2$, $i=1,2,\ldots,m$, e.g., the well-known NP-hard phase
retrieval problem. As opposed to recently proposed state-of-the-art nonconvex methods, we revert
to the semidefinite relaxation (SDR) PhaseLift convex formulation and propose a successive and
incremental nonconvex optimization algorithm, termed as \texttt{IncrePR}, to indirectly minimize
the resulting convex problem on the cone of positive semidefinite matrices. Our proposed method
overcomes the excessive computational cost of typical SDP solvers as well as the need of a good initialization
for typical nonconvex methods. For Gaussian measurements, which is usually needed for provable
convergence of nonconvex methods, \texttt{IncrePR} with restart strategy outperforms state-of-the-art
nonconvex solvers with a sharper phase transition of perfect recovery and typical convex solvers
in terms of computational cost and storage. For more challenging structured (non-Gaussian) measurements
often occurred in real applications, such as transmission matrix and oversampling Fourier transform,
\texttt{IncrePR} with several restarts can be used to find a good initial guess. With further refinement
by local nonconvex solvers, one can achieve a better solution than that obtained by applying nonconvex
solvers directly when the number of measurements is relatively small. Extensive numerical tests
are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
