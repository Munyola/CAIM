In this paper we initiate the study of equivariant wave maps from 2d hyperbolic space into rotationally
symmetric surfaces. This problem exhibits markedly different phenomena than its Euclidean counterpart
due to the exponential volume growth of concentric geodesic spheres on the domain. In particular,
when the target is the 2-sphere, we find a family of equivariant harmonic maps indexed by a parameter
that measures how far the image of each harmonic map wraps around the sphere. These maps have energies
taking all values between zero and the energy of the unique co-rotational Euclidean harmonic map,
Q, from the Euclidean plane to the 2-sphere, given by stereographic projection. We prove that the
harmonic maps are asymptotically stable for values of the parameter smaller than a threshold that
is large enough to allow for maps that wrap more than halfway around the sphere. Indeed, we prove Strichartz
estimates for the operator obtained by linearizing around such a harmonic map. However, for harmonic
maps with energies approaching the Euclidean energy of Q, asymptotic stability via a perturbative
argument based on Strichartz estimates is precluded by the existence of gap eigenvalues in the spectrum
of the linearized operator. When the target is 2d hyperbolic space, we find a continuous family of
asymptotically stable equivariant harmonic maps with arbitrarily small and arbitrarily large
energies. This stands in sharp contrast to the corresponding problem on Euclidean space, where
all finite energy solutions scatter to zero as time tends to infinity.
