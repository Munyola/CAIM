We prove that under certain conditions, phase separation is enough to sustain a regime in which current
flows along the concentration gradient, a phenomenon which is known in the literature as \textit{uphill
diffusion}. The model we consider here is a version of that proposed in [G. B. Giacomin, J. L. Lebowitz,
Phase segregation dynamics in particle system with long range interactions, Journal of Statistical
Physics 87(1) (1997): 37-61], which is the continuous mesoscopic limit of a $1d$ discrete Ising
chain with a Kac potential. The magnetization profile lies in the interval $\left[-\varepsilon^{-1},\varepsilon^{-1}\right]$,
$\varepsilon>0$, staying in contact at the boundaries with infinite reservoirs of fixed magnetization
$\pm\mu$, $\mu\in(m^*\left(\beta\right),1)$, where $m^*\left(\beta\right)=\sqrt{1-1/\beta}$,
$\beta>1$ representing the inverse temperature. At last, an external field of Heaviside-type
of intensity $\kappa>0$ is introduced. According to the axiomatic non-equilibrium theory, we
derive from the mesoscopic free energy functional the corresponding stationary equation and prove
the existence of a solution, which is antisymmetric with respect to the origin and discontinuous
in $x=0$, provided $\varepsilon$ is small enough. When $\mu$ is metastable, the current is positive
and bounded from below by a positive constant independent of $\kappa$, this meaning that both phase
transition as well as external field contributes to uphill diffusion, which is a regime that actually
survives when the external bias is removed.
