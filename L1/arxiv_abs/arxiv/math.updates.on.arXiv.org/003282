Amdeberhan's conjectures on the enumeration, the average size, and the largest size of $(n,n+1)$-core
partitions with distinct parts have motivated many research on this topic. Recently, Straub and
Nath-Sellers obtained formulas for the numbers of $(n, dn-1)$ and $(n, dn+1)$-core partitions
with distinct parts, respectively. Let $X_{s,t}$ be the size of a uniform random $(s,t)$-core partition
with distinct parts when $s$ and $t$ are coprime to each other. Some explicit formulas for the $k$-th
moments $\mathbb{E} [X_{n,n+1}^k]$ and $\mathbb{E} [X_{2n+1,2n+3}^k]$ were given by Zaleski
and Zeilberger when $k$ is small. Zaleski also studied the expectation and higher moments of $X_{n,dn-1}$
and conjectured some polynomiality properties concerning them in arXiv:1702.05634. Motivated
by the above works, we derive several polynomiality results and asymptotic formulas for the $k$-th
moments of $X_{n,dn+1}$ and $X_{n,dn-1}$ in this paper, by studying the beta sets of core partitions.
In particular, we show that these $k$-th moments are asymptotically some polynomials of n with degrees
at most $2k$, when $d$ is given and $n$ tends to infinity. Moreover, when $d=1$, we derive that the
$k$-th moment $\mathbb{E} [X_{n,n+1}^k]$ of $X_{n,n+1}$ is asymptotically equal to $\left(n^2/10\right)^k$
when $n$ tends to infinity. The explicit formulas for the expectations $\mathbb{E} [X_{n,dn+1}]$
and $\mathbb{E} [X_{n,dn-1}]$ are also given. The $(n,dn-1)$-core case in our results proves several
conjectures of Zaleski on the polynomiality of the expectation and higher moments of $X_{n,dn-1}$.
