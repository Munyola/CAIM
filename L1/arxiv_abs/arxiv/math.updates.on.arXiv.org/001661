Let $S$ be a finite set of primes. The $S$-part $[m]_S$ of a non-zero integer $m$ is the largest positive
divisor of $m$ that is composed of primes from $S$. In 2013, Gross and Vincent proved that if $f(X)$
is a polynomial with integer coefficients and with at least two roots in the complex numbers, then
for every integer $x$ at which $f(x)$ is non-zero, we have (*) $[f(x)]_S\leq c\cdot |f(x)|^d$, where
$c$ and $d$ are effectively computable and $d<1$. Their proof uses Baker-type estimates for linear
forms in complex logarithms of algebraic numbers. As an easy application of the $p$-adic Thue-Siegel-Roth
theorem we show that if $f(X)$ has degree $n\geq 2$ and no multiple roots, then an inequality such
as (*) holds for all $d>1/n$, provided we do not require effectivity of $c$. Further, we show that
such an inequality does not hold anymore with $d=1/n$ and sufficiently small $c$. In addition we
prove a density result, giving for every $\epsilon>0$ an asymptotic estimate with the right order
of magnitude for the number of integers $x$ with absolute value at most $B$ such that $f(x)$ has $S$-part
at least $|f(x)|^{\epsilon}$. The result of Gross and Vincent, as well as the other results mentioned
above, are generalized to values of binary forms and decomposable forms at integral points. Our
main tools are Baker type estimates for linear forms in complex and $p$-adic logarithms, the $p$-adic
Subspace Theorem of Schmidt and Schlickewei, and a recent general lattice point counting result
of Barroero and Widmer.
