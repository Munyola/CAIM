Mustafin varieties are flat degenerations of projective spaces, induced by a choice of an $n-$tuple
of lattices in a vector space over a non-archimedean field. They were introduced by Mustafin in the
70s in order to generalise Mumford's groundbreaking work on the unformisation of curves to higher
dimension. These varieties have a rich combinatorial structure as can be seen in pioneering work
of Cartwright, H\"abich, Sturmfels and Werner. In this paper, we introduce a new approach to Mustafin
varieties in terms of images of rational maps, which were studied by Li. Applying tropical intersection
theory and tropical convex hull computations, we use this method to give a new combinatorial description
of the irreducible components of the special fibers of Mustafin varieties. This enables connections
to various topics. In particular, we see that any multiview variety appears as an irreducible component
of the special fiber of some Mustafin variety. Furthermore, we use an interpretation of Mustafin
varieties as a moduli functor introduced by Faltings to relate them to certain moduli functors,
called linked Grassmannians. These objects are featured in limit linear series theory. The focal
point of study regarding linked Grassmannians are so-called \textit{simple points}. As a direct
consequence of the new combinatorial description of Mustafin varieties, we prove that the simple
points of linked Grassmannians are dense in every fiber. Finally, we use the connection to linked
Grassmannians, to relate the special fibers of Mustafin varieties to certain local models of unitary
Shimura varieties.
