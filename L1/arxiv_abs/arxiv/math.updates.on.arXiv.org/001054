Let $\Omega$ be a bounded domain in $\mathbb{R}^n$ ($n\geq 2$). We perturb it to a domain $\Omega^\varepsilon$
attaching a family of small domains with so-called "room-and-passage" geometry ($\varepsilon>0$
is a small parameter), the diameters of the attached domains tend to zero as $\varepsilon\to 0$.
Peculiar spectral properties of Neumann problems in such perturbed domains were observed for the
first time by R. Courant and D. Gilbert. In the present work we study the case, when the number of attached
domains tends to infinity as $\varepsilon\to 0$ and they are $\varepsilon$-periodically distributed
along a part of $\partial\Omega$. Our goal is to describe the asymptotic behaviour of the spectrum
of the operator $\mathcal{A}^\varepsilon=-(\rho^\varepsilon)^{-1}\Delta_{\Omega^\varepsilon}$,
where $\Delta_{\Omega^\varepsilon}$ is the Neumann Laplacian in $\Omega^\varepsilon$, and
the positive function $\rho^\varepsilon$ (mass density) is equal to $1$ in $\Omega$. We prove that
as $\varepsilon\to 0$ the spectrum of $\mathcal{A}^\varepsilon$ converges in the Hausdorff sense
to the "spectrum" of the problem $$-\Delta u=\lambda u\text{ in }\Omega,\quad {\partial u\over\partial
n}=\mathcal{F}(\lambda) u\text{ on }\Gamma, \quad {\partial u\over\partial n}=0\text{ on }\partial\Omega\setminus\Gamma,$$
where $\Gamma$ is a perturbed part of $\partial\Omega$, and $\mathcal{F}(\lambda)$ is either
linear or rational function. In the later case $\mathcal{F}(\lambda)$ has exactly one pole, which
is a point of accumulation of eigenvalues.
