We consider a class of autonomous Hamiltonian systems subject to small, time-periodic perturbations.
When the perturbation parameter is set to zero, the energy of the system is preserved. This is no longer
the case when the perturbation parameter is non-zero. We describe a topological method to show that
for every suitably small, non-zero perturbation parameter, there exist diffusing orbits along
which the energy changes by an amount independent of the perturbation, as well as orbits along which
the energy makes chaotic jumps. The method yields quantitative estimates: an explicit range of
the perturbation parameter for which these phenomena occur, the speed at which the energy changes
along diffusing orbits, and the Hausdorff dimension of the set of initial conditions that exhibit
chaotic behavior. In addition, the distributions of energies along orbits starting from some sets
of initial conditions converge to a Brownian motion with drift as the perturbation parameter tends
to zero. Moreover, we can obtain any desired values of the drift and of the variance for the limiting
Brownian motion, for appropriate sets of initial conditions. Our results address some conjectures
made by Arnold and Chirikov. A key feature of our topological method is that it can be implemented
in computer assisted proofs. As an application, we show the existence of Arnold diffusion, and provide
quantitative estimates, in a concrete model of the planar elliptic restricted three-body problem
describing the motion of an infinitesimal body relative to the Neptune-Triton system.
