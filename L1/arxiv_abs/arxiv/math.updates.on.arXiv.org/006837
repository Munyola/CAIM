In caching system, we prefer to design a coded caching scheme with the rate $R$ and the packet number
$F$ as small as possible since the efficiency of transmission in the peak traffic times increases
with the decreasing of $R$ and the realizing complexity increases with the increasing of $F$. In
this paper, we first introduce a framework for constructing coded caching schemes, which can represent
almost all of the previously known schemes. Based on this framework, we obtain a new scheme, which
generalizes the schemes constructed by Shangguan et al. (IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory, 64, 5755-5766,
2018) and Yan et al. ( IEEE Commun. Lett., 22, 236-239, 2018) and has better performance compared
with these two schemes since it has advantages on the user number, the coded gains and the flexible
memory size. Then the relationships between a coded caching scheme and orthogonal array, covering
array are derived respectively. Consequently a tight lower bound on the packet number $F$ is derived
since the packet number of the schemes constructed by Yan et al. (IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory 63, 5821-5833,
2017) gets this lower bound. Finally based on orthogonal array, we construct a new scheme which has
the same user number, memory size and transmission rate as the scheme constructed by Shangguan et
al. (IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory, 64, 5755-5766, 2018) but has smaller packet number. Based on MDS codes,
more classes of schemes are obtained using our framework, in which the distribution of the coded
gain is equivalent to solving a linear system of equations.
