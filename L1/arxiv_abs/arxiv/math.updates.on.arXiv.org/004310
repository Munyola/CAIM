Following Losik, for a codimension one foliation $\mathcal{F}$ on a smooth manifold $M$, two characteristic
classes as elements of the cohomology $H^3(S(M/\mathcal{F})/\text{O}(1))$ and $H^2(S(M/\mathcal{F})/\text{GL}(1,\mathbb{R}))$,
where $S(M/\mathcal{F})$ is the bundle of frames of infinite order over the leaf space $M/\mathcal{F}$,
are considered; these classes are called here the Godbillon-Vey-Losik and the first Chern-Losik
classes. The Godbillon-Vey-Losik class with values in $H^3(S(M/\mathcal{F})/(\text{O}(1)\times\mathbb{Z}))$
is defined. The Duminy-Losik class generalizing the Vey class is defined. It is shown that the triviality
of that class is equivalent to the existence of a transverse affine connection. Another class related
to the existence of the transverse projective connection is discovered. Sufficient conditions
for non-triviality of the Godbillon-Vey-Losik class with values in $H^3(S(M/\mathcal{F})/(\text{O}(1)\times\mathbb{Z}))$
and of the first Chern-Losik class in terms of the dynamical properties of generators of the holonomy
groups are fond. It is shown that these classes are non-trivial for the Reeb foliation on the three-dimensional
sphere, i.e., the classical Mizutani-Morita-Tsuboi Theorem about triviality of the Godbillon-Vey
class of foliations almost without holonomy is not true for these classes. It is shown that the considered
classes are trivial for a large class of foliations without holonomy. The question of triviality
is related to ergodic theory of dynamical systems on the circle and to the problem of smooth conjugacy
of local diffeomorphisms.
