We consider a discrete-continuum model of a biomembrane with embedded particles. While the membrane
is represented by a continuous surface, embedded particles are described by rigid discrete objects
which are free to move and rotate in lateral direction. For the membrane we consider a linearized
Canham-Helfrich energy functional and height and slope boundary conditions imposed on the particle
boundaries resulting in a coupled minimization problem for the membrane shape and particle positions.
When considering the energetically optimal membrane shape for each particle position we obtain
a reduced energy functional that models the implicitly given interaction potential for the membrane-mediated
mechanical particle-particle interactions. We show that this interaction potential is differentiable
with respect to the particle positions and orientations. Furthermore we derive a fully practical
representation of the derivative only in terms of well defined derivatives of the membrane. This
opens the door for the application of minimization algorithms for the computation of minimizers
of the coupled system and for further investigation of the interaction potential of membrane-mediated
mechanical particle-particle interaction. The results are illustrated with numerical examples
comparing the explicit derivative formula with difference quotient approximations. We furthermore
demonstrate the application of the derived formula to implement a gradient flow for the approximation
of optimal particle configurations.
