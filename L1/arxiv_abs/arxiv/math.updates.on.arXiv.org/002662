Massive MIMO is widely considered as a key enabler of the next generation 5G networks. With a large
number of antennas at the Base Station, both spectral and energy efficiencies can be enhanced. Unfortunately,
the downlink channel estimation overhead scales linearly with the number of antennas. This burden
is easily mitigated in TDD systems by the use of the channel reciprocity property. However, this
is unfeasible for FDD systems and the method of two-stage beamforming was therefore developed to
reduce the amount of channel state information (CSI) feedback. The performance of this scheme being
highly dependent on the users grouping and groups scheduling mechanims, we introduce in this paper
a new similarity measure coupled with a novel clustering procedure to achieve the appropriate users
grouping. A study of the possible precoders design is presented which leads to an interesting conclusion
that in realistic scenarios, inter-group interference is better to be dealt with solely on the MAC
layer. We also proceed to formulate the optimal groups scheduling policy in JSDM and prove that it
is NP-hard. This result is of paramount importance since it suggests that, unless P=NP, there are
no polynomial time algorithms that solve the general scheduling problem to global optimality and
the use of sub-optimal scheduling strategies is more realistic in practice. We therefore use graph
theory to develop a sub-optimal groups scheduling scheme that runs in polynomial time and outperforms
the scheduling schemes previously introduced in the literature for JSDM in both sum-rate and throughput
fairness.
