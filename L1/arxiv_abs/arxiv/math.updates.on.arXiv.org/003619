This paper presents theoretical advances in the application of the Stochastic Partial Differential
Equation (SPDE) approach in geostatistics. We show a general approach to construct stationary
models related to a wide class of SPDEs, with applications to spatio-temporal models having non-trivial
properties. Within the framework of Generalized Random Fields, a criterion for existence and uniqueness
of stationary solutions for a wide class of linear SPDEs is proposed and proven. Their covariance
are then obtained through their associated spectral measure. We also present a result that relates
the covariance in the case of a White Noise source term with that of a generic case through convolution.
Using these results, we obtain a variety of SPDE-based stationary random fields. In particular,
well-known results regarding the Mat\'ern Model and models with Markovian behavior are recovered.
A new relationship between the Stein model and a particular SPDE is obtained. New spatio-temporal
models obtained from evolution SPDEs of arbitrary temporal derivative order are then obtained,
for which properties of separability and symmetry can easily be controlled. Models with a fractional
evolution in time are introduced and described, and we thereby obtain a large class of spatio-temporal
models which separate regularity over space and time without separability or symmetry conditions.
We also obtain results concerning stationary solutions for physically inspired models, such as
solutions for the heat equation, the advection-diffusion equation, some Langevin's equations
and the wave equation.
