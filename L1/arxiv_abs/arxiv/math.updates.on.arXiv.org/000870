The stochastic block model (SBM) with two communities, or equivalently the planted partition model,
is a popular model of random graph exhibiting a cluster behaviour. In its simplest form, the graph
has two equally sized clusters and vertices connect with probability $p$ within clusters and $q$
across clusters. In the past two decades, a large body of literature in statistics and computer science
has focused on the exact recovery of the communities, providing lower-bounds on the order of $|p-q|$
to ensure recovery. More recently, a fascinating phase transition phenomena was conjectured by
Decelle et al. and proved by Massoulie and Mossel et al. concerning a weaker notion of reconstruction:
recovering slightly more than 50% of the vertices (i.e., beating a random guess) is possible if and
only if $(a-b)^2 > 2(a+b)$, where $a=pn$ and $b=pn$ are constant. While this surges interest
on the detection property, it also raises the natural question of determining whether exact recovery
also admits a sharp threshold phenomenon. This paper investigates this question and shows that
if $pn/\log(n)=\alpha$ and $qn/\log(n)=\beta$ are constant (and $\alpha>\beta$), exact
recovery of the communities is impossible (maximum likelihood fails w.h.p.) if $(\alpha - \beta)^2
< 4(\alpha + \beta) - 4$ and is possible if $(\alpha - \beta)^2 > 4(\alpha + \beta) + \frac43(\alpha
- \beta)$. In addition, an efficient algorithm based on semidefinite programming is proposed and
shown to succeed in recovering the communities when $(\alpha - \beta)^2 > 8(\alpha + \beta)+
\frac83 (\alpha - \beta)$.
