The paper is devoted to the shape optimization of microstructures generating porous locally periodic
materials saturated by viscous fluids. At the macroscopic level, the porous material is described
by the Biot model defined in terms of the effective medium coefficients, involving the drained skeleton
elasticity, the Biot stress coupling, the Biot compressibility coefficients, and by the hydraulic
permeability of the Darcy flow model. By virtue of the homogenization, these coefficients are computed
using characteristic responses of the representative unit cell consisting of an elastic solid
skeleton and a viscous pore fluid. For the purpose of optimization, the sensitivity analysis on
the continuous level of the problem is derived. We provide sensitivities of objective functions
constituted by the Biot model coefficients with respect to the underlying pore shape described
by a B-spline box which embeds the whole representative cell. We consider material design problems
in the framework of which the layout of a single representative cell is optimized. Then we propose
a sequential linearization approach to the two-scale problem in which local microstructures are
optimized with respect to macroscopic design criteria. Numerical experiments are reported which
include stiffness maximization with constraints allowing for a sufficient permeability, and
vice versa. Issues of the design anisotropy, the spline box parametrization are discussed. In order
to avoid remeshing a geometric regularization technique based on injectivity constraints is applied.
