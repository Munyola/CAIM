This paper develops a Cambrian extension of the work of C. Ceballos, A. Padrol and C. Sarmiento on
$\nu$-Tamari lattices and their tropical realizations. For any signature $\varepsilon \in \{\pm\}^n$,
we consider a family of $\varepsilon$-trees in bijection with the triangulations of the $\varepsilon$-polygon.
These $\varepsilon$-trees define a flag regular triangulation $\mathcal{T}^\varepsilon$ of
the subpolytope $\operatorname{conv} \{(\mathbf{e}_{i_\bullet}, \mathbf{e}_{j_\circ})
\, | \, 0 \le i_\bullet < j_\circ \le n+1 \}$ of the product of simplices $\triangle_{\{0_\bullet,
\dots, n_\bullet\}} \times \triangle_{\{1_\circ, \dots, (n+1)_\circ\}}$. The oriented dual
graph of the triangulation $\mathcal{T}^\varepsilon$ is the Hasse diagram of the (type $A$) $\varepsilon$-Cambrian
lattice of N. Reading. For any $I_\bullet \subseteq \{0_\bullet, \dots, n_\bullet\}$ and $J_\circ
\subseteq \{1_\circ, \dots, (n+1)_\circ\}$, we consider the restriction $\mathcal{T}^\varepsilon_{I_\bullet,
J_\circ}$ of the triangulation $\mathcal{T}^\varepsilon$ to the face $\triangle_{I_\bullet}
\times \triangle_{J_\circ}$. Its dual graph is naturally interpreted as the increasing flip graph
on certain $(\varepsilon, I_\bullet, J_\circ)$-trees, which is shown to be a lattice generalizing
in particular the $\nu$-Tamari lattices in the Cambrian setting. Finally, we present an alternative
geometric realization of $\mathcal{T}^\varepsilon_{I_\bullet, J_\circ}$ as a polyhedral complex
induced by a tropical hyperplane arrangement.
