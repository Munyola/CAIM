We study the ubiquitous super-resolution problem, in which one aims at localizing positive point
sources in an image, blurred by the point spread function of the imaging device. To recover the point
sources, we propose to solve a convex feasibility program, which simply finds a nonnegative Borel
measure that agrees with the observations collected by the imaging device. In the absence of imaging
noise, we show that solving this convex program uniquely retrieves the point sources, provided
that the imaging device collects enough observations. This result holds true if the point spread
function of the imaging device can be decomposed into horizontal and vertical components, and if
the translations of these components form a Chebyshev system, namely, a system of continuous functions
that loosely behave like algebraic polynomials. Building upon recent results for one-dimensional
signals [1], we prove that this super-resolution algorithm is stable (in the generalized Wasserstein
metric) to model mismatch (namely, when the image is not sparse) and to additive imaging noise. In
particular, the recovery error depends on the noise level and how well the image can be approximated
with well-separated point sources. As an example, we verify these claims for the important case
of a Gaussian point spread function. The proofs rely on the construction of novel interpolating
polynomials, which are the main technical contribution of this paper, and partially resolve the
question raised in [2] about the extension of the standard machinery to higher dimensions.
