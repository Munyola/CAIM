In this work, we pursue the investigation and the development of Stein's method in the infinitely
divisible setting and its relation with functional analysis. Section $2$ starts with standard
notations and definitions together with a multidimensional characterization theorem for infinitely
divisible distributions with finite first moment. Based on this result and on a truncation procedure,
Section $3$ develops characterization results for multivariate self-decomposable laws without
finite first moment highlighting the role of the L\'evy-Khintchine representation of the characteristic
function of the target self-decomposable distribution. In particular, these results apply to
multivariate stable laws with stability parameter belonging to $(0,1]$. In Section $4$, Stein's
equation for self-decomposable distributions without finite first moment is set down and solved
thanks to a combination of semigroup technics and Fourier analysis. Finally, in the last section
of this note, we take a new look at Poincar\'e-type inequalities for self-decomposable laws with
finite first moment. A proof based on semigroup and on Fourier analysis is presented. Several algebraic
quantities from Markov diffusion operators theory are computed in this non-local setting and in
particular for the rotationally invariant $\alpha$-stable laws with $\alpha \in (1,2)$. Finally,
rigidity and stability results for the Poincar\'e $U$-functional of the rotationally invariant
$\alpha$-stable distribution are obtained thanks to spectral analysis and Dirichlet form theory.
