With growing popularity, LoRa networks are pivotally enabling Long Range connectivity to low-cost
and power-constrained user equipments (UEs). Due to its wide coverage area, a critical issue is
to effectively allocate wireless resources to support potentially massive UEs in the cell while
resolving the prominent near-far fairness problem for cell-edge UEs, which is challenging to address
due to the lack of tractable analytical model for the LoRa network and its practical requirement
for low-complexity and low-overhead design. To achieve massive connectivity with fairness, we
investigate the problem of maximizing the minimum throughput of all UEs in the LoRa network, by jointly
designing high-level policies of spreading factor (SF) allocation, power control, and duty cycle
adjustment based only on average channel statistics and spatial UE distribution. By leveraging
on the Poisson rain model along with tailored modifications to our considered LoRa network, we are
able to account for channel fading, aggregate interference and accurate packet overlapping, and
still obtain a tractable and yet accurate closed-form formula for the packet success probability
and hence throughput. We further propose an iterative balancing (IB) method to allocate the SFs
in the cell such that the overall max-min throughput can be achieved within the considered time period
and cell area. Numerical results show that the proposed scheme with optimized design greatly alleviates
the near-far fairness issue, and significantly improves the cell-edge throughput.
