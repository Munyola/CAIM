For four wide classes of topological rings $\mathfrak R$, we show that all flat left $\mathfrak R$-contramodules
have projective covers if and only if all flat left $\mathfrak R$-contramodules are projective
if and only if all left $\mathfrak R$-contramodules have projective covers if and only if all the
discrete quotient rings of $\mathfrak R$ are left perfect. The key technique on which the proofs
are based is the contramodule Nakayama lemma for topologically T-nilpotent ideals. In the second
half of the paper, we present applications of these results to tilting theory, pure module theory,
and the Enochs conjecture. In the categorical $n$-tilting-cotilting correspondence situation,
if $\mathsf A$ is a Grothendieck abelian category and the related abelian category $\mathsf B$ is
equivalent to the category of contramodules over a topological ring $\mathfrak R$ belonging to
one of our four classes, then the left tilting class is covering in $\mathsf A$ if and only if it is closed
under direct limits in $\mathsf A$, and if and only if the topological ring $\mathfrak R$ is pro-perfect.
We also prove that all the discrete quotient rings of the topological ring of endomorphisms of a $\Sigma$-pure-split
module are perfect, and discuss the relations of covers with direct limit closedness properties
of the class $\mathsf{Add}(M)$ for a $\Sigma$-rigid or self-pure-projective module/object $M$.
The example of the tilting object related to an injective ring epimorphism of projective dimension
$1$ is considered at the end.
