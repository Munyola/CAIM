The pair-matching problem appears in many applications where one wants to discover good matches
between pairs of individuals. Formally, the set of individuals is represented by the nodes of a graph
where the edges, unobserved at first, represent the good matches. The algorithm queries pairs of
nodes and observes the presence/absence of edges. Its goal is to discover as many edges as possible
with a fixed budget of queries. Pair-matching is a particular instance of multi-armed bandit problem
in which the arms are pairs of individuals and the rewards are edges linking these pairs. This bandit
problem is non-standard though, as each arm can only be played once. Given this last constraint,
sublinear regret can be expected only if the graph presents some underlying structure. This paper
shows that sublinear regret is achievable in the case where the graph is generated according to a
Stochastic Block Model (SBM) with two communities. Optimal regret bounds are computed for this
pair-matching problem. They exhibit a phase transition related to the Kesten-Stigund threshold
for community detection in SBM. To avoid undesirable features of optimal solutions, the pair-matching
problem is also considered in the case where each node is constrained to be sampled less than a given
amount of times. We show how this constraint deteriorates optimal regret rates. The paper is concluded
by a conjecture regarding the optimal regret when the number of communities is larger than $2$. Contrary
to the two communities case, we believe that a statistical-computational gap would appear in this
problem.
