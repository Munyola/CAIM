We study properties of potentials on quivers $Q_{\mathcal{T},m}$ arising from cluster coordinates
on moduli spaces of $PGL_{m+1}$-local systems on a topological surface with punctures. To every
quiver with potential one can associate a $3d$ Calabi-Yau $A_\infty$-category in such a way that
a natural notion of equivalence for quivers with potentials (called "right-equivalence") translates
to $A_\infty$-equivalence of associated categories. For any quiver one can define a notion of a
"primitive" potential. Our first result is the description of the space of equivalence classes
of primitive potentials on quivers $Q_{\mathcal{T}, m}$. Then we provide a full description of
the space of equivalence classes of all \emph{generic} potentials for the case $m = 2$ (corresponds
to $PGL_3$-local systems). In particular, we show that it is finite-dimensional. This claim extends
results of Gei\ss, Labardini-Fragoso and Schr\"oer who have proved analogous statement in $m=1$
case. In many cases $3d$ Calabi-Yau $A_\infty$-categories constructed from quivers with potentials
are expected to be realized geometrically as Fukaya categories of certain Calabi-Yau $3$-folds.
Bridgeland and Smith gave an explicit construction of Fukaya categories for quivers $Q_{\mathcal{T},m=1}$.
We propose a candidate for Calabi-Yau $3$-folds that would play analogous role in higher rank cases,
$m > 1$. We study their (co)homology and describe a construction of collections of $3$-dimensional
spheres that should play a role of generating collections of Lagrangian spheres in corresponding
Fukaya categories.
