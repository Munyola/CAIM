For any smooth spatially-periodic solution of the Benjamin-Ono equation, the work of Nazarov-Sklyanin
determines a dispersive action profile, a piecewise-linear function of an auxiliary real variable
whose values are all conserved by the flow. In this paper, we derive three results for dispersive
action profiles (finite gap conditions, convex action profiles in the small dispersion limit,
and frozen regions) and relate each to the dispersive dynamics (the Satsuma-Ishimori multi-phase
solutions, the dispersionless characteristics, and the bound on dispersive shock wave speeds
predicted by Whitham modulation theory, respectively). Our results establish a correspondence
between the constructions of Nazarov-Sklyanin and Dobrokhotov-Krichever and are evidence for
existence of an infinite gap integration theory for large periodic initial data (a periodic version
of the Fokas-Ablowitz inverse scattering transform). We prove our results in spectral theory after
extending a result of Kerov for spectral shift functions of Jacobi operators, defining dispersive
action profiles by the spectral shift function of the Lax operator in periodic Hardy space with respect
to its principal minor, and rewriting Szeg\H{o}'s First Theorem for Toeplitz operators (dispersionless
Lax operators) through spectral shift functions. To illustrate our results, we characterize the
dispersive action profile of sinusoidal initial data by a functional difference equation and its
small dispersion limit as the convex profile of Vershik-Kerov-Logan-Shepp, both of which have
appeared in Nekrasov-Shatashvili theory.
