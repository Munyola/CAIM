It is well understood that dynamic instability is among the primary drivers of forecast uncertainty
in chaotic, physical systems. Data assimilation techniques have been designed to exploit this
phenomena, reducing the effective dimension of the data assimilation problem to the directions
of rapidly growing errors. Recent mathematical work has, moreover, provided formal proofs of the
central hypothesis of the Assimilation in the Unstable Subspace methodology of Anna Trevisan and
her collaborators: for filters and smoothers in perfect, linear, Gaussian models, the distribution
of forecast errors asymptotically conforms to the unstable-neutral subspace. Specifically,
the column span of the forecast and posterior error covariances asymptotically align with the span
of backward Lyapunov vectors with non-negative exponents. Earlier mathematical studies have
focused on perfect models, and this current work now explores the relationship between dynamical
instability, the precision of observations and the evolution of forecast error in linear models
with additive model error. We prove bounds for the asymptotic uncertainty, explicitly relating
the rate of dynamical expansion, model precision and observational accuracy. Formalizing this
relationship, we provide a novel, necessary criterion for the boundedness of forecast errors.
Furthermore, we numerically explore the relationship between observational design, dynamical
instability and filter boundedness. Additionally, we include a detailed introduction to the Multiplicative
Ergodic Theorem and to the theory and construction of Lyapunov vectors.
