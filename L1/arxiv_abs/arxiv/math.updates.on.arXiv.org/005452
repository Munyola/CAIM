We establish the a-priori convergence rate for finite element approximations of a class of nonlocal
nonlinear fracture models. We consider state based peridynamic models where the force at a material
point is due to both the strain between two points and the change in volume inside the domain of nonlocal
interaction. The pairwise interactions between points are mediated by a bond potential of multi-well
type while multi point interactions are associated with volume change mediated by a hydrostatic
strain potential. The hydrostatic potential can either be a quadratic function, delivering a linear
force-strain relation, or a multi-well type that can be associated with material degradation and
cavitation. We first show the well-posedness of the peridynamic formulation and that peridynamic
evolutions exist in the Sobolev space $H^2$. We show that the finite element approximations converge
to the $H^2$ solutions uniformly as measured in the mean square norm. For linear continuous finite
elements the convergence rate is shown to be $C_t \Delta t + C_s h^2/\epsilon^2$, where $\epsilon$
is the size of horizon, $h$ is the mesh size, and $\Delta t$ is the size of time step. The constants $C_t$
and $C_s$ are independent of $\Delta t$ and $h$ and may depend on $\epsilon$ through the norm of the
exact solution. We demonstrate the stability of the semi-discrete approximation. The stability
of the fully discrete approximation is shown for the linearized peridynamic force. We present numerical
simulations with dynamic crack propagation that support the theoretical convergence rate.
