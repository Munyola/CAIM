We study the Newton polytopes of determinants of square matrices defined over rings of twisted Laurent
polynomials. We prove that such Newton polytopes are single polytopes (rather than formal differences
of two polytopes); this result can be seen as analogous to the fact that determinants of matrices
over commutative Laurent polynomial rings are themselves polynomials, rather than rational functions.
We also exhibit a relationship between the Newton polytopes and invertibility of the matrices over
Novikov rings, thus establishing a connection with the invariants of Bieri-Neumann-Strebel (BNS)
via a theorem of Sikorav. We offer several applications: we reprove Thurston's theorem on the existence
of a polytope controlling the BNS invariants of a $3$-manifold group; we extend this result to free-by-cyclic
groups, and the more general descending HNN extensions of free groups. We also show that the BNS invariants
of Poincar\'e duality groups of type $\mathtt{F}$ in dimension $3$ and groups of deficiency one
are determined by a polytope, when the groups are assumed to be agrarian, that is their integral group
rings embed in skew-fields. The latter result partially confirms a conjecture of Friedl. We also
deduce the vanishing of the Newton polytopes associated to elements of the Whitehead groups of many
groups satisfying the Atiyah conjecture. We use this to show that the $L^2$-torsion polytope of
Friedl-L\"uck is invariant under homotopy. We prove the vanishing of this polytope in the presence
of amenability, thus proving a conjecture of Friedl-L\"uck-Tillmann.
