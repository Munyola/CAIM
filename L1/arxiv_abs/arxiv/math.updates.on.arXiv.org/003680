Lindel{\"o}f's hypothesis, one of the most important open problems in the history of mathematics,
states that for large $t$, Riemann's zeta function $\zeta(\frac{1}{2}+it)$ is of order $O(t^{\varepsilon})$
for any $\varepsilon>0$. It is well known that for large $t$, the leading order asymptotics of the
Riemann zeta function can be expressed in terms of a transcendental exponential sum. The usual approach
to the Lindel\"of hypothesis involves the use of ingenious techniques for the estimation of this
sum. However, since such estimates can not yield an asymptotic formula for the above sum, it appears
that this approach cannot lead to the proof of the Lindel\"of hypothesis. Here, a completely different
approach is introduced: the Riemann zeta function is embedded in a classical problem in the theory
of complex analysis known as a Riemann-Hilbert problem, and then, the large $t$-asymptotics of
the associated integral equation is formally computed. This yields two different results. First,
the formal proof that a certain Riemann zeta-type double exponential sum satisfies the asymptotic
estimate of the Lindel\"of hypothesis. Second, it is formally shown that the sum of $|\zeta(1/2+it)|^2$
and of a certain sum which depends on $\epsilon$, satisfies for large $t$ the estimate of the Lindel\"of
hypothesis. Hence, since the above identity is valid for all $\epsilon$, this asymptotic identity
suggests the validity of Lindel\"of's hypothesis. The completion of the rigorous derivation of
the above results will be presented in a companion paper.
