The widespread use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) by the military, commercial companies, and
academia continues to push research for autonomous vehicle navigation, particularly in varying
environmental conditions and beyond-line-of-sight (BLOS) applications. This article addresses
trajectory generation for UAVs operating in extreme environments where the wind disturbances
may exceed the vehicle's closed-loop stability bounds. To do this, a controller is developed that
has two modes of operation: (1) normal mode, and (2) drift mode. In the normal mode the vehicle's thrust
and sensor limitations are not exceeded by environmental conditions, whereas in the drift mode
they are. In the drift mode, a drift frame that moves with the prevailing wind is established in which
the vehicle maintains control authority to generate and track trajectories. The vehicle maintains
control authority by relaxing the inertial frame trajectory tracking requirement and re-planning
the trajectory in the drift frame. Guarantees are established to ensure tracking of the trajectory,
collision avoidance, and respecting the vehicle thrust and sensor limitations. Simulation results
demonstrate the algorithm properties through two scenarios. First, the performance of two quadrotors
is compared where one utilizes the drift mode and the other does not. Second, multiple vehicles navigate
through two narrow openings between protected and windy environments to demonstrate on-board
updates to navigation parameters based on environmental conditions.
