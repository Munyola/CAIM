The paper considers the transmission problems for Helmholtz equation with bodies that have negative
material parameters. Such material parameters are used to model metals on optical frequencies
and so-called metamaterials. As the absorption of the materials in the model tends to zero the fields
may blow up. When the speed of the blow up is suitable, this is called the Anomalous Localized Reconance
(ALR). In this paper we study this phenomenon and formulate a new condition, the weak Anomalous Localized
Reconance (w-ALR), where the speed of the blow up of fields may be slower. Using this concept, we can
study the blow up of fields in the presence of negative material parameters without the commonly
used quasi-static approximation. We give simple geometric conditions under which w-ALR or ALR
may, or may not appear. In particular, we show that in a case of a curved layer of negative material
with a strictly convex boundary neither ALR nor w-ALR appears with non-zero frequencies (i.e. in
the dynamic range) in dimensions $d\ge 3$. In the case when the boundary of the negative material
contains a flat subset we show that the w-ALR always happens with some point sources in dimensions
$d\ge 2$. These results, together with the earlier results of Milton et al. ( [22, 23]) and Ammari
et al. ([2]) show that for strictly convex bodies ALR may appear only for bodies so small that the quasi-static
approximation is realistic. This gives limits for size of the objects for which invisibility cloaking
methods based on ALR may be used.
