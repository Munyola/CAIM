We establish small energy H\"{o}lder bounds for minimizers $u_\varepsilon$ of \[E_\varepsilon
(u):=\int_\Omega W(\nabla u)+ \frac{1}{\varepsilon^2} \int_\Omega f(u),\] where $W$ is a positive
definite quadratic form and the potential $f$ constrains $u$ to be close to a given manifold $\mathcal
N$. This implies that, up to subsequence, $u_\varepsilon$ converges locally uniformly to an $\mathcal
N$-valued $W$-harmonic map, away from its singular set. We treat general energies, covering in
particular the 3D Landau-de Gennes model for liquid crystals, with three distinct elastic constants.
Similar results are known in the isotropic case $W(\nabla u)=\vert \nabla u\vert^2$ and rely on
three ingredients: a monotonicity formula for the scale-invariant energy on small balls, a uniform
pointwise bound, and a Bochner equation for the energy density. In the level of generality we consider,
all of these ingredients are absent. In particular, the lack of monotonicity formula is an important
reason why optimal estimates on the singular set of $W$-harmonic maps constitute an open problem.
Our novel argument relies on showing appropriate decay for the energy on small balls, separately
at scales smaller and larger than $\varepsilon$: the former is obtained from the regularity of solutions
to elliptic systems while the latter is inherited from the regularity of $W$-harmonic maps. This
also allows us to handle physically relevant boundary conditions for which, even in the isotropic
case, uniform convergence up to the boundary was open.
