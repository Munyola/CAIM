Sun \cite{MR1245524} proved that a set $W\subseteq\kappa$ is $\Pi^1_1$-indescribable (or equivalently
weakly compact) if and only if $W\cap C\neq\emptyset$ for every $1$-club $C\subseteq \kappa$;
here, a set $C\subseteq\kappa$ is \emph{$1$-club} if and only if $C\in\text{NS}_\kappa^+$ and
whenever $\alpha<\kappa$ is inaccessible and $C\cap \alpha\in\text{NS}_\alpha^+$ then $\alpha\in
C$. We generalize Sun's characterization to $\Pi^1_1$-indescribable subsets of $P_\kappa\lambda$,
which were first defined by Baumgartner by using a natural two-cardinal version of the cumulative
hierarchy. Using the minimal \emph{strongly} normal ideal on $P_\kappa\lambda$, which is distinct
from $\text{NS}_{\kappa,\lambda}$ when $\kappa$ is inaccessible, we formulate a notion of $1$-club
subset of $P_\kappa\lambda$ and prove that a set $W\subseteq P_\kappa\lambda$ is $\Pi^1_1$-indescribable
if and only if $W\cap C\neq\emptyset$ for every $1$-club $C\subseteq P_\kappa\lambda$. We also
prove that elementary embeddings considered by Schanker \cite{MR2989393} witnessing \emph{near
supercompactness} lead to the definition of a normal ideal on $P_\kappa\lambda$, and indeed, this
ideal is equal to Baumgartner's ideal of non--$\Pi^1_1$-indescribable subsets of $P_\kappa\lambda$.
We also prove several results involving a two-cardinal weakly compact diamond principle, answer
a question of Cox-L\"ucke \cite{MR3620068} and prove several partial results involving shooting
$1$-clubs through weakly compact subsets of $P_\kappa\lambda$.
