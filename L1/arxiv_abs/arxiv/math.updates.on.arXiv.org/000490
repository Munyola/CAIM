The false discovery proportion (FDP) is a convenient way to account for false positives in an high
dimensional setting where a large number of tests are performed simultaneously. The Benjamini-Hochberg
procedure is now widely used and is known to control the expectation of the FDP, called the false discovery
rate (FDR). However, when the individual tests are correlated, controlling the FDR can be unsuitable
to ensure that the actually achieved FDP is close (or below) the targeted level. This rises the question
of controlling the quantiles of the distribution of the FDP, which is a challenging question that
has received a growing attention in the recent literature. This paper elaborates upon the general
principle let down by Romano and Wolf (2007) (RW) that builds FDP controlling procedures from $k$-family-wise
error rate ($k$-FWE) controlling procedures, while incorporating known dependencies in an appropriate
manner. This method is revisited as follows: first, choose a device to upper-bound the $k$-FWE,
for all $k$. Second, build the corresponding critical values, possibly adaptively to the number
$m_0$ of true null hypotheses. Third, use these critical values into a step-wise procedure (either
step-down or step-up). The goal of the paper is to study the obtained FDP when using this methodology.
Our first result provides sample finite bounds, while our second result is asymptotic in the number
$m$ of hypotheses. Overall, this paper can be seen as a validation of RW's paradigm for controlling
the FDP under dependence.
