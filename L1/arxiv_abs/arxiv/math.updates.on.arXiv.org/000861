A series of old and recent theoretical observations suggests that the quantization of gravity would
be feasible, and some problems of Quantum Field Theory would go away if, somehow, the spacetime would
undergo a dimensional reduction at high energy scales. But an identification of the deep mechanism
causing this dimensional reduction would still be desirable. The main contribution of this article
is to show that dimensional reduction effects are due to General Relativity at singularities, and
do not need to be postulated ad-hoc. Recent advances in understanding the geometry of singularities
do not require modification of General Relativity, being just non-singular extensions of its mathematics
to the limit cases. They turn out to work fine for some known types of cosmological singularities
(black holes and FLRW Big-Bang), allowing a choice of the fundamental geometric invariants and
physical quantities which remain regular. The resulting equations are equivalent to the standard
ones outside the singularities. One consequence of this mathematical approach to the singularities
in General Relativity is a special, (geo)metric type of dimensional reduction: at singularities,
the metric tensor becomes degenerate in certain spacetime directions, and some properties of the
fields become independent of those directions. Effectively, it is like one or more dimensions of
spacetime just vanish at singularities. This suggests that it is worth exploring the possibility
that the geometry of singularities leads naturally to the spontaneous dimensional reduction needed
by Quantum Gravity.
