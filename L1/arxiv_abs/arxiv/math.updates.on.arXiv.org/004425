In this paper, we present a distributionally robust optimization (DRO) approach for the transmission
expansion planning (TEP) problem, considering both long- and short-term uncertainties on the
system load and renewable generation. Long-term uncertainty is represented on two interrelated
levels. At the first level, as is customary in industry applications, the deep uncertainty faced
in economic, political, environmental, and technological development is addressed based on plausible
visions of long-term future scenarios (trends), traced by current experts beliefs. Subsequently,
uncertainty-related parameters defining the probability distributions of the uncertain factors
are partially refined for each long-term scenario, thereby inducing an ambiguity set. Finally,
for each long-term scenario and induced ambiguity set, the inherent risk model for the short-term
uncertainty is described by means of conditional probability distributions. The mathematical
problem is formulated as a distributionally robust optimization model with numerous long-term
scenarios. The resulting infinite-dimension problem is recast as an exact, although very large,
finite-deterministic mixed-integer linear programming problem. To circumvent scalability
issues, a new column-and-constraint decomposition approach is proposed with an additional Dantzig--Wolfe
step for solving the reformulated problem with tighter bounds. Two numerical experiments based
on the benchmark IEEE 118-bus system are reported to corroborate the effectiveness of the method.
