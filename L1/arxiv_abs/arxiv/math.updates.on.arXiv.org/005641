There is a substantial literature concerning Liouville quantum gravity (LQG) with coupling constant
$\gamma \in (0,2]$. In this setting, the central charge of the corresponding matter field satisfies
$\mathbf c = 25 - 6(2/\gamma+\gamma/2)^2 \in (-\infty,1]$. Physics considerations suggest that
LQG also makes sense for $\mathbf c > 1$, but the behavior in this regime is rather mysterious in part
because the corresponding value of $\gamma$ is complex, so analytic continuations of various formulas
give non-physical complex answers. We introduce and study a discretization of LQG which makes sense
for all $\mathbf c \in (-\infty,25)$. Our discretization consists of a random planar map, defined
as the adjacency graph of a tiling of the plane by dyadic squares which all have approximately the
same "LQG size" with respect to a Gaussian free field. We prove that several formulas for dimension-related
quantities are still valid for $\mathbf c \in (1,25)$, with the caveat that the dimension is infinite
when the formulas give a complex answer. In particular, we prove an extension of the KPZ formula for
$\mathbf c \in (1,25)$, which gives a finite quantum dimension if and only if the Euclidean dimension
is at most $(25-\mathbf c)/12$. We also show that the graph distance between typical points with
respect to our discrete model grows polynomially whereas the cardinality of a graph distance ball
of radius $r$ grows faster than any power of $r$ (which suggests that the Hausdorff dimension of LQG
for $\mathbf c\in(1,25)$ is infinite). We include a substantial list of open problems.
