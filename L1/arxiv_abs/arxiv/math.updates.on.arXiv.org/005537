This paper introduces a novel hybrid optimisation algorithm that combines elements of both metaheuristic
search and integer programming. This new matheuristic combines elements of Benders decomposition
and the Bees Algorithm, to create the Bee-Benders Hybrid Algorithm (BBHA) which retains many of
the advantages both of the methods. Specifically it is designed to be easily parallelizable, to
produce good solutions quickly while still retaining a guarantee of optimality when run for a sufficiently
long time. The algorithm is tested using a transmission network expansion and energy storage planning
model, a challenging and very large scale mixed integer linear programming problem. Transmission
network planning problems are already difficult on their own. When including the planning for storage
systems in the network, the variation of demand over time has to be taken into account significantly
increasing the size and difficulty of the optimization problem. The BBHA is shown to be highly effective
hybrid matheuristic algorithm that performs at least as well as either Benders decomposition or
the Bees Algorithm where these are effective on their own, and significantly improves upon the individual
approaches where neither component part has a pronounced advantage. While the paper demonstrates
the effectiveness in terms of the concrete electricity network planning problem, the algorithm
could be readily applied to any mixed integer linear program, and is expected to work particularly
well whenever this has a structure that is amenable to Benders decomposition.
