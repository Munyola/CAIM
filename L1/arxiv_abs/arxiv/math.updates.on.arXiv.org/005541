Mimetic methods discretize divergence by restricting the Gauss theorem to mesh cells. Because
point clouds lack such geometric entities, construction of a compatible meshfree divergence remains
a challenge. In this work, we define an abstract Meshfree Mimetic Divergence (MMD) operator on point
clouds by contraction of field and virtual face moments. This MMD satisfies a discrete divergence
theorem, provides a discrete local conservation principle, and is first-order accurate. We consider
two MMD instantiations. The first one assumes a background mesh and uses generalized moving least
squares (GMLS) to obtain the necessary field and face moments. This MMD instance is appropriate
for settings where a mesh is available but its quality is insufficient for a robust and accurate mesh-based
discretization. The second MMD operator retains the GMLS field moments but defines virtual face
moments using computationally efficient weighted graph-Laplacian equations. This MMD instance
does not require a background grid and is appropriate for applications where mesh generation creates
a computational bottleneck. It allows one to trade an expensive mesh generation problem for a scalable
algebraic one, without sacrificing compatibility with the divergence operator. We demonstrate
the approach by using the MMD operator to obtain a virtual finite-volume discretization of conservation
laws on point clouds. Numerical results in the paper confirm the mimetic properties of the method
and show that it behaves similarly to standard finite volume methods.
