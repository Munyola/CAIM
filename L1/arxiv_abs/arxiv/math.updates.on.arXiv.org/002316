The group of diffeomorphisms of a compact manifold endowed with the L^2 metric acting on the space
of probability densities gives a unifying framework for the incompressible Euler equation and
the theory of optimal mass transport. Recently, several authors have extended optimal transport
to the space of positive Radon measures where the Wasserstein-Fisher-Rao distance is a natural
extension of the classical L^2-Wasserstein distance. In this paper, we show a similar relation
between this unbalanced optimal transport problem and the Hdiv right-invariant metric on the group
of diffeomorphisms, which corresponds to the Camassa-Holm (CH) equation in one dimension. On the
optimal transport side, we prove a polar factorization theorem on the automorphism group of half-densities.Geometrically,
our point of view provides an isometric embedding of the group of diffeomorphisms endowed with this
right-invariant metric in the automorphisms group of the fiber bundle of half densities endowed
with an L^2 type of cone metric. This leads to a new formulation of the (generalized) CH equation as
a geodesic equation on an isotropy subgroup of this automorphisms group; On S1, solutions to the
standard CH thus give particular solutions of the incompressible Euler equation on a group of homeomorphisms
of R^2 which preserve a radial density that has a singularity at 0. An other application consists
in proving that smooth solutions of the Euler-Arnold equation for the Hdiv right-invariant metric
are length minimizing geodesics for sufficiently short times.
