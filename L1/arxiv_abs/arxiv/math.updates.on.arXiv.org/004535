We give a three-fold upgrade to the rearrangement lemma (pioneer by Connes-Tretkoff-Moscovici)
base on the functional analytic ground laid by Lesch. First, we show that the building blocks of the
spectral functions appeared in the lemma belong to a class of multivariable hypergeometric functions
called Lauricella functions of type $D$, which includes Gauss hypergeometric functions and Appell's
$F_1$ functions as one and two variable subclass respectively. Second, we extend previous results
from dimension two to arbitrary dimensions by absorbing the dimension into the parameters of those
hypergeometric functions. Third, the highlight of this paper is a reduction formula for the multivariable
functions to the Gauss hypergeometric functions using iterated divided differences and differentiations.
As for applications, we take perturbed Laplacian operator (the degree zero part that acts on functions)
in Connes-Moscovici's paper as an example and extend the computation of the associated modular
curvature (functional density of the second heat coefficient) two noncommutative tori of arbitrary
dimension. The two spectral functions are computed first as linear combinations of Gauss and Appell's
hypergeometric functions and then as explicit functions in the dimension parameter. It allows
us to perform symbolic verification (in a CAS (computer algebra system)) for the celebrated Connes-Moscovici
functional relations. A surprising discovery is that functional relations holds as a continuous
family with respect to the dimension parameter.
