We generalize Roe's index theorem for graded generalized Dirac operators on amenable manifolds
to multigraded elliptic uniform pseudodifferential operators. This generalization will follow
as a corollary from a local index theorem that is valid on any manifold of bounded geometry. This local
formula incorporates the uniform estimates that are present in the definition of our class of pseudodifferential
operators which is more general than similar classes defined by other authors. We will revisit Spakula's
uniform K-homology and show that multigraded elliptic uniform pseudodifferential operators
naturally define classes in it. For this we will investigate uniform K-homology more closely, e.g.,
construct the external product and show invariance under weak homotopies. The latter will be used
to refine and extend Spakula's results about the rough Baum-Connes assembly map. We will identify
the dual theory of uniform K-homology. We will give a simple definition of uniform K-theory for all
metric spaces and in the case of manifolds of bounded geometry we will give an interpretation of it
via vector bundles of bounded geometry. Using a version of Mayer-Vietoris induction that is adapted
to our needs, we will prove Poincare duality between uniform K-theory and uniform K-homology for
spin-c manifolds of bounded geometry. We will construct Chern characters from uniform K-theory
to bounded de Rham cohomology and from uniform K-homology to uniform de Rham homology. Using the
adapted Mayer-Vietoris induction we will also show that these Chern characters induce isomorphisms
modulo torsion.
