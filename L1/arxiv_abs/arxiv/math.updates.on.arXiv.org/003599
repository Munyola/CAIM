This paper presents a non-intrusive subdomain POD-TPWL (SD POD-TPWL) algorithm for reservoir
data assimilation through integrating domain decomposition (DD), radial basis function (RBF)
interpolation and the trajectory piecewise linearization (TPWL). It is an efficient approach
for model reduction and linearization of general non-linear time-dependent dynamical systems
without intruding the legacy source code. In the subdomain POD-TPWL algorithm, firstly, a sequence
of snapshots over the entire computational domain are saved and then partitioned into subdomains.
From the local sequence of snapshots over each subdomain, a number of local basis vectors is formed
using POD, and then the RBF interpolation is used to estimate the derivative matrices for each subdomain.
Finally, those derivative matrices are substituted into a POD-TPWL algorithm to form a reduced-order
linear model in each subdomain. This reduced-order linear model makes the implementation of the
adjoint easy and resulting in an efficient adjoint-based parameter estimation procedure. The
performance of the new adjoint-based parameter estimation algorithm has been assessed through
several synthetic cases. Comparisons with the classic finite-difference based history matching
show that our proposed subdomain POD-TPWL approach is obtaining comparable results. The number
of full-order model simulations required is roughly 2-3 times the number of uncertain parameters.
Using different background parameter realizations, our approach efficiently generates an ensemble
of calibrated models without additional full-order model simulations.
