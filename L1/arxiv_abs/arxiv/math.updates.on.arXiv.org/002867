In this paper we show how the cross-disciplinary transfer of techniques from Dynamical Systems
Theory to Number Theory can be a fruitful avenue for research. We illustrate this idea by exploring
from a nonlinear and symbolic dynamics viewpoint certain patterns emerging in some residue sequences
generated from the prime number sequence. We show that the sequence formed by the residues of the
primes modulo $k$ are maximally chaotic and, while lacking forbidden patterns, display a non-trivial
spectrum of Renyi entropies which suggest that every block of size $m>1$, while admissible, occurs
with different probability. This non-uniform distribution of blocks for $m>1$ contrasts Dirichlet's
theorem that guarantees equiprobability for $m=1$. We then explore in a similar fashion the sequence
of prime gap residues. This sequence is again chaotic (positivity of Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy),
however chaos is weaker as we find forbidden patterns for every block of size $m>1$. We relate the
onset of these forbidden patterns with the divisibility properties of integers, and estimate the
densities of gap block residues via Hardy-Littlewood $k$-tuple conjecture. We use this estimation
to argue that the amount of admissible blocks is non-uniformly distributed, what supports the fact
that the spectrum of Renyi entropies is again non-trivial in this case. We complete our analysis
by applying the Chaos Game to these symbolic sequences, and comparing the IFS attractors found for
the experimental sequences with appropriate null models.
