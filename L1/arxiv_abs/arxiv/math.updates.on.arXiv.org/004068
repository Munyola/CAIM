The nonlinear dynamics of a system can be analyzed using a square matrix. If off resonance, the lead
vector of a Jordan chain in a left eigenspace of the square matrix is an accurate action- angle variable
for sufficiently high power order. The deviation from constancy of the action-angle variable provides
a measure of the stability of a trajectory. However, near resonance or the stability boundary, the
fluctuation increases rapidly and the lead vector no longer represents an accurate action-angle
variable. In this paper we show that near resonance or stability boundary, it is possible to find
a set of linear combinations of the vectors in the degenerate Jordan chains as the action-angle variables
by an iteration procedure so that the fluctuation is minimized. Using the Henon-Heiles problem
as an example on resonance, we show that when compared with conventional canonical perturbation
theory, the iteration leads to result in much more close agreement with the forward integration,
and the iteration is convergent even very close to the stability boundary. It is further shown that
the action-angle variables found in the iteration can be used to find another action-angle variables
even much more closer to rigid rotations (KAM invariants). The fast convergent result is not in the
form of polynomials, it is an exponential function with a rational function in the exponent more
similar to a Laurent series than a Taylor series. Hence the method provides a new way to probe the boundary
of the region where KAM tori exist.
