The main results of this paper provide a polynomial time algorithm for approximating the logarithm
of the number of maximal near perfect matchings in dense graphs. By \emph{dense} we mean that $|E(G)|\geq\alpha|V(G)|^2$
for some fixed $\alpha>0$, and a \emph{maximal $\varepsilon$-near perfect matching} is a maximal
matching which covers at least $(1-\varepsilon)|V(G)|$ vertices. More precisely, we provide
a deterministic algorithm that for a given (dense) graph $G$ of order $n$ and a real number $\varepsilon>0$,
returns either a conclusion that $G$ has no $\varepsilon$-near perfect matching, or a positive
real number $m\leq1/2$, such that the logarithm of the number of maximal $\varepsilon$-near perfect
matchings in $G$ is at least $mn\log n$. An upper bound for such graphs is $1/2(n\log n)$. The running
time of this algorithm is $O(f(\varepsilon)n^{5/2})$, where $f(\cdot)$ is an explicit function.
Additionally, for a special class of dense graphs, we provide a non-trivial (i.e. less than $1/2(n\log
n)$) upper bound on the number of maximal near perfect matchings. Our algorithm is based on analyzing
the number of maximal near perfect matchings of generalized quasirandom graphs. We start with an
algorithmic version of the Szemer\'edi Regularity Lemma, then we partition our graph into bounded
number of quasirandom subgraphs. The way we partition the graph is determined by solving a system
of linear inequalities whose size is bounded by a function depending only on $\varepsilon$. The
proof of this result is of independent interest in graph theory.
