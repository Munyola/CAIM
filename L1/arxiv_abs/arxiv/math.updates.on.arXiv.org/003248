Threshold factors govern the maximally allowable step-size at which positivity or contractivity
preservation of explicit integration methods for initial value problems is guaranteed. An optimal
threshold factor, $R_{m,n}$, is defined as the largest possible positive real number for which
there exists a real polynomial $P$ of degree $m$, absolutely monotonic over the interval $[-R_{m,n},0]$
and such that $P(x)= \exp(x) + \mathcal{O}(x^{n+1})$ when $x \rightarrow 0$. In this paper, we show
that the task of computing optimal threshold factors is, to a certain extent, equivalent to the problem
of characterizing positive quadratures with integer nodes with respect to Poisson-Charlier measures.
Using this equivalence, we provide sharp upper and lower bounds for the optimal threshold factors
in terms of the zeros of generalized Laguerre polynomials. Also based on this equivalence, we propose
a highly efficient and stable algorithm for computing these factors based on adaptive spectral
transformations of Poisson-Charlier measures. The algorithm possesses the remarkable property
that its complexity depends only on the order of approximation and thus is independent of the degree
of the underlying polynomials. Our results are achieved by adapting and extending an ingenious
technique by Bernstein in his seminal work on absolutely monotonic functions. Moreover, the techniques
introduced in this work can be adapted to solve the integer quadrature problem for any positive discrete
multi-parametric measure supported on $\mathbb{N}$ under some mild conditions on the zeros of
the associated orthogonal polynomials.
