Recovery of multispecies oral biofilms is investigated following treatment by chlorhexidine
gluconate (CHX), iodine-potassium iodide (IPI) and Sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) both experimentally
and theoretically. Experimentally, biofilms taken from two donors were exposed to the three antibacterial
solutions (irrigants) for 10 minutes, respectively. We observe that (a) live bacterial cell ratios
decline for a week after the exposure and the trend reverses beyond a week; after fifteen weeks, live
bacterial cell ratios in biofilms fully return to their pretreatment levels; (b) NaOCl is shown
as the strongest antibacterial agent for the oral biofilms; (c) multispecies oral biofilms from
different donors showed no difference in their susceptibility to all the bacterial solutions.
Guided by the experiment, a mathematical model for biofilm dynamics is developed, accounting for
multiple bacterial phenotypes, quorum sensing, and growth factor proteins, to describe the nonlinear
time evolutionary behavior of the biofilms. The model captures time evolutionary dynamics of biofilms
before and after antibacterial treatment very well. It reveals the crucial role played by quorum
sensing molecules and growth factors in biofilm recovery and verifies that the source of biofilms
has a minimal to their recovery. The model is also applied to describe the state of biofilms of various
ages treated by CHX, IPI and NaOCl, taken from different donors. Good agreement with experimental
data predicted by the model is obtained as well, confirming its applicability to modeling biofilm
dynamics in general.
