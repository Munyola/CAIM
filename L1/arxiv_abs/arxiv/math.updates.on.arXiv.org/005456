For a group of users in $V$ where everyone observes a component of a discrete multiple random source,
the process that users exchange data so as to reach omniscience, the state where everyone recovers
the entire source, is called communication for omniscience (CO). We first consider how to improve
the existing complexity $O(|V|^2 \cdot \text{SFM}(|V|)$ of minimizing the sum of communication
rates in CO, where $\text{SFM}(|V|)$ denotes the complexity of minimizing a submodular function.
We reveal some structured property in an existing coordinate saturation algorithm: the resulting
rate vector and the corresponding partition of $V$ are segmented in $\alpha$, the estimation of
the minimum sum-rate. A parametric (PAR) algorithm is then proposed where, instead of a particular
$\alpha$, we search the critical points that fully determine the segmented variables for all $\alpha$
so that they converge to the solution to the minimum sum-rate problem and the overall complexity
reduces to $O(|V| \cdot \text{SFM}(|V|))$. For the successive omniscience (SO), we consider how
to attain local omniscience in some complimentary user subset so that the overall sum-rate for the
global omniscience still remains minimum. While the existing algorithm only determines a complimentary
user subset in $O(|V| \cdot \text{SFM}(|V|))$ time, we show that, if a lower bound on the minimum
sum-rate is applied to the segmented variables in the PAR algorithm, not only a complimentary subset,
but also an optimal rate vector for attaining the local omniscience in it are returned in $O(|V| \cdot
\text{SFM}(|V|))$ time.
