Dense kernel matrices $\Theta \in \mathbb{R}^{N \times N}$ obtained from point evaluations of
a covariance function $G$ at locations $\{ x_{i} \}_{1 \leq i \leq N}$ arise in statistics, machine
learning, and numerical analysis. For covariance functions that are Green's functions of elliptic
boundary value problems and approximately equally spaced sampling points, we show how to identify
a subset $S \subset \{ 1 , \dots , N \} \times \{ 1 , \dots , N \}$, with $\# S = \mathcal{O} ( N \log (N) \log^{d}
( N /\epsilon ) )$, such that the zero fill-in incomplete Cholesky factorisation of $\Theta_{i,j}
\mathbb{1}_{( i, j ) \in S}$ is an $\epsilon$-approximation of $\Theta$. This block-factorisation
can provably be obtained in complexity $\mathcal{O} ( N \log( N ) \log^{d}( N /\epsilon) )$ in space
and $\mathcal{O} ( N \log^{2}( N ) \log^{2d}( N /\epsilon) )$ in time. The algorithm only needs to
know the spatial configuration of the $x_{i}$ and does not require an analytic representation of
$G$. Furthermore, an approximate PCA with optimal rate of convergence in the operator norm can be
easily read off from this decomposition. Hence, by using only subsampling and the incomplete Cholesky
decomposition, we obtain at nearly linear complexity the compression, inversion and approximate
PCA of a large class of covariance matrices. By inverting the order of the Cholesky decomposition
we also obtain a solver for elliptic PDE with complexity $\mathcal{O} ( N \log( N ) \log^{d}( N /\epsilon)
)$ in space and $\mathcal{O} ( N \log^{2}( N ) \log^{2d}( N /\epsilon) )$ in time.
