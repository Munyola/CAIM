We consider the quasi-static problem governing the localized surface plasmon modes and permittivity
eigenvalues $\epsilon$ of smooth, arbitrarily shaped, axisymmetric inclusions. We develop an
asymptotic theory for the dense part of the spectrum, i.e., close to the accumulation value $\epsilon=-1$
at which a flat interface supports surface plasmons; in this regime, the field oscillates rapidly
along the surface and decays exponentially away from it on a comparable scale. With $\tau=-(\epsilon+1)$
as the small parameter, we develop a surface-ray description of the eigenfunctions in a narrow boundary
layer about the interface; the fast phase variation, as well as the slowly varying amplitude and
geometric phase, along the rays are determined as functions of the local geometry. We focus on modes
varying at most moderately in the azimuthal direction, in which case the surface rays are meridian
arcs that focus at the two poles. Asymptotically matching the diverging ray solutions with expansions
valid in inner regions in the vicinities of the poles yields the quantization rule $$\frac{1}{\tau}
\sim \frac{\pi n }{\Theta}+\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{\pi}{\Theta}-1\right)+o(1),$$ where
$n\gg1$ is an integer and $\Theta$ a geometric parameter given by the product of the inclusion length
and the reciprocal average of its cross-sectional radius along its symmetry axis. For a sphere,
$\Theta=\pi$, whereby the formula returns the exact eigenvalues $\epsilon_n=-1-1/n$. We also
demonstrate good agreement with exact solutions in the case of prolate spheroids.
