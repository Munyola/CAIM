Let $S \subset \Bbb R^n$ be a smooth compact hypersurface with a strictly positive second fundamental
form, $E$ be the Fourier extension operator on $S$, and $X$ be a Lebesgue measurable subset of $\Bbb
R^n$. If $X$ contains a ball of each radius, then the problem of determining the range of exponents
$(p,q)$ for which the estimate $\| Ef \|_{L^q(X)} \leq C \| f \|_{L^p(S)}$ holds is equivalent to
the restriction conjecture. In this paper, we study the estimate under the following assumption
on the set $X$: there is a number $0 < \alpha \leq n$ such that $|X \cap B_R| \leq c \, R^\alpha$ for all
balls $B_R$ in $\Bbb R^n$ of radius $R \geq 1$. On the left-hand side of this estimate, we are integrating
the function $|Ef(x)|^q$ against the measure $\chi_X dx$. Our approach consists of replacing the
characteristic function $\chi_X$ of $X$ by an appropriate weight function $H$, and studying the
resulting estimate in three different regimes: small values of $\alpha$, intermediate values
of $\alpha$, and large values of $\alpha$. In the first regime, we establish the estimate by using
already available methods. In the second regime, we prove a weighted H\"{o}lder-type inequality
that holds for general non-negative Lebesgue measurable functions on $\Bbb R^n$, and combine it
with the result from the first regime. In the third regime, we borrow a recent fractal Fourier restriction
theorem of Du and Zhang and combine it with the result from the second regime. In the opposite direction,
the results of this paper improve on the Du-Zhang theorem in the range $0 < \alpha < n/2$.
