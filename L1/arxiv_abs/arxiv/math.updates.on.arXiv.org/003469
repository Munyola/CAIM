A cantilevered piezoelectric smart composite beam, consisting of perfectly bonded elastic, viscoelastic
and piezoelectric layers, is considered. The piezoelectric layer is actuated by a voltage source.
Both fully dynamic and electrostatic approaches, based on Maxwell's equations, are used to model
the piezoelectric layer. We obtain (i) fully-dynamic and electrostatic Rao-Nakra type models
by assuming that the viscoelastic layer has a negligible weight and stiffness, (ii) fully-dynamic
and electrostatic Mead-Marcus type models by neglecting the in-plane and rotational inertia terms.
Each model is a perturbation of the corresponding classical smart composite beam model. These models
are written in the state-space form, the existence and uniqueness of solutions are obtained in appropriate
Hilbert spaces. Next, the stabilization problem for each closed-loop system, with a thorough analysis,
is investigated for the natural $B^*-$type state feedback controllers. The fully dynamic Rao-Nakra
model with four state feedback controllers is shown to be not asymptotically stable for certain
choices of material parameters whereas the electrostatic model is exponentially stable with only
three state feedback controllers (by the spectral multipliers method). Similarly, the fully dynamic
Mead-Marcus model lacks of asymptotic stability for certain solutions whereas the electrostatic
model is exponentially stable by only one state feedback controller.stable by one feedback controller
applied to the bending moment only.
