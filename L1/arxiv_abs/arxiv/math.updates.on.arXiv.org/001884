We study Lagrange spectra at cusps of finite area Riemann surfaces. These spectra are penetration
spectra that describe the asymptotic depths of penetration of geodesics in the cusps. Their study
is in particular motivated by Diophantine approximation on Fuchsian groups. In the classical case
of the modular surface and classical Diophantine approximation, Hall proved in 1947 that the classical
Lagrange spectrum contains a half-line, known as a Hall ray. We generalize this result to the context
of Riemann surfaces with cusps and Diophantine approximation on Fuchsian groups. One can measure
excursion into a cusp both with respect to a natural height function or, more generally, with respect
to any proper function. We prove the existence of a Hall ray for the Lagrange spectrum of any non co-compact,
finite covolume Fuchsian group with respect to any given cusp, both when the penetration is measured
by a height function induced by the imaginary part as well as by any proper function close to it with
respect to the Lipschitz norm. This shows that Hall rays are stable under (Lipschitz) perturbations.
As a main tool, we use the boundary expansion developed by Bowen and Series to code geodesics and produce
a geometric continued fraction-like expansion and mimic the key ideas in Hall's original argument.
A key element in the proof of the results for proper functions is a generalization of Hall's theorem
on the sum of Cantor sets, where we consider functions which are small perturbations in the Lipschitz
norm of the sum.
