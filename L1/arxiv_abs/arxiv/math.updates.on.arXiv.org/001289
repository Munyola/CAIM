In this paper we proceed to study properties of Mellin-Barnes (MB) transforms of Usyukina-Davydychev
(UD) functions. In our previous papers [Nuclear Physics B 870 (2013) 243], [Nuclear Physics B 876
(2013) 322] we showed that multi-fold Mellin-Barnes (MB) transforms of Usyukina-Davydychev (UD)
functions may be reduced to two-fold MB transforms and that the higher-order UD functions were obtained
in terms of a differential operator by applying it to a slightly modified first UD function. The result
is valid in $d=4$ dimensions and its analog in $d=4-2\varepsilon$ dimensions exits too [Theoretical
and Mathematical Physics 177 (2013) 1515]. In [Nuclear Physics B 870 (2013) 243] the chain of recurrent
relations for analytically regularized UD functions was obtained implicitly by comparing the
left hand side and the right hand side of the diagrammatic relations between the diagrams with different
loop orders. In turn, these diagrammatic relations were obtained due to the method of loop reduction
for the triangle ladder diagrams proposed in 1983 by Belokurov and Usyukina. Here we reproduce these
recurrent relations by calculating explicitly via Barnes lemmas the contour integrals produced
by the left hand sides of the diagrammatic relations. In such a way we explicitly calculate a family
of multi-fold contour integrals of certain ratios of Euler gamma functions. We make a conjecture
that similar results for the contour integrals are valid for a wider family of smooth functions which
includes the MB transforms of UD functions.
