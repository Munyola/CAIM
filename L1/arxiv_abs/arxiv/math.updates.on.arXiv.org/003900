We address a natural question in noncommutative geometry, namely the rigidity observed in many
examples, whereby noncommutative spaces (or equivalently their coordinate algebras) have very
few automorphisms by comparison with their commutative counterparts. In the framework of noncommutative
projective geometry, we define a groupoid whose objects are noncommutative projective spaces
of a given dimension and whose morphisms correspond to isomorphisms of these. This groupoid is then
a natural generalization of an automorphism group. Using work of Zhang, we may translate this structure
to the algebraic side, wherein we consider homogeneous coordinate algebras of noncommutative
projective spaces. The morphisms in our groupoid precisely correspond to the existence of a Zhang
twist relating the two coordinate algebras. We analyse this automorphism groupoid, showing that
in dimension 1 it is connected, so that every noncommutative $\mathbb{P}^{1}$ is isomorphic to
commutative $\mathbb{P}^{1}$. For dimension 2 and above, we use the geometry of the point scheme,
as introduced by Artin-Tate-Van den Bergh, to relate morphisms in our groupoid to certain automorphisms
of the point scheme. We apply our results to two important examples, quantum projective spaces and
Sklyanin algebras. In both cases, we are able to use the geometry of the point schemes to fully describe
the corresponding component of the automorphism groupoid. This provides a concrete description
of the collection of Zhang twists of these algebras.
