This work presents a multiscale model reduction approach to discontinuous fields identification
problems in the framework of Bayesian inference. An ensemble-based variable separation (VS) method
is proposed to approximate multiscale basis functions used to build a coarse model. The variable-separation
expression is constructed for stochastic multiscale basis functions based on the random field,
which is treated Gauss process as prior information. To this end, multiple local inhomogeneous
Dirichlet boundary condition problems are required to be solved, and the ensemble-based method
is used to obtain variable separation forms for the corresponding local functions. The local functions
share the same interpolate rule for different physical basis functions in each coarse block. This
approach significantly improves the efficiency of computation. We obtain the variable separation
expression of multiscale basis functions, which can be used to the models with different boundary
conditions and source terms, once the expression constructed. The proposed method is applied to
discontinuous field identification problems where the hybrid of total variation and Gaussian
(TG) densities are imposed as the penalty. We give a convergence analysis of the approximate posterior
to the reference one with respect to the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence under the hybrid prior.
The proposed method is applied to identify discontinuous structures in permeability fields. Two
patterns of discontinuous structures are considered in numerical examples: separated blocks
and nested blocks.
