In many problems from multivariate analysis, including principal component analysis, canonical
correlation analysis, and the problem of testing for sphericity, the parameter of interest is a
shape matrix, that is, a normalized version of the corresponding scatter or dispersion matrix.
In this paper, we propose a depth concept for shape matrices. The concept is of a sign nature in the
sense that it involves data points only through their directions from the center of the distribution.
We use the terminology "Tyler shape depth" since the resulting estimator of shape, namely the deepest
shape matrix, is the median-based counterpart of the celebrated M-estimator of shape from Tyler
(1987a). Beyond estimation, shape depth, like its Tyler antecedent, also allows to conduct hypothesis
testing on shape. The main benefit of shape depth, however, lies in the resulting ranking of shape
matrices it provides, whose practical relevance is illustrated in two applications: the first
one in robust principal component analysis and the second one in shape-based outlier detection.
To fully grasp the proposed concept, we study the invariance, quasi-concavity and continuity properties
of Tyler shape depth, as well as the topological and boundedness properties of the corresponding
depth regions. We also study existence of a deepest shape matrix and prove Fisher consistency in
the elliptical case. Finally, we derive a Glivenko-Cantelli-type result and establish the almost
sure consistency of the deepest shape matrix estimator.
