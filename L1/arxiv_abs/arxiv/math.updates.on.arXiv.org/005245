A novel generalized coordinated multi-point transmission (GCoMP)-enabled non-orthogonal multiple
access (NOMA) scheme is proposed. In particular, the traditional joint transmission CoMP scheme
is generalized to be applied for all user-equipments (UEs), i.e. both cell-centre and cell-edge
users within the coverage area of cellular base stations (BSs). Furthermore, every BS applies NOMA
for all UEs associated to it using the same frequency sub-band (i.e. all UEs associated to a BS forms
a single NOMA cluster). To evaluate the proposed scheme, we derive a closed-form expression for
the probability of outage for a UE with different orders of BS cooperation. Important insights on
the proposed system are extracted by deriving an approximate (asymptotic) expressions for the
probability of outage and outage capacity. Furthermore, an optimal transmission power allocation
scheme that jointly allocates transmission power fractions from all cooperating BSs to all connected
UEs is developed and investigated for the proposed system. Findings show that NOMA with a large number
of UEs is feasible when the GCoMP technique is used over all UEs within the network coverage area.
Also, the performance degradation caused by a large NOMA cluster size is significantly mitigated
by increasing the number of cooperating BSs. In addition, for given feasible system parameters
and a given NOMA cluster, the lower the available power budget, the higher is the number of BSs that
apply NOMA for their cluster members and the lower the number of BSs that use water-filling for power
allocation.
