The present work is concerned with community detection. Specifically, we consider a random graph
drawn according to the stochastic block model~: its vertex set is partitioned into blocks, or communities,
and edges are placed randomly and independently of each other with probability depending only on
the communities of their two endpoints. In this context, our aim is to recover the community labels
better than by random guess, based only on the observation of the graph. In the sparse case, where
edge probabilities are in $O(1/n)$, we introduce a new spectral method based on the distance matrix
$D^{(l)}$, where $D^{(l)}_{ij} = 1$ iff the graph distance between $i$ and $j$, noted $d(i, j)$ is
equal to $\ell$. We show that when $\ell \sim c\log(n)$ for carefully chosen $c$, the eigenvectors
associated to the largest eigenvalues of $D^{(l)}$ provide enough information to perform non-trivial
community recovery with high probability, provided we are above the so-called Kesten-Stigum threshold.
This yields an efficient algorithm for community detection, since computation of the matrix $D^{(l)}$
can be done in $O(n^{1+\kappa})$ operations for a small constant $\kappa$. We then study the sensitivity
of the eigendecomposition of $D^{(l)}$ when we allow an adversarial perturbation of the edges of
$G$. We show that when the considered perturbation does not affect more than $O(n^\varepsilon)$
vertices for some small $\varepsilon > 0$, the highest eigenvalues and their corresponding eigenvectors
incur negligible perturbations, which allows us to still perform efficient recovery.
