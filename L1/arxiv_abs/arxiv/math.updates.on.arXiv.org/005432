We consider the probabilistic group testing problem where $d$ random defective items in a large
population of $N$ items are identified with high probability by applying binary tests. It is known
that $\Theta(d \log N)$ tests are necessary and sufficient to recover the defective set with vanishing
probability of error when $d = O(N^{\alpha})$ for some $\alpha \in (0, 1)$. However, to the best of
our knowledge, there is no explicit (deterministic) construction achieving $\Theta(d \log N)$
tests in general. In this work, we show that a famous construction introduced by Kautz and Singleton
for the combinatorial group testing problem (which is known to be suboptimal for combinatorial
group testing for moderate values of $d$) achieves the order optimal $\Theta(d \log N)$ tests in
the probabilistic group testing problem when $d = \Omega(\log^2 N)$. This provides a strongly explicit
construction achieving the order optimal result in the probabilistic group testing setting for
a wide range of values of $d$. To prove the order-optimality of Kautz and Singleton's construction
in the probabilistic setting, we provide a novel analysis of the probability of a non-defective
item being covered by a random defective set directly, rather than arguing from combinatorial properties
of the underlying code, which has been the main approach in the literature. Furthermore, we use a
recursive technique to convert this construction into one that can also be efficiently decoded
with only a log-log factor increase in the number of tests.
