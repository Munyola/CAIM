In this paper, we study the security of a compressed sensing (CS) based cryptosystem called a sparse
one-time sensing (S-OTS) cryptosystem, which encrypts each plaintext with a sparse measurement
matrix. To generate the secret matrix and renew it at each encryption, a bipolar keystream and a random
permutation pattern are employed as cryptographic primitives, which are obtained by a keystream
generator of stream ciphers. With a small number of nonzero elements in the measurement matrix,
the S-OTS cryptosystem achieves an efficient CS encryption process in terms of data storage and
computational cost. For security analysis, we show that the S-OTS cryptosystem can be computationally
secure against ciphertext only attacks (COA) in terms of the indistinguishability, as long as each
plaintext has constant energy. Also, we consider a chosen plaintext attack (CPA) against the S-OTS
cryptosystem, which consists of two stages of keystream and key recovery attacks. Then, we show
that it can achieve the security against the CPA of keystream recovery with overwhelmingly high
probability, as an adversary needs to distinguish a prohibitively large number of candidate keystreams.
Finally, we conduct an information-theoretic analysis to demonstrate that the S-OTS cryptosystem
has sufficient resistance against the CPA of key recovery by guaranteeing the extremely low probability
of success. In conclusion, the S-OTS cryptosystem can be indistinguishable and secure against
a CPA, while providing efficiency in CS encryption.
