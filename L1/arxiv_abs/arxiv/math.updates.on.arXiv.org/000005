We investigate the random dynamics of polynomial maps on the Riemann sphere and the dynamics of semigroups
of polynomial maps on the Riemann sphere. In particular, the dynamics of a semigroup $G$ of polynomials
whose planar postcritical set is bounded and the associated random dynamics are studied. In general,
the Julia set of such a $G$ may be disconnected. We show that if $G$ is such a semigroup, then regarding
the associated random dynamics, the chaos of the averaged system disappears in the $C^{0}$ sense,
and the function $T_{\infty}$ of probability of tending to $\infty$ is continuous on the Riemann
sphere and varies only on the Julia set of $G$. Moreover, the function $T_{\infty}$ has a kind of monotonicity.
It turns out that $T_{\infty}$ is a complex analogue of the devil's staircase, and we call $T_{\infty}$
a "devil's coliseum." We investigate the details of $T_{\infty}$ when $G$ is generated by two polynomials.
In this case, $T_{\infty}$ varies precisely on the Julia set of $G$, which is a thin fractal set. Moreover,
under this condition, we investigate the pointwise H\"{o}lder exponents of $T_{\infty}$ by using
some geometric observations, ergodic theory, potential theory and function theory. In particular,
we show that for almost every point $z$ in the Julia set of $G$ with respect to an invariant measure,
$T_{\infty}$ is not differentiable at $z.$ We find many new phenomena of random complex dynamics
which cannot hold in the usual iteration dynamics of a single polynomial, and we systematically
investigate them.
