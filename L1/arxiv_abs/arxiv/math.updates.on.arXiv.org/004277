The Cholesky QR algorithm is an efficient communication-minimizing algorithm for computing the
QR factorization of a tall-skinny matrix. Unfortunately it has the inherent numerical instability
and breakdown when the matrix is ill-conditioned. A recent work establishes that the instability
can be cured by repeating the algorithm twice (called CholeskyQR2). However, the applicability
of CholeskyQR2 is still limited by the requirement that the Cholesky factorization of the Gram matrix
runs to completion, which means it does not always work for matrices $X$ with $\kappa_2(X)\gtrsim
{{\bf u}}^{-\frac{1}{2}}$ where ${{\bf u}}$ is the unit roundoff. In this work we extend the applicability
to $\kappa_2(X)=\mathcal{O}({\bf u}^{-1})$ by introducing a shift to the computed Gram matrix
so as to guarantee the Cholesky factorization $R^TR= A^TA+sI$ succeeds numerically. We show that
the computed $AR^{-1}$ has reduced condition number $\leq {{\bf u}}^{-\frac{1}{2}}$, for which
CholeskyQR2 safely computes the QR factorization, yielding a computed $Q$ of orthogonality $\|Q^TQ-I\|_2$
and residual $\|A-QR\|_F/\|A\|_F$ both $\mathcal{O}({{\bf u}})$. Thus we obtain the required
QR factorization by essentially running Cholesky QR thrice. We extensively analyze the resulting
algorithm shiftedCholeskyQR to reveal its excellent numerical stability. shiftedCholeskyQR
is also highly parallelizable, and applicable and effective also when working in an oblique inner
product space. We illustrate our findings through experiments, in which we achieve significant
(up to x40) speedup over alternative methods.
