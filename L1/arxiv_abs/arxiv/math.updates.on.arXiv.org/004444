In this work, we present a unified gas-kinetic particle (UGKP) method for the simulation of multiscale
photon transport. The multiscale nature of the particle method mainly comes from the recovery of
the time evolution flux function in the unified gas-kinetic scheme (UGKS) through a coupled dynamic
process of particle transport and collision. This practice improves the original operator splitting
approach in the Monte Carlo method, such as the separated treatment of particle transport and collision.
As a result, with the variation of the ratio between numerical time step and local photon's collision
time, different transport physics can be fully captured in a single computation. In the diffusive
limit, the UGKP method could recover the solution of the diffusion equation with the cell size and
time step being much larger than the photon's mean free path and the mean collision time. In the free
transport limit, it presents an exact particle tracking process as the original Monte Carlo method.
In the transition regime, the weights of particle free transport and collision are determined by
the ratio of local numerical time step to the photon's collision time. Several one-dimensional
numerical examples covering all transport regimes from the optically thin to optically thick are
computed to validate the accuracy and efficiency of the current scheme. In comparison with the $S_N$
discrete ordinate method, the UGKP method is based on particles and avoids the discretization of
particle velocity space, which does not suffer from the ray effect.
