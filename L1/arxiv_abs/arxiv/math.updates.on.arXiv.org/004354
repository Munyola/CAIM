Successive quadratic approximations, or second-order proximal methods, are useful for minimizing
functions that are a sum of a smooth part and a convex, possibly nonsmooth part that promotes regularization.
Most analyses of iteration complexity focus on the special case of proximal gradient method, or
accelerated variants thereof. There have been only a few studies of methods that use a second-order
approximation to the smooth part, due in part to the difficulty of obtaining closed-form solutions
to the subproblems at each iteration. In fact, iterative algorithms may need to be used to find inexact
solutions to these subproblems. In this work, we present global analysis of the iteration complexity
of inexact successive quadratic approximation methods, showing that an inexact solution of the
subproblem that is within a fixed multiplicative precision of optimality suffices to guarantee
the same order of convergence rate as the exact version, with complexity related in an intuitive
way to the measure of inexactness. Our result allows flexible choices of the second-order term,
including Newton and quasi-Newton choices, and does not necessarily require increasing precision
of the subproblem solution on later iterations. For problems exhibiting a property related to strong
convexity, the algorithms converge at global linear rates. For general convex problems, the convergence
rate is linear in early stages, while the overall rate is $O(1/k)$. For nonconvex problems, a first-order
optimality criterion converges to zero at a rate of $O(1/\sqrt{k})$.
