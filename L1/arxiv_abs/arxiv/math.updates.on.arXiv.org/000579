We investigate some of the discrete Painleve equations (dPII, qPI and qPII) and the discrete KdV
equation over finite fields. The first part concerns the discrete Painleve equations. We review
some of the ideas introduced in our previous papers and give some detailed discussions. We first
show that they are well defined by extending the domain according to the theory of the space of initial
conditions. We then extend them to the field of p-adic numbers and observe that they have a property
that is called an `almost good reduction' of dynamical systems over finite fields. We can use this
property, which can be interpreted as an arithmetic analogue of singularity confinement, to avoid
the indeterminacy of the equations over finite fields and to obtain special solutions from those
defined originally over fields of characteristic zero. In the second part we study the discrete
KdV equation. We review the previous discussions and present a way to resolve the indeterminacy
of the equation by treating it over a field of rational functions instead of the finite field itself.
Explicit forms of soliton solutions and their periods over finite fields are obtained. Note: This
is a review article on the recent developments in the theory of discrete integrable equations over
finite fields based on arXiv:1201.5429 , arXiv:1206.4456 , arXiv:1209.0223 . This article is published
as the proceedings of the domestic conference "The breadth and depth of nonlinear discrete integrable
systems" in RIMS, Kyoto University, Japan, on August 2012.
