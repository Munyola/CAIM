Precise soft landings on asteroids are central to many deep space missions for surface exploration
and resource exploitation. To improve the autonomy and intelligence of landing control, a real-time
optimal control approach is proposed using deep neural networks (DNN) for asteroid landing problems
wherein the developed DNN-based landing controller is capable of steering the lander to a preselected
landing site with high robustness to initial conditions. First, to significantly reduce the time
consumption of gravity calculation, DNNs are used to approximate the irregular gravitational
field of the asteroid based on the samples from a polyhedral method. Then, an approximate indirect
method is presented to solve the time-optimal landing problems with high computational efficiency
by taking advantage of the designed gravity approximation method and a homotopy technique. Furthermore,
five DNNs are developed to learn the functional relationship between the state and optimal actions
obtained by the approximate indirect method, and the resulting DNNs can generate the optimal control
instructions in real time because there is no longer need to solve the optimal landing problems onboard.
Finally, a DNN-based landing controller composed of these five DNNs is devised to achieve the real-time
optimal control for asteroid landings. Simulation results of the time-optimal landing for Eros
are given to substantiate the effectiveness of these techniques and illustrate the real-time performance,
control optimality, and robustness of the developed DNN-based optimal landing controller.
