We introduce and study the convex cone of linear transfers between probability distributions and
the dual class of Kantorovich operators between function spaces. The class of linear transfers
naturally extend the cone of convex lower semi-continuous energies on Wasserstein space, and contains
all cost minimizing mass transports, but also many other correlations between probability measures
to which Monge-Kantorovich theory does not readily apply. Examples include balayage of measures,
martingale transports, optimal Skorokhod embeddings, and the weak mass transports of Talagrand,
Marton, Gozlan and others. The class also includes various stochastic mass transports such as the
Schr\"odinger bridge associated to a reversible Markov process. We associate to most linear transfers,
a critical constant, a corresponding effective linear transfer and fixed points for their dual
Kantorovich operator that extend Man\'e's critical value, Aubry-Mather invariant tori, and Fathi's
weak KAM solutions for Hamiltonian systems. This amounts to studying the asymptotic properties
of the nonlinear Kantorovich operators as opposed to classical ergodic theory, which deals with
linear Markov operators. This allows for the extension of Mather theory to other settings such as
its stochastic counterpart. We also introduce the class of convex transfers, which include any
$p$-power ($ p \geq 1$) of a linear transfer, but also the logarithmic entropy, optimal mean field
plans, the Donsker-Varadhan information, and certain free energy functionals. Duality formulae
for general transfer inequalities follow in a very natural way.
