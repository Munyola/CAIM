A major challenge in the study of dynamical systems is that of model discovery: turning data into
models that are not just predictive, but provide insight into the nature of the underlying dynamical
system that generated the data. This problem is made more difficult by the fact that many systems
of interest exhibit diverse behaviors across multiple time scales. We introduce a number of data-driven
strategies for discovering nonlinear multiscale dynamical systems and their embeddings from
data. We consider two canonical cases: (i) systems for which we have full measurements of the governing
variables, and (ii) systems for which we have incomplete measurements. For systems with full state
measurements, we show that the recent sparse identification of nonlinear dynamical systems (SINDy)
method can discover governing equations with relatively little data and introduce a sampling method
that allows SINDy to scale efficiently to problems with multiple time scales. Specifically, we
can discover distinct governing equations at slow and fast scales. For systems with incomplete
observations, we show that the Hankel alternative view of Koopman (HAVOK) method, based on time-delay
embedding coordinates, can be used to obtain a linear model and Koopman invariant measurement system
that nearly perfectly captures the dynamics of nonlinear quasiperiodic systems. We introduce
two strategies for using HAVOK on systems with multiple time scales. Together, our approaches provide
a suite of mathematical strategies for reducing the data required to discover and model nonlinear
multiscale systems.
