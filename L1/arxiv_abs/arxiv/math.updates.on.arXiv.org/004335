Let $G$ be a (multi)graph of order $n$ and let $u,v$ be vertices of $G$. The maximum number of internally
disjoint $u$-$v$ paths in $G$ is denoted by $\kappa_G(u,v)$, and the maximum number of edge-disjoint
$u$-$v$ paths in $G$ is denoted by $\lambda_G (u,v)$. The average connectivity of $G$ is defined
by $\overline{\kappa}(G)=\sum_{\{u,v\}\subseteq V(G)} \kappa_G(u,v)/\tbinom{n}{2},$ and
the average edge-connectivity of $G$ is defined by $\overline{\lambda}(G)=\sum_{\{u,v\}\subseteq
V(G)} \lambda_G(u,v)/\tbinom{n}{2}$. A graph is called ideally connected if $\kappa(u,v)=\min\{\mbox{deg}(u),\mbox{deg}(v)\}$
for all pairs of vertices $\{u,v\}$. We prove that every minimally $2$-connected graph of order
$n$ with largest average connectivity is bipartite, with the set of vertices of degree $2$ and the
set of vertices of degree at least $3$ being the partite sets. We use this structure to prove that $\overline{\kappa}(G)<\tfrac{9}{4}$
for any minimally $2$-connected graph $G$ (this bound is asymptotically tight), and we give an exact
bound and characterize the extremal graphs of every sufficiently large order. The characterization
depends on the value of $n(\mbox{mod}~4)$. For example, every minimally $2$-connected graph of
order $n=4k$ for $k\geq 8$ having maximum average connectivity is obtained from some ideally connected
$6$-regular graph on $n$ vertices by subdividing every edge. We also prove that $ \overline{\lambda}(G)<\tfrac{9}{4}$
for any minimally $2$-edge-connected graph $G$, and provide a similar characterization of the
extremal graphs of every sufficiently large order.
