Consider the generalized flag manifold $G/B$ and the corresponding affine flag manifold $\mathrm{Fl}_G$.
In this paper we use curve neighborhoods for Schubert varieties in $\mathrm{Fl}_G$ to construct
certain affine Gromov-Witten invariants of $\mathrm{Fl}_G$, and to obtain a family of affine quantum
Chevalley operators $\Lambda_0,\ldots , \Lambda_n$ indexed by the simple roots in the affine root
system of $G$. These operators act on the cohomology ring $H^*(\mathrm{Fl}_G)$ with coefficients
in $\mathbb{Z}[q_0, \ldots,q_n]$. By analyzing commutativity and invariance properties of these
operators we deduce the existence of two quantum cohomology rings, which satisfy properties conjectured
earlier by Guest and Otofuji for $G= \mathrm{SL}_n(\mathbb{C})$. The first quantum ring is a deformation
of the subalgebra of $H^*(\mathrm{Fl}_G)$ generated by divisors. The second ring, denoted $QH^*_{\mathrm{aff}}(G/B)$,
deforms the ordinary quantum cohomology ring $QH^*(G/B)$ by adding an affine quantum parameter
$q_0$. We prove that $QH^*_{\mathrm{aff}}(G/B)$ is a Frobenius algebra, and that the new quantum
product determines a flat Dubrovin connection. We further develop an analogue of Givental and Kim
formalism for this ring and we deduce a presentation of $QH^*_{\mathrm{aff}}(G/B)$ by generators
and relations. For $G$ of Lie types $A_n - D_n$ or $E_6$, we prove that the ideal of relations is generated
by the integrals of motion for the periodic Toda lattice associated to the dual of the extended Dynkin
diagram of $G$.
