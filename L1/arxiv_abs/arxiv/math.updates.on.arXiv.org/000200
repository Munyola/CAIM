We obtain several results about representations of rational Cherednik algebras, and discuss their
applications. Our first result is the Cohen-Macaulayness property (as modules over the polynomial
ring) of Cherednik algebra modules with minimal support. Our second result is an explicit formula
for the character of an irreducible minimal support module in type A_{n-1} for c=m/n, and an expression
of its quasispherical part (i.e., the isotypic part of "hooks") in terms of the HOMFLY polynomial
of a torus knot colored by a Young diagram. We use this formula and the work of Calaque, Enriquez and
Etingof to give explicit formulas for the characters of the irreducible equivariant D-modules
on the nilpotent cone for SL_m. Our third result is the construction of the Koszul-BGG complex for
the rational Cherednik algebra, which generalizes the construction of the Koszul-BGG resolution
by Berest-Etingof-Ginzburg and Gordon, and the calculation of its homology in type A. We also show
in type A that the differentials in the Koszul-BGG complex are uniquely determined by the condition
that they are nonzero homomorphisms of modules over the Cherednik algebra. Finally, our fourth
result is the symmetry theorem, which identifies the quasispherical components in the representations
with minimal support over the rational Cherednik algebras H_{m/n}(S_n) and H_{n/m}(S_m). In fact,
we show that the simple quotients of the corresponding quasispherical subalgebras are isomorphic
as filtered algebras. This symmetry has a natural interpretation in terms of invariants of torus
knots.
