Exoskeletons which amplify the strength of their operators can enable heavy-duty manipulation
of unknown objects. However, this type of behavior is difficult to accomplish; it requires the exoskeleton
to sense and amplify the operator's interaction forces while remaining stable. But, the goals of
amplification and robust stability when connected to the operator fundamentally conflict. As
a solution, we introduce a design with a spring in series with the force sensitive cuff. This allows
us to design an exoskeleton compliance behavior which is nominally passive, even with high amplification
ratios. In practice, time delay and discrete time filters prevent our strategy from actually achieving
passivity, but the designed compliance still makes the exoskeleton more robust to spring-like
human behaviors. Our exoskeleton is actuated by a series elastic actuator (SEA), which introduces
another spring into the system. We show that shaping the cuff compliance for the exoskeleton can
be made into approximately the same problem as shaping the spring compliance of an SEA. We therefore
introduce a feedback controller and gain tuning method which takes advantage of an existing compliance
shaping technique for SEAs. We call our strategy the "double compliance shaping" method. With large
amplification ratios, this controller tends to amplify nonlinear transmission friction effects,
so we additionally propose a "transmission disturbance observer" to mitigate this drawback. Our
methods are validated on a single-degree-of-freedom elbow exoskeleton.
