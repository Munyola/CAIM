Applications in machine learning, optimization, and control require the sequential selection
of a few system elements, such as sensors, data, or actuators, to optimize the system performance
across multiple time steps. However, in failure-prone and adversarial environments, sensors
get attacked, data get deleted, and actuators fail. Thence, traditional sequential design paradigms
become insufficient and, in contrast, resilient sequential designs that adapt against system-wide
attacks, deletions, or failures become important. In general, resilient sequential design problems
are computationally hard. Also, even though they often involve objective functions that are monotone
and (possibly) submodular, no scalable approximation algorithms are known for their solution.
In this paper, we provide the first scalable algorithm, that achieves the following characteristics:
system-wide resiliency, i.e., the algorithm is valid for any number of denial-of-service attacks,
deletions, or failures; adaptiveness, i.e., at each time step, the algorithm selects system elements
based on the history of inflicted attacks, deletions, or failures; and provable approximation
performance, i.e., the algorithm guarantees for monotone objective functions a solution close
to the optimal. We quantify the algorithm's approximation performance using a notion of curvature
for monotone (not necessarily submodular) set functions. Finally, we support our theoretical
analyses with simulated experiments, by considering a control-aware sensor scheduling scenario,
namely, sensing-constrained robot navigation.
