We prove that a minimal $t$-fold blocking set in a finite projective plane of order $n$ has cardinality
at most \[\frac{1}{2} n\sqrt{4tn - (3t + 1)(t - 1)} + \frac{1}{2} (t - 1)n + t.\] This is the first general
upper bound on the size of minimal $t$-fold blocking sets in finite projective planes and it generalizes
the classical result of Bruen and Thas on minimal blocking sets. From the proof it directly follows
that if equality occurs in this bound then every line intersects the blocking set $S$ in either $t$
points or $\frac{1}{2}(\sqrt{4tn - (3t + 1)(t - 1)} + t - 1) + 1$ points. We use this to show that for $n$
a prime power, equality can occur in our bound in exactly one of the following three cases: (a) $t =
1$, $n$ is a square and $S$ is a unital; (b) $t = n - \sqrt{n}$, $n$ is a square and $S$ is the complement
of a Baer subplane; (c) $t = n$ and $S$ is equal to the set of all points except one. For a square prime
power $q$ and $t \leq \sqrt{q} + 1$, we give a construction of a minimal $t$-fold blocking set $S$ in
$\mathrm{PG}(2,q)$ with $|S| = q\sqrt{q} + 1 + (t - 1)(q - \sqrt{q} + 1)$. Furthermore, we obtain an
upper bound on the size of minimal blocking sets in symmetric $2$-designs and use it to give new proofs
of other known results regarding tangency sets in higher dimensional finite projective spaces.
We also discuss further generalizations of our bound. In our proofs we use an incidence bound on combinatorial
designs which follows from applying the expander mixing lemma to the incidence graph of these designs.
