We study goodness-of-fit of discrete distributions in the distributed setting, where samples
are divided between multiple users who can only release a limited amount of information about their
samples due to various information constraints. Recently, a subset of the authors showed that having
access to a common random seed (i.e., shared randomness) leads to a significant reduction in the
sample complexity of this problem. In this work, we provide a complete understanding of the interplay
between the amount of shared randomness available, the stringency of information constraints,
and the sample complexity of the testing problem by characterizing a tight trade-off between these
three parameters. We provide a general distributed goodness-of-fit protocol that as a function
of the amount of shared randomness interpolates smoothly between the private- and public-coin
sample complexities. We complement our upper bound with a general framework to prove lower bounds
on the sample complexity of this testing problems under limited shared randomness. Finally, we
instantiate our bounds for the two archetypal information constraints of communication and local
privacy, and show that our sample complexity bounds are optimal as a function of all the parameters
of the problem, including the amount of shared randomness. A key component of our upper bounds is
a new primitive of domain compression, a tool that allows us to map distributions to a much smaller
domain size while preserving their pairwise distances, using a limited amount of randomness.
