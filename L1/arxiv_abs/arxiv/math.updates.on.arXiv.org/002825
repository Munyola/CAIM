This paper considers an unsignalized intersection used by two traffic streams. A stream of cars
is using a primary road, and has priority over the other stream. Cars belonging to the latter stream
cross the primary road if the gaps between two subsequent cars on the primary road are larger than
their critical headways. A question that naturally arises relates to the capacity of the secondary
road: given the arrival pattern of cars on the primary road, what is the maximum arrival rate of low-priority
cars that can be sustained? This paper addresses this issue by considering a compact model that sheds
light on the dynamics of the considered unsignalized intersection. The model, which is of a queueing-theoretic
nature, reveals interesting insights into the impact of the user behavior on stability. The contributions
of this paper are threefold. First, we obtain new results for the aforementioned model that includes
driver impatience. Secondly, we reveal some surprising aspects that have remained unobserved
in the existing literature so far, many of which are caused by the fact that the capacity of the minor
road cannot be expressed in terms of the \emph{mean} gap size; instead more detailed characteristics
of the critical headway distribution play a crucial role. The third contribution is the introduction
of a new form of bunching on the main road, called Markov platooning. The tractability of this model
allows us to study the impact of various platoon formations on the main road on the capacity of the
minor road.
