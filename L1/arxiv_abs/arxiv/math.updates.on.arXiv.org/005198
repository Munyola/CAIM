The use of low-resolution analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) can significantly reduce power
consumption and hardware cost. However, their resulting severe nonlinear distortion makes reliable
data transmission challenging. For orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) transmission,
the orthogonality among subcarriers is destroyed. This invalidates conventional OFDM receivers
relying heavily on this orthogonality. In this study, we move on to quantized OFDM (Q-OFDM) prototyping
implementation based on our previous achievement in optimal Q-OFDM detection. First, we propose
a novel Q-OFDM channel estimator by extending the generalized Turbo (GTurbo) framework formerly
applied for optimal detection. Specifically, we integrate a type of robust linear OFDM channel
estimator into the original GTurbo framework and derive its corresponding extrinsic information
to guarantee its convergence. We also propose feasible schemes for automatic gain control, noise
power estimation, and synchronization. Combined with the proposed inference algorithms, we develop
an efficient Q-OFDM receiver architecture. Furthermore, we construct a proof-of-concept prototyping
system and conduct over-the-air (OTA) experiments to examine its feasibility and reliability.
This is the first work that focuses on both algorithm design and system implementation in the field
of low-resolution quantization communication. The results of the numerical simulation and OTA
experiment demonstrate that reliable data transmission can be achieved.
