We consider a market model where there are two levels of information. The public information generated
by the financial assets, and a larger flow of information that contains additional knowledge about
a random time. This random time can represent many economic and financial settings, such as the default
time of a firm for credit risk, and the death time of an insured for life insurance. By using the expansion
of filtration, the random time uncertainty and its entailed risk are fully considered without any
mathematical restriction. In this context with no model's specification for the random time, the
main challenge lies in finding the dynamics and the structures for the value processes of defaultable
or mortality and/or longevity securities which are vital for the insurance securitization. To
overcome this obstacle, we elaborate our optional martingale representation results, which state
that any martingale in the large filtration stopped at the random time can be decomposed into precise
and unique orthogonal local martingales (i.e. local martingales whose product remains a local
martingale). This constitutes our first and probably the principal contribution. Even though
the driving motivation for this representation resides in credit risk theory, our results are applicable
to several other financial and economics contexts, such as life insurance and financial markets
with random horizon. Thanks to this optional representation, we decompose any defaultable or mortality
and/or longevity liability into the sum of "non-correlated" risks using a risk basis. This constitutes
our second contribution.
