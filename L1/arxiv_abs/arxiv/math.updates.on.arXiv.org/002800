The $p$th degree Hilbert symbol $(\cdot,\cdot )_p:K^\times/K^{\times p}\times K^\times/K^{\times
p}\to{}_p{\rm Br}(K)$ from characteristic $\neq p$ has two analogues in characteristic $p$, $$[\cdot,\cdot
)_p:K/\wp (K)\times K^\times/K^{\times p}\to{}_p{\rm Br}(K),$$ where $\wp$ is the Artin-Schreier
map $x\mapsto x^p-x$, and $$((\cdot,\cdot ))_p:K/K^p\times K/K^p\to{}_p{\rm Br}(K).$$ The
symbol $[\cdot,\cdot )_p$ generalizes to an analogue of $(\cdot,\cdot )_{p^n}$ via the Witt vectors,
$$[\cdot,\cdot )_{p^n}:W_n(K)/\wp (W_n(K))\times K^\times/K^{\times p^n}\to{}_{p^n}{\rm
Br}(K).$$ Here $W_n(K)$ is the truncation of length $n$ of the ring of $p$-typical Witt wectors,
i.e. $W_{\{1,p,\ldots,p^{n-1}\}}(K)$. In this paper we construct similar generalizations for
$((\cdot,\cdot ))_p$. Our construction involves Witt vectors and Weyl algebras. In the process
we obtain a new kind of Weyl algebras in characteristic $p$, with many interesting properties. The
symbols we introduce, $((\cdot,\cdot ))_{p^n}$ and, more generally, $((\cdot,\cdot ))_{p^m,p^n}$,
which here are defined in terms of central simple algebras, coincide with the homonymous symbols
we introduced in [arXiv:1711.00980] in terms of the symbols $[\cdot,\cdot )_{p^n}$. This will
be proved in a future paper. In the present paper we only introduce the symbols and we prove that they
have the same properties with the symbols from [arXiv:1711.00980]. These properies are enough
to obtain the representation theorem for ${}_{p^n}{\rm Br}(K)$ from [arXiv:1711.00980], Theorem
4.10.
