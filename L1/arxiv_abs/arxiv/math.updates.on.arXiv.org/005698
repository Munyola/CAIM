The standard $L$-functions of $\mathrm{GL}_{2n}$ expressed in terms of the Friedberg-Jacquet
global zeta integrals have better structure for arithmetic applications, due to the relation of
the linear periods with the modular symbols. The most technical obstacles towards such arithmetic
applications are (1) {\sl non-vanishing of modular symbols at infinity} and (2) the {\sl existance
or construction of uniform cohomological test vectors}. Problem (1) is also called the {\sl non-vanishing
hypothesis at infinity}, which was proved by Binyong Sun, by establishing the existence of certain
cohomological test vectors. In this paper, we explicitly construct an archimedean local integral
that produces a new type of a twisted linear functional $\Lambda_{s,\chi}$, which, when evaluated
with our explicitly constructed cohomological vector, is equal to the local twisted standard $L$-function
$L(s,\pi\otimes\chi)$ for all complex values $s$. With the relations between linear models and
Shalika models, we establish (1) with an explicitly constructed cohomological vector, and hence
strengthen a non-vanishing result of Binyong Sun. Our main result indicates a complete solution
to (2), which will be presented in the forthcoming paper of Dihua Jiang, Binyong Sun and Fangyang
Tian with full details and with applications to the global period relations for the twisted standard
$L$-functions at critical places. The method used in this paper also works for complex case, which
will be presented in a forthcoming paper of Bingchen Lin and Fangyang Tian.
