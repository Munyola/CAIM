We give a new and representation theoretic construction of $p$-adic interpolation series for central
values of self-dual Rankin-Selberg $L$-functions for $\operatorname{GL}_2$ in dihedral towers
of CM fields, using expressions of these central values as automorphic periods. The main novelty
of this construction, apart from the level of generality in which it works, is that it is completely
local. We give the construction here for a cuspidal automorphic representation of $\operatorname{GL}_2$
over a totally real field corresponding to a $\mathfrak{p}$-ordinary Hilbert modular forms of
parallel weight two and trivial character, although a similar approach can be taken in any setting
where the underlying $\operatorname{GL}_2$-representation can be chosen to take values in a discrete
valuation ring. A certain choice of vectors allows us to establish a precise interpolation formula
thanks to theorems of Martin-Whitehouse and File-Martin-Pitale. Such interpolation formulae
had been conjectured by Bertolini-Darmon in antecedent works. Our construction also gives a conceptual
framework for the nonvanishing theorems of Cornut-Vatsal in that it describes the underlying theta
elements. To highlight this latter point, we describe how the construction extends in the parallel
weight two setting to give a $p$-adic interpolation series for central derivative values when the
root number is generically equal to $-1$, in which case the formula of Yuan-Zhang-Zhang can be used
to give an interpolation formula in terms of heights of CM points on quaternionic Shimura curves.
