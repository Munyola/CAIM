A practical method is described for computing the generators of the algebra of first integrals that
works well for a large family of Hopf--Zero singularity systems. The set of all volume--preserving
classical normal forms of this singularity is introduced via a Lie algebra description. This is
a maximal vector space of classical normal forms with first integral; this is whence our approach
works. Systems with a non-zero condition on their quadratic part are considered. The algebra of
all first integrals for any such system has a unique (modulo scalar multiplication) generator.
The infinite level volume-preserving parametric normal forms of any non-degenerate perturbation
within the Lie algebra of any such system is computed, where it can have rich dynamics. The associated
unique generator of the algebra of first integrals are derived. The symmetry group of the infinite
level normal forms are also discussed. Some necessary formulas are derived and applied on appropriately
modified R\"{o}ssler and generalized Kuramoto--Sivashinsky equations to demonstrate the applicability
of our theoretical results. An approach by Ioos and Lombardi is applied to find an optimal truncation
for the first level normal forms of these examples with exponentially small remainder. The numerically
suggested radios of convergence (for the first integral) associated with a hypernormalization
step is discussed for the truncated first level normal forms of the examples. This is achieved by
an efficient implementation of the results using Maple.
