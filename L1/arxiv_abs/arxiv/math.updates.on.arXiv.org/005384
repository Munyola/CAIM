Flexibility requirements are becoming more relevant in power system planning due to the integration
of variable Renewable Energy Sources (vRES). In order to consider these requirements Generation
Expansion Planning (GEP) models have recently incorporated Unit Commitment (UC) constraints,
using traditional energy-based formulations. However, recent studies have shown that energy-based
UC formulations overestimate the actual flexibility of the system. Instead, power-based UC models
overcome these problems by correctly modeling ramping constraints and operating reserves. This
paper proposes a power-based GEP-UC model that improves the existing models. The proposed model
optimizes investment decisions on vRES, Energy Storage Systems (ESS), and thermal technologies.
In addition, it includes real-time flexibility requirements, and the flexibility provided by
ESS, as well as other UC constraints, e.g., minimum up/down times, startup and shutdown power trajectories,
network constraints. The results show that power-based model uses the installed investments more
effectively than the energy-based models because it more accurately represents flexibility capabilities
and system requirements. For instance, the power-based model obtains less investment (6-12%)
and yet it uses more efficiently this investment because operating cost is also lower (2-8%) in a
real-time validation. We also propose a semi-relaxed power-based GEP-UC model, which is at least
10 times faster than its full-integer version and without significantly losing accuracy in the
results (less than 0.2% error).
