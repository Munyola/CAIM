This paper considers computation offloading in fog-radio access networks (F-RAN), where multiple
user equipments (UEs) offload their computation tasks to the F-RAN through a number of fog nodes.
Each UE can choose one of the fog nodes to offload its task, and each fog node may simultaneously serve
multiple UEs. Depending on the computation burden at the fog nodes, the tasks may be computed by the
fog nodes or further offloaded to the cloud via capacity-limited fronthaul links. To compute all
UEs tasks as fast as possible, joint optimization of UE-Fog association, radio and computation
resources of F-RAN is proposed to minimize the maximum latency of all UEs. This min-max problem is
formulated as a mixed integer nonlinear program (MINP). We first show that the MINP can be reformulated
as a continuous optimization problem, and then employ the majorization minimization (MM) approach
to finding a solution for it. The MM approach that we develop herein is unconventional in that---each
MM subproblem is inexactly solved with the same provable convergence guarantee as the conventional
exact MM. In addition, we also consider a cooperative offloading model, where the fog nodes compress-and-forward
their received signals to the cloud. Under this model, a similar min-max latency optimization problem
is formulated and tackled again by the inexact MM approach. Simulation results show that the proposed
algorithms outperform some heuristic offloading strategies, and that the cooperative offloading
is generally better than the non-cooperative one.
