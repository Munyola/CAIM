The $\gamma$-FDP and $k$-FWER multiple testing error metrics, which are tail probabilities of
the respective error statistics, have become popular recently as less-stringent alternatives
to the FDR and FWER. We propose general and flexible stepup and stepdown procedures for testing multiple
hypotheses about sequential (or streaming) data that simultaneously control both the type I and
II versions of $\gamma$-FDP, or $k$-FWER. The error control holds regardless of the dependence
between data streams, which may be of arbitrary size and shape. All that is needed is a test statistic
for each data stream that controls the conventional type I and II error probabilities, and no information
or assumptions are required about the joint distribution of the statistics or data streams. The
procedures can be used with sequential, group sequential, truncated, or other sampling schemes.
We give recommendations for the procedures' implementation including closed-form expressions
for the needed critical values in some commonly-encountered testing situations. The proposed
sequential procedures are compared with each other and with comparable fixed sample size procedures
in the context of strongly positively correlated Gaussian data streams. For this setting we conclude
that both the stepup and stepdown sequential procedures provide substantial savings over the fixed
sample procedures in terms of expected sample size, and the stepup procedure performs slightly
but consistently better than the stepdown for $\gamma$-FDP control, with the relationship reversed
for $k$-FWER control.
