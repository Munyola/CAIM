Recently, Banakh et al. unified the notions of Haar-null and Haar-meager sets: for a collection
$\mathcal{I}$ of subsets of $2^\omega$, we say that a subset $A$ of an abelian Polish group $X$ is
Haar-$\mathcal{I}$ ($A\in\mathcal{H}\mathcal{I}$) if there are a Borel hull $B\supseteq A$
and a continuous map $f\colon 2^\omega\to X$ with $f^{-1}[B+x]\in\mathcal{I}$ for all $x\in X$.
It turns out that for $\mathcal{I}=\mathcal{N}$ we obtain Haar-null sets. The same holds for $\mathcal{I}=\mathcal{M}$
and Haar-meager sets. As $\mathcal{I}\subseteq\mathcal{J}$ implies $\mathcal{H}\mathcal{I}\subseteq\mathcal{H}\mathcal{J}$,
the above notion enables to develop a whole hierarchy of Haar-null and Haar-meager sets. This requires
constructing examples distinguishing $\mathcal{H}\mathcal{I}$ for various $\mathcal{I}$.
In this paper we are interested in several particular collections $\mathcal{I}$: the $\sigma$-ideal
of countable sets, the ideal of finite sets and the collections of sets of cardinality at most $n$.
We study basic properties of the corresponding families $\mathcal{H}\mathcal{I}$, give suitable
examples distinguishing them (in all abelian Polish groups of the form $\mathbb{R}\times X$ or
$[0,1]\times X$ as well as in $C(K)$, where $K$ is compact metrizable, and $\ell_\infty$) and study
$\sigma$-ideals generated by compact Haar-$\mathcal{I}$ sets for the considered collections
$\mathcal{I}$. Moreover, we answer some questions asked in \cite{2} by Banakh and Jab\l o\'{n}ska
concerning null-finite sets and pose several open problems.
