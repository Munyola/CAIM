Given a symmetric social network, we are interested in testing whether it has only one community
or multiple communities. The desired tests should (a) accommodate severe degree heterogeneity,
(b) accommodate mixed-memberships, (c) have a tractable null distribution, and (d) adapt automatically
to different levels of sparsity, and achieve the optimal phase diagram. How to find such a test is
a challenging problem. We propose the Signed Polygon as a class of new tests. Fix $m \geq 3$. For each
$m$-gon in the network, define a score using the centralized adjacency matrix. The sum of such scores
is then the $m$-th order Signed Polygon statistic. The Signed Triangle (SgnT) and the Signed Quadrilateral
(SgnQ) as special examples of the Signed Polygon. We show that both the SgnT and SgnQ tests satisfy
(a)-(d), and especially, they work well for both the very sparse and less sparse cases. Our proposed
tests compare favorably with the existing tests. For example, the EZ and GC tests \cite{gao2017testing,
OGC} behave unsatisfactorily in the less sparse case and do not achieve the optimal phase diagram.
Also, many existing tests do not allow severe heterogeneity or mixed-memberships, so they behave
unsatisfactorily in our settings. The analysis of the SgnT and SgnQ tests is very delicate and extremely
tedious. The main reason is that we need a unified proof that covers a wide range of sparsity levels
and a wide range of degree heterogeneity: an easier proof may work in one special case but not another,
and the unified proof is therefore delicate and long.
