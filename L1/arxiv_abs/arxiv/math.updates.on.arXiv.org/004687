Given an undirected graph, are there $k$ matchings whose union covers all of its nodes, that is, a
matching-$k$-cover? A first, easy polynomial solution from matroid union is possible, as already
observed by Wang, Song and Yuan (Mathematical Programming, 2014). However, it was not satisfactory
neither from the algorithmic viewpoint nor for proving graphic theorems, since the corresponding
matroid ignores the edges of the graph. We prove here, simply and algorithmically: all nodes of a
graph can be covered with $k\ge 2$ matchings if and only if for every stable set $S$ we have $|S|\le
k\cdot|N(S)|$. When $k=1$, an exception occurs: this condition is not enough to guarantee the existence
of a matching-$1$-cover, that is, the existence of a perfect matching, in this case Tutte's famous
matching theorem (J. London Math. Soc., 1947) provides the right `good' characterization. The
condition above then guarantees only that a perfect $2$-matching exists, as known from another
theorem of Tutte (Proc. Amer. Math. Soc., 1953). Some results are then deduced as consequences with
surprisingly simple proofs, using only the level of difficulty of bipartite matchings. We give
some generalizations, as well as a solution for minimization if the edge-weights are non-negative,
while the edge-cardinality maximization of matching-$2$-covers turns out to be already NP-hard.
We have arrived at this problem as the line graph special case of a model arising for manufacturing
integrated circuits with the technology called `Directed Self Assembly'.
