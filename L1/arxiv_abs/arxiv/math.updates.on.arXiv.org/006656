Fix $\mathbb Z/2$ is the prime field of two elements and write $\mathcal A_2$ for the mod $2$ Steenrod
algebra. Denote by $GL_d:= GL(d, \mathbb Z/2)$ the general linear group of rank $d$ over $\mathbb
Z/2$ and by $\mathscr P_d$ the polynomial algebra $\mathbb Z/2[x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_d]$ as an unstable
left $\mathcal A_2$-module on $d$ generators of degree one. We study the Peterson hit problem of
finding a minimal set of generators for $\mathcal A_2$-module $\mathscr P_d.$ Equivalently, we
need to determine a basis for the $\mathbb Z/2$-vector space $$Q\mathscr P_d := \mathbb Z/2\otimes_{\mathcal
A_2} \mathscr P_d \cong \mathscr P_d/\mathcal A_2^+\mathscr P_d$$ in each degree $n\geq 1.$ Note
that this space is a representation of $GL_d$ over $\mathbb Z/2.$ The problem is still open for $d\geq
5.$ In this paper, we explicitly compute the hit problem in the $5$-variable case and in generic degree
$n = r(2^t -1) + 2^ts$ with $r = d = 5,\ s =8$ and $t$ an arbitrary positive integer. This result is used
to prove that the fifth Singer algebraic transfer detects the element $h_1g_1\in {\rm Ext}_{\mathcal
{A}_2}^{5, 26}(\mathbb Z/2, \mathbb Z/2),$ the $E_2$-term of Adams spectral sequence of spheres.
As an easy consequence, we see that it is an isomorphism in the bidegree $(5, 13.2^t)$ for $t= 1.$ Here
the Singer algebraic transfer is a homomorphism from $GL_d$-coinvariants of certain subspaces
of $Q\mathscr P_d$ to the cohomology groups of the Steenrod algebra, ${\rm Ext}_{\mathcal A_2}^{d,
*}(\mathbb Z/2, \mathbb Z/2)$.
