The article is devoted to the representation theory of locally compact infinite-dimensional group
$\mathbb{GLB}$ of almost upper-triangular infinite matrices over the finite field with $q$ elements.
This group was defined by S.K., A.V., and Andrei Zelevinsky in 1982 as an adequate $n=\infty$ analogue
of general linear groups $\mathbb{GL}(n,q)$. It serves as an alternative to $\mathbb{GL}(\infty,q)$,
whose representation theory is poor. Our most important results are the description of semi-finite
unipotent traces (characters) of the group $\mathbb{ GLB}$ via certain probability measures on
the Borel subgroup $\mathbb{B}$ and the construction of the corresponding von Neumann factor representations
of type $II_\infty$. As a main tool we use the subalgebra $\mathcal A(\mathbb{ GLB})$ of smooth functions
in the group algebra $L_1(\mathbb{GLB})$. This subalgebra is an inductive limit of the finite--dimensional
group algebras ${\mathbb C}(\mathbb{GL}(n,q))$ under parabolic embeddings. As in other examples
of the asymptotic representation theory we discover remarkable properties of the infinite case
which does not take place for finite groups, like multiplicativity of indecomposable characters
or connections to probabilistic concepts. The infinite dimensional Iwahori-Hecke algebra $\mathcal
H_q(\infty)$ plays a special role in our considerations and allows to understand the deep analogy
of the developed theory with the representation theory of infinite symmetric group $S(\infty)$
which had been intensively studied in numerous previous papers.
