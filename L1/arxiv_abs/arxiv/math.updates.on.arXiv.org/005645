Let $M\subset \mathbb{S}^{n+1}\subset\mathbb{R}^{n+2}$ be a compact cmc rotational hypersurface
of the $(n+1)$-dimensional Euclidean unit sphere. Denote by $|A|^2$ the square of the norm of the
second fundamental form and $J(f)=-\Delta f-nf-|A|^2f$ the stability or Jacobi operator. In this
paper we compute the spectra of their Laplace and Jacobi operators in terms of eigenvalues of second
order Hill's equations. For the minimal rotational examples, we prove that the stability index
--the numbers of negative eigenvalues of the Jacobi operator counted with multiplicity -- is greater
than $3 n+4$ and we also prove that there are at least 2 positive eigenvalues of the Laplacian of $M$
smaller than $n$. When $H$ is not zero, we have that every non-flat CMC rotational immersion is generated
by rotating a planar profile curve along a geodesic called the axis of rotation. Let $m$ be the number
of points where the maximal distance from this profile curve to the origin is achieved (we assume
that the coordinates of the plane containing the profile curve has been set up so that the axis of rotation
goes through the origin). Let $l$ be be the wrapping number of the profile curve. We show that the number
of negative eigenvalues of the operator $J$ counted with multiplicity is at least $(2l-1)n+(2m-1)$.
This result was proven for the case $n=2$ by Rossman and Sultana. They called $m$ the number of bulges
or the number of necks. We will slightly change the definition of $l$ to include immersed examples
that contain the axis of rotation.
