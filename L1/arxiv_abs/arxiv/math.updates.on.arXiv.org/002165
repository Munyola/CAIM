In the early 1980's Almgren developed a theory of Dirichlet energy minimizing multi-valued functions,
proving that the Hausdorff dimension of the singular set (including branch points) of such a function
is at most $(n-2),$ where $n$ is the dimension of its domain. Almgren used this result in an essential
way to show that the same upper bound holds for the dimension of the singular set of an area minimizing
$n$-dimensional rectifiable current of arbitrary codimension. In either case, the dimension
bound is sharp. We develop estimates to study the asymptotic behaviour of a multi-valued Dirichlet
energy minimizer on approach to its singular set. Our estimates imply that a Dirichlet energy minimizer
at ${\mathcal H}^{n-2}$ a.e. point of its singular set has a unique set of homogeneous multi-valued
cylindrical tangent functions (blow-ups) to which the minimizer, modulo a set of single-valued
harmonic functions, decays exponentially fast upon rescaling. A corollary is that the singular
set is countably $(n-2)$-rectifiable. Our work is inspired by the work of L. Simon on the analysis
of singularities of minimal submanifolds in multiplicity 1 classes, and uses some new estimates
and strategies together with techniques from Wickramasekera's prior work to overcome additional
difficulties arising from higher multiplicity and low regularity of the minimizers in the presence
of branch points. The results described here were announced in earlier work of the authors where
the special case of two-valued Dirichlet minimizing functions was treated.
