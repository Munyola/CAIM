The diffuse-domain, or smoothed boundary, method is an attractive approach for solving partial
differential equations in complex geometries because of its simplicity and flexibility. In this
method the complex geometry is embedded into a larger, regular domain. The original PDE is reformulated
using a smoothed characteristic function of the complex domain and source terms are introduced
to approximate the boundary conditions. The reformulated equation, which is independent of the
dimension and domain geometry, can be solved by standard numerical methods and the same solver can
be used for any domain geometry. A challenge is making the method higher-order accurate. For Dirichlet
boundary conditions, which we focus on here, current implementations demonstrate a wide range
in their accuracy but generally the methods yield at best first order accuracy in $\epsilon$, the
parameter that characterizes the width of the region over which the characteristic function is
smoothed. Typically, $\epsilon\propto h$, the grid size. Here, we analyze the diffuse-domain
PDEs using matched asymptotic expansions and explain the observed behaviors. Our analysis also
identifies simple modifications to the diffuse-domain PDEs that yield higher-order accuracy
in $\epsilon$, e.g., $O(\epsilon^2)$ in the \(L^2\) norm and $O(\epsilon^p)$ with $1.5\le p\le
2$ in the \(L^{\infty}\) norm. Our analytic results are confirmed numerically in stationary and
moving domains where the level set method is used to capture the dynamics of the domain boundary and
to construct the smoothed characteristic function.
