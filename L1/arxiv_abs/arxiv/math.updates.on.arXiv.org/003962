New classes of performance measures have been recently introduced to quantify the transient response
to external disturbances of coupled dynamical systems on complex networks. These performance
measures are time-integrated quadratic forms in the system's coordinates or their time derivative.
For the specific case of electric power networks, their physical meaning is that they quantify the
primary effort control to restore synchrony, the amount of additional power that is ohmically dissipated
during the transient or, more conceptually, the coherence of the synchronous state. So far, investigations
of these performance measures have been restricted to Dirac-$\delta$ impulse disturbances, in
which case they can be alternatively interpreted as giving the long time output variances for stochastic
white noise power demand/generation fluctuations. Strictly speaking, the approach is therefore
restricted to power fluctuating on time scales shorter than the shortest time scales in the swing
equations. To account for power productions from new renewable energy sources, we extend these
earlier works to the relevant case of colored noise power fluctuations, with a finite correlation
time $\tau > 0$. We calculate a closed-form expression for generic quadratic performance measures.
Applied to specific cases, this leads to a spectral representation of performance measures as a
sum over the non-zero modes of the network Laplacian. Our results emphasize the competition between
inertia, damping and the Laplacian modes, whose balance is determined to a large extent by the noise
correlation time scale $\tau$.
