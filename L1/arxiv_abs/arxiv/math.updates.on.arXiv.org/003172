We develop unified and easy to use framework to study robust fully discrete numerical methods for
nonlinear degenerate diffusion equations $$ \partial_t u-\mathfrak{L}[\varphi(u)]=f(x,t)
\qquad\text{in}\qquad \mathbb{R}^N\times(0,T), $$ where $\mathfrak{L}$ is a general symmetric
L\'evy type diffusion operator. Included are both local and nonlocal problems with e.g. $\mathfrak{L}=\Delta$
or $\mathfrak{L}=-(-\Delta)^{\frac\alpha2}$, $\alpha\in(0,2)$, and porous medium, fast diffusion,
and Stefan type nonlinearities $\varphi$. By robust methods we mean that they converge even for
nonsmooth solutions and under very weak assumptions on the data. We show that they are $L^p$-stable
for $p\in[1,\infty]$, compact, and convergent in $C([0,T];L_{\text{loc}}^p(\mathbb{R}^N))$
for $p\in[1,\infty)$. The first part of this project is given in \cite{DTEnJa18a} and contains
the unified and easy to use theoretical framework. This paper is devoted to schemes and testing.
We study many different problems and many different concrete discretizations, proving that the
results of \cite{DTEnJa18a} apply and testing the schemes numerically. Our examples include fractional
diffusions of different orders, and Stefan problems, porous medium, and fast diffusion nonlinearities.
Most of the convergence results and many schemes are completely new for nonlocal versions of the
equation, including results on high order methods, the powers of the discrete Laplacian method,
and discretizations of fast diffusions. Some of the results and schemes are new even for linear and
local problems.
