We offer a non-parametric plug-in estimator for an important measure of treatment effect variability
and provide minimum conditions under which the estimator is asymptotically efficient. The stratum
specific treatment effect function or so-called blip function, is the average treatment effect
for a randomly drawn stratum of confounders. The mean of the blip function is the average treatment
effect (ATE), whereas the variance of the blip function (VTE), the main subject of this paper, measures
overall clinical effect heterogeneity, perhaps providing a strong impetus to refine treatment
based on the confounders. VTE is also an important measure for assessing reliability of the treatment
for an individual. The CV-TMLE provides simultaneous plug-in estimates and inference for both
ATE and VTE, guaranteeing asymptotic efficiency under one less condition than for TMLE. This condition
is difficult to guarantee a priori, particularly when using highly adaptive machine learning that
we need to employ in order to eliminate bias. Even in defiance of this condition, CV-TMLE sampling
distributions maintain normality, not guaranteed for TMLE, and have a lower mean squared error
than their TMLE counterparts. In addition to verifying the theoretical properties of TMLE and CV-TMLE
through simulations, we point out some of the challenges in estimating VTE, which lacks double robustness
and might be unavoidably biased if the true VTE is small and sample size insufficient. We will provide
an application of the estimator on a data set for treatment of acute trauma patients.
