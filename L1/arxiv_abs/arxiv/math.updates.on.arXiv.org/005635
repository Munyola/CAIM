Near-integrability is usually associated with smooth small perturbations of smooth integrable
systems. Studying integrable mechanical Hamiltonian flows with impacts that respect the symmetries
of the integrable structure provides an additional rich class of non-smooth systems that can be
analyzed. Such systems exhibit rich dynamics, as, in addition to the underlying integrable structure,
some of the trajectories may undergo only transverse impact, others may undergo also tangential
impacts, and some trajectories do not impact at all. Under perturbations, each of these classes
of orbits behaves differently. Tools for classifying these different types of dynamics in 2 degrees-of-freedom
Hamiltonian impact systems with underlying separable integrable dynamics are presented. Moreover,
some of these tools may be extended to far from integrable cases. In particular, a generalization
of the energy momentum bifurcation diagram, Fomenko graphs and the hierarchy of bifurcations framework
to impact systems is constructed. It is shown that such representations classify dynamically different
regions in phase space. For the integrable and near integrable (small perturbations) cases these
provide global information on the dynamics whereas for the far from integrable (non-perturbative)
regimes, these provide rough classification of the first impact map. The interpretation of these
results in terms of projections of solutions to the configuration space as well as the relations
of these to the Hill region are presented.
