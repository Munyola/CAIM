We propose the adaptive multicarrier quadrature division-multiuser quadrature allocation (AMQD-MQA)
multiple access technique for continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CVQKD). The MQA
scheme is based on the AMQD modulation, which granulates the inputs of the users into Gaussian subcarrier
continuous-variables (CVs). The subcarrier coherent states formulate Gaussian sub-channels
from the physical link with diverse transmittance coefficients. In an AMQD-MQA multiple access
scenario, the simultaneous reliable transmission of the users is handled by the dynamic allocation
of the Gaussian subcarrier CVs. We propose two different settings of AMQD-MQA for multiple input-multiple
output communication. We introduce a rate-selection strategy that tunes the modulation variances
and allocates adaptively the quadratures of the users over the sub-channels. We also prove the rate
formulas if only partial channel side information is available for the users of the sub-channel
conditions. In an experimental CVQKD scenario, an ideal Gaussian input modulation can only be approximated,
which affects the quadrature adaption and the efficiency of the transmission. We show a technique
for the compensation of a nonideal Gaussian input modulation, which allows the users to overwhelm
the modulation imperfections to reach optimal capacity-achieving communication over the Gaussian
sub-channels. We investigate the diversity amplification of the sub-channel transmittance coefficients
and reveal that a strong diversity can be exploited by opportunistic Gaussian modulation.
