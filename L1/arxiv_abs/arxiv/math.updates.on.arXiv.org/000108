We present a Kalman smoothing framework based on modeling errors using the heavy tailed Student's
t distribution, along with algorithms, convergence theory, open-source general implementation,
and several important applications. The computational effort per iteration grows linearly with
the length of the time series, and all smoothers allow nonlinear process and measurement models.
Robust smoothers form an important subclass of smoothers within this framework. These smoothers
work in situations where measurements are highly contaminated by noise or include data unexplained
by the forward model. Highly robust smoothers are developed by modeling measurement errors using
the Student's t distribution, and outperform the recently proposed L1-Laplace smoother in extreme
situations with data containing 20% or more outliers. A second special application we consider
in detail allows tracking sudden changes in the state. It is developed by modeling process noise
using the Student's t distribution, and the resulting smoother can track sudden changes in the state.
These features can be used separately or in tandem, and we present a general smoother algorithm and
open source implementation, together with convergence analysis that covers a wide range of smoothers.
A key ingredient of our approach is a technique to deal with the non-convexity of the Student's t loss
function. Numerical results for linear and nonlinear models illustrate the performance of the
new smoothers for robust and tracking applications, as well as for mixed problems that have both
types of features.
