$(M^n,g)$ be a complete Riemannian manifold without conjugate points. In this paper, we show that
if $M$ is also simply connected, then $M$ is flat, provided that $M$ is also asymptotically harmonic
manifold with minimal horospheres (AHM). The (first order) flatness of $M$ is shown by using the
strongest criterion: $\{{e_i}\}$ be an orthonormal basis of $T_{p}M$ and $\{b_{e_{i}}\}$ be the
corresponding Busemann functions on $M$. Then, (1) The vector space $V = span\{b_{v} | v \in T_{p}M
\}$ is finite dimensional and dim $V = $ dim $M = n$.(2) $\{\nabla b_{e_i}(p) \}$ is a global parallel
orthonormal basis of $T_{p}M$ for any $p \in M$. Thus, $M$ is a parallizable manifold. And (3) F : M
-> R^n defined by $F(x) = (b_{e_1}(x), b_{e_{2}}(x), \cdots, b_{e_{n}}(x)),$ is an isometry and
therefore, $M$ is flat. Consequently, AH manifolds can have either polynomial or exponential volume
growth,generalizing the corresponding result of [18] for harmonic manifolds. In case of harmonic
manifold with minimal horospheres (HM), the (second order) flatness was proved in [23] by showing
that $span\{b_{v}^2 | v \in T_{p}M \}$ is finite dimensional. We conclude that, the results obtained
in this paper are the strongest and wider in comparison to harmonic manifolds, which are known to
be AH. In fact, our proof shows the more generalized result, viz.: If (M,g) is a non-compact, complete,
connected Riemannian manifold of infinite injectivity radius and of subexponential volume growth,
then M is a first order flat manifold.
