A meander is a topological configuration of a line and a simple closed curve in the plane (or a pair
of simple closed curves on the 2-sphere) intersecting transversally. Meanders can be traced back
to H. Poincar\'e and naturally appear in various areas of mathematics, theoretical physics and
computational biology (in particular, they provide a model of polymer folding). Enumeration of
meanders is an important open problem. The number of meanders with 2N crossings grows exponentially
when N grows, but the longstanding problem on the precise asymptotics is still out of reach. We show
that the situation becomes more tractable if one additionally fixes the topological type (or the
total number of minimal arcs) of a meander. Then we are able to derive simple asymptotic formulas
for the numbers of meanders as N tends to infinity. We also compute the asymptotic probability of
getting a simple closed curve on a sphere by identifying the endpoints of two arc systems (one on each
of the two hemispheres) along the common equator. The new tools we bring to bear are based on interpretation
of meanders as square-tiled surfaces with one horizontal and one vertical cylinders. The proofs
combine recent results on Masur-Veech volumes of the moduli spaces of meromorphic quadratic differentials
in genus zero with our new observation that horizontal and vertical separatrix diagrams of integer
quadratic differentials are asymptotically uncorrelated. The additional combinatorial constraints
we impose in this article yield explicit polynomial asymptotics.
