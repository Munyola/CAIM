A main disadvantage of many high-order methods for hyperbolic conservation laws lies in the famous
Gibbs-Wilbraham phenomenon, once discontinuities appear in the solution. Due to the Gibbs-Wilbraham
phenomenon, the numerical approximation will be polluted by spurious oscillations, which produce
unphysical numerical solutions and might finally blow up the computation. In this work, we propose
a new shock capturing procedure to stabilise high-order spectral element approximations. The
procedure consists of going over from the original (polluted) approximation to a convex combination
of the original approximation and its Bernstein reconstruction, yielding a stabilised approximation.
The coefficient in the convex combination, and therefore the procedure, is steered by a discontinuity
sensor and is only activated in troubled elements. Building up on classical Bernstein operators,
we are thus able to prove that the resulting Bernstein procedure is total variation diminishing
and preserves monotone (shock) profiles. Further, the procedure can be modified to not just preserve
but also to enforce certain bounds for the solution, such as positivity. In contrast to other shock
capturing methods, e.g. artificial viscosity methods, the new procedure does not reduce the time
step or CFL condition and can be easily and efficiently implemented into any existing code. Numerical
tests demonstrate that the proposed shock-capturing procedure is able to stabilise and enhance
spectral element approximations in the presence of shocks.
