A noncoherent two-way relaying system is developed using physical-layer network coding for improved
throughput over conventional relaying in a fading channel. Energy-efficient noncoherent operation
is achieved using multitone frequency shift keying (FSK). A novel soft-output demodulator is developed
for the relay, and corresponding achievable exchange rates are found for Rayleigh fading and AWGN
channels. Bit-error rate performance approaching the achievable rate is realized using a capacity-approaching
channel code and a receiver architecture that iterates between demodulation and channel decoding.
Iterative decoding is performed feeding information back from the channel decoder to the demodulator.
Additionally, error-rate performance is made to approach the achievable rate more closely by optimizing
LDPC codes for this system. The energy efficiency improvement obtained by increasing the modulation
order is more dramatic for the proposed physical-layer network coding scheme than it is for a conventional
point-to-point system. Using optimized LDPC codes, the bit-error rate performance is improved
by as much as 1.1 dB over a widely known standardized LDPC code, and comes to within 0.7 dB of the limit
corresponding to the achievable rate. Throughout this work, performance for physical-layer network
coding is compared to conventional network coding. When noncoherent FSK is used, physical-layer
network coding enables higher achievable rates, and conventional network coding exhibits better
energy efficiency at low rates.
