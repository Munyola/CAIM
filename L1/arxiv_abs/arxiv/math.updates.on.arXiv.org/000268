Inspired by regularization in quantum field theory, we study topological and metric properties
of spaces in which a cut-off is introduced. We work in the framework of noncommutative geometry,
and focus on Connes distance associated to a spectral triple (A,H,D). A high momentum (short distance)
cut-off is implemented by the action of a projection P on the Dirac operator D and/or on the algebra
A. This action induces two new distances. We first individuate conditions making them equivalent
to the original distance. We then study the Gromov-Hausdorff limit of the set of truncated states,
first for quantum metric spaces in the sense of Rieffel, and then for arbitrary spectral triples.
In the commutative case, we show that the cut-off induces a minimal length between points, which
is infinite if P has finite rank. When P is a spectral projection of D, we work out an approximation
of points by non-pure states that are at finite distance from each other. We apply the results to Moyal
plane and to the fuzzy sphere, obtained as Berezin quantization of the plane and the sphere. Along
the way, we introduce a notion of "state with finite moment of order 1" for noncommutative algebras,
give a new proof that the spectral distance between coherent states of Moyal plane is the Euclidean
distance between the peaks, and present some new results about Wasserstein distance on the real
line and on the circle, including a sharp approximation of the distance between Fej\'er probability
distributions. Finally, we discuss discrete approximations of the derivative on the real line:
the h-derivative and the q-derivative.
