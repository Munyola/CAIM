In this paper, we analyse piecewise deterministic Markov processes, as introduced in Davis (1984).
Many models in insurance mathematics can be formulated in terms of the general concept of piecewise
deterministic Markov processes. In this context, one is interested in computing certain quantities
of interest such as the probability of ruin of an insurance company, or the insurance company's value,
defined as the expected discounted future dividend payments until the time of ruin. Instead of explicitly
solving the integro-(partial) differential equation related to the quantity of interest considered
(an approach which can only be used in few special cases), we adapt the problem in a manner that allows
us to apply deterministic numerical integration algorithms such as quasi-Monte Carlo rules; this
is in contrast to applying random integration algorithms such as Monte Carlo. To this end, we reformulate
a general cost functional as a fixed point of a particular integral operator, which allows for iterative
approximation of the functional. Furthermore, we introduce a smoothing technique which is applied
to the integrands involved, in order to use error bounds for deterministic cubature rules. On the
analytical side, we prove a convergence result for our PDMP approximation, which is of independent
interest as it justifies phase-type approximations on the process level. We illustrate the smoothing
technique for a risk-theoretic example, and provide a comparative study of deterministic and Monte
Carlo integration.
