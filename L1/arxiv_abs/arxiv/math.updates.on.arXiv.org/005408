Since its first use by Euler on the seven bridges of K{\"o}nigsberg problem, graph theory has shown
excellent abilities in solving and unveiling the properties of multiple discrete optimization
problems notably in communications and signal processing. The study of the structure of integer
programs reveals equivalence with graph theory problems, which makes a large body of the literature
readily available for solving and characterizing the complexity of these problems. This tutorial
presents a framework for utilizing a particular graph theory problem, known as the clique problem,
for solving communications and signal processing problems. In particular, the paper aims to illustrate
the structural properties of problems that can be formulated as clique problems through multiple
examples in communications and signal processing. To that end, the first part of the tutorial formulates
and suggests various optimal and heuristic solutions for the clique problem and its variants. The
tutorial, further, illustrates the use of the clique formulation and its variants through numerous
contemporary examples in communications and signal processing, mainly in maximum access problem
for non-orthogonal multiple access networks, throughput maximization using index coding and
instantly decodable network coding, collision-free radio frequency identification networks,
and resource allocation in cloud-radio access networks. The tutorial finally sheds light on the
recent advances of such applications and discusses future research directions on the topics.
