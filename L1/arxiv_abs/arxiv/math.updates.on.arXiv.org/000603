In this paper we present an alternative method for the spectral analysis of a strictly stationary
time series $\{Y_t\}_{t\in \mathbb{Z}}$. We define a "new" spectrum as the Fourier transform of
the differences between copulas of the pairs $(Y_t,Y_{t-k})$ and the independence copula. This
object is called {\it copula spectral density kernel} and allows to separate marginal and serial
aspects of a time series. We show that it is intrinsically related to the concept of quantile regression.
Like in quantile regression, which provides more information about the conditional distribution
than the classical location-scale model, the copula spectral density kernel is more informative
than the spectral density obtained from the autocovariances. In particular the approach provides
a complete description of the distributions of all pairs $(Y_t,Y_{t-k})$. Moreover, it inherits
the robustness properties of classical quantile regression, because it does not require any distributional
assumptions such as the existence of finite moments. In order to estimate the copula spectral density
kernel we introduce rank-based Laplace periodograms which are calculated as bilinear forms of
weighted $L_1$-projections of the ranks of the observed time series onto a harmonic regression
model. We establish the asymptotic distribution of those periodograms, and the consistency of
adequately smoothed versions. The finite-sample properties of the new methodology, and its potential
for applications are briefly investigated by simulations and a short empirical example.
