We analyze a model problem based on highly disparate elastic constants that we propose in order to
understand corners and cusps that form on the boundary between the nematic and isotropic phases
in a liquid crystal. For a bounded planar domain $\Omega$ we investigate the $\varepsilon \to 0$
asymptotics of the variational problem \[\inf \frac{1}{2}\int_\Omega \left( \frac{1}{\varepsilon}
W(u)+\varepsilon |\nabla u|^2 + L_\varepsilon(\mathrm{div}\, u)^2 \right) \,dx\] within various
parameter regimes for $L_\varepsilon > 0.$ Here $u:\Omega\to\mathbb{R}^2$ and $W$ is a potential
vanishing on the unit circle and at the origin. When $\varepsilon\ll L_\varepsilon\to 0$, we show
that these functionals $\Gamma-$converge to a constant multiple of the perimeter of the phase boundary
and the divergence penalty is not felt. However, when $L_\varepsilon \equiv L > 0$, we find that a
tangency requirement along the phase boundary for competitors in the conjectured $\Gamma$-limit
becomes a mechanism for development of singularities. We establish criticality conditions for
this limit and under a non-degeneracy assumption on the potential we prove compactness of energy
bounded sequences in $L^2$. The role played by this tangency condition on the formation of interfacial
singularities is investigated through several examples: each of these examples involves analytically
rigorous reasoning motivated by numerical experiments. We argue that generically, "wall" singularities
between $\mathbb{S}^1$-valued states are expected near the defects along the phase boundary.
