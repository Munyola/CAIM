We propose inhomogeneous random K-out graphs $\mathbb{H}(n; \pmb{\mu}, \pmb{K}_n)$, where each
of the $n$ nodes is assigned to one of $r$ classes independently with a probability distribution
$\pmb{\mu} = \{\mu_1, \ldots, \mu_r\}$. In particular, each node is classified as class-$i$ with
probability $\mu_i>0$, independently. Each class-$i$ node selects $K_{i,n}$ distinct nodes
uniformly at random from among all other nodes. A pair of nodes are adjacent in $\mathbb{H}(n; \pmb{\mu},
\pmb{K}_n)$ if at least one selects the other. Without loss of generality, we assume that $K_{1,n}
\leq K_{2,n} \leq \ldots \leq K_{r,n}$. Earlier results on homogeneous random K-out graphs $\mathbb{H}(n;
K_n)$, where all nodes select the same number $K$ of other nodes, reveal that $\mathbb{H}(n; K_n)$
is connected with high probability (whp) if $K_n \geq 2$ which implies that $\mathbb{H}(n; \pmb{\mu},
\pmb{K}_n)$ is connected whp if $K_{1,n} \geq 2$. In this paper, we investigate the connectivity
of inhomogeneous random K-out graphs $\mathbb{H}(n; \pmb{\mu}, \pmb{K}_n)$ for the special case
when $K_{1,n}=1$, i.e., when each class-$1$ node selects only one other node. We show that $\mathbb{H}\left(n;\pmb{\mu},\pmb{K}_n\right)$
is connected whp if $K_{r,n}$ is chosen such that $\lim_{n \to \infty} K_{r,n} = \infty$. However,
any bounded choice of the sequence $K_{r,n}$ gives a positive probability of $\mathbb{H}\left(n;\pmb{\mu},\pmb{K}_n\right)$
being not connected. Simulation results are provided to validate our results in the finite node
regime.
