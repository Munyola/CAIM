Numerical simulations of brittle fracture using phase-field approaches often employ a discrete
approximation framework that applies the same order of interpolation for the displacement and
phase-field variables. Most common is to use linear finite elements to discretize the linear momentum
and phase-field equations. However the use of $P_1$ Lagrange shape functions to model the phase-field
is not optimal, since the latter develops cusps for fully developed cracks that in turn occur at locations
correspoding to Gauss points of the associated FE model for the mechanics. Such feature is challenging
to reproduce accurately with low order elements, and consequently element sizes must be made very
small relative to the phase-field regularization parameter in order to achieve convergence of
results with respect to the mesh. In this paper, we combine the standard $P_1$ FE discretization
of stress equilibrium with a cell-centered finite volume approximation of the phase-field evolution
equation based on the two-point flux approximation that is constructed on the same simplex mesh.
Compared to a pure FE formulation utilizing linear elements, the proposed framework results in
looser restrictions on mesh refinement with respect to the phase-field length scale. Furthermore,
initialization of the history field is straightforward and accomplished through a local procedure.
The ability to employ a coarser mesh relative to the traditional implementation is shown for several
numerical examples, demonstrating savings in computational cost on the order of 50 to 80 percent
for the studied cases.
