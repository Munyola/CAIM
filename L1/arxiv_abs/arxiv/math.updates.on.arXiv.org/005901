A bivariate random vector can exhibit either asymptotic independence or dependence between the
largest values of its components. When used as a statistical model for risk assessment in fields
such as finance, insurance or meteorology, it is crucial to understand which of the two asymptotic
regimes occurs. Motivated by their ubiquity and flexibility, we consider the extremal dependence
properties of vectors with a random scale construction $(X_1,X_2)=R(W_1,W_2)$, with non-degenerate
$R>0$ independent of $(W_1,W_2)$. Focusing on the presence and strength of asymptotic tail dependence,
as expressed through commonly-used summary parameters, broad factors that affect the results
are: the heaviness of the tails of $R$ and $(W_1,W_2)$, the shape of the support of $(W_1,W_2)$, and
dependence between $(W_1,W_2)$. When $R$ is distinctly lighter tailed than $(W_1,W_2)$, the extremal
dependence of $(X_1,X_2)$ is typically the same as that of $(W_1,W_2)$, whereas similar or heavier
tails for $R$ compared to $(W_1,W_2)$ typically result in increased extremal dependence. Similar
tail heavinesses represent the most interesting and technical cases, and we find both asymptotic
independence and dependence of $(X_1,X_2)$ possible in such cases when $(W_1,W_2)$ exhibit asymptotic
independence. The bivariate case often directly extends to higher-dimensional vectors and spatial
processes, where the dependence is mainly analyzed in terms of summaries of bivariate sub-vectors.
The results unify and extend many existing examples, and we use them to propose new models that encompass
both dependence classes.
