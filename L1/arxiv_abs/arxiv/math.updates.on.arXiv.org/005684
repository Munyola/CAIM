In this paper, we investigate the physical layer security of a full-duplex base station (BS) aided
system in the worst case, where an uplink transmitter (UT) and a downlink receiver (DR) are both equipped
with a single antenna, while a powerful eavesdropper is equipped with multiple antennas. For securing
the confidentiality of signals transmitted from the BS and UT, an artificial noise (AN) aided secrecy
beamforming scheme is proposed, which is robust to the realistic imperfect state information of
both the eavesdropping channel and the residual self-interference channel. Our objective function
is that of maximizing the worst-case sum secrecy rate achieved by the BS and UT, through jointly optimizing
the beamforming vector of the confidential signals and the transmit covariance matrix of the AN.
However, the resultant optimization problem is non-convex and non-linear. In order to efficiently
obtain the solution, we transform the non-convex problem into a sequence of convex problems by adopting
the block coordinate descent algorithm. We invoke a linear matrix inequality for finding its Karush-Kuhn-Tucker
(KKT) solution. In order to evaluate the achievable performance, the worst-case secrecy rate is
derived analytically. Furthermore, we construct another secrecy transmission scheme using the
projection matrix theory for performance comparison. Our simulation results show that the proposed
robust secrecy transmission scheme achieves substantial secrecy performance gains, which verifies
the efficiency of the proposed method.
