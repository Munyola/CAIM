The discontinuous Galerkin spectral element method (DGSEM) is now an established method for computing
approximate solutions of partial differential equations in many applications. Unlike continuous
finite elements, in DGSEM, numerical fluxes are used to enforce inter-element conditions, and
internal and external physical boundary conditions. This has been successful for many problems.
However, for certain problems such as elastic wave propagation in complex media, and where several
wave types and wave speeds are simultaneously present, a standard numerical flux may not be compatible
with the physical boundary conditions. If surface or interface waves are present, this incompatibility
may lead to numerical instabilities. We present a stable and arbitrary order accurate DGSEM for
elastic waves with a physically motivated numerical flux. Our numerical flux is compatible with
all well-posed, internal and external, boundary conditions, and can be easily extended to linear
and nonlinear friction laws for modeling fracture in elastic solids and dynamic earthquake rupture
processes. By construction our choice of penalty parameters yield an upwind scheme and a discrete
energy estimate analogous to the continuous energy estimate. The spectral radius of the resulting
spatial operator has an upper bound which is independent of the boundary and interface conditions,
thus it is suitable for efficient explicit time integration. We present numerical experiments
verifying high order accuracy and asymptotic numerical stability.
