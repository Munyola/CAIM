A group A acting faithfully on a set X is 2-distinguishable if there is a 2-coloring of X that is not
preserved by any nonidentity element of A, equivalently, if there is a proper subset of X with trivial
setwise stabilizer. The motion of an element a in A is the number of points of X that are moved by a, and
the motion of the group A is the minimal motion of its nonidentity elements. For finite A, the Motion
Lemma says that if the motion of A is large enough (specifically at least 2 log_2 |A|), then the action
is 2-distinguishable. For many situations where X has a combinatorial or algebraic structure,
the Motion Lemma implies the action of Aut(X) on X is 2-distinguishable in all but finitely many instances.
We prove an infinitary version of the Motion Lemma for countably infinite permutation groups, which
states that infinite motion is large enough to guarantee 2-distinguishability. From this we deduce
a number of results, including the fact that every locally finite, connected graph whose automorphism
group is countably infinite is 2-distinguishable. One cannot extend the Motion Lemma to uncountable
permutation groups, but nonetheless we prove that 2-distinguishable permutation groups with
infinite motion are dense in the class of groups with infinite motion. We conjecture an extension
of the Motion Lemma which we expect holds for a restricted class of uncountable permutation groups,
and we conclude with a list of open questions. The consequences of our results are drawn for orbit
equivalence of infinite permutation groups.
