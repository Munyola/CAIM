A topological classification of many classes of dynamical systems with regular dynamics in low
dimensions is often reduced to combinatorial invariants. In dimension 3 combinatorial invariants
are proved to be insufficient even for simplest Morse-Smale diffeomorphisms. The complete topological
invariant for the systems with a single saddle point on the 3-sphere is the embedding of the homotopy
non-trivial knot into the manifold $\mathbb S^2\times\mathbb S^1$. If a diffeomorphism has several
saddle points their unstable separatrices form arcs frames in the basin of the sink and circles frame
in the orbits space. Thus, the type of embedding of the circles frame into $\mathbb S^2\times\mathbb
S^1$ is a topological invariant for diffeomorphisms of this kind and this type turns out to be the
complete topological invariant for some classes of Morse-Smale 3-diffeomorphisms. Recently
it was shown that the problem of embedding of a 3-diffeomorphism into a topological flow is interconnected
with the properties of embedding of the arcs frame into the 3-Euclidean space. In this paper we consider
the criteria for the tame embedding of an arcs frame into the 3-Euclidean space as well as for the trivial
embedding of circles frame into $\mathbb S^2\times\mathbb S^1$. We apply this criteria to prove
that frames of one-dimensional separatrices in basins of sources of rough 3-diffeomorhisms with
two-dimensional expanding attractor are tamely embedded and their spaces of orbits are trivial
embeddings of circles frame into $\mathbb S^2\times\mathbb S^1$.
