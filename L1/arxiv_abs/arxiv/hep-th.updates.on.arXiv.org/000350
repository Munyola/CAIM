Despite the outstanding achievements of modern cosmology, the classical dispute on the precise
value of $H_0$, which is the first ever parameter of modern cosmology and one of the prime parameters
in the field, still goes on and on after over half a century of measurements. Recently the dispute
came to the spotlight with renewed strength owing to the significant tension (at $>3\sigma$ c.l.)
between the latest Planck determination obtained from the cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies
and the local measurement from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), based on Cepheid variables. In
this work, we investigate the impact of the dynamical vacuum models (DVMs) on such a controversy.
These models have recently been explored in great detail, with the result that by letting the vacuum
energy density to carry some moderate dependence on the cosmic expansion it is possible to strongly
ameliorate the fit quality to the overall $SNIa+BAO+H(z)+LSS+CMB$ cosmological observations,
as compared to the concordance $\Lambda$CDM model. Here we show that the main DVMs can surpass the
$\Lambda$CDM fit performance even after including the local HST measurement of $H_0$. We also find
that if we allow a departure from the vacuum equation of state, the vacuum option $w=-1$ continues
to be preferred. The kind of cosmic vacuum that is most favored, however, is \emph{not} the traditional
cosmological constant but a mildly evolving one with the Hubble rate, i.e. $\rho_{\Lambda}=\rho_{\Lambda}(H(t))$.
The large scale structure (LSS) formation data play a momentous role in discriminating between
the two options.
