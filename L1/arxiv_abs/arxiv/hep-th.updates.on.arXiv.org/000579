During the last few years, a large family of cosmological attractor models has been discovered,
which can successfully match the latest inflation-related observational data. Many of these models
can also describe a small cosmological constant $\Lambda$, which provides the most natural description
of the present stage of the cosmological acceleration. In this paper, we study $\alpha$-attractor
models with dynamical dark energy, including the cosmological constant $\Lambda$ as a free parameter.
Predominantly, the models with $\Lambda > 0$ converge to the asymptotic regime with $w=-1$. However,
there are some models with $w\neq -1$, which are compatible with the current observations. In the
simplest models with $\Lambda = 0$ one has $r=\frac{12\alpha}{N^2}$ and the asymptotic $w=-1+\frac{2}{9\alpha}$.
For example, in the seven disk M-theory related model with $\alpha = 7/3$ one finds $r \sim 10^{-2}$
and the asymptotic equation of state is $w \sim -0.9$. Future observations, including large-scale
structure surveys as well as B-mode detectors will test these, as well as more general models presented
here. Investigation of quintessential inflation with gravitational reheating may be interesting
from the point of view of inflationary cosmology. Such models require much greater number of $e$-folds,
and therefore predict $n_{s}$ which can exceed the value of $n_{s}$ in more conventional models
by about $0.006$. This suggests a way to distinguish the conventional inflationary models from
the models of quintessential inflation, even if they predict $w = -1$.
