We study K\"ahler-Dirac fermions on Euclidean dynamical triangulations. This fermion formulation
furnishes a natural extension of staggered fermions to random geometries without requring vielbeins
and spin connections. We work in the quenched approximation where the geometry is allowed to fluctuate
but there is no back-reaction from the matter on the geometry. By examining the eigenvalue spectrum
and the masses of scalar mesons we find evidence for a four fold degeneracy in the fermion spectrum
in the large volume, continuum limit. It is natural to associate this degeneracy with the well known
equivalence in continuum flat space between the K\"ahler-Dirac fermion and four copies of a Dirac
fermion. Lattice effects then lift this degeneracy in a manner similar to staggered fermions on
regular lattices. The evidence that these discretization effects vanish in the continuum limit
suggests both that lattice continuum K\"ahler-Dirac fermions are recovered at that point, and
that this limit truly corresponds to smooth continuum geometries. One additional advantage of
the K\"ahler-Dirac action is that it respects an exact $U(1)$ symmetry on any random triangulation.
This $U(1)$ symmetry is related to continuum chiral symmetry. By examining fermion bilinear condensates
we find strong evidence that this $U(1)$ symmetry is not spontaneously broken in the model at order
the Planck scale. This is a necessary requirement if models based on dynamical triangulations are
to provide a valid ultraviolet complete formulation of quantum gravity.
