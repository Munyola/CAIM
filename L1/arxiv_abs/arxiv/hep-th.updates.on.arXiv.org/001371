Motivated by the novel asymptotically global AdS$_4$ solutions with deforming horizon in [JHEP
{\bf 1802}, 060 (2018)], we analyze the boundary metric with odd multipolar differential rotation
and numerically construct a family of deforming solutions with tripolar differential rotation
boundary, including two classes of solutions: solitons and black holes. We find that the maximal
values of the rotation parameter $\varepsilon$, below which the stable large black hole solutions
could exist, are not a constant for $T> T_{schw}=\sqrt{3}/2\pi\simeq0.2757$. When temperature
is much higher than $ T_{schw}$, even though the norm of Killing vector $\partial_{t}$ keeps timelike
for some regions of $\varepsilon<2$, solitons and black holes with tripolar differential rotation
could be unstable and develop hair due to superradiance. As the temperature $T$ drops toward $T_{schw}$,
we find that though there exists the spacelike Killing vector $\partial_{t}$ for some regions of
$\varepsilon>2$, solitons and black holes still exist and do not develop hair due to superradiance.
Moreover, for $T\leqslant T_{schw}$, the curves of entropy firstly combine into one curve and then
separate into two curves again, in the case of each curve there are two solutions at a fixed value of
$\varepsilon$. In addition, we study the deformations of horizon for black holes by using an isometric
embedding in the hyperbolic three-dimensional space. Furthermore, we also study the quasinormal
modes of the solitons and black holes, which have analogous behaviours to that of dipolar rotation
and quadrupolar rotation.
