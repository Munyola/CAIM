Black hole (BH) thermodynamics was established by Bekenstein and Hawking, who made abstract theoretical
arguments about the second law of thermodynamics and quantum theory in curved spacetime respectively.
Testing these ideas experimentally has, so far, been impractical because the putative flux of Hawking
radiation from astrophysical BHs is too small to be distinguished from the rest of the hot environment.
Here, it is proposed that the spectrum of emitted gravitational waves (GWs) after the merger of two
BHs, in particular the spectrum of GW150914, can be used to infer a lower limit on the magnitude of
the entropy of the post-merger BH. This lower bound is potentially significant as it could be of the
same order as the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. To infer this limit, we first assume that the result
of the merger is an ultracompact object with an external geometry which is Schwarzschild or Kerr,
but with an outer surface which is capable of reflecting in-falling GWs rather than fully absorbing
them. If the absence of deviations from the predictions of general relativity in detected GW signals
will be verified, we will then obtain a bound on the minimal redshift factor of GWs that emerge from
the vicinity of the object's surface. This lack of deviations would also mean that the remnant of
the merger has to have a strongly absorbing surface and must then be a BH for all practical purposes.
We conclude that a relationship between the minimal redshift factor and the BH entropy, which was
first proposed by 't Hooft, could then be used to set a lower bound on the entropy of the post-merger
BH.
