A graded quiver with superpotential is a quiver whose arrows are assigned degrees $c\in \{0, 1, \cdots,
m\}$, for some integer $m \geq 0$, with relations generated by a superpotential of degree $m-1$.
Ordinary quivers ($m=1)$ often describe the open string sector of D-brane systems; in particular,
they capture the physics of D3-branes at local Calabi-Yau (CY) 3-fold singularities in type IIB
string theory, in the guise of 4d $\mathcal{N}=1$ supersymmetric quiver gauge theories. It was
pointed out recently that graded quivers with $m=2$ and $m=3$ similarly describe systems of D-branes
at CY 4-fold and 5-fold singularities, as 2d $\mathcal{N}=(0,2)$ and 0d $\mathcal{N}=1$ gauge
theories, respectively. In this work, we further explore the correspondence between $m$-graded
quivers with superpotential, $Q_{(m)}$, and CY $(m+2)$-fold singularities, ${\mathbf X}_{m+2}$.
For any $m$, the open string sector of the topological B-model on ${\mathbf X}_{m+2}$ can be described
in terms of a graded quiver. We illustrate this correspondence explicitly with a few infinite families
of toric singularities indexed by $m \in \mathbb{N}$, for which we derive "toric" graded quivers
associated to the geometry, using several complementary perspectives. Many interesting aspects
of supersymmetric quiver gauge theories can be formally extended to any $m$; for instance, for one
family of singularities, dubbed $C(Y^{1,0}(\mathbb{P}^m))$, that generalizes the conifold
singularity to $m>1$, we point out the existence of a formal "duality cascade" for the corresponding
graded quivers.
