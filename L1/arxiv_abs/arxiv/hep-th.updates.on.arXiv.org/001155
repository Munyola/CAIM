Under a rotation by an angle $\vartheta$, both the right- and left- handed Weyl spinors pick up a phase
factor ${\exp(\pm\, i \vartheta/2)}$. The upper sign holds for the positive helicity spinors,
while the lower sign for the negative helicity spinors. For $\vartheta = 2\pi$ radians this produces
the famous minus sign. However, the four-component spinors are built from a direct sum of the indicated
two-component spinors. The effect of the rotation by $2\pi$ radians on the eigenspinors of the parity
- that is, the Dirac spinors -- is the same as on Weyl spinors. It is because for these spinors the right-
and left- transforming components have the same helicity. And the rotation induced phases, being
same, factor out. But for the eigenspinors of the charge conjugation operator, i.e. Elko, the left-
and right- transforming components have opposite helicities, and therefore they pick up opposite
phases. As a consequence the behaviour of the eigenspinors of the charge conjugation operator (Elko)
is more subtle: for $0<\vartheta<2\pi$ a self conjugate spinor becomes a linear combination of
the self and antiself conjugate spinors with $\vartheta$ dependent superposition coefficients
- and yet the rotation preserves the self/antiself conjugacy of these spinors! This apparently
paradoxical situation is fully resolved. This new effect, to the best of our knowledge, has never
been reported before. The purpose of this communication is to present this result and to correct
an interpretational error of a previous version.
