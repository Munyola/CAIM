It is shown that the recently introduced positivity and causality preserving string-local quantum
field theory (SLFT) resolves most No-Go situations in higher spin problems. This includes in particular
the Velo-Zwanziger causality problem which turns out to be related in an interesting way to the solution
of zero mass Weinberg-Witten issue. In contrast to the indefinite metric and ghosts of gauge theory,
SLFT uses only positivity-respecting physical degrees of freedom. The result is a fully Lorentz-covariant
and causal string field theory in which light- or space-like linear strings transform covariant
under Lorentz transformation. The cooperation of causality and quantum positivity in the presence
of interacting s particles leads to remarkable conceptual changes. It turns out that the presence
of H-selfinteractions in the Higgs model is not the result of SSB on a postulated Mexican hat potential,
but solely the consequence of the implementation of positivity and causality. These principles
(and not the imposed gauge symmetry) account also for the Lie-algebra structure of the leading contributions
of selfinteracting vector mesons. Second order consistency of selfinteracting vector mesons
in SLFT requires the presence of H-particles; this, and not SSB, is the raison d'\^etre for H. The
basic conceptual and calculational tool of SLFT is the S-matrix. Its string-independence is a powerful
restriction which determines the form of interaction densities in terms of the model-defining
particle content and plays a fundamental role in the construction of pl observables and sl interpolating
fields.
