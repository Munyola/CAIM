We study the OPE coefficients $c_{\Delta, J}$ for heavy-light scalar four-point functions, which
can be obtained holographically from the two-point function of a light scalar of some non-integer
conformal dimension $\Delta_L$ in an AdS black hole. We verify that the OPE coefficient $c_{d,0}=0$
for pure gravity black holes, consistent with the tracelessness of the holographic energy-momentum
tensor. We then study the OPE coefficients from black holes involving matter fields. We first consider
general charged AdS black holes and we give some explicit low-lying examples of the OPE coefficients.
We also obtain the recursion formula for the lowest-twist OPE coefficients with at most two current
operators. For integer $\Delta_L$, although the OPE coefficients are not fully determined, we
set up a framework to read off the coefficients $\gamma_{\Delta,J}$ of the $\log(z\bar{z})$ terms
that are associated with the anomalous dimensions of the exchange operators and obtain a general
formula for $\gamma_{\Delta,J}$. We then consider charged AdS black holes in gauged supergravity
STU models in $D=5$ and $D=7$, and their higher-dimensional generalizations. The scalar fields
in the STU models are conformally massless, dual to light operators with $\Delta_L=d-2$. We derive
the linear perturbation of such a scalar in the STU charged AdS black holes and obtain the explicit
OPE coefficient $c_{d-2,0}$. Finally, we analyse the asymptotic properties of scalar hairy AdS
black holes and show how $c_{d,0}$ can be nonzero with exchanging scalar operators in these backgrounds.
