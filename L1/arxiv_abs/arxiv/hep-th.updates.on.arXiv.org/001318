In three dimensions, it is known that field theories possessing extended $(p,q)$ anti-de Sitter
(AdS) supersymmetry with ${\cal N}=p+q \geq 3$ can be realised in (2,0) AdS superspace. Here we present
a formalism to reduce every field theory with (2,0) AdS supersymmetry to ${\cal N}=1$ AdS superspace.
As nontrivial examples, we consider supersymmetric nonlinear sigma models formulated in terms
of ${\cal N}=2$ chiral and linear supermultiplets. The $(2,0) \to (1,0)$ AdS reduction technique
is then applied to the off-shell massless higher-spin supermultiplets in (2,0) AdS superspace
constructed in [1]. As a result, for each superspin value $\hat s$, integer $(\hat s= s)$ or half-integer
$(\hat s= s+1/2)$, with $s=1,2,\dots $, we obtain two off-shell formulations for a massless ${\cal
N}=1$ superspin-$\hat s$ multiplet in AdS${}_3$. These models prove to be related to each other
by a superfield Legendre transformation in the flat superspace limit, but the duality is not lifted
to the AdS case. Two out of the four series of ${\cal N}=1$ supersymmetric higher-spin models thus
derived are new. The constructed massless ${\cal N}=1$ supersymmetric higher-spin actions in
AdS${}_3$ are used to formulate (i) higher-spin supercurrent multiplets in ${\cal N}=1$ AdS superspace;
and (ii) new topologically massive higher-spin off-shell supermultiplets. Examples of ${\cal
N}=1$ higher-spin supercurrents are given for models of a complex scalar supermultiplet. We also
present two new off-shell formulations for a massive ${\cal N}=1$ gravitino supermultiplet in
AdS${}_3$.
