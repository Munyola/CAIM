We study numerically the onset of chaos and thermalization in the Banks-Fischler-Shenker-Susskind
(BFSS) matrix model with and without fermions, considering Lyapunov exponents, entanglement
generation, and quasinormal ringing. We approximate the real-time dynamics in terms of the most
general Gaussian density matrices with parameters which obey self-consistent equations of motion,
thus extending the applicability of real-time simulations beyond the classical limit. Initial
values of these Gaussian density matrices are optimized to be as close as possible to the thermal
equilibrium state of the system. Thus attempting to bridge between the low-energy regime with a
calculable holographic description and the classical regime at high energies, we find that quantum
corrections to classical dynamics tend to decrease the Lyapunov exponents, which is essential
for consistency with the Maldacena-Shenker-Stanford (MSS) bound at low temperatures. The entanglement
entropy is found to exhibit an expected "scrambling" behavior - rapid initial growth followed by
saturation. At least at high temperatures the entanglement saturation time appears to be governed
by classical Lyapunov exponents. Decay of quasinormal modes is found to be characterized by the
shortest time scale of all. We also find that while the bosonic matrix model becomes non-chaotic
in the low-temperature regime, for the full BFSS model with fermions the leading Lyapunov exponent,
entanglement saturation time, and decay rate of quasinormal modes all remain finite and non-zero
down to the lowest temperatures.
