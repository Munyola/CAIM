We study Kac-Moody asymptotic symmetries and memory effects in $\text{AdS}_4^{\text{Poincare}}$
gauge theory and (when accompanied by 4D gravity) in its holographic $\text{CFT}_3$ dual. While
such infinite-dimensional symmetries are absent in standard asymptotic analyses of $\text{AdS}_4$,
we show how they arise with alternate AdS boundary conditions. In the 3D holographic description,
these alternate boundary conditions correspond to a modified $\widetilde{\text{CFT}}_3$ obtained
by Chern-Simons gauging of the $\text{CFT}_3$ dual defined by standard boundary conditions, so
that Kac-Moody symmetries then follow from the familiar Chern-Simons/Wess-Zumino-Witten correspondence.
Apart from their own intrinsic interest, in abelian $\text{AdS}_4$ gauge theories these alternate
boundary conditions are equivalent to standard boundary conditions imposed on electric-magnetic
dual variables. In the holographic description this corresponds to 3D "mirror" symmetries connecting
the original and modified CFTs. Further, in both abelian and non-abelian theories we show that the
alternative/$\widetilde{\text{CFT}}_3$ theory emerges at leading order in large Chern-Simons
level from the correlators of the standard theory, upon incorporating large-wavelength limits
in the holographically emergent dimension. We point out analogies between 4D AdS and Minkowski
gauge theories in their asymptotic symmetries, "soft" limits and memory effects, but with AdS having
the advantages of greater holographic insight and technical simplicity.
