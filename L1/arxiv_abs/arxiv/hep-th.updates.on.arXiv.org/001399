We present a mathematically rigorous canonical quantization of Yang-Mills theory in 1+1 dimensions
(YM$_{1+1}$) by operator-algebraic methods. The latter are based on Hamiltonian lattice gauge
theory and multi-scale analysis via inductive limits of $C^{*}$-algebras which are applicable
in arbitrary dimensions. The major step, restricted to one spatial dimension, is the explicitly
construction of the spatially-localized von Neumann algebras of time-zero fields in the time gauge
in representations associated with scaling limits of Gibbs states of the Kogut-Susskind Hamiltonian.
We relate our work to existing results about YM$_{1+1}$ and its counterpart in Euclidean quantum
field theory (YM$_{2}$). In particular, we show that the operator-algebraic approach offers a
unifying perspective on results about YM$_{1+1}$ obtained by Dimock as well as Driver and Hall,
especially regarding the existence of dynamics. Although our constructions work for non-abelian
gauge theory, we obtain the most explicit results in the abelian case by applying the results of our
recent companion article. In view of the latter, we also discuss relations with the construction
of unitary representations of Thompson's groups by Jones. To understand the scaling limits arising
from our construction, we explain our findings via a rigorous adaptation of the Wilson-Kadanoff
renormalization group, which connects our construction with the multi-scale entanglement renormalization
ansatz (MERA). Finally, we discuss potential generalizations and extensions to higher dimensions
($d+1\geq 3$).
