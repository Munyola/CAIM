We develop a formalism to treat higher order (nonlinear) metric perturbations of the Kerr spacetime
in a Teukolsky framework. We first show that solutions to the linearized Einstein equation with
nonvanishing stress tensor can be decomposed into a pure gauge part plus a zero mode (infinitesimal
perturbation of the mass and spin) plus a perturbation arising from a certain scalar ("Debye-Hertz")
potential, plus a so-called "corrector tensor." The scalar potential is a solution to the spin $-2$
Teukolsky equation with a source. This source, as well as the tetrad components of the corrector
tensor, are obtained by solving certain decoupled ordinary differential equations involving
the stress tensor. As we show, solving these ordinary differential equations reduces simply to
integrations in the coordinate $r$ in outgoing Kerr-Newman coordinates, so in this sense, the problem
is reduced to the Teukolsky equation with source, which can be treated by a separation of variables
ansatz. Since higher order perturbations are subject to a linearized Einstein equation with a stress
tensor obtained from the lower order perturbations, our method also applies iteratively to the
higher order metric perturbations, and could thus be used to analyze the nonlinear coupling of perturbations
in the near-extremal Kerr spacetime, where weakly turbulent behavior has been conjectured to occur.
Our method could also be applied to the study of perturbations generated by a pointlike body traveling
on a timelike geodesic in Kerr, which is relevant to the extreme mass ratio inspiral problem.
