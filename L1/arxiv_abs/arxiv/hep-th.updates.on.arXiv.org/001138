Successes of the modified gravitation theories encourage scientists to apply them in the domain
of cosmology as well as in solar system to overcome the recent issues that Einstein's general relativity
could not resolve them. For this purpose, we explore the quadratic form of $f(R)=R+bR^2$ gravitational
theory to derive in details rotating $N$-dimensions black string solutions with $\ell$ rotation
parameters. Here, $R$ is the Ricci scalar and $b$ is a dimensional parameter. We supposed that the
$N$-dimensional spacetime is static and flat or cylindrical horizons with zero curvature boundary.
The system of differential equations is solved analytically without any constraints. We show the
relations of the physical quantities like the horizon radius, the mass and so on. We also demonstrate
that in the four-dimensional case, the higher order curvature has no effect on the black string,
i.e., the black string does not depend on the dimensional parameter $b$, while in the case of $N>4$,
it has a dependence on the parameter. We analyze the conserved quantities, energy, and angular momentum,
of the black string solutions by applying the relocalization method. In addition, we calculate
the thermodynamic quantities such as temperature, entropy etc. and confirm that the first law of
thermodynamics is verified by examining a Smarr-type formula of the total mass and the angular momentum
of the derived solutions. Furthermore, we investigate the stability of the black string solutions
locally and explain that the derived solutions are stable.
