Black hole (BH) thermodynamics was established by Bekenstein and Hawking, who made abstract theoretical
arguments about the second law of thermodynamics and quantum theory in curved spacetime respectively.
Testing these ideas experimentally has, so far, been impractical because the putative flux of Hawking
radiation from astrophysical BHs is too small to be distinguished from the rest of the hot environment.
Here, it is proposed that the spectrum of emitted gravitational waves (GWs) after the merger of two
BHs, in particular the spectrum of GW150914, can be used to infer a lower limit on the magnitude of
the entropy of the post-merger BH. This lower bound is significant as it is the same order as the Bekenstein-Hawking
entropy. To infer this limit, we first assume that the result of the merger is an ultracompact object
with an external geometry which is Schwarzschild or Kerr, but with an outer surface which is capable
of reflecting in-falling GWs rather than fully absorbing them. Because of the absence of deviations
from the predictions of general relativity in detected GW signals, we then obtain a bound on the minimal
redshift factor of GWs that emerge from the vicinity of the object's surface. The lack of deviations
also means that the merger remnant essentially needs to have an absorbing surface, and thus it must
effectively be a BH. Finally, a relationship between the minimal redshift factor and the BH entropy,
which was first proposed by 't Hooft, is used to set a lower bound on the entropy of the post-merger
BH.
