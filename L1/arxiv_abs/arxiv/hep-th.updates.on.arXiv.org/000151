We review, in the first part of this work, many pioneering works on supersymmetry and organize these
results to show how supersymmetric quantum field theories arise from spin-statistics, N{\oe}ther
and a series of no-go theorems. We then introduce the so-called superspace formalism dedicated
to the natural construction of supersymmetric Lagrangians and detail the most popular mechanisms
leading to soft supersymmetry breaking. As an application, we describe the building of the Minimal
Supersymmetric Standard Model and investigate current experimental limits on the parameter space
of its most constrained versions. To this aim, we use various flavor, electroweak precision, cosmology
and collider data. We then perform several phenomenological excursions beyond this minimal setup
and probe effects due to non-minimal flavor violation in the squark sector, revisiting various
constraints arising from indirect searches for superpartners. Next, we use several interfaced
high-energy physics tools, including the FeynRules package and its UFO interface that we describe
in detail, to study the phenomenology of two non- minimal supersymmetric models at the Large Hadron
Collider. We estimate the sensitivity of this machine to monotop production in R-parity violating
supersymmetry and sgluon-induced multitop production in R-symmetric supersymmetry. We then
generalize the results to new physics scenarios designed from a bottom-up strategy and finally
depict, from a theorist point of view, a search for monotops at the Tevatron motivated by these findings.
