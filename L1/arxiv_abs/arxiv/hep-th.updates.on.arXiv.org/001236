We have considered the effects of space and momentum noncommutativity separately on the zitterbewegung
(ZBW) phenomenon. In the space noncommutativity scenario, it has been expressed that, due to the
conservation of momentum, the Fourier decomposition of the expectation value of position does~not
change. However, the noncommutative (NC) space corrections to the magnetic dipole moment of electron,
that was traditionally perceived to come into play only in the first-order of perturbation theory,
appear in the leading-order calculations with the similar structure and numerically the same order,
but with an opposite sign. This result may explain why for large lumps of masses, the Zeeman-effect
due to the noncommutativity remains undetectable. Moreover, we have shown that the $x$- and $y$-components
of the electron magnetic dipole moment, contrary to the commutative (usual) version, are non-zero
and with the same structure as the $z$-component. In the momentum noncommutativity case, we have
indicated that, due to the relevant external uniform magnetic field, the energy-spectrum and also
the solutions of the Dirac equation are changed in $3+1$ dimensions. In addition, our analysis shows
that in $2+1$ dimensions, the resulted NC field makes electrons in the zero Landau-level rotate
not only via a cyclotron motion, but also through the ZBW motion with a frequency proportional to
the field, which doubles the amplitude of the rotation. In fact, this is a hallmark of the ZBW in graphene
that provides a promising way to be tested experimentally.
