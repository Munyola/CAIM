Using de Wit-Nicolai $D=4\;\mathcal{N}=8\;SO(8)$ supergravity as an example, we show how modern
Machine Learning software libraries such as Google's TensorFlow can be employed to greatly simplify
the analysis of high-dimensional scalar sectors of some M-Theory compactifications. We provide
detailed information on the location, symmetries, and particle spectra and charges of~192 critical
points on the scalar manifold of SO(8)~supergravity, including one newly discovered $\mathcal{N}=1$
vacuum with~$SO(3)$ residual symmetry, one new potentially stabilizable non-supersymmetric
solution, and examples for ``Galois conjugate pairs'' of solutions, i.e. solution-pairs that
share the same gauge group embedding into~$SO(8)$ and minimal polynomials for the cosmological
constant. Where feasible, we give analytic expressions for solution coordinates and cosmological
constants. As the authors' aspiration is to present the discussion in a form that is accessible to
both the Machine Learning and String Theory communities and allows adopting our methods towards
the study of other models, we provide an introductory overview over the relevant Physics as well
as Machine Learning concepts. This includes short pedagogical code examples. In particular, we
show how to formulate a requirement for residual Supersymmetry as a Machine Learning loss function
and effectively guide the numerical search towards supersymmetric critical points. Numerical
investigations suggest that there are no further supersymmetric vacua beyond this newly discovered
fifth solution.
