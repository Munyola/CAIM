Eight-dimensional non-geometric heterotic strings with gauge algebra $\mathfrak{e}_8\mathfrak{e}_7$
were constructed by Malmendier and Morrison as heterotic duals of F-theory on K3 surfaces with $\Lambda^{1,1}\oplus
E_8\oplus E_7$ lattice polarization. Clingher, Malmendier and Shaska extended these constructions
to eight-dimensional non-geometric heterotic strings with gauge algebra $\mathfrak{e}_7\mathfrak{e}_7$
as heterotic duals of F-theory on $\Lambda^{1,1}\oplus E_7\oplus E_7$ lattice polarized K3 surfaces.
In this study, we analyze the points in the moduli of non-geometric heterotic strings with gauge
algebra $\mathfrak{e}_7\mathfrak{e}_7$, at which the non-Abelian gauge groups on the F-theory
side are maximally enhanced. The gauge groups on the heterotic side do not allow for the perturbative
interpretation at these points. We show that these theories can be described as deformations of
the stable degenerations, as a result of coincident 7-branes on the F-theory side. From the heterotic
viewpoint, this effect corresponds to the insertion of 5-branes. These effects can be used to understand
nonperturbative aspects of nongeometric heterotic strings. Additionally, we build a family of
elliptic Calabi-Yau 3-folds by fibering elliptic K3 surfaces, which belong to the F-theory side
of the moduli of non-geometric heterotic strings with gauge algebra $\mathfrak{e}_7\mathfrak{e}_7$,
over $\mathbb{P}^1$. We find that highly enhanced gauge symmetries arise on F-theory on the built
elliptic Calabi-Yau 3-folds.
