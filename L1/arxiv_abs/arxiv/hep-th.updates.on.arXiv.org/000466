Recently, the nonlinear electrodynamics (NED) has been gaining attention to generate primordial
magnetic fields in the Universe and also to resolve singularity problems. Moreover, recent works
have shown the crucial role of the NED on the inflation. This paper provides a new approach based on
a new model of NED as a source of gravitation to remove the cosmic singularity at the big bang and explain
the cosmic acceleration during the inflation era without initial singularity on the background
of stochastic magnetic field. We explore whether a NED field can be the origin of the cosmic acceleration.
Also, we found a realization of a cyclic Universe, free of initial singularity, due the model for
the NED energy density we propose. We find explicit relations for $H(z)$ by direct integration of
the equations of motion of the proposed model. We perform MCMC likelihood exploration of these relations
using Observational Hubble data to find the mean values for the NED parameters. We compute the deceleration
parameter $q(z)$ in the range $0<z<2$ from the best fit values of the parameters and find $q(z)\rightarrow
1/2$ at $z\rightarrow \infty$. Moreover, the Universe passes of a decelerated phase to an accelerated
stage at redshift $\sim 0.5$. The result is that the are not statistical differences with the usual
model during the radiation epoch which holds for $\alpha=0$. However, taking $\alpha$ slightly
different from zero, we find that the NED with dust matter ($w_{m}=0$) is able to drive the late-time
cosmic acceleration of the standard cosmological model.
