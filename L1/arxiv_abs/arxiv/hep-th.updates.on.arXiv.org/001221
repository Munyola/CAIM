The swampland program of delineating the space of effective field theories consistent with quantum
gravity appears similar to the bootstrap program of delineating the space of quantum field theories
consistent with conformal symmetry. With this in mind we rewrite the effective field theory of the
Large Volume Scenario in AdS space solely in terms of $R_{AdS}$, in a form suitable for holographic
analysis. This rewritten EFT takes a remarkably universal (and previously unnoticed) form, which
is uniquely determined in the large-volume limit up to terms suppressed by $\mathcal{O} \left(
1/\ln R_{AdS} \right)$, with no reference to any of the fluxes, brane or instanton configurations
that enter the microphysics of moduli stabilisation. The putative dual 3d CFT will have two low-lying
single trace scalars, an even-parity scalar $\Phi$ dual to the volume modulus with $\Delta_{\Phi}
= \frac{3}{2}\left( 1 + \sqrt{19} \right) \simeq 8.038$ and an odd-parity scalar $a$ dual to the
volume axion with $\Delta_a = 3$. On the AdS side the higher-point interactions are likewise uniquely
determined. As the AdS theory is both subject to swampland constraints and holographically related
to a CFT, we argue that holography will lead to a `bootland' --- a map between swampland constraints
on the AdS side and bootstrap constraints on the CFT side. We motivate this with a discussion of swampland
quantum gravity constraints on the axion decay constant in the $\mathcal{V} \to \infty$ limit and
the $\langle \Phi \Phi a a \rangle$ 4-point function on the CFT side.
