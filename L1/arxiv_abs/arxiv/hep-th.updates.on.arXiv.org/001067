We revisit the recent reformulation of the holographic prescription to compute entanglement entropy
in terms of a convex optimization problem, introduced by Freedman and Headrick. According to it,
the holographic entanglement entropy associated to a boundary region is given by the maximum flux
of a bounded, divergenceless vector field, through the corresponding region. Our work leads to
two main results: (i) We present a general algorithm that allows the construction of explicit thread
configurations in cases where the minimal surface is known. We illustrate the method with simple
examples: spheres and strips in vacuum AdS, and strips in a black brane geometry. Studying more generic
bulk metrics, we uncover a sufficient set of conditions on the geometry and matter fields that must
hold to be able to use our prescription. (ii) Based on the nesting property of holographic entanglement
entropy, we develop a method to construct bit threads that maximize the flux through a given bulk
region. As a byproduct, we are able to construct more general thread configurations by combining
(i) and (ii) in multiple patches. We apply our methods to study bit threads which simultaneously
compute the entanglement entropy and the entanglement of purification of mixed states and comment
on their interpretation in terms of entanglement distillation. We also consider the case of disjoint
regions for which we can explicitly construct the so-called multi-commodity flows and show that
the monogamy property of mutual information can be easily illustrated from our constructions.
