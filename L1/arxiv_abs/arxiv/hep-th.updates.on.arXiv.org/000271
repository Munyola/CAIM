We consider spherically symmetric inhomogeneous Stephani universes, the center of symmetry being
our location. We emphasize that in these models comoving observers do not follow geodesics, in particular
comoving perfect fluids have necessarily a radial dependent pressure. We consider a subclass of
these models characterized by some inhomogeneity parameter $\beta$. We show that also the velocity
of sound, like the (effective) equation of state parameter, of comoving perfect fluids acquire
away from the origin a time and radial dependent change proportional to $\beta$. In order to produce
a realistic universe accelerating at late times without dark nergy component one must take $\beta
< 0$. The redshift gets a modified dependence on the scale factor $a$ with a relative modification
of $-9\%$ peaking at $z\sim 4$ and vanishing at the Big bang and today on our past lightcone. The equation
of state parameter and the speed of sound of dustlike matter (corresponding to a vanishing pressure
at the center of symmetry $r=0$) behave in a similar way and away from the center of symmetry they become
negative, a property usually encountered for the dark energy component only. In order to mimic the
observed late-time accelerated expansion the matter component must significantly depart from
standard dust, presumably ruling this model out as a realistic cosmology. The only way to accept
these models is to keep all standard matter components of the universe including dark energy and
take an inhomogeneity parameter $\beta$ small enough.
