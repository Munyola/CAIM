Our contribution sets out to investigate the GeV-scale phenomenology of a model based on an $SU_{L}(2)
\times U_{Y}(1) \times U(1)_{X}$-gauge symmetry. The model accommodates, as a consequence of
the symmetry-breaking pattern, a light gauge boson at the GeV-scale or below, allowing then to set
up a new low energy physics. The fermion sector includes an exotic candidate to Dark Matter (DM) and
the whole fermionic field content yields, as it is mandatory, the cancellation of the chiral anomaly.
%In this strict sense, we refer to our proposal as a unified description : two different and exclusive
symmetry-breaking patterns are treated with a single Lagrangian density and a common symmetry
group. Furthermore, The light gauge boson and the exotic fermion are proposed as candidates to the
so-called dark sector of the model that we try to describe in this contribution. The low-energy spectrum
exhibits a hidden scalar field with mass fixed at the GeV level in the Higgs sector. We calculate the
DM relic density associated with the dark fermion candidate by considering two annihilation processes
in which the light gauge boson works as a portal for the DM detection. The observed relic density points
to a mass of $3.4$ GeV for the DM fermion, while the light gauge boson mass is $8.0$ GeV. We also investigate
the direct detection of DM in the low energy regime and obtain the region of parameters allowed by
recent discussions on DM limits. Finally, the correction to the muon magnetic dipole moment is calculated
considering the gauge boson mass at the GeV scale or below.
