Generalized quasi-topological gravities (GQTGs) are higher-curvature extensions of Einstein
gravity characterized by the existence of non-hairy generalizations of the Schwarzschild black
hole which satisfy $g_{tt}g_{rr}=-1$, as well as for having second-order linearized equations
around maximally symmetric backgrounds. In this paper we provide strong evidence that any gravitational
effective action involving higher-curvature corrections is equivalent, via metric redefinitions,
to some GQTG. In the case of theories involving invariants constructed from contractions of the
Riemann tensor and the metric, we show this claim to be true as long as (at least) one non-trivial GQTG
invariant exists at each order in curvature ---and extremely conclusive evidence suggests this
is the case in general dimensions. When covariant derivatives of the Riemann tensor are included,
the evidence provided is not as definitive, but we still prove the claim explicitly for all theories
including up to eight derivatives of the metric as well as for terms involving arbitrary contractions
of two covariant derivatives of the Riemann tensor and any number of Riemann tensors. Our results
suggest that the physics of generic higher-curvature gravity black holes is captured by their GQTG
counterparts, dramatically easier to characterize and universal. As an example, we map the gravity
sector of the Type-IIB string theory effective action in AdS$_5$ at order $\mathcal{O}({\alpha^{\prime}}^3)$
to a GQTG and show that the thermodynamic properties of black holes in both frames match.
