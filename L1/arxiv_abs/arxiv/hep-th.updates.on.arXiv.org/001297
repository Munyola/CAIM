The general solution of the conformal Ward identities (CWI's) in momentum space, and their matching
to perturbation theory, allows to uncover some specific characteristics of the breaking of conformal
symmetry, induced by the anomaly. It allows to compare perturbative features of the 1-particle
irreducible (1PI, nonlocal) anomaly action with the prediction of a similar (but exact) nonlocal
action identified by the CWI's. The two predictions can be exactly matched at the level of 3-point
functions. The analysis of the $TJJ$ and $TTT$ shows that both approaches - based either on 1PI or
on the exact solutions of the CWI's - predict massless (dynamical) scalar exchanges in 3-point functions
as the signature of the conformal anomaly. In a local formulation such 1PI actions exhibit a ghost
in the spectrum which may induce ghost condensation. We also discuss alternative approaches, which
take to Wess-Zumino forms of the action with an asymptotic dilaton, which should be considered phenomenological
alternatives to the exact nonlocal action. If derived by a Weyl gauging, they also include a ghost
in the spectrum. The two formulations, nonlocal and of WZ type, can be unified under the assumption
that they describe the same anomaly phenomenon at two separate (UV/IR) ends of the renormalization
group flow, possibly separated by a vacuum rearrangement at an intermediate scale. A similar analysis
is presented for an $\mathcal{N}=1$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory. We comment on the possibile
cosmological implications of such quasi Nambu-Goldstone modes as ultralight dilatons and axions.
