The scrambling of quantum information in closed many-body systems has received considerable recent
attention. Two useful measures of scrambling have emerged: the spreading of initially-local operators,
and the related concept of out-of-time-ordered correlation functions (OTOCs). Recently, random
circuits have been used to give these quantities an effective hydrodynamical description. We extend
these results by considering local random unitary circuits with a conserved U$(1)$ charge and argue,
with numerical and analytical evidence, that the presence of a conservation law slows relaxation
in both time ordered and time-out-of ordered correlation functions; we show that both can have a
diffusively relaxing component or "power-law tail" at late times. Moreover, we consider OTOCs
in Gibbs states, parametrized by a chemical potential $\mu$, and apply perturbative arguments
to show that for $\mu\gg 1$ the ballistic front of information-spreading can only develop at times
exponentially large in $\mu$ -- with the information traveling diffusively at earlier times. We
also develop a new formalism for describing OTOCs and operator spreading, which allows us to describe
the saturation of OTOCs as a form of "thermalization on operator space", and leads to a conjecture
for their long-time behavior, wherein the conservation law results in a particular profile for
OTOCs, showing a slow decay behind the main front. Our results may be relevant to systems with energy
conservation, with the role of chemical potential played by the inverse temperature, even though
our models explicitly break time translation symmetry.
