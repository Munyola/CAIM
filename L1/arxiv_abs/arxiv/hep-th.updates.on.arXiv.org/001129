In a spacetime divided into two regions $U_1$ and $U_2$ by a hypersurface $\Sigma$, a perturbation
of the field in $U_1$ is coupled to perturbations in $U_2$ by means of the holographic imprint that
it leaves on $\Sigma$. The linearized gluing field equation constrains perturbations on the two
sides of a dividing hypersurface, and this linear operator may have a nontrivial null space. A nontrivial
perturbation of the field leaving a holographic imprint on a dividing hypersurface which does not
affect perturbations on the other side should be considered physically irrelevant. This consideration,
together with a locality requirement, leads to the notion of gauge equivalence in Lagrangian field
theory over confined spacetime domains. Physical observables in a spacetime domain $U$ can be calculated
integrating (possibly non local) gauge invariant conserved currents on hypersurfaces such that
$\partial \Sigma \subset \partial U$. The set of observables of this type is sufficient to distinguish
gauge inequivalent solutions. The integral of a conserved current on a hypersurface is sensitive
only to its homology class $[\Sigma]$, and if $U$ is homeomorphic to a four ball the homology class
is determined by its boundary $S = \partial \Sigma$. We will see that a result of Anderson and Torre
implies that for a class of theories including vacuum General Relativity all local observables
are holographic in the sense that they can be written as integrals of over the two dimensional surface
$S$. However, non holographic observables are needed to distinguish between gauge inequivalent
solutions.
