We study the critical values ($\alpha_{c}, a_{c}$) of the quintessential and spin parameters,
to distinguish a rotating Kiselev black hole (RKBH) from a naked singularity. For any value of the
dimensionless quintessential parameter $\omega_{q} \in (-1, -1/3)$, a black hole can exist if
$\alpha$ $\leq$ $\alpha_{c}$ and $a$ $\leq$ $a_{c}$. Both $\alpha_{c}$ and $a_{c}$ are directly
proportional to $\omega_{q}$. Further, for any $\omega_{q}$, when increasing the value of $\alpha$
from zero to $\alpha_{c}$, the size of the event horizon increases, whereas the size of the outer
horizon decreases. We also study the critical value of the quintessential parameter $\overline{\alpha}_c$
for the Kiselev black hole (KBH) and find horizons of extremal black holes. It is seen that, similar
to a RKBH, for a KBH with any $\omega_{q}$, when increasing the value of $\alpha$, the size of the event
horizon increases, while the size of the outer horizon decreases. We then study the spin precession
of a test gyroscope attached to a stationary observer in this spacetime. Using the spin precessions
we differentiate black holes from naked singularities. If the precession frequency becomes arbitrarily
large, as approaching to the central object in the quintessential field along any direction, then
the spacetime is a black hole. A spacetime will contain a naked singularity if the precession frequency
remains finite everywhere except at the singularity itself. Finally, we study the Lense-Thirring
precession frequency for RKBHs and the geodetic precession for KBHs.
