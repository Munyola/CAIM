The Schur functions play a crucial role in the modern description of HOMFLY polynomials for knots
and of topological vertices in DIM-based network theories, which could merge into a unified theory
still to be developed. The Macdonald functions do the same for hyperpolynomials and refined vertices,
but merging appears to be more problematic. For a detailed study of this problem, more knowledge
is needed about the Macdonald polynomials than is usually available. As a preparation for the discussion
of the knot/vertices relation, we summarize the relevant facts and open problems about the Macdonald
and, more generally, Kerov functions. Like Macdonald polynomials, they are triangular combinations
of Schur functions, but orthogonal in a more general scalar product. We explain that the parameters
of the measure can be considered as a set of new time variables, and the Kerov functions are actually
expressed through the Schur functions of these variables as well. Despite they provide an infinite-parametric
extension of the Schur and Macdonald polynomials, the Kerov functions, and even the skew Kerov functions
continue to satisfy the most important relations, like Cauchy summation formula, the transposition
identity for reflection of the Young diagram and expression of the skew functions through the generalized
Littlewood-Richardson structure constants. Since {\it these} are the properties important in
most applications, one can expect that the Kerov extension exists for most of them, from the superintegrable
matrix and tensor models to knot theory.
