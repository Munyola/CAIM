In this paper, we derive the formula for the Casimir interaction energy between a sphere and a plate
in $(D+1)$-dimensional Minkowski spacetime. It is assumed that the scalar field satisfies the
Dirichlet or Neumann boundary conditions on the sphere and the plate. As in the $D=3$ case, the formula
is of TGTG type. One of our main contributions is deriving the translation matrices which express
the change of bases between plane waves and spherical waves for general $D$. Using orthogonality
of Gegenbauer polynomials, it turns out that the final TGTG formula for the Casimir interaction
energy can be simplified to one that is similar to the $D=3$ case. To illustrate the application of
the formula, both large separation and small separation asymptotic behaviors of the Casimir interaction
energy are computed. The large separation leading term is proportional to $L^{-D+1}$ if the sphere
is imposed with Dirichlet boundary condition, and to $L^{-D-1}$ if the sphere is imposed with Neumann
boundary condition, where $L$ is distance from the center of the sphere to the plane. For the small
separation asymptotic behavior, it is shown that the leading term is equal to the one obtained using
proximity force approximation. The next-to-leading order term is also computed using perturbation
method. It is shown that when the space dimension $D$ is larger than 5, the next-to-leading order
has sign opposite to the leading order term. Moreover, the ratio of the next-to-leading order term
to the leading order term is linear in $D$, indicating a larger correction at higher dimensions.
