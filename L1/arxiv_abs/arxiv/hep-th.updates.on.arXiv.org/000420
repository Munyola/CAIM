In this work we study classical bouncing solutions in the context of f(R,T)=R+h(T) gravity in a flat
FLRW background using a perfect fluid as the only matter content. Our investigation is based on introducing
an effective fluid through defining effective energy density and pressure, we call this reformulation
as the "effective picture". These definitions have been already introduced to study the energy
conditions in f(R,T) gravity. We examine various models to which different effective equations
of state, corresponding to different h(T) functions, can be attributed. It is also discussed that
one can link between an assumed f(R,T) model in the effective picture and the theories with generalized
equation of state (EoS). We obtain cosmological scenarios exhibiting a nonsingular bounce before
and after which the Universe lives within a de-Sitter phase. We then proceed to find general solutions
for matter bounce and investigate their properties. We show that the properties of bouncing solution
in the effective picture of f(R,T) gravity are as follows: these solutions are without any future
singularities. It is possible that all energy conditions be respected by the real perfect fluid,
however, the null and the strong energy conditions can be violated by the effective fluid near the
bounce event. These solutions always correspond to a maximum in the real matter energy density and
a vanishing minimum in the effective density. The effective pressure varies between negative values
and may show either a minimum or a maximum.
