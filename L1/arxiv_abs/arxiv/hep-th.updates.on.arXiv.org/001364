We study the entanglement entropy (EE) and the R\'{e}nyi entropy (RE) of multiple intervals in two-dimensional
$T\overline{T}$-deformed conformal field theory (CFT) at finite temperature by field theoretic
and holographic methods. First, by the replica method with the twist operators, we construct the
general formula of the RE and EE up to the first order of a deformation parameter. By using our general
formula, we show that the EE of multiple intervals for a holographic CFT is just a summation of the
single interval case even with the small deformation. This is a non-trivial consequence from the
field theory perspective, though it may be expected by the Ryu-Takayanagi formula in holography.
However, the deformed RE of the two intervals is a summation of the single interval case only if the
separations between the intervals are big enough. It can be understood by the tension of the cosmic
branes dual to the RE. We also study the holographic EE for single and two intervals with an arbitrary
cut-off radius (dual to the $T\overline{T}$ deformation) at any temperature. We confirm our holographic
results agree with the field theory results with a small deformation and high temperature limit,
as expected. For two intervals, there are two configurations for EE: disconnected ($s$-channel)
and connected ($t$-channel) ones. We investigate the phase transition between them as we change
parameters: as the deformation or temperature increases the phase transition is suppressed and
the disconnected phase is more favored.
