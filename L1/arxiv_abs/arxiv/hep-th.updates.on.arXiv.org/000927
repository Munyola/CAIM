In this paper, we analyse the bosonic current densities induced by a magnetic flux running along
the core of an idealized cosmic string in a high-dimensional AdS spacetime, admitting that an extra
dimension coordinate is compactified. Additionally we admit the presence of a magnetic flux enclosed
by the compactified axis. In order to develop this analysis we calculate the complete set of normalized
bosonic wave-functions obeying a quasiperiodicity condition, with arbitrary phase $\beta$,
along the compactified extra dimension. In this context, only azimuthal and axial currents densities
take place. As to the azimuthal current, two contributions appear. The first one corresponds to
the standard azimuthal current in high-dimensional AdS spacetime with a cosmic string without
compactification while the second contribution is a new one, induced by the compactification itself.
The latter is an even function of the magnetic flux enclosed by the compactified axis and is an odd
function of the magnetic flux along its core with period equal to quantum flux, $\Phi_0=2\pi/e$.
On the other hand, the nonzero axial current density is an even function of the magnetic flux along
the core of the string and an odd function of the magnetic flux enclosed by the compactified axis.
We also find that the axial current density vanishes for untwisted and twisted bosonic fields in
the absence of the magnetic flux enclosed by the compactified axis. Some asymptotic expressions
for the current density are provided for specific limiting cases of the physical parameter of the
model.
