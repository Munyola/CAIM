In recent years, a close connection between supergravity, string effective actions and generalized
geometry has been discovered that typically involves a doubling of geometric structures. We investigate
this relation from the point of view of deformations of graded canonical Poisson structures and
derive the corresponding generalized geometry and gravity actions. We consider in particular
natural deformations based on a metric $g$, a 2-form $B$ and a scalar (dilaton) $\phi$ of the $2$-graded
symplectic manifold $T^{*}[2]T[1]M$. The corresponding deformed graded Poisson structure can
be elegantly expressed in terms of generalized vielbeins. It involves a flat Weitzenb\"ock-type
connection with torsion. The derived bracket formalism relates this structure to the generalized
differential geometry of a Courant algebroid, Christoffel symbols of the first kind and a connection
with non-trivial curvature and torsion on the doubled (generalized) tangent bundle $TM \oplus
T^{*}M$. Projecting onto tangent space, we obtain curvature invariants that reproduce the NS-NS
sector of supergravity in 10 dimensions. Other results include a fully generalized Dorfman bracket,
a generalized Lie bracket and new formulas for torsion and curvature tensors associated to generalized
tangent bundles. A byproduct is a unique Koszul-type formula for the torsion-full connection naturally
associated to a non-symmetric metric $g+B$. This resolves problems with ambiguities and inconsistencies
of more direct approaches to gravity theories with a non-symmetric metric.
