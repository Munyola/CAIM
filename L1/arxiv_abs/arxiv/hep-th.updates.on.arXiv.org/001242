We introduce a class of gapped three-dimensional models, dubbed "cage-net fracton models," which
host immobile fracton excitations in addition to non-Abelian particles with restricted mobility.
Starting from layers of two-dimensional string-net models, whose spectrum includes non-Abelian
anyons, we condense extended one-dimensional "flux-strings" built out of point-like excitations.
Flux-string condensation generalizes the concept of anyon condensation familiar from conventional
topological order and allows us to establish properties of the fracton ordered (equivalently,
flux-string condensed) phase, such as its ground state wave function and spectrum of excitations.
Through the examples of doubled Ising and SU(2)$_k$ cage-net models, we demonstrate the existence
of strictly immobile Abelian fractons and of non-Abelian particles restricted to move only along
one dimension. In the doubled Ising cage-net model, we show that these restricted-mobility non-Abelian
excitations are a fundamentally three-dimensional phenomenon, as they cannot be understood as
bound states amongst two-dimensional non-Abelian anyons and Abelian particles. We further show
that the ground state wave function of such phases can be understood as a fluctuating network of extended
objects -- cages -- and strings, which we dub a cage-net condensate. Besides having implications
for topological quantum computation in three dimensions, our work may also point the way towards
more general insights into quantum phases of matter with fracton order.
