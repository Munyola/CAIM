This is a continuation of a programme, initiated in the work arXiv:1706.05682 [hep-th], of supersymmetry-equivariant
geometrisation of the Green-Schwarz super-$(p+2)$-cocycles coupling to the topological charges
carried by super-$p$-branes of the superstring theory on reductive homogeneous spaces of supersymmetry
Lie supergroups. In the present part, the ideas and geometro-algebraic tools developed previously
are substantially enhanced, adapted to and applied in the physically significant curved backround
of Metsaev and Tseytlin, determining the propagation of the critical superstring in the super-${\rm
AdS}_5\times\mathbb{S}^5$ geometry. The analysis brings to the fore the r\^ole, in the geometrisation
scheme proposed, of the wrapping anomaly of the Poisson algebra of the Noether charges of the rigid
symmetries of the relevant super-{\sigma}-model that lift the geometric symmetries of the supertarget.
In particular, the significance of the charges quantifying the monodromy of the Grassmann-odd
coordinates in the Kosteleck\'y-Rabin-type quotient of the supertarget is emphasised. A trivial
super-1-gerbe is associated with the Metsaev-Tseytlin super-3-cocycle over the super-${\rm
AdS}_5\times\mathbb{S}^5$ target. The issue of compatibility of the geometrisation with the
\.In\"on\"u-Wigner contraction of the supersymmetry Lie superalgebra to its flat-superspace
counterpart is investigated at some length, revealing the rigidity of the relevant Cartan-Eilenberg
cohomology and signalling an attractive potential alternative to the non-contractible trivial
super-1-gerbe constructed.
