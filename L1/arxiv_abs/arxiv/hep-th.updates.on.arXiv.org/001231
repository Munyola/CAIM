Numerical simulations of Nambu-Goto cosmic strings in an expanding universe show that the loop
distribution relaxes to an universal configuration, the so-called scaling regime, which is of
power law shape on large scales. Precise estimations of the power law exponent are, however, still
matter of debate while numerical simulations do not incorporate all the radiation and backreaction
effects expected to affect the network dynamics at small scales. By using a Boltzmann approach,
we show that the steepness of the loop production function with respect to loops size is associated
with drastic changes in the cosmological loop distribution. For a scale factor varying as a(t)~t^nu,
we find that sub-critical loop production functions, having a Polchinski-Rocha exponent chi <
(3nu-1)/2, yield scaling loop distributions which are mostly insensitive to infra-red (IR) and
ultra-violet (UV) assumptions about the cosmic string network. For those, cosmological predictions
are expected to be relatively robust, in accordance with previous results. On the contrary, critical
and super-critical loop production functions, having chi >= (3nu-1)/2, are shown to be IR-physics
dependent and this generically prevents the loop distribution to relax towards scaling. In the
latter situation, we discuss the additional regularisations needed for convergence and show that,
although a scaling regime can still be reached, the shape of the cosmological loop distribution
is modified compared to the naive expectation. Finally, we discuss the implications of our findings.
