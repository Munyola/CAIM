We use analytic estimates and numerical simulations to explore the stochastic approach to vacuum
decay. According to this approach, the time derivative of a scalar field, which is in a local vacuum
state, develops a large fluctuation and the field \flies over" a potential barrier to another vacuum.
The probability distribution for the initial fluctuation is found quantum mechanically, while
the subsequent nonlinear evolution is determined by classical dynamics. We find in a variety of
cases that the rate of such flyover transitions has the same parametric form as that of tunneling
transitions calculated using the instanton method, differing only by a numerical factor O(1) in
the exponent. An important exception is an "upward" transition from a de Sitter vacuum to a higher-energy
de Sitter vacuum state. The rate of flyover transitions in this case is parametrically different
and can be many orders of magnitude higher than tunneling. This result is in conflict with the conventional
picture of quantum de Sitter space as a thermal state. Our numerical simulations indicate that the
dynamics of bubble nucleation in flyover transitions is rather different from the standard picture.
The difference is especially strong for thin-wall bubbles in flat space, where the transition region
oscillates between true and false vacuum until a true vacuum shell is formed which expands both inwards
and outwards, and for upward de Sitter transitions, where the inflating new vacuum region is contained
inside of a black hole.
