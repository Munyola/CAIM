Quantum fluctuation effects have an irrefutable role in high energy physics. Such fluctuation
can be often regarded as a correction of infrared (IR) limit. In this paper, the effects of the first-order
correction of entropy, caused by thermal fluctuation, on the thermodynamics of charged black holes
in gravity's rainbow will be discussed. It will be shown that such correction has profound contributions
to high energy limit of thermodynamical quantities, stability conditions of the black holes and
interestingly has no effect on thermodynamical phase transitions. The coupling between gravity's
rainbow and the first-order correction will be addressed. In addition, the measurement of entropy
as a function of fluctuation of temperature will be done and it will be shown that de Sitter (dS) case
enforces an upper limit on the values of temperature and produces cyclic like diagrams. While for
the anti-de Sitter (AdS) case, a lower limit on the entropy is provided and although for special cases
a cyclic like behavior could be observed, no upper or lower limit exists for the temperature. In addition,
a comparison between non-correction and correction included cases on the thermodynamical properties
of solutions will also be discussed and the effects of the first-order correction will be highlighted.
It will be shown that the first-order correction provides the solutions with larger classes of thermal
stability conditions which may result into existence of a larger number of thermodynamical structures
for the black holes.
