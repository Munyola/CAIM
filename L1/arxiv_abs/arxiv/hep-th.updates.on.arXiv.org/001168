Motivated by the study of indecomposable, nonsimple modules for a vertex operator algebra $V$,
we study the relationship between various types of $V$-modules and modules for the higher level
Zhu algebras for $V$, denoted $A_n(V)$, for $n \in \mathbb{N}$, first introduced by Dong, Li, and
Mason in 1998. We resolve some issues that arise in a few theorems previously presented when these
algebras were first introduced, and give examples illustrating the need for certain modifications
of the statements of those theorems. We establish that whether or not $A_{n-1}(V)$ is isomorphic
to a direct summand of $A_n(V)$ affects the types of indecomposable $V$-modules which can be constructed
by inducing from an $A_n(V)$-module, and in particular whether there are $V$-modules induced from
$A_n(V)$-modules that were not already induced by $A_0(V)$. We give some characterizations of
the $V$-modules that can be constructed from such inducings, in particular as regards their singular
vectors. To illustrate these results, we discuss two examples of $A_1(V)$: when $V$ is the vertex
operator algebra associated to either the Heisenberg algebra or the Virasoro algebra. For these
two examples, we show how the structure of $A_1(V)$ in relationship to $A_0(V)$ determines what
types of indecomposable $V$-modules can be induced from a module for the level zero versus level
one Zhu algebras. We construct a family of indecomposable modules for the Virasoro vertex operator
algebra that are logarithmic modules and are not highest weight modules.
