Teleparallel gravity and its popular generalization $f(T)$ gravity can be formulated as fully
invariant (under both coordinate transformations and local Lorentz transformations) theories
of gravity. Several misconceptions about teleparallel gravity and its generalizations can be
found in the literature, especially regarding their local Lorentz invariance. We describe how
these misunderstandings may have arisen and attempt to clarify the situation. In particular, the
central point of confusion in the literature appears to be related to the inertial spin connection
in teleparallel gravity models. While inertial spin connections are commonplace in special relativity,
and not something inherent to teleparallel gravity, the role of the inertial spin connection in
removing the spurious inertial effects within a given frame of reference is emphasized here. The
careful consideration of the inertial spin connection leads to the construction of a fully invariant
theory of teleparallel gravity and its generalizations. Indeed, it is the nature of the spin connection
that differentiates the relationship between what have been called good tetrads and bad tetrads
and clearly shows that, in principle, any tetrad can be utilized. The field equations for the fully
invariant formulation of teleparallel gravity and its generalizations are presented and a number
of examples using different assumptions on the frame and spin connection are displayed to illustrate
the covariant procedure. Various modified teleparallel gravity models are also briefly reviewed.
