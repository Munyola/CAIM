Primordial Black Holes (PBH) from peaks in the curvature power spectrum could constitute today
an important fraction of the Dark Matter in the Universe. At horizon reentry, during the radiation
era, order one fluctuations collapse gravitationally to form black holes and, at the same time,
generate a stochastic background of gravitational waves coming from second order anisotropic
stresses in matter. We study the amplitude and shape of this background for several phenomenological
models of the curvature power spectrum that can be embedded in waterfall hybrid inflation, axion,
domain wall, and boosts of PBH formation at the QCD transition. For a broad peak or a nearly scale invariant
spectrum, this stochastic background is generically enhanced by about one order of magnitude,
compared to a sharp feature. As a result, stellar-mass PBH from Gaussian fluctuations with a wide
mass distribution are already in strong tension with the limits from Pulsar Timing Arrays, if they
constitute a non negligible fraction of the Dark Matter. But this result is mitigated by the uncertainties
on the curvature threshold leading to PBH formation. LISA will have the sensitivity to detect or
rule out light PBH down to $10^{-14} M_{\odot}$. Upcoming runs of LIGO/Virgo and future interferometers
such as the Einstein Telescope will increase the frequency lever arm to constrain PBH from the QCD
transition. Ultimately, the future SKA Pulsar Timing Arrays could probe the existence of even a
single stellar-mass PBH in our Observable Universe.
