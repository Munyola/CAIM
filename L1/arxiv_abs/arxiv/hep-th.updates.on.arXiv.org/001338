We investigate how topological entanglement of Chern-Simons theory is captured in a string theoretic
realization. Our explorations are motivated by a desire to understand how quantum entanglement
of low energy open string degrees of freedom is encoded in string theory (beyond the oft discussed
classical gravity limit). Concretely, we realize the Chern-Simons theory as the worldvolume dynamics
of topological D-branes in the topological A-model string theory on a Calabi-Yau target. Via the
open/closed topological string duality one can map this theory onto a pure closed topological A-model
string on a different target space, one which is related to the original Calabi-Yau geometry by a
geometric/conifold transition. We demonstrate how to uplift the replica construction of Chern-Simons
theory directly onto the closed string and show that it provides a meaningful definition of reduced
density matrices in topological string theory. Furthermore, we argue that the replica construction
commutes with the geometric transition, thereby providing an explicit closed string dual for computing
reduced states, and Renyi and von Neumann entropies thereof. While most of our analysis is carried
out for Chern-Simons on S^3, the emergent picture is rather general. Specifically, we argue that
quantum entanglement on the open string side is mapped onto quantum entanglement on the closed string
side and briefly comment on the implications of our result for physical holographic theories where
entanglement has been argued to be crucial ingredient for the emergence of classical geometry.
