Lattice regularization is a standard technique for the nonperturbative definition of a quantum
theory of fields. Several approaches to the construction of a quantum theory of gravity adopt this
technique either explicitly or implicitly. A crucial complement to lattice regularization is
the process of renormalization through which a continuous description of the quantum theory arises.
I provide a comprehensive conceptual discussion of the renormalization of lattice-regularized
quantum gravity models. I begin with a presentation of the renormalization group from the Wilsonian
perspective. I then consider the application of the renormalization group in four contexts: quantum
field theory on a continuous nondynamical spacetime, quantum field theory on a lattice-regularized
nondynamical spacetime, quantum field theory of continuous dynamical spacetime, and quantum
field theory of lattice-regularized dynamical spacetime. The first three contexts serve to identify
successively the particular issues that arise in the fourth context. These issues originate in
the inescability of establishing all scales solely on the basis of the dynamics. While most of this
discussion rehearses established knowledge, the attention that I pay to these issues, especially
the previously underappreciated role of standard units of measure, is largely novel. I conclude
by briefly reviewing past studies of renormalization of lattice-regularized quantum gravity
models. In the second paper of this two-part series, I illustrate the ideas presented here by proposing
a renormalization group scheme for causal dynamical triangulations.
