We examine a generic field theory in which the field particle has two couplings. It is of particular
interest when these are the electroweak, e, and the hypothetical magnetoweak, g. The new field operators
are obtained by replacing the field operators $\Psi (x)$ of the standard model or of similar models
by $\tilde{\Psi} (x) D^j_q (m,m')$ where $ D^j_q (m,m')$ is an element of the $2j+1$ dimensional
representation of the SLq(2) algebra, which is also the knot algebra. The field is assumed to exist
in two phases distinguished by two values of $q$: $q_e = \frac{e}{g}$ and $q_g = \frac{g}{e}$ which
label the electroweak and magnetoweak phases respectively. We assume that the observed leptons
and quarks are composed of e-preons and are in agreement with the observed charge spectrum of leptons
and quarks. It is now proposed that there is also a g-phase where g-leptons and g-quarks are composed
of g-preons. It is assumed that the g-charge is very large compared to the e-charge and the mass of
the g charged particle is even larger since the mass of all of these particles is partially determined
by the eigenvalues of $\bar{D}^j_q (m,m') D_q^j (m,m')$, a polynomial in $q$, that multiplies the
Higgs mass term and where \begin{equation*} \frac{q_g}{q_e} = \left ( \frac{\hbar c}{e^2} \right)^2
\approx (137)^2. \end{equation*} These values of $q$ indicate that particles in the g-phase are
much more massive, they should be harder to produce or to observe.\\ \\ \emph{Keywords:} Quantum
