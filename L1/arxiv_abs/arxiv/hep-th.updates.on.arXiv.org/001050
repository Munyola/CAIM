The pseudo-conformal field theory (PCFT) is a 4-d action, which depends on the lorentzian Cauchy-Riemann
(LCR) structure. Like the 2-d Polyakov action, it does not depend on the metric tensor. But the invariance
under the pseudo-conformal transformations (in the terminology of E. Cartan and Tanaka) imposes
in the action the existence of a gauge field instead of the scalar field of the Polyakov action. The
tetrad of the LCR-structure defines a class of metrics and a corresponding class of self dual 2-forms.
I prove that the inverse is also valid. Einstein has showed that the equations of motion of the black-hole
essential singularities is a consequence of the regularity of the metric tensor. Hence its equivalence
with the LCR-structure implies that these equations assure the regularity of the LCR-structures.
This permit us to determine the multisolitons of the PCFT. After the expansion of the action around
the static LCR-structure soliton, the quadratic part of the Yang-Mills-like term implies a linear
partial differential equation (PDE). I solve this PDE using the Teukolsky method of solution of
the electromagnetic field in the background of the Kerr black hole. The angular and radial ODEs are
different to the corresponding Teukolsky master equations, permitting the possible identification
of the quark as a soliton bound state of the static LCR-structure and the gluon. These two results
opens up the possibility of the numerical computations of the standard model parameters and the
hadron form factors, permitting the experimental check of PCFT.
