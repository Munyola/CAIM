Tensor non-Gaussianity represents an important future probe of the physics of inflation. Inspired
by recent works, we elaborate further on the possibility of significant primordial tensor non-Gaussianities
sourced by extra fields during inflation. Unitarity constraints limit the impact of extra (spinning)
particle content by means of a lower bound on the corresponding mass spectrum. For spin-2 particles,
this takes the form of the well-known Higuchi bound. Massive ($m\gtrsim H$) particles will typically
decay during inflation unless they are non-minimally coupled to the inflaton sector: the inflating
field "lifts" the dynamics of the extra field(s), effectively getting around the limits imposed
by unitarity. There exist several models that realize such a mechanism, but we focus here on the set-up
of [1] where, through an EFT approach, one is able to capture the essential features common to an entire
class of theories. In the presence of an extra massive spin-2 particle, the interactions in the tensor
sector mimic very closely those in the scalar sector of quasi-single-field inflationary models.
We calculate the tensor bispectrum in different configurations and extract its dependence on the
extra tensor sound speed. We show in detail how one may obtain significant tensor non-Gaussianities
whose shape-function interpolates between local and equilateral, depending on the mass of the
extra field. We also estimate the LISA response functions to a tensor bispectrum supporting the
intermediate-type shapes we find.
