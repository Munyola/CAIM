We obtain topological black hole solutions in scalar-tensor gravity with nonminimal derivative
coupling between scalar and tensor components of gravity and power-law Maxwell field minimally
coupled to gravity. The obtained solutions can be treated as a generalization of previously derived
charged solutions with standard Maxwell action \cite{Feng_PRD16}. We examine the behaviour of
obtained metric functions for some asymptotic values of distance and coupling. To obtain information
about singularities of the metrics we calculate Kretschmann scalar. We also examine the behaviour
of gauge potential and show that it is necessary to impose some constraints on parameter of nonlinearity
in order to obtain reasonable behaviour of the filed. The next part of our work is devoted to the examination
of black hole's thermodynamics. Namely we obtain black hole's temperature and investigate it in
general as well as in some particular cases. To introduce entropy we use well known Wald procedure
which can be applied to quite general diffeomorphism-invariant theories. We also extend thermodynamic
phase space by introducing thermodynamic pressure related to cosmological constant and as a result
we derive generalized first law and Smarr relation. The extended thermodynamic variables also
allow us to construct Gibbs free energy and its examination gives important information about thermodynamic
stability and phase transitions. We also calculate heat capacity of the black holes which demonstrates
variety of behaviour for different values of allowed parameters.
