We study solutions of the Einstein-Skyrme model. Firstly we consider test field Skyrmions on the
Kerr background. These configurations -- hereafter dubbed Skerrmions -- can be in equilibrium
with a Kerr black hole (BH) by virtue of a synchronisation condition. We consider two sectors for
Skerrmions. In the sector with non-zero baryon charge, Skerrmions are akin to the known Skyrme solutions
on the Schwarzschild background. These `topological' configurations reduce to flat spacetime
Skyrmions in a vanishing BH mass limit; moreoever, they never become "small" perturbations on the
Kerr background: the non-linearities of the Skyrme model are crucial for all such Skerrmions. In
the non-topological sector, on the other hand, Skerrmions have no analogue on the Schwarzschild
background. Non-topological Skerrmions carry not baryon charge and bifurcate from a subset of
Kerr solutions defining an existence line. Therein the appropriate truncation of the Skyrme model
yield a linear scalar field theory containing a complex plus a real field, both massive and decoupled,
and the Skerrmions reduce to the known stationary scalar clouds around Kerr BHs. Moreover, non-topological
Skerrmions trivialise in the vanishing BH mass limit. We then discuss the backreaction of these
Skerrmions, that yield rotating BHs with synchronised Skyrme hair, which continously connect
to the Kerr solution (self-gravitating Skyrmions) in the non-topological (topological) sector.
In particular, the non-topological hairy BHs provide a non-linear realisation, within the Skyrme
model, of the synchronous stationary scalar clouds around Kerr.
