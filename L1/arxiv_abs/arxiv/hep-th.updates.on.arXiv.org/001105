Exact conformal field theories (CFTs) are obtained by using the approach of Poisson-Lie (PL) T-duality
in the presence of spectators. We explicitly construct some non-Abelian T-dual $\sigma$-models
(here as the PL T-duality on a semi-Abelian double) on $2+2$-dimensional target manifolds $M \approx
O \times \bf G$ and ${\tilde M} \approx O \times {\bf {\tilde G}}$, where $\bf G$ and ${\bf {\tilde
G}}$ as two-dimensional real non-Abelian and Abelian Lie groups act freely on $M$ and $\tilde M$,
respectively, while $O$ is the orbit of $\bf G$ in $M$. The findings of our study show that the original
models are equivalent to Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) models based on the Heisenberg $(H_4)$ and $GL(2,\mathbb{R})$
Lie groups. In this way, some new T-dual backgrounds for these WZW models are obtained. For one of
the duals of the $H_4$ WZW model, we show that the model is self-dual. In the case of the $GL(2,\mathbb{R})$
WZW model it is observed that the duality transformation changes the asymptotic behavior of solutions
from $AdS_{3} \times \mathbb{R}$ to flat space. Then, the structure and asymptotic nature of the
dual spacetime of this model including the horizon and singularity are determined. We furthermore
get the non-critical Bianchi type III string cosmological model with a non-vanishing field strength
from T-dualizable $\sigma$-models and show that this model describes an exact CFT (equivalent
to the $GL(2,\mathbb{R})$ WZW model). After that, the conformal invariance of T-dual models up
to two-loop order (first order in $\alpha'$) is discussed.
