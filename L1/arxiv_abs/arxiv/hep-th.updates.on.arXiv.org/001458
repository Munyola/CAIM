Paramagnetic spin systems with spontaneously broken spatial symmetries, such as valence bond
solid (VBS) phases, can host topological defects carrying non-trivial quantum numbers, which
enables the paradigm of deconfined quantum criticality. In this work, we study the properties of
topological defects in valence plaquette solid (VPS) phases on square and cubic lattices. We show
that the defects of the VPS order parameter, in addition to possessing non-trivial quantum numbers,
have fracton mobility constraints deep in the VPS phase, which has been overlooked previously.
The spinon inside a single vortex cannot move freely in any direction, while a dipolar pair of vortices
with spinon pairs can only move perpendicular to its dipole moment. These mobility constraints,
while they persist, can potentially inhibit the condensation of vortices and preclude a continuous
transition from the VPS to the N\'eel antiferromagnet. Instead, the VPS melting transition can
be driven by proliferation of spinon dipoles. For example, we argue that a $2d$ VPS can melt into a
stable gapless phase in the form of an algebraic bond liquid with algebraic correlations and long
range entanglement. Such a bond liquid phase yields a concrete example of the elusive $2d$ Bose metal
with symmetry fractionalization. We also study $3d$ valence plaquette and valence cube ordered
phase, and demonstrate that the topological defects therein also have fractonic dynamics. Possible
nearby phases after melting the valence plaquettes or cubes are also discussed.
