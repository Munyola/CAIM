Dark energy can modify the dynamics of dark matter if there exists a direct interaction between them.
Thus a measurement of the structure growth, e.g., redshift-space distortions (RSD), can be a powerful
tool to constrain the interacting dark energy (IDE) models. For the widely studied $Q=3\beta H\rho_{de}$
model, previous works showed that only a very small coupling ($\beta\sim\mathcal{O}(10^{-3})$)
can survive in current RSD data. However, all these analyses have to assume $w>-1$ and $\beta>0$
due to the existence of the large-scale instability in the IDE scenario. In our recent work [Phys.\
Rev.\ D {\bf 90}, 063005 (2014)], we successfully solved this large-scale instability problem
by establishing a parametrized post-Friedmann (PPF) framework for the IDE scenario. So we, for
the first time, have the ability to explore the full parameter space of the IDE models. In this work,
we reexamine the observational constraints on the $Q=3\beta H\rho_{de}$ model within the PPF framework.
By using the Planck data, the baryon acoustic oscillation data, the JLA sample of supernovae, and
the Hubble constant measurement, we get $\beta=-0.009^{+0.037}_{-0.034}$ ($1\sigma$). The
fit result becomes $\beta=-0.0147^{+0.0102}_{-0.0090}$ ($1\sigma$) once we further incorporate
the RSD data in the analysis. The error of $\beta$ is substantially reduced with the help of the RSD
data. Compared with the previous results, our results show that current observations actually
favor a negative $\beta$, and a relative larger interaction rate is permitted by current RSD data.
