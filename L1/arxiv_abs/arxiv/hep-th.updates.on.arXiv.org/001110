Feynman diagrams have been superseded as the tool of choice for calculating scattering amplitudes.
Various other methods are not only more efficient but also explicitly exhibit beautiful structures
obscured by Feynman diagrams. This thesis aims to lay some groundwork on how two of these methods,
ambitwistor strings and the double copy, can be generalised to scattering in curved backgrounds.
In the first part of this thesis, a heterotic ambitwistor string model coupled to a non-abelian background
gauge field is constructed. It is shown that after decoupling gravity this model is anomaly free
if and only if the background field is a solution to the Yang-Mills equations. A fixed gluon vertex
operator for the aforementioned heterotic model as well as a vertex operator encoding graviton,
B-field and dilaton for type II ambitwistor strings in a curved background are presented. It is shown
that they are BRST closed if and only if they correspond to physical on-shell states. In the second
part, sandwich plane waves are considered. It is shown that scattering of gluons and gravitons is
well defined on these backgrounds. 3-point amplitudes are calculated using quantum field theory
techniques and a double copy relation between gluons on a gauge theory plane wave and gravitons on
a gravitational plane wave is proposed. Using the results from the first part of this thesis, it is
then shown that curved background heterotic and type II ambitwistor string models correctly reproduce
these 3-point amplitudes on sandwich plane waves.
