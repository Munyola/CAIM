The spreading of entanglement in out-of-equilibrium quantum systems is currently at the centre
of intense interdisciplinary research efforts involving communities with interests ranging
from holography to quantum information. Here we provide a constructive and mathematically rigorous
method to compute the entanglement dynamics in a class of "maximally chaotic", periodically driven,
quantum spin chains. Specifically, we consider the so called "self-dual" kicked Ising chains initialised
in a class of separable states and devise a method to compute exactly the time evolution of the entanglement
entropies of finite blocks of spins in the thermodynamic limit. Remarkably, these exact results
are obtained despite the models considered are maximally chaotic: their spectral correlations
are described by the circular orthogonal ensemble of random matrices on all scales. Our results
saturate the so called "minimal cut" bound and are in agreement with those found in the contexts of
random unitary circuits with infinite-dimensional local Hilbert space and conformal field theory.
In particular, they agree with the expectations from both the quasiparticle picture, which accounts
for the entanglement spreading in integrable models, and the minimal membrane picture, recently
proposed to describe the entanglement growth in generic systems. Based on a novel "duality-based"
numerical method, we argue that our results describe the entanglement spreading from any product
state at the leading order in time when the model is non-integrable.
