Quantization of Free Fields: The non-interacting field belonging to a new {\bf SO(1,3)\/} gauge
field theory equivalent to General Relativity is canonically quantized in the Lorentz gauge and
the physical Fock space for free gauge particles is constructed. To assure both relativistic covariance
and positivity of the norm and energy expectation value for physical states restrictions needed
in the construction of the physical Fock space are put consequentially on state vectors, and not
on the algebra of creation and annihilation operators as usual - alltogether providing the second
step in consistently quantizing gravitation Proof of Renormalizability: A new SO(1,3) gauge field
theory classically equivalent to General Relativity is quantized and the gauge-fixed path integral
representation of the quantum effective action (QEA) is derived. Both the gauge-fixed classical
action and the QEA are shown to be invariant under nilpotent BRST variations of the gauge, matter,
ghost, antighost and Nakanishi-Lautrup fields defining the theory and a Zinn-Justin equation
constraining the QEA is derived. Dimensional analysis and the various linear constraints put on
the QEA plus the ones from the non-linear Zinn-Justin equation are deployed to demonstrate full
renormalizability such that all infinities appearing in a perturbative expansion of the QEA can
be absorbed into the gauge-fixed classical action solely by field renormalizations and coupling
redefinitions - alltogether providing the third step in consistently quantizing gravitation
