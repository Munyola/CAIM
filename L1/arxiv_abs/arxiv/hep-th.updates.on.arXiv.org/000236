We examine the evolution of cosmological perturbations in a non-thermal post-inflationary history
with a late-time matter domination period prior to BBN. Such a cosmology could arise naturally in
the well-motivated moduli scenario in the context of supersymmetry (SUSY) -- in particular in models
of Split-SUSY. Sub-horizon dark matter perturbations grow linearly during the matter dominated
phase before reheating and can lead to an enhancement in the growth of substructure on small scales,
even in the presence of dark matter annihilations. This suggests that a new scale (the horizon size
at reheating) could be important for determining the primordial matter power spectrum. However,
we find that in many non-thermal models free-streaming effects or kinetic decoupling after reheating
can completely erase the enhancement leading to small-scale structures. In particular, in the
moduli scenario with wino or higgsino dark matter we find that the dark matter particles produced
from moduli decays would thermalize with radiation and kinetically decouple below the reheating
temperature. Thus, the growth of dark matter perturbations is not sustained, and the predictions
for the matter power spectrum are similar to a standard thermal history. Exceptions exist but seem
to imply invoking exotic properties for dark matter. We conclude that although enhanced structure
does not provide a new probe for investigating the cosmic dark ages prior to BBN, it does suggest that
non-thermal histories offer a robust alternative to a strictly thermal post-inflationary history.
