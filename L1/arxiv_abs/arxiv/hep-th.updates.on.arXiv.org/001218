We investigate the relativistic properties under boost transformations of the $\kappa$-Poincar\'e
model with multiple causally connected interactions, both at the level of its formulation in momentum
space only and when it is endowed with a full phase space construction, provided by the relative locality
framework. Previous studies focussing on the momentum space picture showed that in presence of
just one interaction vertex the model is relativistic, provided that the boost parameter acting
on each given particle receives a "backreaction" from the momenta of the other particles that participate
in the interaction. Here we show that in presence of multiple causally-connected vertices the model
is relativistic if the boost parameter acting on each given particle receives a backreaction from
the total momentum of all the particles that are causally connected, even those that do not directly
enter the vertex. The relative locality framework constructs spacetime by defining a set of dual
coordinates to the momentum of each particle and interaction coordinates as Lagrange multipliers
that enforce momentum conservation at interaction events. We show that the picture is Lorentz invariant
if one uses an appropriate "total boost" to act on the particles' worldlines and on the interaction
coordinates. The picture we develop also allows for a reinterpretation of the backreaction as the
manifestation of the "total boost" action. Our findings provide the basis to consistently define
distant relatively boosted observers in the relative locality framework.
