We introduce and analyze a few examples of massless higher spin theories in Minkowski spacetime.
They are defined in terms of master fields, i.e. fields defined in the whole phase space. More specifically
we introduce the HS YM-like theories in any dimension and HS CS-like ones in any odd dimension, in
both Abelian and non-Abelian cases. These theories are invariant under gauge transformations
that include ordinary gauge transformations, diffeomorphisms and HS gauge transformations.
They are not at first sight invariant under local Lorentz transformations, but we show how this invariance
can be recovered. We explicitly write down the actions, the eom's as well as the (infinite many) conservation
laws in both HS YM and HS CS cases. Then we focus in particular on the HS YM models, we illustrate their
$L_\infty$ structure and perform their BRST quantization. We also introduce HS scalar and fermion
master fields and show that the Higgs mechanism can be realized also in the case of HS YM theories.
Next we start the discussion of the perturbative approach to quantization by means of Feynman diagrams.
We show that the dependence on the conjugate momentum can be absorbed in a redefinition of the component
fields, the coupling and the coordinates. The consequence is that a mass scale shows up. In such a
new frozen momentum framework, we carry out a sample calculation. Finally we show that these theories
do not respect a few basic hypotheses on which the no-go theorems on massless HS particles in flat
background rely.
