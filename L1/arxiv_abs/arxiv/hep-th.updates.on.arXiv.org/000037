We present a rigorous and functorial quantization scheme for linear fermionic and bosonic field
theory targeting the topological quantum field theory (TQFT) that is part of the general boundary
formulation (GBF). Motivated by geometric quantization, we generalize a previous axiomatic characterization
of classical linear bosonic field theory to include the fermionic case. We proceed to describe the
quantization scheme, combining a Fock space quantization for state spaces with the Feynman path
integral for amplitudes. We show rigorously that the resulting quantum theory satisfies the axioms
of the TQFT, in a version generalized to include fermionic theories. In the bosonic case we show the
equivalence to a previously developed holomorphic quantization scheme. Remarkably, it turns
out that consistency in the fermionic case requires state spaces to be Krein spaces rather than Hilbert
spaces. This is also supported by arguments from geometric quantization and by the explicit example
of the Dirac field theory. Contrary to intuition from the standard formulation of quantum theory,
we show that this is compatible with a consistent probability interpretation in the GBF. Another
surprise in the fermionic case is the emergence of an algebraic notion of time, already in the classical
theory, but inherited by the quantum theory. As in earlier work we need to impose an integrability
condition in the bosonic case for all TQFT axioms to hold, due to the gluing anomaly. In contrast,
we are able to renormalize this gluing anomaly in the fermionic case.
