We show how local constraints can globally "shatter" Hilbert space into subsectors, leading to
an unexpected dynamics with features reminiscent of both many body localization and quantum scars.
A crisp example of this phenomenon is provided by a "fractonic circuit" - a model of quantum circuit
dynamics in one dimension constrained to conserve both charge and dipole moment. We show how the
Hilbert space of the fractonic circuit dynamically fractures into disconnected emergent subsectors
within a particular charge and dipole symmetry sector. A large number of the emergent subsectors,
exponentially many in the size of the system, have dimension one and exhibit strictly localized
quantum dynamics---even in the absence of spatial disorder and in the presence of temporal noise.
Exponentially large localized subspaces can be proven to exist for any one dimensional fractonic
circuit with finite spatial range, and provide a potentially new route for the robust storage of
quantum information. Other emergent subsectors display non-trivial dynamics and may be constructed
by embedding finite sized non-trivial blocks into the localized subspace. The shattering of a particular
symmetry sector into a distribution of dynamical subsectors with varying sizes leads to the coexistence
of high and low entanglement states, i.e. this provides a general mechanism for the production of
quantum many body scars. We discuss the detailed pattern of fracturing and its implications. We
also discuss other mechanisms for similarly shattering Hilbert space.
