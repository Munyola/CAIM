The random matrix theory (RMT) can be used to classify both topological phases of matter and quantum
chaos. Here, we apply the random matrix theory (RMT) to classify the quantum chaos in the colored
SYK model first introduced by Gross and Rosenhaus. %(which may also be called Gross and Rosenhaus
model ). We focus on the two colored case and four colored case with balanced number of sites $ N $. By
identifying the maximal symmetries, the independent parity conservation sectors, the minimum
(irreducible) Hilbert space, and especially the relevant anti-unitary and unitary operators,
we show that the color degree of freedoms lead to novel quantum chaotic behaviours. When $ N $ is odd,
different symmetry operators need to be constructed to make the classifications complete. The
2 colored case only show 3-fold Wigner-Dyson (WD) way. The 4 colored case show 10-fold generalized
WD way which may also have non-trivial edge exponents. We also study 2 and 4 colored hybrid SYK models
which display many salient quantum chaotic features hidden in the corresponding pure SYK models.
We perform exact diagonalization to study both the bulk energy level statistics and the edge exponents
and find excellent agreements with our exact maximal symmetry classifications. Our complete and
systematic methods can be easily extended to study the generic imbalanced cases. They may be transferred
to the classifications of colored tensor models, quantum chromodynamics with pairings across
different colors, quantum black holes and interacting symmetry protected (or enriched) topological
phases.
