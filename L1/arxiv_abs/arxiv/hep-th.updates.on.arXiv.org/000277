This is a short review of string cosmology. We wish to connect string-scale physics as closely as
possible to observables accessible to current or near-future experiments. Our possible best hope
to do so is a description of inflation in string theory. The energy scale of inflation can be as high
as that of Grand Unification (GUT). If this is the case, this is the closest we can possibly get in energy
scales to string-scale physics. Hence, GUT-scale inflation may be our best candidate phenomenon
to preserve traces of string-scale dynamics. Our chance to look for such traces is the primordial
gravitational wave, or tensor mode signal produced during inflation. For GUT-scale inflation
this is strong enough to be potentially visible as a B-mode polarization of the cosmic microwave
background (CMB). Moreover, a GUT-scale inflation model has a trans-Planckian excursion of the
inflaton scalar field during the observable amount of inflation. Such large-field models of inflation
have a clear need for symmetry protection against quantum corrections. This makes them ideal candidates
for a description in a candidate fundamental theory like string theory. At the same time the need
of large-field inflation models for UV completion makes them particularly susceptible to preserve
imprints of their string-scale dynamics in the inflationary observables, the spectral index $n_s$
and the fractional tensor mode power $r$. Hence, we will focus this review on axion monodromy inflation
as a mechanism of large-field inflation in string theory.
