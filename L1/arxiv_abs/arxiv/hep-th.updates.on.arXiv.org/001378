The constraints on a general form for power-law potential in the framework of warm single field inflation
by means of Planck $2013$ and $2015$ will be investigated. By considering much less dynamic universe,
quasi-static evolutions, and also the well-known slow-roll conditions the regions which a binary
of our free parameters are in good agreement with Planck results will be obtained. The advantage
of this likelihood method is that instead of a set of free parameters we can visualize a region of free
parameters that can satisfy the precision limits on theoretical results. On the other side, when
we consider the preformed quantity for the amplitude of scalar perturbations the conflict between
obtained results for free parameters in different steps dramatically decreased. As done in flagship
literature, based on the friction of the environment, we can divide the primordial universe into
two different epochs namely weak and strong dissipative regimes. For the aforementioned eras,
the free parameters of the model will be constrained and the best regions will be obtained. To do so
the main inflationary observables such as tensor-to-scalar ratio, power-spectra of density perturbations
and gravitational waves, scalar and tensor spectral indices, running spectral index and the number
of e-folds in both weak and strong regimes will be obtained. Ultimately, it can be visualized this
model can make concord between theoretical results and data originated from cosmic microwave background
and Planck $2013$ and $2015$.
