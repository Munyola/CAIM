In this paper we shall study the inflationary aspects of a logarithmic corrected $R^2$ Starobinsky
inflation model, in the presence of a Kalb-Ramond field in the gravitational action of $F(R)$ gravity.
Our main interest is to pin down the effect of this rank two antisymmetric tensor field on the inflationary
phenomenology of the $F(R)$ gravity theory at hand. The effects of the Kalb-Ramond field are expected
to be strong during the inflationary era, however as the Universe expands, the energy density of
the Kalb-Ramond field scales as $\sim a^{-6}$ so dark matter and radiation dominate over the Kalb-Ramond
field effects. In general, antisymmetric fields constitute the field content of superstring theories,
and thus their effect at the low-energy limit of the theory is expected to be significant. As we will
show, for a flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker metric, the Kalb-Ramond field actually reduces to
a scalar field, so it is feasible to calculate the observational indices of inflation. We shall calculate
the spectral index and the tensor-to-scalar ratio for the model at hand, by assuming two conditions
for the resulting Kalb-Ramond scalar field, the slow-roll and the constant-roll condition. As
we shall demonstrate, in both the slow-roll and constant-roll cases, compatibility with the latest
observational data can be achieved. Also the effect of the Kalb-Ramond field on the inflationary
phenomenology is to increase the amount of the predicted primordial gravitational radiation,
in comparison to the corresponding $f(R)$ gravities, however the results are still compatible
with the observational data.
