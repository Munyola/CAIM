Picard-Lefschetz theory is applied to solutions of the Helmholtz equation, formulated in terms
of sums of integrals of a proper-time, or `einbein', wave function $\Psi(\Lambda) = \exp(i\mathbb
S(\Lambda))$ along complex contours bounded by essential singularities of $\Psi$, or poles of
$\mathbb S$. There is a one to one map between steepest descent paths connecting poles, also known
as Lefschetz thimbles, and both real and complex eigenrays. Residues of poles at finite $\Lambda$
always vanish at some spatial points, which correspond to the location of a source if only one Lefschetz
thimble is bounded at the pole. If there are two oppositely oriented contours ending at a pole, points
of vanishing residue are not source locations, but are argued to be the locus on which caustic curves
may have singularities such as cusps. The map between $\mathbb S$ and the generating function in
the Thom--Arnold classification of catastrophes is discussed. Monodromies of the solution set
with respect to complexified parameters defining the index of refraction, or spatial endpoints
of Green's functions, are trivially determined from the singularities of $\mathbb S$. We construct
a variant of a Laurent series expansion of $\mathbb S$ about the poles at finite $\Lambda$. Expressions
for the coefficients of each order in this expansion can often be given exactly, even for an index
of refraction which is not a simple quadratic polynomial. Based on the Laurent series expansion,
we propose a variation of a Pad\'e approximant for $\mathbb S$, arguing for its efficacy well beyond
the neighborhood of any particular pole.
