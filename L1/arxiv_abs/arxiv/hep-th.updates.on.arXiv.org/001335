We study the OPE coefficients $c_{\Delta, J}$ for heavy-light scalar four-point functions, which
can be obtained holographically from the two-point function of a light scalar of some non-integer
conformal dimension $\Delta_L$ in an AdS black hole. For a pure gravity black hole, we find an inconsistency,
namely $c_{d,0}\neq 0$ in $d>4$. This motivates us to consider black holes involving matter fields
as well. We first consider general charged AdS black holes and we give some explicit low-lying examples
of the OPE coefficients. We also obtain the recursion formula for the lowest-twist OPE coefficients
with at most two current operators. For integer $\Delta_L$, although the OPE coefficients are not
fully determined, we set up a framework to read off the coefficients $\gamma_{\Delta,J}$ of the
$\log(z\bar{z})$ terms that are associated with the anomalous dimensions of the exchange operators
and obtain a general formula for $\gamma_{\Delta,J}$. We then consider charged AdS black holes
in gauged supergravity STU models in $D=5$ and $D=7$, and their higher-dimensional generalizations.
The scalar fields in the STU models are conformally massless, dual to light operators with $\Delta_L=d-2$.
We derive the linear perturbation of such a scalar in the STU charged AdS black holes and obtain the
explicit OPE coefficient $c_{d-2,0}$. The inconsistency of $c_{d,0}\ne 0$ however persists in
all above examples for $d>4$. Finally, we analyse the asymptotic properties of scalar hairy AdS
black holes and show how this inconsistency can be resolved in these backgrounds.
