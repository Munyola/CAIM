We give an explicit example of a composite Higgs model with a pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone Higgs in which
the top Yukawa coupling is generated via the partial compositeness mechanism. This mechanism requires
composite top partners which are relatively light compared to the typical mass scale of the strongly
coupled theory. While most studies of the phenomenology of such models have focused on a bottom-up
approach with a minimal effective theory, a top-down approach suggests that that the theory should
contain a limit in which an unbroken global chiral symmetry protects the mass of the top partners,
and the spectrum of the partners satisfies `t Hooft matching conditions. We therefore consider
a model for the UV gauge group which could provide a solution to the matching conditions, and note
that the relatively light fermions and pseudo-Goldstone bosons fall into complete multiplets
of a large approximate global symmetry. This implies that the spectrum of particles lighter than
a few TeV is non-minimal. Our example illustrates likely features of a composite Higgs theory, and
also serves as an example of a non-chiral theory with no sign problem and a possible solution to `t
Hooft matching conditions. It would therefore be very interesting for a lattice exploration. We
find in this example that for some low-energy parameters in the effective theory the top partners
can decay into high multiplicity final states, which could be difficult for the Large Hadron Collider
(LHC) to constrain. This may potentially allow for the top partners to be lighter than those in more
minimal models.
