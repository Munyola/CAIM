In this article we show that the BPS equations of vortex with nonzero internal pressure obtained
in~\cite{Atmaja:2015lia} for the generalized Maxwell-Higgs model can also be derived using the
BPS Lagrangian method developed in~\cite{Atmaja:2015umo}. Two additional terms are added into
the original BPS Lagrangian $L_{BPS}=\int dQ$, that is total derivative term, which are proportional
to square of first-derivative of the scalar effective field, $f'(r)$, and a function that depends
only on the scalar effective field. These additional terms produce additional constraint equations
coming from Euler-Lagrange equations of the BPS Lagrangian. We apply this procedure for the generalized
Born-Infeld-Higgs model and show that the total static energy, for the corresponding BPS equations,
is finite if the scalar potential is bounded from above by $V< 2b^2$, with $b$ is the Born-Infeld parameter.
We also compute the energy-momentum tensor and show that the pressure densities in radial and angular
directions are nonzero. Furthermore we show that the conservation of energy-momentum does not
produce new constraint equation. We do the numerical analysis and found that for a large class of
solutions the scalar and gauge effetive fields, $f(r)$ and $a(r)$, behave nicely near the origin,
but unfortunately they are infinite near the boundary. We suggest that adding gravity field into
the action might cure this problem. Other resolutions might be appeared in higher dimensional models
and we expect that the BPS Lagrangian method could be used to find BPS equations for other solitons
with nonzero internal pressure.
