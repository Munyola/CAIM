We study the matter perturbations of a new AdS wormhole in (3+1)-dimensional Einstein-Born-Infeld
gravity, called "natural wormhole", which does not require exotic matters. We discuss the stability
of the perturbations by numerically computing the quasi-normal modes (QNMs) of a massive scalar
field in the wormhole background. We investigate the dependence of quasi-normal frequencies on
the mass of scalar field as well as other parameters of the wormhole. It is found that the perturbations
are always stable for the wormhole geometry which has the general relativity (GR) limit when the
scalar field mass m satisfies a certain, tachyonic mass bound m^2 > m^2_* with m^2_* < 0, analogous
to the Breitenlohner-Freedman (BF) bound in the global-AdS space, m^2_BF = 3 Lambda/4. It is also
found that the BF-like bound m^2_* shifts by the changes of the cosmological constant Lambda or angular-momentum
number l, with a level crossing between the lowest complex and pure-imaginary modes for zero angular
momentum l = 0. Furthermore, it is found that the unstable modes can also have oscillatory parts as
well as non-oscillatory parts depending on whether the real and imaginary parts of frequencies
are dependent on each other or not, contrary to arguments in the literature. For wormhole geometries
which do not have the GR limit, the BF-like bound does not occur and the perturbations are stable for
arbitrary tachyonic and non-tachyonic masses, up to a critical mass m^2_c > 0 where the perturbations
are completely frozen.
