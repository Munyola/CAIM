The Ad Hoc Committee on SETI Nomenclature was convened at the suggestion of Frank Drake after the
Decoding Alien Intelligence Workshop at the SETI Institute in March 2018. The purpose of the committee
was to recommend standardized definitions for terms, especially those that are used inconsistently
in the literature and the scientific community. The committee sought to recommend definitions
and terms that are a compromise among several desirable but occasionally inconsistent properties
for such terms: 1) Consistency with the historical literature and common use in the field; 2) Consistency
with the present literature and common use in the field; 3) Precision of meaning; 4) Consistency
with the natural (i.e. everyday, non-jargon) meanings of terms; 5) Compatibility with non-English
terms and definitions. The definitions in this report are restricted to technical, SETI contexts,
where they may have jargon senses different from their everyday senses. In many cases we include
terms only to deprecate them (in the sense of "to withdraw official support for or discourage the
use of...in favor of a newer or better alternative", Merriam-Webster sense 4). This is a consensus
document that the committee members all endorse; however, in many cases the individual members
have (or have expressed in the past) more nuanced opinions on these terms that are not fully reflected
here, for instance Alm\'ar (2008, Acta Astronautica, 68, 351), Denning (2008, NASA-SP-2009-4802
Ch. 3 pp.63-124), and Wright (2018, arXiv:1803.06972).
