Magnetorotational instability (MRI) is one of the fundamental processes in astrophysics, driving
angular momentum transport and mass accretion in a wide variety of cosmic objects. Despite much
theoretical/numerical and experimental efforts over the last decades, its saturation mechanism
and amplitude, which sets the angular momentum transport rate, remains not well understood, especially
in the limit of high resistivity, or small magnetic Prandtl numbers typical to interiors of protoplanetary
disks, liquid cores of planets and liquid metals in laboratory. We investigate the nonlinear development
and saturation properties of the helical magnetorotational instability (HMRI) in a magnetized
Taylor-Couette flow using direct numerical simulations. From the linear theory of HMRI, it is known
that the Elsasser number, or interaction parameter plays a special role for its dynamics and determines
its growth rate. We show that this parameter is also important in the nonlinear problem. By increasing
its value, a sudden transition from weakly nonlinear, where the system is slightly above the linear
stability threshold, to turbulent regime occurs. We calculate the azimuthal and axial energy spectra
corresponding to these two regimes and show that they differ qualitatively. Remarkably, the nonlinear
states remain in all cases nearly axisymmetric suggesting that HMRI turbulence is quasi two-dimensional
in nature. Although the contribution of non-axisymmetric modes increases moderately with the
Elsasser number, their total energy remains much smaller than that of the axisymmetric ones.
