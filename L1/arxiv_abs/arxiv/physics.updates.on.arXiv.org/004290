Understanding network topology is a fundamental aspect of network science that allows us to gather
insights into the complicated relational architectures of the world we inhabit. We provide a first
specific study of neighbourhood degree sequences in complex networks, revealing new insights
into real-world connectivity patterns. Particularly, we consider how to explicitly characterise
important physical concepts such as symmetry, organisation and complexity in neighbourhood degree
sequences. This entails the development of novel network indices which we apply to a comprehensive
array of graph models and real-world networks. We find that these indices are neither highly correlated
with each other nor with classical network indices, revealing a rich, new area of analysis in network
topology. Neighbourhood degree sequences of a wide variety of real world networks are found to be
more symmetric, organised and complex than is expected for networks of their given degree distributions.
Notably, social and biological networks show consistently higher levels of neighbourhood organisation
than expected by random chance, while only the former shows consistent hierarchical complexity.
Evidence suggests web hyperlink networks have the greatest relative levels of neighbourhood organisation
and symmetry and ecological networks have the greatest relative levels of hierarchical complexity.
The versatility of this newly recognised topologically descriptive tool shows potential for describing
the unique characteristics of complex networks.
