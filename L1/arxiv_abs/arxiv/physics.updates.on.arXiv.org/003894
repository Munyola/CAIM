Low-loss electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) in the scanning transmission electron microscope
(STEM) probes the valence electron density and relevant optoelectronic properties such as band
gap energies and other band structure transitions. The measured spectra can be formulated in a dielectric
theory framework, comparable to optical spectroscopies and ab-initio simulations. Moreover,
Kramers-Kronig analysis (KKA), an inverse algorithm based on the homonym relations, can be employed
for the retrieval of the complex dielectric function (CDF). However, spurious contributions traditionally
not considered in this framework typically impact low-loss EELS modifying the spectral shapes
and precluding the correct measurement and retrieval of the dielectric information. A relativistic
KKA algorithm is able to account for the bulk and surface radiative-loss contributions to low-loss
EELS, revealing the correct dielectric properties. Using a synthetic low-loss EELS model, we propose
some modifications on the naive implementation of this algorithm that broadens its range of application.
The robustness of the algorithm is improved by regularization, appliying previous knowledge about
the shape and smoothness of the correction term. Additionally, our efficient numerical integration
methodology allows processing hyperspectral datasets in a reasonable amount of time. Harnessing
these abilities, we show how simultaneous relativistic KKA processing of several spectra can share
information to produce an improved result.
