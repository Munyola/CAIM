Recently, a complex-network based method of Visibility-Graph has been applied to confirm the scale-freeness
and the fractal properties of the process of multiplicity fluctuation. Experiments have been carried
out over the data of hadron-nucleus and nucleus-nucleus interactions and then analysing the values
Power-of-Scale-freeness-of-Visibility-Graph-PSVG parameter extracted from the Graphs constructed
from the data[1],[2]. Motivated by the inspiring findings acquired from these studies, in this
work, the relativistic nucleus-nucleus interaction data has been analysed extensively for collective-anisotropic-flow
by extending the Visibility-Graph approach and extracting the Average-clustering-co-efficient(one
of the important topological parameters) from the graph and then azimuthal-distributions corresponding
to different rapidity-regions around the central-rapidity are analysed utilising the parameter.
Average-clustering-co-efficient has the usual significance with respect to complex-network
systems. Here we attempted to correlate its physical significance with some fundamental notions
of particle production phenomenology, like clustering and correlation. Earlier methods for detecting
anisotropy in azimuthal-distribution, were mostly based on the analysis of statistical fluctuation.
In this work, we have attempted to analyse collective-anisotropic-flow by analysing the azimuthal-distribution
using a poles apart, rigorous approach of complex-network perspective which gives more deterministic
information on the anisotropy in azimuthal-distribution by means of precise topological parameter.
