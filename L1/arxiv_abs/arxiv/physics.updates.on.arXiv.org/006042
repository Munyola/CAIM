Munk (1966) showed that the deep (1000-3000 m) vertical temperature profile is consistent with
a one-dimensional vertical advection-diffusion balance, with a constant upwelling and an interior
diapycnal diffusivity of $\mathcal{O}(10^{-4})$ m$^{2}$ s$^{-1}$. However, typical observed
diffusivities in the interior are $\mathcal{O}(10^{-5})$ m$^{2}$ s$^{-1}$. Recent work suggested
that the deep stratification is set by Southern Ocean (SO) isopycnal slopes, fixed by SO eddies,
that communicate the surface outcrop positions to the deep ocean. It is shown here, using an idealized
ocean general circulation model, that SO eddies alone cannot lead to the observed exponential temperature
profile, and that interior mixing must contribute. Strong diapycnal mixing concentrated near
the ocean boundaries is shown to be balanced locally by upwelling. A one-dimensional Munk-like
balance in these boundary mixing areas, although with much larger mixing and upwelling, leads to
an exponential deep temperature stratification, which propagates via isopycnal mixing to the
ocean interior. The exponential profile is robust to vertical variations in the vertical velocity,
and persists despite the observed weak interior diapycnal mixing. Southern Ocean eddies link the
surface water mass transformation by air-sea fluxes with the deep stratification, but the eddies
do not determine the stratification itself. These results reconcile the observed exponential
interior deep temperature stratification, the weak diapycnal diffusivity observed in tracer
release experiments, and the role of Southern Ocean dynamics.
