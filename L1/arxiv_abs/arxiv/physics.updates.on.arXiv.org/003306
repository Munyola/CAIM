Many-body perturbation theory (MBPT) is widely used in quantum physics, chemistry, and materials
science. At the heart of MBPT is the Feynman diagrammatic expansion, which is, simply speaking,
an elegant way of organizing the combinatorially growing number of terms of a certain Taylor expansion.
In particular, the construction of the `bold Feynman diagrammatic expansion' involves the partial
resummation to infinite order of possibly divergent series of diagrams. This procedure demands
investigation from both the combinatorial (perturbative) and the analytical (non-perturbative)
viewpoints. In Part II of this two-part series, we approach the analytical investigation of the
bold diagrammatic expansion in the simplified setting of Gibbs measures (known as the Euclidean
lattice field theory in the physics literature). Using non-perturbative methods, we rigorously
construct the Luttinger-Ward formalism for the first time, and we prove that the bold diagrammatic
series can be obtained directly via an asymptotic expansion of the Luttinger-Ward functional,
circumventing the partial resummation technique. Moreover we prove that the Dyson equation can
be derived as the Euler-Lagrange equation associated with a variational problem involving the
Luttinger-Ward functional. We also establish a number of key facts about the Luttinger-Ward functional,
such as its transformation rule, its form in the setting of the impurity problem, and its continuous
extension to the boundary of the domain of physical Green's functions.
