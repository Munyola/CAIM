Using particle-in-cell simulations of relativistic laser plasma wakes in the presence of an external
magnetic field, we demonstrate that there exists a parameter window where the dynamics of the magnetized
wake channel are largely independent of the laser wavelength $\lambda_{\rm las}$. One condition
for this manifestation of "limited similarity" is that the electron density $n_{\rm e}$ is highly
subcritical, so that the plasma does not affect the laser. The freedom to choose a convenient laser
wavelength can be useful in experiments and simulations. In simulations, an up-scaled wavelength
(and, thus, a coarser mesh and larger time steps) reduces the computational effort, while limited
similarity ensures that the overall structure and evolutionary phases of the wake channel are preserved.
In our demonstrative example, we begin with a terrawatt$\cdot$picosecond pulse from a ${\rm CO}_2$
laser with $\lambda_{\rm las} = 10\,\mu{\rm m}$, whose field reaches a relativistic amplitude
at the center of a sub-millimeter-sized focal spot. The laser is shot into a sparse deuterium gas
($n_{\rm e} \sim 10^{13}\,{\rm cm}^{-3}$) in the presence of a tesla-scale magnetic field. Limited
similarity is demonstrated in 2D for $4\,\mu{\rm m} \leq \lambda_{\rm las} \leq 40\,\mu{\rm m}$
and is expected to extend to shorter wavelengths. Assuming that this limited similarity also holds
in 3D, increasing the wavelength to $40\,\mu{\rm m}$ enables us to simulate the after-glow dynamics
of the wake channel all the way into the nanosecond regime.
