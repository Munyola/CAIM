We have developed the concept of pathway assembly to explore the amount of extrinsic information
required to build an object. To quantify this information in an agnostic way, we present a method
to determine the amount of pathway assembly information contained within such an object by deconstructing
the object into its irreducible parts, and then evaluating the minimum number of steps to reconstruct
the object along any pathway. The mathematical formalisation of this approach uses an assembly
space. By finding the minimal number of steps contained in the route by which the objects can be assembled
within that space, we can compare how much information (I) is gained from knowing this pathway assembly
index (PA) according to I_PA=log (|N|)/(|N_PA |) where, for an end product with PA=x, N is the set
of objects possible that can be created from the same irreducible parts within x steps regardless
of PA, and NPA is the subset of those objects with the precise pathway assembly index PA=x. Applying
this formalism to objects formed in 1D, 2D and 3D space allows us to identify objects in the world or
wider Universe that have high assembly numbers. We propose that objects with PA greater than a threshold
are important because these are uniquely identifiable as those that must have been produced by biological
or technological processes, rather than the assembly occurring via unbiased random processes
alone. We think this approach is needed to help identify the new physical and chemical laws needed
to understand what life is, by quantifying what life does.
