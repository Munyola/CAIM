In this work, the development and implementation of the effective stochastic potential (ESP) method
is presented to perform efficient conformational sampling of molecules. The overarching goal
of this work is to alleviate the computational bottleneck associated with performing a large number
of electronic structure calculations required for conformational sampling. We introduce the
concept of a deformation potential and demonstrate its existence by the proof-by-construction
approach. A statistical description of the fluctuations in the deformation potential due to non-zero
temperature was obtained using infinite-order moment expansion of the distribution. The formal
mathematical definition of the ESP was derived using functional minimization approach to match
the infinite-order moment expansion for the deformation potential. Practical implementation
of the ESP was obtained using the random-matrix theory method. The developed method was applied
to two proof-of-concept calculations of the distribution of HOMO-LUMO gap in the water molecule
and solvated CdSe clusters at 300K. The need for large sample size to obtain statistically meaningful
results was demonstrated by performing $10^5 $ ESP calculations. The results from these prototype
calculations demonstrated the efficacy of the ESP method for performing efficient conformational
sampling. We envision that the fundamental nature of this work will not only extend our knowledge
of chemical systems at non-zero temperatures but will also generate new insights for innovative
technological applications.
