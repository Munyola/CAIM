The idea of using fragment embedding to circumvent the high computational scaling of accurate electronic
structure methods while retaining high accuracy has been a long-standing goal for quantum chemists.
Traditional fragment embedding methods mainly focus on systems composed of weakly correlated
parts and are insufficient when division across chemical bonds is unavoidable. Recently, density
matrix embedding theory (DMET) and other methods based on the Schmidt decomposition have emerged
as a fresh approach to this problem. Despite their success on model systems, these methods can prove
difficult for realistic systems because they rely on either a rigid, non-overlapping partition
of the system or a specification of some special sites (i.e. `edge' and `center' sites), neither
of which is well-defined in general for real molecules. In this work, we present a new Schmidt decomposition-based
embedding scheme called Incremental Embedding that allows the combination of arbitrary overlapping
fragments without the knowledge of edge sites. This method forms a convergent hierarchy in the sense
that higher accuracy can be obtained by using fragments involving more sites. The computational
scaling for the first few levels is lower than that of most correlated wave function methods. We present
results for several small molecules in atom-centered Gaussian basis sets and demonstrate that
Incremental Embedding converges quickly with fragment size and recovers most static correlation
in small basis sets even when truncated at the second lowest level.
