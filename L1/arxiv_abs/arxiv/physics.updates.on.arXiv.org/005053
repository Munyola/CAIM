Direct numerical simulations of homogeneous sheared and stably stratified turbulence are considered
to probe the asymptotic high-dynamic range regime suggested by Gargett et al. 1984 and Shih et al.
2005. We consider statistically stationary configurations of the flow that span three decades
in dynamic range defined by the separation between the Ozmidov length scale, $L_O=\sqrt{\epsilon/N^3}$,
and the Kolmogorov length scale, $L_K=(\nu^3/\epsilon)^{1/4}$, up to $\mathrm{Re_b}\equiv
(L_O/L_K)^{4/3}=\epsilon/(\nu N^2) \sim O(1000)$, where $\epsilon$ is the mean turbulent kinetic
energy dissipation rate, $\nu$ is the kinematic viscosity, and $N$ is the buoyancy frequency. We
isolate the effects of $\mathrm{Re_b}$, particularly on irreversible mixing, from the effects
of other flow parameters of stratified and sheared turbulence. Specifically, we evaluate the influence
of dynamic range independent of initial conditions. We present evidence that the flow approaches
an asymptotic state for $\mathrm{Re_b}\gtrapprox 300$, characterized both by an asymptotic partitioning
between the potential and kinetic energies and by the approach of components of the dissipation
rate to their expected values under the assumption of isotropy. As $\mathrm{Re_b}$ increases above
100, there is a slight decrease in the turbulent flux coefficient $\Gamma=\chi/\epsilon$, where
$\chi$ is the dissipation rate of buoyancy variance, but, for this flow, there is no evidence of the
commonly suggested $\Gamma \propto \mathrm{Re_b}^{-1/2}$ dependence when $100 \leq \mathrm{Re_b}
\leq 1000$.
