This study considers the linear stability of Poiseuille-Rayleigh-B\'enard flows, subjected
to a transverse magnetic field to understand the instabilities that arise from the complex interaction
between the effects of shear, thermal stratification and magnetic damping. This fundamental study
is motivated in part by the desire to enhance heat transfer in the blanket ducts of nuclear fusion
reactors. In pure MHD flows, the imposed transverse magnetic field causes the flow to become quasi-2D
and exhibit disturbances that are localised to the horizontal walls. However, the vertical temperature
stratification in Rayleigh-B\'enard flows feature convection cells that occupy the interior
region and therefore the addition of this aspect provides an interesting point for investigation.
The linearised governing equations are described by the \qtwod\ model proposed by Sommeria and
Moreau (1982) which incorporates a Hartmann friction term, and the base flows are considered fully
developed and 1D. The neutral stability curves for critical Reynolds and Rayleigh numbers, $Re_c$
and $Ra_c$, respectively, as functions of Hartmann friction parameter $H$ have been obtained over
$10^{-2}\leq H\leq10^4$. Asymptotic trends are observed as $H\rightarrow\infty$ following
$Re_c\propto H^{\,1/2}$ and $Ra_c\propto H$. The linear stability analysis reveals multiple
instabilities which alter the flow both within the Shercliff boundary layers and the interior flow,
with structures consistent with features from plane Poiseuille and Rayleigh-B\'enard flows.
