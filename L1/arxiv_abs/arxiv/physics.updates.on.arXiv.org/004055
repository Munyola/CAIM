We have calculated by using CARI-7A the effective and ambient radiation doses absorbed by a reference
human phantom inside aircrafts with cruise speed, and averaged ascent/descent rates as presented
by real airplanes such as: Airbus 380, Boeing 777, 787, Hercules C-130 and Twin Otter DHC-6. The sample
is composed of fifteen flight aerial routes, from which twelve are the longest non-stop flight routes
around the world, where four flights pass over the Arctic and additionally we have considered three
air routes involving the Antarctica. The Earth curvature was taking into account for points in the
constructed flight routes, by using the INVERSE3D software, which is based on the model WGS84. We
also have constructed radiation dose charts according to the radiometric results coming from CARI-7A
simulations. These charts present the effective absorbed radiation dose as a function of the flight
level and the flight time in a year of normal operations of the crew as recommended by FAA. For the flights
sample considered here, we found the top seven rate irradiated flights of the sample, and for the
leading rate irradiated flight, we fit for altitudes and found an inequation that gives a superior
threshold for any flight of the sample and perhaps on Earth, valid in interval [20000, 50000] ft and
[0, 1000] h. Finally we discuss about the threshold values for absorption of radiation, the flight
hours per year, and the model of statistical radiation and tissue weights established by the ICRP-103
and its relation with the radiation charts for aviation shown in this work.
