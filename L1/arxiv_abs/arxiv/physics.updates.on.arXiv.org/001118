The vertical heat transfer in B\'enard-Marangoni convection of a fluid layer with infinite Prandtl
number is studied by means of upper bounds on the Nusselt number $Nu$ as a function of the Marangoni
number $Ma$. Using the background method for the temperature field, it has recently been proven
by Hagstrom & Doering that $ Nu\leq 0.838\,Ma^{2/7}$. In this work we extend previous background
method analysis to include balance parameters and derive a variational principle for the bound
on $Nu$, expressed in terms of a scaled background field, that yields a better bound than Hagstrom
& Doering's formulation at a given $Ma$. Using a piecewise-linear, monotonically decreasing profile
we then show that $Nu \leq 0.803\,Ma^{2/7}$, lowering the previous prefactor by 4.2%. However,
we also demonstrate that optimisation of the balance parameters does not affect the asymptotic
scaling of the optimal bound achievable with Hagstrom & Doering's original formulation. We subsequently
utilise convex optimisation to optimise the bound on $Nu$ over all admissible background fields,
as well as over two smaller families of profiles constrained by monotonicity and convexity. The
results show that $Nu \leq O(Ma^{2/7}(\ln Ma)^{-1/2})$ when the background field has a non-monotonic
boundary layer near the surface, while a power-law bounds with exponent 2/7 is optimal within the
class of monotonic background fields. Further analysis of our upper-bounding principle reveals
the role of non-monotonicity, and how it may be exploited in a rigorous mathematical argument.
