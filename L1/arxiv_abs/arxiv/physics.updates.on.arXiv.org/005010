Viscoelasticity plays a key role in many practical applications and in different reasearch fields,
such as in seals, sliding-rolling contacts and crack propagation. In all these contexts, a proper
knowledge of the viscoelastic modulus is very important. However, the experimental characterization
of the frequency dependent modulus, carried out through different standard procedures, still
presents some complexities, then possible alternative approaches are desirable. For example,
the experimental investigation of viscoelastic beam dynamics would be challenging, especially
for the intrinsic simplicity of this kind of test. This is why, a deep understanding of damping mechanisms
in viscoelastic beams results to be a quite important task to better predict their dynamics. With
the aim to enlighten damping properties in such structures, an analytical study of the transversal
vibrations of a viscoelastic beam is presented in this paper. Some dimensionless parameters are
defined, depending on the material properties and the beam geometry, which enable to shrewdly design
the beam dynamics. In this way, by properly tuning such disclosed parameters, for example the dimensionless
beam length or a chosen material, it is possible to enhance or suppress some resonant peaks, one at
a time or more simultaneously. This is a remarkable possibility to efficiently control damping
in these structures, and the results presented in this paper may help in elucidating experimental
procedures for the characterization of viscoelastic materials.
