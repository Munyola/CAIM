Data-driven decompositions are becoming essential tools in fluid dynamics, allowing for identifying
and tracking the evolution of coherent patterns in large numerical and experimental datasets.
In this work, we analyze the main limits of two popular decompositions, namely the Proper Orthogonal
Decomposition (POD) and the Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD), and we propose a novel decomposition
which allows for enhanced feature detection capabilities. This novel decomposition is referred
to as Multiscale Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (mPOD) and combines Multiresolution Analysis
(MRA) with a standard POD. Using MRA, the mPOD splits the correlation matrix into the contribution
of different scales, retaining non-overlapping portions of the correlation spectra; using the
standard POD, the mPOD extracts the optimal basis from each scale. After introducing a matrix factorization
framework for data-driven decompositions, the MRA is formulated via 1D and 2D filter banks for the
dataset and the correlation matrix respectively. The validation of the mPOD, and a comparison with
the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT), DMD and POD are provided in three test cases. These include
a synthetic test case, a numerical simulation of a nonlinear advection-diffusion problem, and
an experimental dataset provided by the Time-Resolved Particle Image Velocimetry (TR-PIV) of
an impinging gas jet. For each of these examples, the decompositions are compared in terms of convergence,
feature detection capabilities, and time-frequency localization.
