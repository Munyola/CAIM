Predicting occurrence of landslides is very significant to avoid or reduce losses in lives and properties.
Stability of rock slopes is often dominated by one or more locked segments along a potential slip
surface that resist failure and accumulate strain energy. We preliminarily summarize the types
of locked segments and classify them into three categories: "rock bridge", "retaining wall" and
"sustaining arch". Coupling one dimensional renormalization group model with the strain-softening
constitutive relation of geo-materials considering the Weibull's distribution, a physical prediction
model for slopes with locked segments is established. It is found that the ratio of the strain or displacement
at the peak strength point to that at the volume dilation point for a locked segment is exclusively
dependent on the Weibull's shape parameter m, and approximately equals to a constant, 1.48. A corresponding
accelerating displacement increment (tertiary creep) of slope can be observed from the onset of
the volume dilation of the locked segment due to its unsteady cracking. For a slope with multiple
locked segments, one can predict its critical instability displacement value according to the
accelerating displacement onset and the number of locked segments. The back analysis on two typical
cases, i.e., the Yanchihe rockslide and the wedge rockslide, Libby Dam, shows that their evolutionary
processes dominated respectively by one and two locked segments follow this model and hence they
can be predicted on firm scientific grounds.
