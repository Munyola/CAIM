In this work, the Eulerian-Eulerian (E-E) method was used to investigate nine classic gas-liquid
systems. These test cases were selected from different industries including chemical, nuclear,
bio-processing and metallurgical engineering. Although coming from different disciplines,
all the test cases can be seen as multi-phase bubbly flows. They were launched by the OpenFOAM solver
reactingTwoPhaseEulerFoam, in which the E-E method was implemented with sophisticated numerical
techniques. The governing equations and discretization procedure were firstly discussed in details.
The effects of the drag force, non-drag forces, bubble induced turbulence, bubble swarm on the predicted
phase fraction distribution, gas holdup, liquid velocity and turbulence variables were investigated.
Our results show that the combination of drag force and turbulence dispersion force should be included
to all the test cases. The drag force directly determines the global gas holdup and the vertical liquid/gas
velocity. For the test cases operated at high aspect ratio (e.g., pipe flows), accurate results
can only be obtained by considering lift force and wall lubrication force. In certain cases, the
addition of the bubble induced model improves the predictions, whereas in other cases it predicts
worse results. Meanwhile, the bubble swarm correction should be used in simulations when operated
at high gas phase fraction. Further, some of the shortcomings of the E-E method are identified and
recommendations for future work are made based on the numerical analysis.
