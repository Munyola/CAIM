Objective: Accurately classifying the malignancy of lesions detected in a screening scan is critical
for reducing false positives. Radiomics holds great potential to differentiate malignant from
benign tumors by extracting and analyzing a large number of quantitative image features. Since
not all radiomic features contribute to an effective classifying model, selecting an optimal feature
subset is critical. Methods: This work proposes a new multi-objective based feature selection
(MO-FS) algorithm that considers sensitivity and specificity simultaneously as the objective
functions during feature selection. For MO-FS, we developed a modified entropy based termination
criterion (METC) that stops the algorithm automatically rather than relying on a preset number
of generations. We also designed a solution selection methodology for multi-objective learning
that uses the evidential reasoning approach (SMOLER) to automatically select the optimal solution
from the Pareto-optimal set. Furthermore, we developed an adaptive mutation operation to generate
the mutation probability in MO-FS automatically. Results: We evaluated the MO-FS for classifying
lung nodule malignancy in low-dose CT and breast lesion malignancy in digital breast tomosynthesis.
Conclusion: The experimental results demonstrated that the feature set selected by MO-FS achieved
better classification performance than features selected by other commonly used methods. Significance:
The proposed method is general and more effective radiomic feature selection strategy.
