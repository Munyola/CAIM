We consider the one-dimensional Schroedinger equation on a ring, with the cubic term, of either
self-attractive or repulsive sign, confined to a narrow segment. This setting can be realized in
optics and Bose-Einstein condensates. For the nonlinearity coefficient represented by the delta-function,
all stationary states are obtained in an exact analytical form. The states with positive chemical
potentials are found in alternating bands for the cases of the self-repulsion and attraction, while
solutions with negative chemical potentials exist only in the latter case. These results provide
a possibility to obtain exact solutions for bandgap states in the nonlinear system. Approximating
the delta-function by a narrow Gaussian, stability of the stationary modes is addressed through
numerical computation of eigenvalues for small perturbations, and verified by simulations of
the perturbed evolution. For positive chemical potentials, the stability is investigated in three
lowest bands. In the case of the self-attraction, each band contains a stable subband, the transition
to instability occurring with the increase of the total norm. As a result, multi-peak states may
be stable in higher bands. In the case of the self-repulsion, a single-peak ground state is stable
in the first band, while the two higher ones are populated by weakly unstable two- and four-peak excited
states. In the case of the self-attraction and negative chemical potentials, single-peak modes
feature instability which transforms them into persistently oscillating states.
