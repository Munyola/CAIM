We can make two kinds of perturbations to a parametrized chaotic dynamical system: perturbations
on initial conditions and on the parameter. Typically, for both perturbations, the first order
approximation of the difference between the original and new trajectory grows exponentially.
However, if we coordinate the two perturbations carefully, the first order approximation between
the original and new trajectory remains bounded even as time goes to infinity: such first order approximation
is called the shadowing direction. For the shadowing direction to exists, the dynamical system
should satisfy the uniform hyperbolicity assumption, that is, the directions of different Characteristic
Lyapunov Vectors (CLV) are distinct. In this paper, the chaotic dynamical system is a flow past a
3-D cylinder under Reynolds number 525. We first compute the 40 fastest growing CLVs. By plotting
the flow field of CLVs, we discover that the flow pattern of different CLVs moves towards the high-dissipation
area, as the growing rate of CLVs becomes negative. We also find that this flow problem has 16 unstable
directions, which implies the attractor is low-dimensional. Moreover, by computing angles between
different CLVs, we verify that this problem does satisfy the uniform hyperbolicity assumption.
Next, we plot the flow field of the shadowing direction computed by the Non-Intrusive Least Squares
Shadowing (NILSS) algorithm. Finally, we exhibit the physicality and usefulness of the shadowing
direction by using it to compute the sensitivities of some long-time averaged objectives.
