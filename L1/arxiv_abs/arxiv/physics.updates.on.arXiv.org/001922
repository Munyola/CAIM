Precision and chip contamination-free placement of two-dimensional (2D) materials is expected
to accelerate both the study of fundamental properties and novel device functionality. Current
transfer methods of 2D materials onto an arbitrary substrate deploy wet chemistry and viscoelastic
stamping. However, these methods produce a) significant cross contamination of the substrate
due to the lack of spatial selectivity b) may not be compatible with chemically sensitive device
structures, and c) are challenged with respect to spatial alignment. Here, we demonstrate a novel
method of transferring 2D materials resembling the functionality known from printing; utilizing
a combination of a sharp micro-stamper and viscoelastic polymer, we show precise placement of individual
2D materials resulting in vanishing cross contamination to the substrate. Our 2D printer-method
results show an aerial cross contamination improvement of two to three orders of magnitude relative
to state-of-the-art dry and direct transfer methods. Moreover, we find that the 2D material quality
is preserved in this transfer method. Testing this 2D material printer on taped-out integrated
Silicon photonic chips, we find that the micro-stamper stamping transfer does not physically harm
the underneath Silicon nanophotonic structures such as waveguides or micro-ring resonators receiving
the 2D material. Such accurate and substrate-benign transfer method for 2D materials could be industrialized
for rapid device prototyping due to its high time-reduction, accuracy, and contamination-free
process.
