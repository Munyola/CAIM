Low thermal conductance of metal contacts is one of the main challenges in thermal management of
nanoscale devices of graphene and other 2D materials. Previous attempts to search for metal contacts
with high thermal conductance yielded limited success due to incomplete understanding of the origins
of the low thermal conductance. In this paper, we carefully study the intrinsic thermal conductance
across metal/graphene/metal interfaces to identify the heat transport mechanisms across graphene
interfaces. We find that unlike metal contacts on diamond, the intrinsic thermal conductance of
most graphene interfaces (except Ti and TiNx) is only about 50 % of the phonon radiation limit, suggesting
that heat is carried across graphene interfaces mainly through elastic transmission of phonons.
We thus propose a convenient approach to substantially enhance the phononic heat transport across
metal contacts on graphene, by better matching the energy of phonons in metals and graphene, e.g.,
using metallic nitrides. We test the idea with TiNx, with phonon frequencies of up to 1.18*10^14
rad/s, 47 % of the highest phonon frequencies in graphene of 2.51*10^14 rad/s . Interestingly, we
obtain a huge thermal conductance of 270 MW m-2 K-1 for TiNx/graphene interfaces, which is about
140 % of the phonon radiation limit. The huge thermal conductance could be partially attributed
to inelastic phonon transport across the TiNx/graphene interface. Our work provides guidance
for the search for good metal contacts on 2D materials and devices.
