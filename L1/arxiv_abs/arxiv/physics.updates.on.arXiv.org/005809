What do binary (or probabilistic) forecasting abilities have to do with overall performance? We
map the difference between (univariate) binary predictions, bets and "beliefs" (expressed as
a specific "event" will happen/will not happen) and real-world continuous payoffs (numerical
benefits or harm from an event) and show the effect of their conflation and mischaracterization
in the decision-science literature. We also examine the differences under thin and fat tails. The
effects are: A- Spuriousness of many psychological results particularly those documenting that
humans overestimate tail probabilities and rare events, or that they overreact to fears of market
crashes, ecological calamities, etc. Many perceived "biases" are just mischaracterizations
by psychologists. There is also a misuse of Hayekian arguments in promoting prediction markets.
We quantify such conflations with a metric for "pseudo-overestimation". B- Being a "good forecaster"
in binary space doesn't lead to having a good actual performance}, and vice versa, especially under
nonlinearities. A binary forecasting record is likely to be a reverse indicator under some classes
of distributions. Deeper uncertainty or more complicated and realistic probability distribution
worsen the conflation . C- Machine Learning: Some nonlinear payoff functions, while not lending
themselves to verbalistic expressions and "forecasts", are well captured by ML or expressed in
option contracts. D- Fattailedness: The difference is exacerbated in the power law classes of probability
distributions.
