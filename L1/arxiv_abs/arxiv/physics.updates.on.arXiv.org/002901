The main role of the ITER Radial Neutron Camera (RNC) diagnostic is to measure in real-time the plasma
neutron emissivity profile at high peak count rates for a time duration up to 500 s. Due to the unprecedented
high performance conditions and after the identification of critical problems, a set of activities
have been selected, focused on the development of high priority prototypes, capable to deliver
answers to those problems before the final RNC design. This paper presents one of the selected activities:
the design, development and testing of a dedicated FPGA code for the RNC Data Acquisition prototype.
The FPGA code aims to acquire, process and store in real-time the neutron and gamma pulses from the
detectors located in collimated lines of sight viewing a poloidal plasma section from the ITER Equatorial
Port Plug 1. The hardware platform used was an evaluation board from Xilinx (KC705) carrying an IPFN
FPGA Mezzanine Card (FMC-AD2-1600) with 2 digitizer channels of 12-bit resolution sampling up
to 1.6 GSamples/s. The code performs the proper input signal conditioning using a down-sampled
configuration to 400 MSamples/s, apply dedicated algorithms for pulse detection, filtering and
pileup detection, and includes two distinct data paths operating simultaneously: i) the event-based
data-path for pulse storage; and ii) the real-time processing, with dedicated algorithms for pulse
shape discrimination and pulse height spectra. For continuous data throughput both data-paths
are streamed to the host through two distinct PCIe x8 Direct Memory Access (DMA) channels.
