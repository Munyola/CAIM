Discrete particle simulation, a combined approach of computational fluid dynamics and discrete
methods such as DEM (Discrete Element Method), SPH (Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics), PIC (Particle-In-Cell),
etc., is becoming a practical tool for exploring lab-scale gas-solid systems owing to the fast development
of its parallel computation. However, the gas-solid coupling and the corresponding fluid flow
solver remain immature. In this work, we presented a modified lattice Boltzmann approach to consider
the effect of both the local solid volume fraction and the local relative velocity between the particles
and the fluid, which was different from the traditional volume-averaged Navier-Stokes equations.
This approach is combined with a time-driven hard sphere algorithm to simulate the motion of individual
particles in which particles interact with each other via hard-sphere collisions but the collision
detection and motion of the particle are performed at constant time intervals, and the EMMS (energy
minimization multi-scale) drag has been coupled with lattice Boltzmann based discrete particle
simulation to improve its accuracy. Two typical fluidization processes, namely injection of a
single bubble at incipient fluidization and fast fluidization in a riser, are simulated with this
approach, showing a good agreement with published correlations and experimental data. The capability
of the model to capture more detailed and intrinsic characteristics of particle-fluid systems
are demonstrated. The method can be used straightforwardly with other solid phase solvers also.
