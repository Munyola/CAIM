Evidence from the research literature indicates that both audience response systems (ARS) and
guided inquiry worksheets (GIW) can lead to greater student engagement, learning, and equity in
the STEM classroom. We compare the use of these two tools in large enrollment STEM courses delivered
in different contexts, one in biology and one in engineering. The instructors studied utilized
each of the active learning tools differently. In the biology course, ARS questions were used mainly
to check in with students and assess if they were correctly interpreting and understanding worksheet
questions. The engineering course presented ARS questions that afforded students the opportunity
to apply learned concepts to new scenarios towards improving students conceptual understanding.
In the biology course, the GIWs were primarily used in stand-alone activities, and most of the information
necessary for students to answer the questions was contained within the worksheet in a context that
aligned with a disciplinary model. In the engineering course, the instructor intended for students
to reference their lecture notes and rely on their conceptual knowledge of fundamental principles
from the previous ARS class session in order to successfully answer the GIW questions. However,
while their specific implementation structures and practices differed, both instructors used
these tools to build towards the same basic disciplinary thinking and sense-making processes of
conceptual reasoning, quantitative reasoning, and metacognitive thinking.
