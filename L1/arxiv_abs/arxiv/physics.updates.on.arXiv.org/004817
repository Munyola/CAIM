Echo is a ubiquitous phenomenon found in many physical systems, ranging from spins in magnetic fields
to particle beams in hadron accelerators. It is typically observed in inhomogeneously broadened
ensembles of nonlinear objects, and is used to eliminate the effects of environmental-induced
dephasing, enabling observation of proper, inherent object properties. Here, we report experimental
observation of quantum wave packet echoes in a single isolated molecule. In contrast to conventional
echoes, here the entire dephasing-rephasing cycle occurs within a single molecule without any
inhomogeneous spread of molecular properties, or any interaction with the environment. In our
experiments, we use a short laser pulse to impulsively excite a vibrational wave packet in an anharmonic
molecular potential, and observe its oscillations and eventual dispersion with time. A second
delayed pulsed excitation is applied, giving rise to an echo - a partial recovery of the initial coherent
wavepacket. The vibrational dynamics of single molecules is visualized by time-delayed probe
pulse dissociating them one at a time. Two mechanisms for the echo formation are identified - ac Stark-induced
molecular potential shaking and creation of depletion-induced "hole" in the nuclear spatial distribution.
Interplay between the optically induced echoes and quantum revivals of the vibrational wave packets
is observed and theoretically analyzed. The single molecule wave packet echoes may lead to the development
of new tools for probing ultrafast intramolecular processes in various molecules.
