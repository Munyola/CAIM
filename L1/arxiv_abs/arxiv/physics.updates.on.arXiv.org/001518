We study unbinding of multivalent cationic ligands from oppositely charged polymeric binding
sites sparsely grafted on a flat neutral substrate. Our molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are
suggested by single-molecule studies of protein-DNA interactions. We consider univalent salt
concentrations spanning roughly a thousandfold range, together with various concentrations
of excess ligands in solution. To reveal the ionic effects on unbinding kinetics of spontaneous
and facilitated dissociation mechanisms, we treat electrostatic interactions both at a Debye-H\"{u}ckel
(DH, or `implicit' ions, i.e., use of an electrostatic potential with a prescribed decay length)
level, as well as by the more precise approach of considering all ionic species explicitly in the
simulations. We find that the DH approach systematically overestimates unbinding rates, relative
to the calculations where all ion pairs are present explicitly in solution, although many aspects
of the two types of calculation are qualitatively similar. For facilitated dissociation (FD, acceleration
of unbinding by free ligands in solution) explicit ion simulations lead to unbinding at lower free
ligand concentrations. Our simulations predict a variety of FD regimes as a function of free ligand
and ion concentrations; a particularly interesting regime is at intermediate concentrations
of ligands where non-electrostatic binding strength controls FD. We conclude that explicit-ion
electrostatic modeling is an essential component to quantitatively tackle problems in molecular
ligand dissociation, including nucleic-acid-binding proteins.
