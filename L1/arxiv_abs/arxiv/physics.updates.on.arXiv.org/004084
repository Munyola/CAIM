Predictive simulation of many complex flows requires moving beyond Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes
(RANS) based models to representations resolving at least some scales of turbulence in at least
some regions of the flow. To resolve turbulence where necessary while avoiding the cost of performing
large eddy simulation (LES) everywhere, a broad range of hybrid RANS/LES methods have been developed.
While successful in some situations, existing methods exhibit a number of deficiencies which limit
their predictive capability in many cases of interest, for instance in many flows involving smooth
wall separation. These deficiencies result from inappropriate blending approaches and resulting
inconsistencies between the resolved and modeled turbulence as well as errors inherited from the
underlying RANS and LES models. This work details these problems and their effects in hybrid simulations,
and develops a modeling paradigm aimed at overcoming these challenges. The new approach discards
typical blending approaches in favor of a hybridization strategy in which the RANS and LES model
components act through separate models formulated using the mean and fluctuating velocity, respectively.
Further, a forcing approach in which fluctuating content is actively transferred from the modeled
to the resolved scales is introduced. Finally, the model makes use of an anisotropic LES model that
is intended to represent the effects of grid anisotropy. The model is demonstrated on fully-developed,
incompressible channel flow and shown to be very promising.
