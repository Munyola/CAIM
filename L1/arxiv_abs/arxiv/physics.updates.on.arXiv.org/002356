Fast-growing electronics industry and future energy storage needs have encouraged the design
of rechargeable batteries with higher storage capacities, and longer life times. In this regard,
two-dimensional (2D) materials, specifically boron and carbon nanosheets, have garnered enthusiasm
due to their fascinating electronic, optical, mechanical and chemical properties. Recently,
a hydrogen boride (HB) nanosheet was successfully fabricated showing remarkable stability and
superior physical properties. Motivated by this experimental study, we used first principle electronic
structure calculations to study the feasibility of this nanosheet to serve as an anode material
for Li/Na/Ca/Mg/Al ion batteries. Most active adsorption sites for single adatoms were evaluated
and next adatoms were gradually inserted into the anode surface accordingly. The charge transfer,
electronic density of sates, storage capacity, structural stability, open-circuit potential
and diffusion energy barriers were explored. Our theoretical study predicts that HB shows outstanding
electrode properties for Li and Na ion batteries. The intercalation of both Li and Na adatoms into
the HB monolayer can lead to a high identical storage capacity of 1133.8 mAh/g which is promising
compared to the capacities of the traditional anode materials; such as graphite (372 mAh/g) and
TiO2 (200 mAh/g), and other 2D materials; such as germanene (369 mAh/g), stanene (226 mAh/g), and
phosphorene (432.8 mAh/g) nanosheets. These results may open a new horizon for the design of rechargeable
batteries with higher storage capacitates.
