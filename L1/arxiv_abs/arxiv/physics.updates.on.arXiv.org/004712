Metallic layers are known to be used for the suppression of wave transmission when their thickness
is sufficiently higher than the skin depth of metal. If in addition to blocking the transmission,
metallic layers have the feature of blocking the reflection, too, they would make perfect absorbers.
In this work, we propose an experimental approach of using a single thin layer of Manganese (Mn) as
both the transmission suppresser and the reflection suppresser. This approach leads to obtaining
lithography-free ultra-broadband perfect absorption in an ultra-wide spectrum ranging from
Ultraviolet (UV) to Far Infrared (FIR). The measured average absorption is approximately 99%.
Such a promising result can be achieved by only coating a single Mn layer on high-roughness substrates
that include random nano-pyramids on it. In other words, we do not need a stack of different materials
and combinations of geometrical features. The high roughness is realized on a commercial Silicon
wafer substrate by inductively coupled plasma (ICP) etching. The key to this ultra-wideband absorption
is electromagnetic field tapering which exists due to the graded-index feature of the structure
(known as moth-eye effect), along with the ideal optical properties of Mn which makes it an excellent
metal for broadband absorption applications. A full experimental characterization of the fabricated
samples is presented along with the physical analysis of the phenomena. The findings of this paper
can be used for the realization of lithography-free, cost-effective and high-throughput mass
production of broadband absorbers.
