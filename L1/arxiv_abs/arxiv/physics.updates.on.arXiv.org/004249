Time irreversibility (temporal asymmetry) is one of fundamental properties that characterize
the nonlinearity of complex dynamical processes, and our brain is a typical complex dynamical system
manifested with nonlinearity. Two subtraction-based parameters, Ys and X2, are employed to measure
the probabilistic differences of permutations instead of raw vectors for the simplified quantification
of time irreversibility, which is validated by chaotic and reversible processes and the surrogate
data. We show that it is equivalent to quantify time irreversibility by measuring probabilistic
difference between the forward and its backward processes and between the symmetric permutations.
And we detect time irreversibility of two groups of epileptic EEGs, from the Nanjing General Hospital
(NJGH) and from the public Bonn epileptic database. In our contribution, the manifestation of nonlinearity
of whether healthy or diseased brain electrical activities is highlighted, and the highest time
irreversibility of epileptic EEG during seizures is demonstrated. NJGH epileptic EEGs during
seizure-free intervals of have lower time irreversibility than the control data while those of
the Bonn data sets have higher nonlinearity than the healthy brain electrical activities. For the
inconsistent results, we conduct multi-scale analysis and elucidate from the circadian rhythms
in epileptic nonlinearity, however, more targeted researches are needed to verify our assumptions
or to determine if there are other reasons leading to the inconsistency.
