Recently higher order networks describing the interactions between two or more nodes are attracting
large attention. Most notably higher order networks include simplicial complexes formed not only
by nodes and links but also by triangles, tetrahedra, etc. glued along their faces. Simplicial complexes
and in general higher order networks are able to characterize data as different as functional brain
networks or collaboration networks beyond the framework of pairwise interactions. Interestingly
higher order networks have a natural geometric interpretation and therefore constitute the natural
way to explore the discrete network geometry of complex networks. Here we investigate the rich interplay
between emergent network geometry of higher order networks and their complexity in the framework
of a non-equilibrium model called Network Geometry with Flavor. This model originally proposed
for capturing the evolution of simplicial complexes is here extended in order to capture higher
order networks formed not only by simplices but by any type of regular polytope. We reveal the interplay
between complexity and geometry of the higher-order networks by studying the emergent community
structure and the dependence of the degree distribution on the dimension and the nature of the regular
polytope forming the building blocks of the networked structure. Additionally we discuss the underlying
hyperbolic nature of the emergent geometry and we relate the spectral dimension of the higher-order
network to the dimension and nature of its building blocks.
