Cenozoic temperature, sea level and CO2 co-variations provide insights into climate sensitivity
to external forcings and sea level sensitivity to climate change. Climate sensitivity depends
on the initial climate state, but potentially can be accurately inferred from precise paleoclimate
data. Pleistocene climate oscillations yield a fast-feedback climate sensitivity 3 +/- 1{\deg}C
for 4 W/m2 CO2 forcing if Holocene warming relative to the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) is used as calibration,
but the error (uncertainty) is substantial and partly subjective because of poorly defined LGM
global temperature and possible human influences in the Holocene. Glacial-to-interglacial climate
change leading to the prior (Eemian) interglacial is less ambiguous and implies a sensitivity in
the upper part of the above range, i.e., 3-4{\deg}C for 4 W/m2 CO2 forcing. Slow feedbacks, especially
change of ice sheet size and atmospheric CO2, amplify total Earth system sensitivity by an amount
that depends on the time scale considered. Ice sheet response time is poorly defined, but we show
that the slow response and hysteresis in prevailing ice sheet models are exaggerated. We use a global
model, simplified to essential processes, to investigate state-dependence of climate sensitivity,
finding an increased sensitivity towards warmer climates, as low cloud cover is diminished and
increased water vapor elevates the tropopause. Burning all fossil fuels, we conclude, would make
much of the planet uninhabitable by humans, thus calling into question strategies that emphasize
adaptation to climate change.
