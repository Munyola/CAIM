To measure the main characteristics of radiative neutron decay, namely its relative intensity
BR (branching ratio), it is necessary to measure the spectra of double coincidences between beta-electron
and proton as well as the spectra of triple coincidences of electron, proton and radiative gamma-quantum.
Analysis of double coincidences spectra requires one to distinguish events of ordinary neutron
beta decay from the background; analysis of triple coincidences relies on distinguishing radiative
neutron decay from background events. As demonstrated in our first experiment, these spectra presented
a heterogeneous background that included response peaks related to the registration of electrons
and protons by our electronic detection system. The NIST experimental group (emiT group) observed
an analogous pattern on the spectrum of double coincidences. The current report is dedicated to
the analysis of this heterogeneous background. In particular, this report demonstrates that the
use of response function methodology allows to clearly identify radiative neutron decay events
and to distinguish them from the background. This methodology enabled us to become the first team
to measure the relative intensity of radiative neutron decay B.R.= (3.2+-1.6)*10-3 (where C.L.=99.7%
and gamma quanta energy exceeds 35 kev). In addition, the review emphasizes that the background
events on the spectrum of double coincidences are caused by ion registration, and demonstrates
that one cannot ignore the ionic background, which is why experiment registered the ions and not
recoil protons.
