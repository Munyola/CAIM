Seismic facies identification plays a significant role in reservoir characterization. It helps
in identifying the various lithological and stratigraphical changes in reservoir properties.
With the increase in the size of seismic data or number of attributes to be analyzed, the manual process
for facies identification becomes complicated and time-consuming. Even though seismic attributes
add multiple dimensions to the data, their role in reservoir characterization is very crucial.
There exist different linear transformation methods that use seismic attributes for identification,
characterization, and visualization of seismic facies. These linear transformation methods
have been widely used for facies characterization. However, there are some limitations associated
with these methods such as deciding the width parameters, number of clusters, convergence rate
etc. Therefore, the present research work uses non-linear transformation approach that overcomes
some of the major limitations of linear approaches. The proposed Seismic facies analysis approach
based on Generative Topographic Map \& Radial Basis Function(SFA-GTM) works by calculating the
set of four Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix(GLCM) texture based attributes viz. energy, homogeneity,
contrast, and dissimilarity. The Generative Topographic Map(GTM) is used for unsupervised classification
of seismic facies based on the set of calculated texture attributes. Further, the present work uses
Radial Basis Function(RBF) for interpolating the missing values in the data.
