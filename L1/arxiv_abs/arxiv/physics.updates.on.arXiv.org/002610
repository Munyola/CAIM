High-efficiency organic photocathodes, based on regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene) and phenyl-C61-butyric
acid methyl ester (rr-P3HT:PCBM) bulk heterojunction sandwiched between charge-selective layers,
are emerging as efficient and low-cost devices for solar hydrogen production by water splitting.
Nevertheless, stability issues of the materials used as charge-selective layers are hampering
the realization of long-lasting photoelectrodes, pointing out the need to investigate novel and
stable materials. Here, we propose MoS2 nano-flakes, produced by Li-aided exfoliation of bulk
counterpart, as efficient atomic-thick hole-selective layer for rr-P3HT:PCBM-based photocathodes.
We carried out a p-type chemical doping to tune on-demand the MoS2 Fermi level in order to match the
highest occupied molecular orbital level of the rr-P3HT, thus easing the hole collection at the
electrode. The as-prepared p-doped MoS2-based photocathodes reached a photocurrent of 1.21 mA
cm-2 at 0 V vs. RHE, a positive onset potential of 0.56 V vs. RHE and a power-saved figure of merit of
0.43%, showing a 6.1-fold increase with respect to pristine MoS2-based photocathodes, under simulated
1 Sun illumination. Operational activity of the photocathodes over time and under 1 Sun illumination
revealed a progressive stabilization of the photocurrents at 0.49 mA cm-2 at 0 V vs. RHE. These results
pave the way towards the exploitation of layered crystals as efficiency-boosters for scalable
hybrid organic H2-evolving photoelectrochemical cells.
