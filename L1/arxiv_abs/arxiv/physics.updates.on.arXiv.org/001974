The non-trivial structure of such complex systems makes the analysis of their collective behavior
a challenge. The problem is even more difficult when the information is distributed across networks
(e.g., communication networks in different media); in this case, it becomes impossible to have
a complete, or even partial picture, if situations are analyzed separately within each network
due to sparsity. A multiplex network is well-suited to model the complexity of this kind of systems
by preserving the semantics associated with each network. Centrality measures are fundamental
for the identification of key players, but existing approaches are typically designed to capture
a predefined aspect of the system, ignoring or merging the semantics of the individual layers. To
overcome the aforementioned limitations, we present a Framework for Tailoring Centrality Measures
in Multiplex networks (TaCMM), which offers a flexible methodology that encompasses and generalizes
previous approaches. The strength of TaCMM is to enable the encoding of specific dependencies between
the subnets of multiplex networks to define semantic-aware centrality measures. We develop a theoretically
sound iterative method, based on Perron-Frobenius theory, designed to be effective also in high-sparsity
conditions. We formally and experimentally prove its convergence for ranking computation. We
provide a thorough investigation of our methodology against existing techniques using different
types of subnets in multiplex networks. The results clearly show the power and flexibility of the
proposed framework.
