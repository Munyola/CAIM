Radiative and non-radiative charge carrier recombination in thin-film diodes plays a key role
in determining the efficiency of electronic devices made of next generation semiconductors such
as organic, perovskite and nanocrystals. In this work, we show that lowering the bulk recombination
does not necessarily result in enhanced performance metrics of electronic devices. From the perspective
of charge carrier extraction and injection, the radiative limit of the open-circuit voltage of
solar cells, noise current of photodetectors and lasing threshold of injection lasers cannot be
improved if the contacts are not perfectly selective. A numerical drift-diffusion model is used
to investigate the interplay between bulk recombination and surface recombination of minority
carriers at the contacts in bipolar thin diode devices based on low-mobility semiconductors. The
surface recombination becomes prominent in case of reduced bulk recombination strengths when
non-selective contacts, i. e. contacts that are either metallic or have imperfect charge-selective
interlayer, are employed. Finally, we derive analytical approximations for the case when diffusion-limited
surface recombination of minority carriers at Ohmic contacts dominates the dark current. These
results indicate that having perfectly selective contacts becomes crucial in systems with suppressed
bulk recombination - a challenging requirement for future state-of-the-art thin-film solar cells,
light-emitting devices and photodetectors made of next generation semiconductors.
