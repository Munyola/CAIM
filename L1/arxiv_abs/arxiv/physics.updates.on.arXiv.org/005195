Evolving systems, be it an antibody repertoire in the face of mutating pathogens or a microbial population
exposed to varied antibiotics, constantly search for adaptive solutions in time-varying fitness
landscapes. Generalists correspond to genotypes that remain fit across diverse selective pressures;
cross-reactive antibodies are much wanted but rare, while multi-drug resistant microbes are undesired
yet prevalent. However, little is known about under what conditions such solutions with a high capacity
to adapt would be efficiently discovered by evolution, as environmental changes alter the relative
fitness and accessibility of neighboring genotypes. In addition, can epistasis --- the source
of landscape ruggedness and path constraints --- play a different role, if the environments are
correlated in time? We present a generative model to estimate the propensity of evolving generalists
in rugged landscapes that are tunably related and cycling relatively slowly. We find that environment
cycling can substantially facilitate the search for fit generalists by dynamically enlarging
their effective basins of attraction. Importantly, these high performers are most likely to emerge
at an intermediate level of both ruggedness and environmental relatedness, trading diversity
for fitness and accessibility. Our work provides a conceptual framework to study evolution in correlated
varying complex environments, and offers statistical understanding that suggests general strategies
for speeding up the generation of broadly neutralizing antibodies or preventing microbes from
evolving multi-drug resistance.
