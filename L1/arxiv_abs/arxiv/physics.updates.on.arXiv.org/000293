We study quantitatively the level of false multifractal signal one may encounter while analyzing
multifractal phenomena in time series within multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis (MF-DFA).
The investigated effect appears as a result of finite length of used data series and is additionally
amplified by the long-term memory the data eventually may contain. We provide the detailed quantitative
description of such apparent multifractal background signal as a threshold in spread of generalized
Hurst exponent values $\Delta h$ or a threshold in the width of multifractal spectrum $\Delta \alpha$
below which multifractal properties of the system are only apparent, i.e. do not exist, despite
$\Delta\alpha\neq0$ or $\Delta h\neq 0$. We find this effect quite important for shorter or persistent
series and we argue it is linear with respect to autocorrelation exponent $\gamma$. Its strength
decays according to power law with respect to the length of time series. The influence of basic linear
and nonlinear transformations applied to initial data in finite time series with various level
of long memory is also investigated. This provides additional set of semi-analytical results.
The obtained formulas are significant in any interdisciplinary application of multifractality,
including physics, financial data analysis or physiology, because they allow to separate the 'true'
multifractal phenomena from the apparent (artificial) multifractal effects. They should be a
helpful tool of the first choice to decide whether we do in particular case with the signal with real
multiscaling properties or not.
