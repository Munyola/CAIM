We study hydrodynamic fluctuations in a compressible and viscous fluid film confined between two
rigid, no-slip, parallel plates, where one of the plates is kept fixed, while the other one is driven
in small-amplitude, translational, displacements around its reference position. This jiggling
motion is assumed to be driven by a stochastic, external, surface forcing of zero mean and finite
variance. Thus, while the transverse (shear) and longitudinal (compressional) hydrodynamic
stresses produced in the film vanish on average on either of the plates, these stresses exhibit fluctuations
that can be quantified through their equal-time, two-point, correlation functions. For transverse
stresses, we show that the correlation functions of the stresses acting on the same plate (self-correlators)
as well as the correlation function of the stresses acting on different plates (cross-correlators)
exhibit universal, decaying, power-law behaviors as functions of the inter-plate separation.
At small separations, the exponents are given by -1, while at large separations, the exponents are
found as -2 (self-correlator on the fixed plate), -4 (excess self-correlator on the mobile plate)
and -3 (cross-correlator). For longitudinal stresses, we find much weaker power-law decays in
the large separation regime, with exponents -3/2 (excess self-correlator on the mobile plate)
and -1 (cross-correlator). The self-correlator on the fixed plate increases and levels off upon
increasing the inter-plate separation, reflecting the non-decaying nature of the longitudinal
forces acting on the fixed plate.
