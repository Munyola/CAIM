Modal decompositions such as proper orthogonal decomposition (POD), dynamic mode decomposition
(DMD) and their variants are regularly used to educe physical mechanisms of nonlinear flow phenomena
that cannot be easily understood through direct inspection. In fluid-structure interaction (FSI)
systems, fluid motion is coupled to vibration and/or deformation of an immersed structure. Despite
this coupling, data analysis is often performed using only fluid or structure variables, rather
than incorporating both. This approach does not provide information about the manner in which fluid
and structure modes are correlated. We present a framework for performing POD and DMD where the fluid
and structure are treated together. As part of this framework, we introduce a physically meaningful
norm for FSI systems. We first use this combined fluid-structure formulation to identify correlated
flow features and structural motions in limit-cycle flag flapping. We then investigate the transition
from limit-cycle flapping to chaotic flapping, which can be initiated by increasing the flag mass.
Our modal decomposition reveals that at the onset of chaos, the dominant flapping motion increases
in amplitude and leads to a bluff-body wake instability. This new bluff-body mode interacts triadically
with the dominant flapping motion to produce flapping at the non-integer harmonic frequencies
previously reported by Connell & Yue (2007). While our formulation is presented for POD and DMD,
there are natural extensions to other data-analysis techniques.
