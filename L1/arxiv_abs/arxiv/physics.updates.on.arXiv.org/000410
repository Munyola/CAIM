Random walks on networks is the standard tool for modelling spreading processes in social and biological
systems. However, this conventional first-order Markov approach ignores a potentially important
feature of the dynamics: where flow moves to may depend on where it comes from. Here we analyse multi-step
pathways from different systems and show that ignoring the effects of second-order Markov dynamics
has important consequences for community detection and ranking, but only marginal consequences
for disease spreading through air travel. When people travelling by plane can transmit infections
to random other people in cities, the memory effects from their travel patterns are lost. Therefore,
accurately modelling air travel patterns has a negligible effect on disease spread. However, when
focusing on the travel patterns themselves, or on systems with limited mixing, we observed that
random flow on networks understates the effect of communities and exaggerates the effect of highly
connected nodes. For example, capturing dynamics with a second-order Markov model allows us to
differentiate airport hubs from popular destinations and reveal actual travel patterns in air
traffic, and to uncover multidisciplinary journals and ranking that favour specialized journals
in scientific communication. These findings were achieved only by using more available data and
making no additional assumptions, and therefore suggest that accounting for higher-order memory
in network flows can help us better understand how real systems are organized and function.
