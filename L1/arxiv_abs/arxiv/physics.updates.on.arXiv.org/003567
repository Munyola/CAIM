The development of single-cell technologies provides the opportunity to identify new cellular
states and reconstruct novel cell-to-cell relationships. Applications range from understanding
the transcriptional and epigenetic processes involved in metazoan development to characterizing
distinct cells types in heterogeneous populations like cancers or immune cells. However, analysis
of the data is impeded by its unknown intrinsic biological and technical variability together with
its sparseness; these factors complicate the identification of true biological signals amidst
artifact and noise. Here we show that, across technologies, roughly 95% of the eigenvalues derived
from each single-cell data set can be described by universal distributions predicted by Random
Matrix Theory. Interestingly, 5% of the spectrum shows deviations from these distributions and
present a phenomenon known as eigenvector localization, where information tightly concentrates
in groups of cells. Some of the localized eigenvectors reflect underlying biological signal, and
some are simply a consequence of the sparsity of single cell data; roughly 3% is artifactual. Based
on the universal distributions and a technique for detecting sparsity induced localization, we
present a strategy to identify the residual 2% of directions that encode biological information
and thereby denoise single-cell data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach by comparing
with standard single-cell data analysis techniques in a variety of examples with marked cell populations.
