The structure and vibrational density of states (VDOS) of polymer glasses are investigated using
numerical simulations based on the classical Kremer-Grest bead-spring model. We focus on the roles
of chain length and bending stiffness, the latter being set by imposing three-body angular potentials
along chain backbones. Upon increasing the chain length and bending stiffness, structural reorganisation
leads to volumetric expansion of the material and build-up of internal stresses. The VDOS has two
dominant bands: a low frequency one corresponding to inter- and intra-chain non-bonding interactions
and a high frequency one corresponding principally to vibrations of bonded beads that constitute
skeletal chain backbones. Upon increasing the steepness of the angular potential, vibrational
modes associated with chain bending gradually move from the low-frequency to the high-frequency
band. This redistribution of modes is reflected in a reduction of the so-called Boson peak upon increasing
chain stiffness. Remarkably, the finer structure and the peaks of the high-frequency band, and
their variations with stiffness, can, for short chains, be explained using an analytical solution
derived for a model triatomic molecule. For longer chains, the qualitative evolution of the VDOS
with chain stiffness is similar, although the distinct peaks observed for short chains become increasingly
smoothed-out. Our findings can be used to guide a systematic approach to interpretation of Brillouin
and Raman scattering spectra of glassy polymers in future work, with applications in polymer processing
diagnostics.
