The synthesis, characterization and metal complexation of a new class of perylene bisimides (PBIs)
being an integral part of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) is reported. The simplest representative,
namely derivative 1a, was synthesized both by a convergent as well as a direct approach while the
elongated derivatives, 1b and 1c, were obtained only via a convergent synthetic pathway. All these
new prototypes of water-soluble perylenes are bolaamphiphiles and were fully characterized by
1H- and 13C-NMR spectroscopy, matrix assisted laser desorption ionization, time of flight (MALDI-TOF)
mass spectrometry and IR spectroscopy. In order to acquaint for the behaviour in solution of our
PBIs bearing dentritic wedges, the simplest derivative, 1a, was chosen and tested by means of UV/Vis
and fluorescence spectroscopy as well as by zeta-potential measurements. A photoexcitation induced
intramolecular photo-electron transfer (PET) can be observed in these molecules. Therefore potential
applications as sensor can be imagined. Model compound 1a efficiently coordinates trivalent metal
cations both in water and in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). Significantly, the effects of the complexation
strongly depend on the aggregation state of the PBI molecules in solution. As a matter of fact, in
water, the presence of M3+ ions triggers the formation of light emitting supramolecular aggregates
(excimers). On the other hand, in DMSO-rich solutions metal complexation leads to the suppression
of the PET and leads to a strong fluorescence enhancement.
