We consider the nonlocal multiscale model for surface tension \citep{Tartakovsky2018} as an alternative
to the (macroscale) Young-Laplace law. The nonlocal model is obtained in the form of an integral
of a molecular-force-like function with support $\varepsilon$ added to the Navier-Stokes momentum
conservation equation. Using this model, we calculate analytical forms for the steady-state equilibrium
pressure gradient and pressure profile for circular and spherical bubbles and flat interfaces
in two and three dimensions. According to the analytical solutions, the pressure changes continuously
across the interface in a way that is quantitatively similar to what is observed in MD simulations.
Furthermore, the pressure difference $P_{\varepsilon, in} - P_{\varepsilon, out}$ satisfies
the Young-Laplace law for the radius of curvature greater than $3\varepsilon$ and deviates from
the Young-Laplace law otherwise (i.e., $P_{\varepsilon, in} - P_{\varepsilon, out}$ goes to zero
as the radius of the curvature goes to zero, where $P_{\varepsilon, out}$ is the pressure outside
of the bubble at the distance greater than $3\varepsilon$ from the interface and $P_{\varepsilon,
in}$ is the pressure at the center of the bubble). The latter indicates that the surface tension in
the proposed model decreases with the decreasing radius of curvature, which agrees with molecular
dynamics simulations and laboratory experiments with nanobubbles. Therefore, our results demonstrate
that the nonlocal model behaves microscopically at scales smaller than $\varepsilon$ and macroscopically,
otherwise.
