Because wind-generated waves can propagate over large distances, wave spectra from a fixed point
can record information about air-sea interactions in distant areas. In this study, the spectral
wave climate is computed for a specific location in the tropical Eastern Pacific Ocean. Several
well-defined partitions independent of each other, referred to as wave-climate systems, are observed
in the annual mean wave spectrum. Significant seasonal cycling, long-term trends, and correlations
with climate indices are observed in the local wave spectra, showing the abundant climatic information
they contain. The projections of the wind vector on the direction pointing to the target location
are used to link the spectral wave climate and basin-scale wind climate. The origins of all the identified
wave climate systems are clearly shown in the wind projection maps and some are thousands of kilometers
away from the target point, demonstrating the validity of this connection. Comparisons are made
between wave spectra and the corresponding local and remote wind fields with respect to seasonal
and interannual variability, as well as the long-term trends. The results show that each frequency
and direction of ocean wave spectra at a certain location can be linked to the wind field for a geographical
area from a climatological point of view, implying that it is feasible to reconstruct a spectral
wave climate from global observational wind field data and wind climate monitoring using observations
of wave spectrum geographically far away.
