Recent work has shown that a M\"obius strip soap film rendered unstable by deforming its frame changes
topology to that of a disk through a 'neck-pinching' boundary singularity. This behavior is unlike
that of the catenoid, which transitions to two disks through a bulk singularity. It is not yet understood
whether the type of singularity is generally a consequence of the surface topology, nor how this
dependence could arise from an equation of motion for the surface. To address these questions we
investigate experimentally, computationally, and theoretically the route to singularities
of soap films with different topologies, including a family of punctured Klein bottles. We show
that the location of singularities (bulk or boundary) may depend on the path of the boundary deformation.
In the unstable regime the driving force for soap-film motion is the mean curvature. Thus, the narrowest
part of the neck, associated with the shortest nontrivial closed geodesic of the surface, has the
highest curvature and is the fastest-moving. Just before onset of the instability there exists
on the stable surface a shortest closed geodesic, which is the initial condition for evolution of
the neck's geodesics, all of which have the same topological relationship to the frame. We make the
plausible conjectures that if the initial geodesic is linked to the boundary then the singularity
will occur at the boundary, whereas if the two are unlinked initially then the singularity will occur
in the bulk. Numerical study of mean curvature flows and experiments support these conjectures.
