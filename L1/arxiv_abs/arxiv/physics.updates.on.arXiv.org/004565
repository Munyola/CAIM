The highly charged RNA molecules, with each phosphate carrying a single negative charge, cannot
fold into well-defined architectures with tertiary interactions, in the absence of ions. For ribozymes,
divalent cations are known to be more efficient than monovalent ions in driving them to a compact
state although often Mg$^{2+}$ ions are needed for catalytic activity. Therefore, how ions interact
with RNA is relevant in understanding RNA folding. It is often thought that most of the ions are territorially
and non-specifically bound to the RNA, as predicted by the counterion condensation (CIC) theory.
Here, we show using simulations of ${\it Azoarcus}$ ribozyme, based on an accurate coarse-grained
Three Site Interaction (TIS) model, with explicit divalent and monovalent cations, that ion condensation
is highly specific and depends on the nucleotide position. The regions with high coordination between
the phosphate groups and the divalent cations are discernible at very low concentrations when the
ribozyme does not form tertiary interactions. Surprisingly, these regions also contain the secondary
structural elements that nucleate subsequently in the self-assembly of RNA, implying that ion
condensation is determined by the architecture of the folded state. These results are in sharp contrast
to interactions of ions (monovalent and divalent) with rigid charged rods in which ion condensation
is uniform and position independent. The differences are explained in terms of the dramatic non-monotonic
shape fluctuations in the ribozyme as it folds with increasing Mg$^{2+}$ or Ca$^{2+}$ concentration.
