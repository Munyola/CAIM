In this paper we suggest a novel though strange flavor physics idea of dual flavor-geometric nature
of neutrino and color-quark mixing angles. Success of this idea in considered phenomenology is
possible because of the definitive three dimensions of the macroscopic space. At the one hand, there
are three different elementary particle mixing angles in charged current weak interactions. At
the other hand, the three angles presents one geometric object that can be visualized at nonrelativistic
approximation as a mixing vector with three obeying Pythagorean equation direction angles in the
outer euclidean space. The first aspect is well known SM physics. The second aspect is a radical PH-solution
to the old fundamental puzzles of equal numbers of particle mixing angles, flavors, colors and dimensions
of outer space. Many topical problems of neutrino mixing phenomenology get elucidated by the inferred
new Pythagorean equation already at leading basic benchmark approximation without tuning parameters
in agreement with data. New physical quantity, introduced in particle mixing phenomenology, is
particle color degree of freedom. It unites one color neutrino with three color quark mixing patterns
at the basic level, while distinguishing them at the observational level. Known experimental data
suggest that realistic particle mixing angles are small deviations from the defined benchmark
ones. Accordingly, as interesting examples, conformable parametrizations with one small empirical
epsilon parameter determine all six realistic quark and neutrino mixing angles in noticeable agreement
with data
