In chemical or physical reaction dynamics, it is essential to distinguish precisely between reactants
and products for all time. This task is especially demanding in time-dependent or driven systems
because therein the dividing surface (DS) between these states often exhibits a nontrivial time-dependence.
The so-called transition state (TS) trajectory has been seen to define a DS which is free of recrossings
in a large number of one-dimensional reactions across time-dependent barriers, and, thus, allows
one to determine exact reaction rates. A fundamental challenge to applying this method is the construction
of the TS trajectory itself. The minimization of Lagrangian descriptors (LDs) provides a general
and powerful scheme to obtain that trajectory even when perturbation theory fails. Both approaches
encounter possible breakdowns when the overall potential is bounded, admitting the possibility
of returns to the barrier long after trajectories have reached the product or reactant wells. Such
global dynamics cannot be captured by perturbation theory. Meanwhile, in the LD-DS approach, it
leads to the emergence of additional local minima which make it difficult to extract the optimal
branch associated with the desired TS trajectory. In this work, we illustrate this behavior for
a time-dependent double-well potential revealing a self-similar structure of the LD, and we demonstrate
how the reflections and side-minima can be addressed by an appropriate modification of the LD associated
with the direct rate across the barrier.
