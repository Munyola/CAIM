Thermospheric mass density is a major driver of satellite drag, the largest source of uncertainty
in accurately predicting the orbit of satellites in low Earth orbit (LEO) pertinent to space situational
awareness. Most existing models for thermosphere are either physics-based or empirical. Physics-based
models offer the potential for good predictive/forecast capabilities but require dedicated parallel
resources for real-time evaluation and data assimilative capabilities that have yet to be developed.
Empirical models are fast to evaluate, but offer very limited forecasting abilities. This paper
presents a methodology of developing a reduced-order dynamic model from high-dimensional physics-based
models by capturing the underlying dynamical behavior. This work develops a quasi-physical reduced
order model (ROM) for thermospheric mass density using simulated output from NCAR's Thermosphere-Ionosphere-Electrodynamics
General Circular Model (TIE-GCM). The ROM is derived using a dynamic system formulation from a large
dataset of TIE-GCM simulations spanning 12 years and covering a complete solar cycle. Towards this
end, a new reduced order modeling approach, based on Dynamic Mode Decomposition with control (DMDc),
that uses the Hermitian space of the problem to derive the dynamics and input matrices in a tractable
manner is developed. Results show that the ROM performs well in serving as a reduced order surrogate
for TIE-GCM while almost always maintaining the forecast error to within 5\% of the simulated densities
after 24 hours.
