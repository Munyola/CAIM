The problem of detecting the ability of some metal oxides as photocatalysts is receiving considerable
attention in the world. The studied zinc oxide is considered as one of the most utilized semiconductors,
due to its direct band gap of 3.37 eV and a large exciton binding energy of 60 meV at room temperature.
The characteristic formulation of Copper doped zinc oxide is implemented to obtain an improved
adsorption kinetics and photocatalytic activity of zinc oxide photocatalyst capable of evolving
estimated photoluminescence (PL) spectra of zinc oxide nanoparticles to explore the effect of
Copper doping and annealing temperature on its optical properties. using Solgel spin coating technique,
Zinc oxide and copper doped zinc oxide thin films were deposited on borosilicate substrate and all
films was annealed at 500 C for 5- hours. Optical properties of the films have been studied using spectrophotometer
in the wavelength range 300-800nm and structure of zinc oxide films is investigated and included
reported, also the effect of the doping concentration of Copper. Further the characteristic formulation
to treat the photocatalytic performance of pure zinc oxide and Copper Doped zinc oxide samples were
investigated through the degradation of Malachite Green (MG), as a model of organic pollutants,
under UV light irradiation. Mainly, these films exhibited a good transparency in the visible region.
It was observed that when the doping concentration increased, the transmittance also increased.
irradiation for different times.
