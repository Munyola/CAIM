We study fluid-structure interactions (FSIs) in a long and shallow microchannel, conveying a non-Newtonian
fluid, at steady state. The microchannel has a linearly elastic and compliant top wall, while its
three other walls are rigid. The fluid flowing inside the microchannel has a shear-dependent viscosity
described by the power-law rheological model. We employ lubrication theory to solve for the flow
problem inside the long and shallow microchannel. For the structural problem, we employ two plate
theories, namely Kirchhoff-Love theory of thin plates and Reissner-Mindlin first-order shear
deformation theory. The hydrodynamic pressure couples the flow and deformation problem by acting
as a distributed load onto the soft top wall. Within our perturbative (lubrication theory) approach,
we determine the relationship between flow rate and the pressure gradient, which is a nonlinear
first-order ordinary differential equation for the pressure. From the solution of this differential
equation, all other quantities of interest in non-Newtonian microchannel FSIs follow. Through
illustrative examples, we show the effect of FSI coupling strength and the plate thickness on the
pressure drop across the microchannel. Through direct numerical simulation of non-Newtonian
microchannel FSIs using commercial computational engineering tools, we benchmark the prediction
from our mathematical prediction for the flow rate-pressure drop relation and the structural deformation
profile of the top wall. In doing so, we also establish the limits of applicability of our perturbative
theory.
