Mobile phones and the Internet of Things provide unprecedented opportunities for transportation
researchers and computational social scientists to observe city-scale human dynamics in terms
of millions of vehicles or people moving around. They also enable policy researchers to identify
the best strategies to influence the individuals in order for the complex system to achieve the best
utility. However, the mobility data become sparse at the individual level and it is non-trivial
to stitch together the isolated observations with high fidelity models to infer the macroscopic
dynamics. In this paper, we introduce a discrete-event decision process to capture the high fidelity
dynamics of a complex system at the individual level in terms of a collection of microscopic events
where each one brings minimum changes but together induce complex behaviors. We further derive
a particle filter algorithm to connect the dots of isolated observations through driving the discrete-event
decision process in agreement with these observations. Finally, we solve a partially observable
Markov decision process problem through reducing it into a learning and inference task. Evaluation
with one synthesized dataset (SynthTown), one partly real and partly synthesized dataset (Berlin),
and three real world datasets (Santiago de Chile, Dakar, and NYC) show that the discrete-event decision
process gives an accurate estimation of complex system dynamics due to its better integration of
high-fidelity dynamics and human mobility data.
