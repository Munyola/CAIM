Shell models of hydrodynamic turbulence originated in the seventies. Their main aim was to describe
the statistics of homogeneous and isotropic turbulence in spectral space, using a simple set of
ordinary differential equations. In the eighties, shell models of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD)
turbulence emerged based on the same principles as their hydrodynamic counter-part but also incorporating
interactions between magnetic and velocity fields. In recent years, significant improvements
have been made such as the inclusion of non-local interactions and appropriate definitions for
helicities. Though shell models cannot account for the spatial complexity of MHD turbulence, their
dynamics are not over simplified and do reflect those of real MHD turbulence including intermittency
or chaotic reversals of large-scale modes. Furthermore, these models use realistic values for
dimensionless parameters (high kinetic and magnetic Reynolds numbers, low or high magnetic Prandtl
number) allowing extended inertial range and accurate dissipation rate. Using modern computers
it is difficult to attain an inertial range of three decades with direct numerical simulations,
whereas eight are possible using shell models. In this review we set up a general mathematical framework
allowing the description of any MHD shell model. The variety of the latter, with their advantages
and weaknesses, is introduced. Finally we consider a number of applications, dealing with free-decaying
MHD turbulence, dynamo action, Alfven waves and the Hall effect.
