In a standard computed tomography (CT) image, pixels having the same Hounsfield Units (HU) can correspond
to different materials and it is, therefore, challenging to differentiate and quantify materials.
Dual-energy CT (DECT) is desirable to differentiate multiple materials, but DECT scanners are
not widely available as single-energy CT (SECT) scanners. Here we develop a deep learning approach
to perform DECT imaging by using standard SECT data. A deep learning model to map low-energy image
to high-energy image using a two-stage convolutional neural network (CNN) is developed. The model
was evaluated using 4949 images from 22 patients who received contrast-enhanced abdomen DECT scan
with a popular DE application: virtual non-contrast (VNC) imaging and contrast quantification.
The HU difference between the predicted and original high-energy CT images are 3.47, 2.95, 2.38
and 2.40 HU for ROIs on spine, aorta, liver, and stomach, respectively. The HU differences between
VNC images obtained from original DECT and deep learning DECT are 4.10, 3.75, 2.33 and 2.92 HU for
the 4 ROIs, respectively. The aorta iodine quantification difference between iodine maps obtained
from original DECT and deep learning DECT images is 0.9\%, suggesting high consistency between
the predicted and the original high-energy CT images. This study demonstrates that highly accurate
DECT imaging with single low-energy data is achievable by using a deep learning approach. The proposed
method can significantly simplify the DECT system design, reducing the scanning dose and imaging
cost.
