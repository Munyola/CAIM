This paper presents a theoretical and experimental study of the long-standing fluid mechanics
problem involving the temporal resolution of a large, localised initial disturbance into a sequence
of solitary waves. This problem is of fundamental importance in a range of applications including
tsunami and internal ocean wave modelling. This study is performed in the context of the viscous
fluid conduit system-the driven, cylindrical, free interface between two miscible Stokes fluids
with high viscosity contrast. Due to buoyancy induced nonlinear self-steepening balanced by stress
induced interfacial dispersion, the disturbance evolves into a slowly modulated wavetrain and
further, into a sequence of solitary waves. An extension of Whitham modulation theory, termed the
solitary wave resolution method, is used to resolve the fission of an initial disturbance into solitary
waves. The developed theory predicts the relationship between the initial disturbance's profile,
the number of emergent solitary waves, and their amplitude distribution, quantifying an extension
of the well-known soliton resolution conjecture from integrable systems to non-integrable systems
that often provide a more accurate modelling of physical systems. The theoretical predictions
for the fluid conduit system are confirmed both numerically and experimentally. The number of observed
solitary waves is consistently within 1-2 waves of the prediction, and the amplitude distribution
shows remarkable agreement. Universal properties of solitary wave fission in other fluid dynamics
problems are identified.
