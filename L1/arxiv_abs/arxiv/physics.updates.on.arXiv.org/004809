The process of divertor detachment, whereby particle fluxes to divertor surfaces are strongly
reduced, is required to reduce heat loading and erosion in a magnetic fusion reactor. The ions reaching
the target during divertor detachment are primarily generated in the divertor (ion source), which
costs energy. In addition, there can be additional ion sinks such as volumetric recombination.
Experimental power/particle balance investigations are thus crucial for understanding detachment
and were not possible previously. For that purpose, we have developed a new analysis technique for
the Balmer line series to extract information on power and particle balance. First we employ line
ratios to quantitatively separate excitation/recombination emission from the Balmer line series.
This enabled us to analyse each of those two components individually, ultimately providing ionisation/recombination
and hydrogenic excitation radiative loss measurements during attached and detached conditions
on the TCV tokamak. That analysis required the development of probabilistic Monte Carlo techniques
for full error propagation - eventually resulting in probability density functions for each output
variable; providing the most likely estimate as well as upper/lower limit uncertainties. This
combined with the full spectroscopic coverage; provides access to detailed power/particle balance
investigations crucial to the understanding of plasma detachment. These techniques and their
assumptions have been verified by comparing data inferred from a synthetic diagnostic against
outputs directly obtained using SOLPS simulations.
