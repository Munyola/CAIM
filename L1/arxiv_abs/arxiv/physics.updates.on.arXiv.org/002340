This paper suggests that business cycles may be a manifestation of coupled economy-market dynamics
and describes a mechanism that can generate economic fluctuations consistent with observed business
cycles. To this end, we seek to incorporate into the macroeconomic framework a dynamic stock market
model based on opinion interactions (Gusev et al., 2015). We derive this model from microfoundations,
provide its empirical verification including market return prediction (backtested and live-track),
demonstrate that it contains the efficient market as a particular regime and establish a link through
which economic models can be attached for the study of economy-market interaction. To examine key
effects, we link this market model with a simple economic model (Blanchard, 1981). The coupled system
generates nontrivial endogenous dynamics, which exhibit deterministic and stochastic features,
producing quasiperiodic fluctuations (business cycles). We also inspect this system's behavior
in the phase space. The economy and the market are shown to coevolve dynamically along the path governed
by a stochastically-forced dynamical system with two stable equilibria, one where the economy
expands and the other where it contracts, resulting in business cycles identified as the coherence
resonance phenomenon. Thus, the incorporation of market dynamics into the macroeconomic framework,
as presented here, allows the derivation of realistic behaviors in a tractable setting, and so could
enhance models applied for policy analysis.
