The search for novel topological systems and phase transitions has recently broadened to include
random substitutional alloys such as (AX)_x(BX)_{1-x}. Owing to disorder, such alloys lack translational
symmetry that defines wavevectors and the specific crystalline symmetries that protect topological
phases. We apply a disorder model within density functional formalism by solving the band structure
problems within large supercells, in which different local environments, as well as atomic displacements
and inter-site charge transfer are allowed. The "effective band structure" is then recovered by
unfolding the supercell eigen solutions. This provides spectral functions manifesting coherent
dispersive and incoherent broadening features, which reflects the above noted effects. Application
to the PbSe-SnSe topological crystalline insulator (TCI) alloys reveals that the (a) valley degeneracy
at the L points is removed by spatial randomness (valley splitting > 150 meV), and (b) absence of inversion
lifts spin degenerates. Consequently, (a) instead of finding a concurrent transition between
normal insulator and TCI phases, as predicted by standard alloy models that retain the high symmetry
of components, we find a new, sequential, one-by-one inversion of the split valley components over
a range of alloy compositions. Furthermore, (b) leads to a Weyl semimetal phase in this sequential
transition, even without the need of external magnetic field. We suggest that the sequential band
inversion can be measured in experiment.
