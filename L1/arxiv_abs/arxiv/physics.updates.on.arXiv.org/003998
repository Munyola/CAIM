Low-latitude rainfall variability on the daily to intraseasonal timescale is often related to
tropical waves, including convectively coupled equatorial waves, the Madden-Julian Oscillation
(MJO), and tropical disturbances. Despite the importance of rainfall variability for vulnerable
societies in tropical Africa, the relative influence of tropical waves for this region is largely
unknown. This article presents the first systematic comparison of the impact of six wave types on
precipitation over northern tropical Africa during the transition and full monsoon seasons, using
two satellite products and a dense rain gauge network. Composites of rainfall anomalies in the different
datasets show} comparable modulation intensities in the West Sahel and at the Guinea Coast, varying
from less than 2 to above 7 mm/d depending on the wave type. African Easterly Waves (AEWs) and Kelvin
waves dominate the 3-hourly to daily timescale and explain 10-30% locally. On longer timescales
(7-20d), only the MJO and equatorial Rossby (ER) waves remain as modulating factors and explain
about up to one third of rainfall variability. Eastward inertio-gravity waves and mixed Rossby-gravity
(MRG) waves are comparatively unimportant. An analysis of wave superposition shows that low-frequency
waves (MJO, ER) in their wet phase amplify the activity of high-frequency waves (TD, MRG) and suppress
them in the dry phase. The results stress that more attention should be paid to tropical waves when
forecasting rainfall over northern tropical Africa.
