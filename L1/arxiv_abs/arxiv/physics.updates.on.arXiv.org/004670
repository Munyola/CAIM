Townsend (1976) proposed a structural model for the logarithmic layer (log-layer) of wall turbulence
at high Reynolds numbers, where the dominant momentum-carrying motions are organised into a multi-scale
population of eddies attached to the wall. In the attached eddy framework, the relevant length and
velocity scales of the wall-attached eddies are the friction velocity and the distance to the wall.
In the present work, we hypothesise that the momentum-carrying eddies are controlled by the mean
momentum flux and mean shear with no explicit reference to the distance to the wall and propose new
characteristic velocity, length, and time scales consistent with this argument. Our hypothesis
is supported by direct numerical simulation (DNS) of turbulent channel flows driven by non-uniform
body forces and modified mean velocity profiles, where the resulting outer-layer flow structures
are substantially altered to accommodate the new mean momentum transfer. The proposed scaling
is further corroborated by simulations where the no-slip wall is replaced by a Robin boundary condition
for the three velocity components, allowing for substantial wall-normal transpiration at all
lengths scales. We show that the outer-layer one-point statistics and spectra of this channel with
transpiration agree quantitatively with those of its wall-bounded counterpart. The results reveal
that the wall-parallel no-slip condition is not required to recover classic wall-bounded turbulence
far from the wall and, more importantly, neither is the impermeability condition at the wall.
