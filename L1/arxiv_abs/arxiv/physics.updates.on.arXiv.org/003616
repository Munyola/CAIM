Presented are new correlations for skin-friction and forced convection from an isothermal plate
having root-mean-squared height-of-roughness $\varepsilon_q$. Corresponding to Prandtl and
Schlichting's "fully-developed roughness" region, the skin-friction correlation is independent
of Reynolds number; the convection correlation is a linear function of Reynolds number (versus
an exponent of ${4/5}$ for turbulent convection from a smooth plate). $$f_c={1\over16\left[\log_{10}{\varepsilon_q\over
L}\right]^{2}} \qquad {\rm Nu}={{\rm Re}~{\rm Pr}^{1/3}\over32\left[\log_{10}{\varepsilon_q\over
L}\right]^{2}}$$ Measurements taken of a plate having precisely 3 mm of roughness match the convection
correlation within 3% at Reynolds numbers from 5000 to 50000. A formula addressing the transition
from fully-rough turbulent to smooth turbulent convection for this bi-level test plate matches
those measurements within 2% from Re=5000 to 80000. Convection measurements of a bi-level plate
having 1.03 mm of roughness are within the expected measurement uncertainties of the transition
formula. An analysis of sand-roughness finds that its relation to root-mean-squared height-of-roughness
is non-linear. The resulting scale error explains discrepancies between the Prandtl and Schlichting
formula, two recent papers, and the results presented here. These new correlations and measurements
imply a threefold tighter upper bound for the height of admissible-roughness than is given in Schlichting's
book Boundary-layer theory.
