The interpretation of the DAMA seasonal variation pattern as a Dark Matter (DM) effect rests on the
assumption that all sources of variable background have been excluded from the measurement. We
have identified an overlooked background that mimics the DM signature -- a large, patently existing
effect that has nothing to do with detection within the scintillators. This process takes place
exclusively within the individual photomultiplier tubes (PMTs), with two familiar actors (thermionic
electrons and helium atoms), two familiar processes (helium penetration of glass and ion afterpulsing),
and a simple storyline: (a) After defeating the insulation of the DAMA detector, helium atoms from
the variable local environment penetrate the PMT vacua; (b) Thermionic electrons from the PMT photocathode
ionize helium atoms; (c) Secondary electrons from each helium ion impact in the photocathode form
an afterpulse, and thus effectively boost and extend the waveform. We demonstrate that the accidental
coincidences of such inflated dark noise waveforms, originating from any pair of PMTs, mimic scintillation
events at a rate of $\approx$ 1 cpd/kg/keV, which is consistent with DAMA result. The reported seasonal
variation of $\sim$ 1% thus implicates an equivalent variation of helium concentration in the local
environment. We predict that the DAMA detector with a modified readout logic -- blinded for the DM
scintillation events \textendash will measure the same, helium -- driven seasonal variation pattern
as the original detector.
