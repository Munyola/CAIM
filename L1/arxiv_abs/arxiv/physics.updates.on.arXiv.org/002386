Multipartite viruses replicate through a puzzling evolutionary strategy. These viruses have
their genomes segmented into two or more parts encapsidated in separate particles that propagate
independently. The requirement of host co-infection to complete the viral cycle represents a major
drawback of this adaptive strategy, while its advantages remain unclear. Still, multipartitism
is a successful adaptive solution observed in over 40% of all known viral families, particularly
targeting plants. The transition from a monopartite to a bipartite viral form has been described
in vitro under conditions of high multiplicity of infection, suggesting that cooperation between
defective mutants is a plausible evolutionary pathway towards multipartitism. Here we devise
a compartmental model for the spread of a multipartite virus in a population of hosts through vector
mediated contacts. Our goal is to disentangle which mechanisms might favor the ecological emergence
and persistence of multipartitism. Our analytical and numerical results uncover a rich phenomenology
driven by the interplay between viral dynamics, vector driven mobility, and the structure of the
host population. In the framework of our model, multipartitism appears as a successful adaptive
strategy driven by mobility, that permits the colonization of environments forbidden to the nonsegmented
variant. Surprisingly, this is promoted in homogeneous contact networks, which corresponds to
the vast majority of farmed plant patterns. This is also in line with the observed rising of multipartitism
concomitantly with the agricultural expansion.
