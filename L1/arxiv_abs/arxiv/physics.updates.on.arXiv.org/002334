New results on the short-term galactic cosmic ray (GCR) intensity variation (Forbush decrease)
in December 2006 measured by the PAMELA instrument are presented. Forbush decreases are sudden
suppressions of the GCR intensities which are associated with the passage of interplanetary transients
such as shocks and interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs). Most of the past measurements
of this phenomenon were carried out with ground-based detectors such as neutron monitors or muon
telescopes. These techniques allow only the indirect detection of the overall GCR intensity over
an integrated energy range. For the first time, thanks to the unique features of the PAMELA magnetic
spectrometer, the Forbush decrease commencing on 2006 December 14, following a CME at the Sun on
2006 December 13 was studied in a wide rigidity range (0.4 - 20 GV) and for different species of GCRs
detected directly in space. The daily averaged GCR proton intensity was used to investigate the
rigidity dependence of the amplitude and the recovery time of the Forbush decrease. Additionally,
for the first time, the temporal variations in the helium and electron intensities during a Forbush
decrease were studied. Interestingly, the temporal evolutions of the helium and proton intensities
during the Forbush decrease were found in good agreement, while the low rigidity electrons (< 2 GV)
displayed a faster recovery. This difference in the electron recovery is interpreted as a charge-sign
dependence introduced by drift motions experienced by the GCRs during their propagation through
the heliosphere.
