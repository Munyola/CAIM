We describe a new micro-pattern gas detector structure comprising a multi-layer hole-type multiplier
(M-THGEM) combined with two in-built electrode meshes: the Multi-Mesh THGEM-type multiplier
(MM-THGEM). Suitable potential differences applied between the various electrodes provide an
efficient collection of ionization electrons within the MM-THGEM holes and a large charge avalanche
multiplication between the meshes. Different from conventional hole-type multipliers (e.g.
Gas Electron Multipliers - GEMs, Thick Gas Electron Multipliers - THGEMs, etc.), which are characterized
by a variable (dipole-like) field strength inside the avalanche gap, electrons in MM-THGEMs are
largely multiplied by a strong uniform field established between the two meshes, like in the parallel-plate
avalanche geometry. The presence of the two meshes within the holes allows for the trapping of a large
fraction of the positive ions that stream back to the drift region. A gas gain above 10^5 has been achieved
for single photo-electron detection with a single MM-THGEM in Ar/(10%)CH4 and He/(10%)CO2, at
standard conditions for temperature and pressure. When the MM-THGEM is coupled to a conventional
THGEM and used as first cascade element, the maximum achievable gains reach values above 10^6 in
He/(10%)CO2, while the IBF approaches of 1.5% in the case of optimum detector-bias configuration.
This IBF value is several times lower compared to the one obtained by a double GEM/THGEM detector
(5-10%), and equivalent to the performance attained by a Micromegas detector.
