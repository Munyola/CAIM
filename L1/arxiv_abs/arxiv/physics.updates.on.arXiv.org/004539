Introduction. The aim is to provide a summary of methods available for the assessment of tear turnover
and tear clearance rates. The review defines tear clearance and tear turnover and describes their
implication for ocular surface health. Additionally, it describes main types of techniques for
measuring tear turnover, including fluorescein tear clearance tests, techniques utilizing electromagnetic
spectrum and tracer molecule and novel experimental techniques utilizing optical coherence tomography
and fluorescein profilometry. Areas covered. Internet databases (PubMed, Science Direct, Google
Scholar) and most frequently cited references were used as a principal resource of information
on tear turnover rate and tear clearance rate, presenting methodologies and equipment, as well
as their definition and implications for the anterior eye surface health and function. Keywords
used for data-search were as follows: tear turnover, tear clearance, fluorescein clearance, scintigraphy,
fluorophotometry, tear flow, drainage, tear meniscus dynamics, Krehbiel flow and lacrimal functional
unit. Expert Commentary. After decades, the topic of tear turnover assessment is reintroduced.
Recently, new techniques have been developed to propose less invasive, less time consuming and
simpler methodologies for the assessment of tear dynamics that have the potential to be utilized
in a clinical practice. Keywords. Fluorescein clearance test, fluorophotometry, tear clearance,
tear film dynamics, tear turnover, scintigraphy, optical coherence tomography.
