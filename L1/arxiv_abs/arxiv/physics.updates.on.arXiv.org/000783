Hydraulic fracturing (fracking) using high pressures and a low viscosity fluid allow the extraction
of large quantiles of oil and gas from very low permeability shale formations. The initial production
of oil and gas at depth leads to high pressures and an extensive distribution of natural fractures
which reduce the pressures. With time these fractures heal, sealing the remaining oil and gas in
place. High volume fracking opens the healed fractures allowing the oil and gas to flow the horizontal
productions wells. We model the injection process using invasion percolation. We utilize a 2D square
lattice of bonds to model the sealed natural fractures. The bonds are assigned random strengths
and the fluid, injected at a point, opens the weakest bond adjacent to the growing cluster of opened
bonds. Our model exhibits burst dynamics in which the clusters extends rapidly into regions with
weak bonds. We associate these bursts with the microseismic activity generated by fracking injections.
A principal object of this paper is to study the role of anisotropic stress distributions. Bonds
in the $y$-direction are assigned higher random strengths than bonds in the $x$-direction. We illustrate
the spatial distribution of clusters and the spatial distribution of bursts (small earthquakes)
for several degrees of anisotropy. The results are compared with observed distributions of microseismicity
in a fracking injection. Both our bursts and the observed microseismicity satisfy Gutenberg-Richter
frequency-size statistics.
