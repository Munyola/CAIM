Two different types of experiments were performed. In the first experiment, we studied the low-temperature
condensation of vaporized graphite inside bulk liquid helium, while in the second experiment,
we studied the condensation of single carbon atoms together with H$_2$, H$_2$O, and CO molecules
inside helium nanodroplets. The condensation of vaporized graphite leads to the formation of partially
graphitized carbon, which indicates high temperatures, supposedly higher than 1000{\deg}C,
during condensation. Possible underlying processes responsible for the instant rise in temperature
during condensation are discussed. This suggests that such processes cause the presence of partially
graphitized carbon dust formed by low-temperature condensation in the diffuse interstellar medium.
Alternatively, in the denser regions of the ISM, the condensation of carbon atoms together with
the most abundant interstellar molecules (H$_2$, H$_2$O, and CO), leads to the formation of complex
organic molecules (COMs) and finally organic polymers. Water molecules were found not to be involved
directly in the reaction network leading to the formation of COMs. It was proposed that COMs are formed
via the addition of carbon atoms to H$_2$ and CO molecules $(C + H_2 \rightarrow HCH, HCH + CO \rightarrow
OCCH_2)$. Due to the involvement of molecular hydrogen, the formation of COMs by carbon addition
reactions should be more efficient at high extinctions compared with the previously proposed reaction
scheme with atomic hydrogen.
