We present a coarse-grained model for stochastic transport of noninteracting chemical signals
inside neuronal dendrites and show how first-passage properties depend on the key structural factors
affected by neurodegenerative disorders or aging: the extent of the tree, the topological bias
induced by segmental decrease of dendrite diameter, and the trapping probabilities in biochemical
cages and growth cones. We derive an exact expression for the distribution of first-passage times,
which follows a universal exponential decay in the long-time limit. The asymptotic mean first-passage
time exhibits a crossover from power-law to exponential scaling upon reducing the topological
bias. We calibrate the coarse-grained model parameters and obtain the variation range of the mean
first-passage time when the geometrical characteristics of the dendritic structure evolve during
the course of aging or neurodegenerative disease progression (A few disorders are chosen and studied
for which clear trends for the pathological changes of dendritic structure have been reported in
the literature). We prove the validity of our analytical approach under realistic fluctuations
of structural parameters, by comparing to the results of Monte Carlo simulations. Moreover, by
constructing local structural irregularities, we analyze the resulting influence on transport
of chemical signals and formation of heterogeneous density patterns. Since neural functions rely
on chemical signal transmission to a large extent, our results open the possibility to establish
a direct link between the disease progression and neural functions.
