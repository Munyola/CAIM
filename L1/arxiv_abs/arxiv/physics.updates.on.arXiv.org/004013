Thanks to the use of geolocated big data in computational social science research, the spatial and
temporal heterogeneity of human activities are increasingly being revealed. Paired with smaller
and more traditional data, this opens new ways of understanding how people act and move, and how these
movements crystallise into the structural patterns observed by censuses. In this article we explore
the convergence of mobile phone data with more classical socioeconomic data from census in French
cities. We extract mobile phone indicators from six months worth of Call Detail Records (CDR) data,
while census and administrative data are used to characterize the socioeconomic organisation
of French cities. We address various definitions of cities and investigate how they impact the relation
between mobile phone indicators, such as the number of calls or the entropy of visited cell towers,
and measures of economic organisation based on census data, such as the level of deprivation, inequality
and segregation. Our findings show that some mobile phone indicators relate significantly with
different socioeconomic organisation of cities. However, we show that found relations are sensitive
to the way cities are defined and delineated. In several cases, differing city definitions delineations
can change the significance or even the signs of found correlations. In general, cities delineated
in a restricted way (central cores only) exhibit traces of human activity which are less related
to their socioeconomic organisation than cities delineated as metropolitan areas and dispersed
urban regions.
