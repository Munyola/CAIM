We propose and develop an electrical and mechanical system model of a single-axis linear-motion
kinetic energy harvester for impulsive excitation that allows its generated load power to be numerically
optimised as a function of design parameters. The device consists of an assembly of one or more spaced
magnets suspended by a magnetic spring and passing through one or more coils when motion is experienced
along the axis. The design parameters that can be optimised include the number of coils, the coil
height, coil spacing, the number of magnets, the magnet spacing and the physical size. We use the
proposed model to design optimal energy harvesters for the case of impulse-like motion like that
experienced when attached to the leg of a human. We generate several optimised designs, ranked in
terms of their predicted load power output. The three best designs are subsequently constructed
and subjected to controlled practical evaluation while attached to the leg of a human subject. The
results show that the ranking of the measured output power corresponds to the ranking predicted
by the optimisation, and that the numerical model correctly Predicts the relative differences
in generated power for complex motion. It is also found that all three designs far outperform a baseline
design. The best energy harvesters generated an average power of 3.01mW into a 40$\Omega$ test load
when driven by footsteps whose measured peak impact was approximately 2.2g. With respect to the
device dimensions, this corresponds to a power density of 179.380$\mu\text{W/cm}^3$.
