We present proof-of-concept imaging measurements of a polycrystalline material that integrate
the elements of conventional high-energy X-ray diffraction microscopy with coherent diffraction
imaging techniques, and that can enable in-situ strain-sensitive imaging of lattice structure
in ensembles of deeply embedded crystals over five decades of length scale upon full realization.
Such multi-scale imaging capabilities are critical to addressing important questions in a variety
of research areas such as materials science and engineering, chemistry, and solid state physics.
Towards this eventual goal, the following key aspects are demonstrated: 1) high-energy Bragg coherent
diffraction imaging (HE-BCDI) of sub-micron-scale crystallites at 52 keV at current third-generation
synchrotron light sources, 2) HE-BCDI performed in conjunction with far-field high-energy diffraction
microscopy (ff-HEDM) on the grains of a polycrystalline sample in an smoothly integrated manner,
and 3) the orientation information of an ensemble of grains obtained via ff-HEDM used to perform
complementary HE-BCDI on multiple Bragg reflections of a single targeted grain. These steps lay
the foundation for integration of HE-BCDI, which typically provides a spatial resolution tens
of nanometers, into a broad suite of well-established HEDM methods, extending HEDM beyond the few-micrometer
resolution bound and into the nanoscale, and positioning the approach to take full advantage of
the orders-of-magnitude improvement of X-ray coherence expected at fourth generation light sources
presently being built and commissioned worldwide.
