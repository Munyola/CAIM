In ferromagnetic (FM) metal/organic semiconductor (OSC) heterostructures charge transfer can
occur which leads to induction of magnetism in the non-magnetic OSC. This phenomenon has been described
by the change in the density of states in the OSC which leads to a finite magnetic moment at the OSC interface
and it is called the "spinterface". One of the main motivation in this field of organic spintronics
is how to control the magnetic moment in the spinterface. In this regard, there are several open questions
such as (i) which combination of FM and OSC can lead to more moment at the spinterface? (ii) Is the thickness
of OSC also important? (iii) How does the spinterface moment vary with the FM thickness? (iv) Does
the crystalline quality of the FM matters? (v) What is the effect of spinterface on magnetization
reversal, domain structure and anisotropy? In this context, we have tried to answer the last three
issues in this paper by studying Fe/C$_{60}$ bilayers of variable Fe thickness deposited on Si substrates.
We find that both the induced moment and thickness of the spinterface vary proportionally with the
Fe thickness. Such behavior is explained in terms of the growth quality of the Fe layer on the native
oxide of the Si (100) substrate. The magnetization reversal, domain structure and anisotropy of
these bilayer samples were studied and compared with their respective reference samples without
having the C$_{60}$ layer. It is observed that the formation of spinterface leads to reduction in
uniaxial anisotropy in Fe/C$_{60}$ on Si (100) in comparison to their reference samples.
