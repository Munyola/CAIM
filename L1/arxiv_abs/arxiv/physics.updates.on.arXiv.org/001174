Subject of this paper falls under the broad heading of the propagation of disturbances causing transition
in a fully developed spiral annular flow. The problem is approached through reformulation of the
linearised equations of motion governing small-amplitude disturbances in a parameter space that
differs from that conventionally employed for this purpose. The alternative parameter space comprises
a suitably defined Reynolds number that is formed with a resultant characteristic velocity which
is a vector sum of the axial and azimuthal characteristic velocities, a swirl parameter that is the
ratio of the azimuthal to the axial characteristic velocity, and the ratio of the annular gap to the
mean diameter of the cylinders. In the limits of the swirl parameter assuming very small or very large
values, the newly derived generalised Orr-Sommerfeld and Squire equations for disturbance propagation
in the revised parameter space reduce to the corresponding equations that are known and well established
for the limiting cases of disturbance propagation as the swirl parameter goes to zero or infinity
respectively. Furthermore, they also lead naturally to the criterion that determines from the
equations themselves the analytical expression for the location of the critical layer in spiral
annular flow, the scaling behaviour of the thickness of the critical layer with the Reynolds number
and the swirl parameter, and the equation governing the dynamics of the flow in the critical layer.
They thus explicitly reveal the effect of swirl on the critical layer.
