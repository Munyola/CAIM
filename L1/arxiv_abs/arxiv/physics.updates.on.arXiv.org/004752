We use particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations to study the effects of variations of the incoming 400
GeV proton bunch parameters on the amplitude and phase of the wakefields resulting from a seeded
self-modulation (SSM) process. We find that these effects are largest during the growth of the SSM,
i.e. over the first five to six meters of plasma with an electron density of $7 \times10^{14}$ cm$^{-3}$.
However, for variations of any single parameter by $\pm$5%, effects after the SSM saturation point
are small. In particular, the phase variations correspond to much less than a quarter wakefield
period, making deterministic injection of electrons (or positrons) into the accelerating and
focusing phase of the wakefields in principle possible. We use the wakefields from the simulations
and a simple test electron model to estimate the same effects on the maximum final energies of electrons
injected along the plasma, which are found to be below the initial variations of $\pm$5%. This analysis
includes the dephasing of the electrons with respect to the wakefields that is expected during the
growth of the SSM. Based on a PIC simulation, we also determine the injection position along the bunch
and along the plasma leading to the largest energy gain. For the parameters taken here (ratio of peak
beam density to plasma density $n_{b0}/n_0 \approx 0.003$), we find that the optimum position along
the proton bunch is at $\xi \approx -1.5 \; \sigma_{zb}$, and that the optimal range for injection
along the plasma (for a highest final energy of $\sim$1.6 GeV after 10 m) is 5-6 m.
