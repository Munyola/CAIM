Light detection and ranging (LIDAR) is critical to many fields in science and industry. Over the
last decade, optical frequency combs were shown to offer unique advantages in optical ranging,
in particular when it comes to fast distance acquisition with high accuracy. However, current comb-based
concepts are not suited for emerging high-volume applications such as drone navigation or autonomous
driving. These applications critically rely on LIDAR systems that are not only accurate and fast,
but also compact, robust, and amenable to cost-efficient mass-production. Here we show that integrated
dissipative Kerr-soliton (DKS) comb sources provide a route to chip-scale LIDAR systems that combine
sub-wavelength accuracy and unprecedented acquisition speed with the opportunity to exploit
advanced photonic integration concepts for wafer-scale mass production. In our experiments,
we use a pair of free-running DKS combs, each providing more than 100 carriers for massively parallel
synthetic-wavelength interferometry. We demonstrate dual-comb distance measurements with
record-low Allan deviations down to 12 nm at averaging times of 14 $\mu$s as well as ultrafast ranging
at unprecedented measurement rates of up to 100 MHz. We prove the viability of our technique by sampling
the naturally scattering surface of air-gun projectiles flying at 150 m/s (Mach 0.47). Combining
integrated dual-comb LIDAR engines with chip-scale nanophotonic phased arrays, the approach
could allow widespread use of compact ultrafast ranging systems in emerging mass applications.
