We present a study for the generation of events from a physical process with generative deep learning.
To simulate physical processes it is not only important to produce physical events, but also to produce
the events with the right frequency of occurrence (density). We investigate the feasibility to
learn the event generation and the frequency of occurrence with Generative Adversarial Networks
(GANs) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) to produce events like Monte Carlo generators. We study
three toy models from high energy physics, i.e. a simple two-body decay, the processes $e^+e^-\to
Z \to l^+l^-$ and $p p \to t\bar{t} $ including the decay of the top quarks and a simulation of the detector
response. We show that GANs and the standard VAE do not produce the right distributions. By buffering
density information of Monte Carlo events in latent space given the encoder of a VAE we are able to
construct a prior for the sampling of new events from the decoder that yields distributions that
are in very good agreement with real Monte Carlo events and are generated $\mathcal{O}(10^8)$ times
faster. Applications of this work include generic density estimation and sampling, targeted event
generation via a principal component analysis of encoded events in the latent space and the possibility
to generate better random numbers for importance sampling, e.g. for the phase space integration
of matrix elements in quantum perturbation theories. The method also allows to build event generators
directly from real data events.
