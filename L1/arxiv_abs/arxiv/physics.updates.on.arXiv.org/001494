Using transfer-matrix methods, we investigate the response of a multilayered metamaterial system
containing defects to an incident acoustic plane wave at normal or oblique incidence. The transmission
response consists of regions of Bloch oscillations separated by band gaps and covers a wide spectral
range. The presence of gain and loss in the layers leads to the emergence of $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry
breaking and re-entrant phases. In the general case, a system containing defects will display a
more general property, pseudo-Hermiticity (PH), of which $\mathcal{PT}$ systems are a subset.
In the PH-symmetric phase, unidirectional responses of the reflection, accomplished by reversing
the parity $\mathcal{P}$, can be found but the response sometimes deviates from the predictions
of simple scattering theory which call for a pseudo-unitarity relation relating the transmission
and the two directions of reflections to hold. The converse of reversing the parity, reversing the
time operator $\mathcal{T}$ in a spatially asymmetric system within the PH-symmetric regime can
lead to different transmissions: pass-band versus a stop-band. As regions of stable PH-symmetric
Bloch oscillations occur over a wide spectral range, there is a large flexibility in system parameters
such as layer thicknesses, for leading to the desired unidirectional traits. In addition, we find
that while defects in general lead to a near or complete loss of PH symmetry at all frequencies, they
can be exploited to produce highly-sensitive responses, making such systems good candidates for
sensor applications.
