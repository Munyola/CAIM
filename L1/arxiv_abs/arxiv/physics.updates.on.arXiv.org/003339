While other fields such as statistics and education have examined various issues with quantitative
work, few studies in physics education research (PER) have done so. We conducted a two-phase study
to identify and to understand the extent of these issues in quantitative PER . During Phase 1, we conducted
a focus group of three experts in this area, followed by six interviews. Subsequent interviews refined
our plan. Both the focus group and interviews revealed issues regarding the lack of details in sample
descriptions, lack of institutional/course contextual information, lack of reporting on limitation,
and overgeneralization or overstatement of conclusions. During Phase 2, we examined 72 manuscripts
that used four conceptual or attitudinal assessments (Force Concept Inventory, Conceptual Survey
of Electricity and Magnetism, Brief Electricity and Magnetism Assessment, and Colorado Learning
Attitudes about Science Survey). Manuscripts were coded on whether they featured various sample
descriptions, institutional/course context information, limitations, and whether they overgeneralized
conclusions. We also analyzed the data to see if reporting has changed from the earlier periods to
more recent times. We found that not much has changed regarding sample descriptions and institutional/course
context information, but reporting and overgeneralizing conclusions has improved over time.
We offer some questions for researchers, reviewers, and readers in PER to consider when conducting
or using quantitative work.
