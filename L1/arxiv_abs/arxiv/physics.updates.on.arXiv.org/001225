Climate models are often affected by long-term drift that is revealed by the evolution of global
variables such as the ocean temperature or the surface air temperature. This spurious trend reduces
the fidelity to initial conditions and has a great influence on the equilibrium climate after long
simulation times. Useful insight on the nature of the climate drift can be obtained using two global
metrics, i.e. the energy imbalance at the top of the atmosphere and at the ocean surface. The former
is an indicator of the limitations within a given climate model, at the level of both numerical implementation
and physical parameterisations, while the latter is an indicator of the goodness of the tuning procedure.
Using the MIT general circulation model, we construct different configurations with various degree
of complexity (i.e. different parameterisations for the bulk cloud albedo, inclusion or not of
friction heating, different bathymetry configurations) to which we apply the same tuning procedure
in order to obtain control runs for fixed external forcing where the climate drift is minimised.
We find that the interplay between tuning procedure and different configurations of the same climate
model provides crucial information on the stability of the control runs and on the goodness of a given
parameterisation. This approach is particularly relevant for constructing good-quality control
runs of the geological past where huge uncertainties are found in both initial and boundary conditions.
We will focus on robust results that can be generally applied to other climate models.
