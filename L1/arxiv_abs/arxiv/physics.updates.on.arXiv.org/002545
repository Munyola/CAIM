In reservoir simulation, solution of the coupled systems of nonlinear algebraic equations that
are associated with fully-implicit (backward Euler) discretization is challenging. Having a
robust and efficient nonlinear solver is necessary in order for reservoir simulation to serve as
the primary tool for managing the recovery processes of large-scale reservoirs. Here, we develop
a continuation method based on the use of a dissipation operator to simulate nonlinear two-phase
flow and transport in heterogeneous porous media in the presence of viscous, gravitational, and
capillary forces. The homotopy is constructed by adding numerical dissipation to the discrete
conservation equations. A continuation parameter is introduced to control the amount of dissipation.
Numerical evidence of multi-dimensional models and detailed analysis of single-cell problems
are used to explain how the dissipation operator improves the nonlinear convergence of the coupled
system of equations. An adaptive strategy to determine the optimum dissipation coefficient is
proposed. The adaptive dissipation is computed locally for each cell interface, and is applicable
to coupled flow and transport. We demonstrate the efficacy of the new nonlinear solver using several
examples, including 1D scalar transport and 2D heterogeneous problems with fully-coupled flow
and transport. The new solver exhibits superior convergence properties compared with the standard
Newton solver used in reservoir simulation. We show that the new solver works robustly for a wide
range of flow conditions without parameter tuning of the dissipation operator.
