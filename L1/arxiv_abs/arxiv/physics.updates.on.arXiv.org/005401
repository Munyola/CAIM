An innovative \textit{deep learning} approach has been adopted to formulate the eddy-viscosity
for large eddy simulation (LES) of wall-bounded turbulent flows. A deep neural network (DNN) is
developed which learns to evaluate the eddy-viscosity from a dataset generated for a channel flow
at friction Reynolds number $Re_{\tau} = 395$ using the Dynamic Smagorinsky subgrid-scale model.
Later this DNN is employed to predict the eddy-viscosity for a number of grid configurations for
channel flow at $Re_{\tau} = 395$ and $590$. The statistics computed from the DNN based LES model
show an excellent match with direct numerical simulations (DNS). In some cases, particularly for
the coarse grid simulations, the DNN based model yields statistics closer to DNS than those from
the Dynamic Smagorinsky model. The turbulent kinetic energy budget terms also manifest a satisfactory
match with the DNS results. This model computes eddy-viscosity $2-8$ times quicker than the Dynamic
Smagorinsky model. This DNN based LES model is also able to closely mimic the duct flow at $Re_{\tau}
= 300$ in a qualitatively and quantitatively similar manner as the LES using the Dynamic Smagorinsky
model and a DNS from a previous study. This study demonstrates the feasibility of deep learning for
parameterizing the subgrid-scales (SGS) in a turbulent flow accurately in a cost-effective manner.
In a broader perspective, deep learning based models can be a promising alternative to traditional
RANS and LES models for simulating complex turbulent flows.
