Future sea-level rise drives severe risks for many coastal communities. Strategies to manage these
risks hinge on a sound characterization of the uncertainties. For example, recent studies suggest
that large fractions of the Antarctic ice sheet (AIS) may rapidly disintegrate in response to rising
global temperatures, leading to potentially several meters of sea-level rise during the next few
centuries. It is deeply uncertain, for example, whether such an AIS disintegration will be triggered,
how much this would increase sea-level rise, whether extreme storm surges intensify in a warming
climate, or which emissions pathway future societies will choose. Here, we assess the impacts of
these deep uncertainties on projected flooding probabilities for a levee ring in New Orleans, Louisiana.
We use 18 scenarios, presenting probabilistic projections within each one, to sample key deeply
uncertain future projections of sea-level rise, radiative forcing pathways, storm surge characterization,
and contributions from rapid AIS mass loss. The implications of these deep uncertainties for projected
flood risk are thus characterized by a set of 18 probability distribution functions. We use a global
sensitivity analysis to assess which mechanisms contribute to uncertainty in projected flood
risk over the course of a 50-year design life. In line with previous work, we find that the uncertain
storm surge drives the most substantial risk, followed by general AIS dynamics, in our simple model
for future flood risk for New Orleans.
