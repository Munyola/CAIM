Carbon dioxide (CO2) capture and subsurface storage is one method for reducing anthropogenic CO2
emissions to mitigate climate change. It is well known that large-scale fluid injection into the
subsurface leads to a buildup in pressure that gradually spreads and dissipates through lateral
and vertical migration of water. This dissipation can have an important feedback on the shape of
the CO2 plume during injection, and the impact of vertical pressure dissipation, in particular,
remains poorly understood. Here, we investigate the impact of lateral and vertical pressure dissipation
on the injection of CO2 into a layered aquifer system. We develop a compressible, two-phase model
that couples pressure dissipation to the propagation of a CO2 gravity current. We show that our vertically
integrated, sharp-interface model is capable of efficiently and accurately capturing water migration
in a layered aquifer system with an arbitrary number of aquifers. We identify two limiting cases
--- `no leakage' and `strong leakage' --- in which we derive analytical expressions for the water
pressure field for the corresponding single-phase injection problem. We demonstrate that pressure
dissipation acts to suppress the formation of an advancing CO2 tongue during injection, resulting
in a plume with a reduced lateral extent. The properties of the seals and the number of aquifers determine
the strength of pressure dissipation and subsequent coupling with the CO2 plume. The impact of pressure
dissipation on the shape of the CO2 plume is likely to be important for storage efficiency and security.
