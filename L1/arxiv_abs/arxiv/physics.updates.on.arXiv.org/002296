A new theoretical method is presented for future multi-scale aerodynamic optimisation of very
large wind farms. The new method essentially combines a recent two-scale coupled momentum analysis
of ideal wind turbine arrays with the classical blade-element-momentum (BEM) theory for turbine
rotor design, making it possible to explore some potentially important relationships between
the design of rotors and their performance in a very large wind farm. The details of the original two-scale
coupled momentum model are described first, where a parameter called 'effective' farm density
is shown to play an important role, followed by the new coupling procedure with the classical BEM
theory and some example solutions. The example solutions, obtained using a simplified but still
realistic NREL S809 airfoil performance curve, illustrate how the aerodynamically optimal rotor
design (namely the set of radial variations of the blade chord length and twist angle that maximises
the rotor power) may change depending on the effective farm density. It is also shown that the peak
power of the rotors designed optimally for a given farm (i.e. 'tuned' rotors) could be substantially
higher than that of the rotors designed for a different farm (i.e. 'untuned' rotors) even if the blade
pitch angle is allowed to be adjusted optimally during the operation of untuned rotors. The results
presented are for ideal very large wind farms and a possible future extension of the present work
for real large wind farms is also discussed briefly.
