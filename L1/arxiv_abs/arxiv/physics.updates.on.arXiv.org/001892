The paper is devoted to the derivation of a combined system of motion equations for solid and fluid
in isotropic tight oil/gas sandstone media through volume averaging theorems (VAT). Based on the
features of the media, four physical assumptions are proposed as the foundation for our derivation.
More precisely, volume averaging theorems are applied to the micro-scale motion equations for
both the solid and the fluid as well as to the stress-strain relations, resulting in a combined system
of macro-scale equations for the tight oil/gas sandstone media. It is worth noting that the four
assumptions may not be satisfied in the whole region. Nevertheless, since the characteristic diameter
for applying VAT ranges between $10^{-6}$ meters and dozens of meters, we may split the entire domain
into several sub-domains such that the four physical assumptions are satisfied in each sub-domain.
By choosing a proper characteristic diameter of an averaging volume, we derive a formula for the
fluid average pressure in terms of the divergence of the average displacement from the continuity
equation of the fluid. As a result, the motion equations derived in this paper are simpler than the
Biot equations, and are more suitable for inversion of porous medium parameters. When the fluid
is gas and the compressional wave is considered, the derived motion equations can be simplified
to the diffusive-viscous wave equation. Moreover, the explicit relationship between the coefficients
in this equation and medium parameters is very important for gas detection in tight gas sandstone.
