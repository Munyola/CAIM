Laminar natural convection heat transfer from two horizontally aligned square cylinders has been
investigated numerically using a finite-volume method (FVM) approach. Computations were performed
to delineate the momentum and heat transfer characteristics under the following ranges of parameters:
horizontal spacing between the cylinders (0 <= S/W <= 10), tilt angle of the square cylinder (0^0
<= {\delta} <= 60^0), and Grashof number (10 <= Gr <= 10^5) for some specific Newtonian fluids having
Prandtl number (0.71 <= Pr <= 7). The comprehensive results are represented in terms of temperature
contours and streamlines, velocity and temperature profiles, the mass flow rate in the passage
between the cylinders, local and average Nu, and the drag coefficient. Owing to the development
of a chimney effect, the heat transfer increases with decrease in the horizontal spacing up to a certain
limit, whereas it significantly degrades with a further decrease in the spacing. The square cylinder
having {\delta} = 45^0 shows a higher heat transfer, whereas it is least for {\delta} = 0^0. At higher
Gr and Pr, the average Nu is found to be in excess of 22% at {\delta} = 45^0 compared to at {\delta} = 0^0.
Overall, the average Nu has a strong dependence on both Gr and Pr, whereas it is a weak function of S/W
and {\delta}. Furthermore, the entropy generation is reproduced non-dimensionally in terms of
the Bejan number. Finally, a correlation for the average Nu has been developed, which can be useful
for the engineering calculations.
