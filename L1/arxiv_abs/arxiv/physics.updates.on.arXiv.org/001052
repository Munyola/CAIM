The nonclassical modification of plasmon-assisted fluorescence enhancement is theoretically
explored by placing two-level dipole emitters at the narrow gaps encountered in canonical plasmonic
architectures, namely dimers and trimers of different metallic nanoparticles. Through detailed
simulations, in comparison with appropriate analytical modelling, it is shown that within classical
electrodynamics, and for the reduced separations explored here, fluorescence enhancement factors
of the order of $10^{5}$ can be achieved, with a divergent behaviour as the particle touching regime
is approached. This remarkable prediction is mainly governed by the dramatic increase in excitation
rate triggered by the corresponding field enhancement inside the gaps. Nevertheless, once nonclassical
corrections are included, the amplification factors decrease by up to two orders of magnitude and
a saturation regime for narrower gaps is reached. These nonclassical limitations are demonstrated
by simulations based on the generalised nonlocal optical response theory, which accounts in an
efficient way not only for nonlocal screening, but also for the enhanced Landau damping near the
metal surface. A simple strategy to introduce nonlocal corrections to the analytic solutions is
also proposed. It is therefore shown that the nonlocal optical response of the metal imposes more
realistic, finite upper bounds to the enhancement feasible with ultrasmall plasmonic cavities,
thus providing a theoretical description closer to state of the art experiments.
