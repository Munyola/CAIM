We investigate flow instability created by an oblique shock wave impinging on a Mach 5.92 laminar
boundary layer at a transitional Reynolds number. The adverse pressure gradient of the oblique
shock causes the boundary layer to separate from the wall, resulting in the formation of a recirculation
bubble. For sufficiently large oblique shock angles, the recirculation bubble is unstable to three-dimensional
perturbations and the flow bifurcates from its original laminar state. We utilize Direct Numerical
Simulation (DNS) and Global Stability Analysis (GSA) to show that this first occurs at a critical
shock angle of $\theta = 12.9^o$. At bifurcation, the least stable global mode is non-oscillatory,
and it takes place at a spanwise wavenumber $\beta=0.25$, in good agreement with DNS results. Examination
of the critical global mode reveals that it originates from an interaction between small spanwise
corrugations at the base of the incident shock, streamwise vortices inside the recirculation bubble,
and spanwise modulation of the bubble strength. The global mode drives the formation of long streamwise
streaks downstream of the bubble. While the streaks may be amplified by either the lift-up effect
or by G\"ortler instability, we show that centrifugal instability plays no role in the upstream
self-sustaining mechanism of the global mode. We employ an adjoint solver to corroborate our physical
interpretation by showing that the critical global mode is most sensitive to base flow modifications
that are entirely contained inside the recirculation bubble.
