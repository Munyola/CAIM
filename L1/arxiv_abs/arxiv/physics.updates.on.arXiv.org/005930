In this work we revisit the classic problem of homogeneous nucleation of a liquid droplet in a supersaturated
vapor phase. We consider this at different extents of the driving force, which here is the extent
of supersaturation, and calculate a reaction coordinate (RC) for nucleation as the driving force
is varied. The RC is constructed as a linear combination of three order parameters, where one accounts
for the number of liquid-like atoms, and the other two for local density fluctuations. The RC is calculated
from all-atom biased and unbiased molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using the spectral gap optimization
approach "SGOOP" [P. Tiwary and B. J. Berne, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 113, 2839 (2016)]. Our
key finding is that as the supersaturation decreases, the RC ceases to simply be the number of liquid-like
atoms, and instead it becomes important to explicitly consider local density fluctuations that
correlate with shape and density variations in the nucleus. All three order parameters are found
to have similar barriers in their respective potentials of mean force, however, as the supersaturation
decreases the density fluctuations decorrelate slower and thus carry longer memory. Thus at lower
supersaturations density fluctuations are non-Markovian and can not be simply ignored from the
RC by virtue of being noise. Finally, we use this optimized RC to calculate nucleation rates in the
infrequent metadynamics framework, and show it leads to more accurate estimate of the nucleation
rate with four orders of magnitude acceleration relative to unbiased MD.
