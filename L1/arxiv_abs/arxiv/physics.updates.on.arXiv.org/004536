In October 2017, the first interstellar object within our solar system was discovered. Today designated
1I/'Oumuamua, it shows characteristics that have never before been observed in a celestial body.
Due to these characteristics, an in-situ investigation of 1I would be of extraordinary scientific
value. Previous studies have demonstrated that a mission to 1I/'Oumuamua is feasible, using current
and near-term technologies. However, the anticipated launch date of 2020-2021 is too soon to be
realistic. In this paper, we demonstrate that a mission to 1I/'Oumuamua is feasible at an even later
point in time, providing sufficient time for developing a spacecraft. Using the OITS trajectory
simulation tool, various scenarios are analyzed, including a powered Jupiter flyby and Solar Oberth
manoeuvre, a Jupiter powered flyby, and more complex flyby schemes including a Mars and Venus flyby.
With a powered Jupiter flyby and Solar Oberth manoeuvre, we identify a trajectory to 1I/'Oumuamua
with a launch date in 2033, a total velocity increment of 18.6 km/s, and arrival at 1I/'Oumuamua in
2049. With an additional deep space manoeuvre before the powered Jupiter flyby, a trajectory with
a launch date in 2030, a total velocity increment of 16.2 km/s, and an arrival at 1I/'Oumuamua in 2047
were identified. Both launch dates would provide over a decade for spacecraft development, in contrast
to the previously identified 2020-2021 launch dates. We conclude that a mission to 1I/'Oumuamua
is feasible, using existing and near-term technologies and there is sufficient time for developing
such a mission.
