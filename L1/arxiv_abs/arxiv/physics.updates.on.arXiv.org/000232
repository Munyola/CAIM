DDSCAT 7.3 is an open-source Fortran-90 software package applying the discrete dipole approximation
to calculate scattering and absorption of electromagnetic waves by targets with arbitrary geometries
and complex refractive index. The targets may be isolated entities (e.g., dust particles), but
may also be 1-d or 2-d periodic arrays of "target unit cells", allowing calculation of absorption,
scattering, and electric fields around arrays of nanostructures. The theory of the DDA and its implementation
in DDSCAT is presented in Draine (1988) and Draine & Flatau (1994), and its extension to periodic
structures in Draine & Flatau (2008), and efficient near-field calculations in Flatau &
Draine (2012). DDSCAT 7.3 includes support for MPI, OpenMP, and the Intel Math Kernel Library (MKL).
DDSCAT supports calculations for a variety of target geometries. Target materials may be both inhomogeneous
and anisotropic. It is straightforward for the user to "import" arbitrary target geometries into
the code. DDSCAT automatically calculates total cross sections for absorption and scattering
and selected elements of the Mueller scattering intensity matrix for user-specified scattering
directions. DDSCAT 7.3 can efficiently calculate E and B throughout a user-specified volume containing
the target. This User Guide explains how to use DDSCAT 7.3 to carry out electromagnetic scattering
calculations, including use of DDPOSTPROCESS, a Fortran-90 code to perform calculations with
E and B at user-selected locations near the target. A number of changes have been made since the last
release, DDSCAT 7.2 .
