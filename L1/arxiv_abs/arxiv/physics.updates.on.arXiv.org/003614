The making and breaking of H-bonds on highly anharmonic potential energy surfaces (PES) in proton
and hydrogen transfer reactions require a full-dimensional quantum mechanical treatment of not
only electrons, but also of nuclei. Here we demonstrate that dealing with this complexity is necessary
for achieving predictive simulations that can solve puzzling properties of these reactions by
addressing the intramolecular double hydrogen transfer (DHT) in porphycene. We combine high level
density-functional theory calculations and full-dimensional path-integral ring polymer methods.
Our quantum dynamics simulations show that although below 100 K the concerted tunneling pathway
dominates, between 100 K and 300 K there is a competition between concerted and stepwise pathways
when nuclear quantum effects are included. We obtain reaction rates in excellent agreement with
experiment, thus confirming our determination of the tunneling pathways and of the anharmonic
mode couplings that play a role in this reaction. We also reproduce the puzzling and controversial
N-H stretching band of porphycene with remarkable accuracy. We relate the red-shifted position
and large width of this peak with the strengthening of the hydrogen bonds due to the delocalization
of the hydrogens within the cage, highlighting the role of NQEs in vibrational fingerprints. These
results verify the appropriateness of our general theoretical approach and provide a framework
for a deeper physical understanding of hydrogen transfer dynamics in complex systems.
