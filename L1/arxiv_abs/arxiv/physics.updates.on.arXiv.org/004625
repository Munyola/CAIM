Despite the recent advances in augmented reality (AR), which has shown the potential to significantly
impact on our daily lives by offering a new way to manipulate and interact with virtual information,
minimizing visual discomfort due to the vergence-accommodation conflict remains a challenge.
Emerging AR technologies often exploit focus-tunable optics to address this problem. Although
they demonstrated improved depth perception by enabling proper focus cues, a bulky form factor
of focus-tunable optics prevents their use in the form of a pair of eyeglasses. Herein, we describe
an ultrathin, focus-tunable liquid crystal (LC) diffractive lens with a large aperture, a low weight,
and a low operating voltage. In addition, we show that the polarization dependence of the lens, which
is an inherent optical property of LC lenses, can be eliminated using birefringent thin films as
substrates and by aligning the optical axes of the birefringent substrates and LC at a specific angle.
The polarization independence eliminates the need for a polarizer, thus further reducing the form
factor of the optical system. Next, we demonstrate a prototype of AR glasses with addressable focal
planes using the ultrathin lens. The prototype AR glasses can adjust the accommodation distance
of the virtual image, mitigating the vergence-accommodation conflict without substantially
compromising the form factor or image quality. This research on ultrathin lens technology shows
promising potential for developing compact optical displays in various applications.
