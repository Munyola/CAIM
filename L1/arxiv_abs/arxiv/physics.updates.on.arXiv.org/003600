In this paper, we investigate the crossing statistics of speckle patterns formed in Fresnel diffraction
region by a laser beam scattering through a nanofluid. We extend $zero-crossing$ statistics to
assess dynamical properties of nanofluid. According to joint probability density function of
laser beam fluctuation and its time derivative, theoretical framework for Gaussian and non-Gaussian
regimes are revisited. We count number of crossings not only at {\it zero} level but also for all available
thresholds to determine the average speed of moving particles. Using probabilistic framework
in determining crossing statistics, {\it a priori} Gaussianity is not essentially considered,
therefore even in presence of deviation from Gaussian fluctuation, this modified approach is capable
to compute relevant quantities such as mean value of speed more precisely. Generalized total crossing
which represents the weighted summation of crossings for all thresholds to quantify small deviation
from Gaussian statistics is introduced. This criterion can also manipulate the contribution of
noises and trends to infer reliable physical quantities. The characteristic time scale for having
successive crossings at a given threshold is defined. In our experimental setup, we find that increasing
sample temperature leads to more consistency between Gaussian and perturbative non-Gaussian
predictions. The maximum number of crossing does not necessarily occur at mean level indicating
that we should take into account other levels in addition to {\it zero} level to achieve more accurate
assessments.
