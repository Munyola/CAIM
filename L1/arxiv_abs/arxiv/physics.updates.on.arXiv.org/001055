An empirical model of the concentration dependence of the excess Gibbs free energy Gex for saline
solutions is proposed. Our simple analytical form of Gex allows obtaining equations of state of
saline solutions equally precise in the whole range of the salt concentrations, from dilute solutions
up to the limit of solubility. Our equation for Gex includes one term responsible for concentration
dependence of Gex at low salt concentrations and two terms of Margules type dependent on powers of
mole fractions of the components. These terms contain four parameters dependent on temperature
and pressure. As an example of application of the proposed model we took the system H2O-NaCl. For
fixed T and P, our four-parameter form of Gex allows precisely reproduce experimental data for NaCl
water solutions, including both regions of low and high concentrations. An introduction of temperature
dependence of the parameters allowed us to build a precise analytic fit of experimental data on osmotic
coefficients of NaCl solutions for saturation pressures of NaCl at temperatures 423.15K-573.15K.
On the basis of PVTx data by Driesner (2007) the model was extended towards pressures up to 5kbar.
Our form of Gex allows obtaining the molar volumes, activities of components and other thermodynamic
properties of NaCl-H2O solutions in the range of temperatures 423.15K-573.15K and pressures from
saturation up to 5kbar in the whole range of concentrations possible for H2O-NaCl solutions (from
zero up to approximately 10 molal at 573.15K).
