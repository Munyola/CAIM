Computational chemistry at the atomic level has largely branched into two major fields, one based
on quantum mechanics and the other on molecular mechanics using classical force fields. Because
of high computational costs, quantum mechanical methods have been typically relegated to the study
of small systems. Classical force field methods can describe systems with millions of atoms, but
suffer from well known problems. For example, these methods have problems describing the rich coordination
chemistry of transition metals or physical phenomena such as charge transfer. The requirement
of specific parametrization also limits their applicability. There is clearly a need to develop
new computational methods based on quantum mechanics to study large and heterogeneous systems.
Quantum based methods are typically limited by the calculation of two-electron integrals and diagonalization
of large matrices. Our initial work focused on the development of fast techniques for the calculation
of two-electron integrals. In this publication the diagonalization problem is addressed and results
from molecular dynamics simulations of alanine decamer in gas-phase using a new fast pseudo-diagonalization
method are presented. The Hamiltonian is based on the standard Extended Hueckel approach, supplemented
with a term to correct electrostatic interactions. Besides presenting results from the new algorithm,
this publication also lays the requirements for a new quantum mechanical method and introduces
the extended Hueckel method as a viable base to be developed in the future.
