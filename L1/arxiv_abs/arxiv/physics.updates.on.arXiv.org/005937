The current work presents a tensor formulation of the Lumley Decomposition (LD), introduced in
its original form by Lumley (1967b), allowing decompositions of turbulent flow fields in curvilinear
coordinates. The LD in his form is shown to enable semi-analytical decompositions of self-similar
turbulent flows in general coordinate systems. The decomposition is applied to the far-field region
of the fully developed turbulent axi-symmetric jet, which is expressed in stretched spherical
coordinates in order to exploit the self-similar nature of the flow while ensuring the self-adjointness
of the LD integral. From the LD integral it is deduced that the optimal eigenfunctions in the streamwise
direction are stretched amplitude-decaying Fourier modes (SADFM). The SADFM are obtained from
the LD integral upon the introduction of a streamwise-decaying weight function in the vector space
definition. The wavelength of the Fourier modes is linearly increasing in the streamwise direction
with an amplitude which decays with the -3/2 power of distance from the virtual origin. The streamwise
evolution of the SADFM re-sembles reversed wave shoaling known from surface waves. The energy-
and cross-spectra obtained from these SADFM exhibit a -5/3- and a -7/3-slope region, respectively,
as would be expected for regular Fourier modes in homogeneous and constant shear flows. The approach
introduced in this work can be extended to other flows which admit to equilibrium similarity, such
that a Fourier-based decomposition along inhomogeneous flow directions can be performed.
