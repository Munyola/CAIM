In order to support students in the development of expertise in quantum mechanics (QM), as well as
to provide insight on teaching, we asked which concepts and structures can act as organizing principles
in basic QM (RQ1). The research question has been addressed in a multi-step process based on the analysis
of categorization studies, on a content analysis of a sample of upper-undergraduate course textbooks
and on the results of existing research on learning difficulties in QM. The answer to RQ1 consists
in seven concept maps, intended as models of the organizing principles of quantum knowledge needed
to account for the results of measurement and time evolution both at a qualitative and quantitative
level. The central element of this network is the interplay of the vector structure of the quantum
states and the operator structure of the observables, with a particular focus on the relations between
observables. These relations explain how information on measurement and time evolution is encoded
in the modulus and in the phase of the probability amplitudes associated with the representations
of the state, a topic identified as difficult by educational research. At upper-undergraduate
level, the maps can be used by instructors as a support for helping students build a well-organized
knowledge structure independently of the approach used, be it a spin-first or a waves-first one.
However, this framework provides indications in favor of the former over the latter. At high school
level, a simplified version of this framework has been used as a basis for the design of a teaching-learning
sequence.
