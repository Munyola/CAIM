We determined relative X-ray photon emission cross sections in Fe XVII ions that were mono-energetically
excited in an electron beam ion trap. Line formation for the 3s (3s-2p) and 3d (3d-2p) transitions
of interest proceeds through dielectronic recombination (DR), direct electron-impact excitation
(DE), resonant excitation (RE), and radiative cascades. By reducing the electron-energy spread
to a sixth of that of previous works and increasing counting statistics by three orders of magnitude,
we account for hitherto unresolved contributions from DR and the little-studied RE process to the
3d transitions, and also for cascade population of the 3s line manifold through forbidden states.
We found good agreement with state-of-the-art many-body perturbation theory (MBPT) and distorted-wave
(DW) method for the 3s transition, while in the 3d transitions known discrepancies were confirmed.
Our results show that DW calculations overestimate the 3d line emission due to DE by ~20%. Inclusion
of electron-electron correlation effects through the MBPT method in the DE cross section calculations
reduces this disagreement by ~11%. The remaining ~9% in 3d and ~11% in 3s/3d discrepancies are consistent
with those found in previous laboratory measurements, solar, and astrophysical observations.
Meanwhile, spectral models of opacity, temperature, and turbulence velocity should be adjusted
to these experimental cross sections to optimize the accuracy of plasma diagnostics based on these
bright soft X-ray lines of Fe XVII.
