An understanding of collective effects is of fundamental importance for the design and optimisation
of the performance of modern accelerators. In particular, the design of an accelerator with strict
requirements on the beam quality, such as a free electron laser (FEL), is highly dependent on a correspondence
between simulation, theory and experiments in order to correctly account for the effect of coherent
synchrotron radiation (CSR), and other collective effects. A traditional approach in accelerator
simulation codes is to utilise an analytic one-dimensional approximation to the CSR force. We present
an extension of the 1D CSR theory in order to correctly account for the CSR force at the entrance and
exit of a bending magnet. A limited range of applicability to this solution, in particular in bunches
with a large transverse spot size or offset from the nominal axis, is recognised. More recently developed
codes calculate the CSR effect in dispersive regions directly from the Lienard-Wiechert potentials,
albeit with approximations to improve the computational time. A new module of the General Particle
Tracer (GPT) code was developed for simulating the effects of CSR, and benchmarked against other
codes. We experimentally demonstrate departure from the commonly used 1D CSR theory for more extreme
bunch length compression scenarios at the FERMI FEL facility. Better agreement is found between
experimental data and the codes which account for the transverse extent of the bunch, particularly
in more extreme compression scenarios.
