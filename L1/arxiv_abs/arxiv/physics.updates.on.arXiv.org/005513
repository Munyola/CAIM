Dynamics of slender magnetic flux tubes (MFT) in the accretion discs of T Tauri stars is investigated.
We perform simulations taking into account buoyant, aerodynamic and turbulent drag forces, radiative
heat exchange between MFT and ambient gas, magnetic field of the disc. The equations of MFT dynamics
are solved using Runge-Kutta method of the fourth order. The simulations show that there are two
regimes of MFT motion in absence of external magnetic field. In the region $r<0.2$ au, the MFT of radii
$0.05 \leq a_0 \leq 0.16\,H$ ($H$ is the scale height of the disc) with initial plasma beta of 1 experience
thermal oscillations above the disc. The oscillations decay over some time, and MFT continue upward
motion afterwards. Thinner or thicker MFT do not oscillate. MFT velocity increases with initial
radius and magnetic field strength. MFT rise periodically with velocities up to 5-15 km s$^{-1}$
and periods of $0.5-10$ yr determined by the toroidal magnetic field generation time. Approximately
20 % of disc mass and magnetic flux can escape to disc atmosphere via the magnetic buoyancy over characteristic
time of disc evolution. MFT dispersal forms expanding magnetized corona of the disc. External magnetic
field causes MFT oscillations near the disc surface. These magnetic oscillations have periods
from several days to 1-3 months at $r < 0.6$ au. The magnetic oscillations decay over few periods.
We simulate MFT dynamics in accretion discs in the Chameleon I cluster. The simulations demonstrate
that MFT oscillations can produce observed IR-variability of T Tauri stars.
