Attempts to use Electrohydrodynamic (EHD) flow for propulsion have been made since the last century
[1]. Limited success has been registered particularly due to the inhomogeneous generation of the
thrust, and also the very light weight and frail nature of the devices versus the power supply weight
needed hover the craft [2]. However, EHD propulsion can offer a greater thrust to power ratio than
any of the current propulsion technologies [3]. Rotary EHD devices have been employed as demo units
for a long time [4,5], but it was unknown if they could produce enough thrust and vertical lift to lead
to device liftoff. We designed EHD propellers which spin and eventually lift off and fly independently
for a short while. The propeller is balanced on and powered through a high voltage pin/shaft while
an intense electric field is created by the presence of a surrounding ground electrode [6]. Multiple
propeller electrode designs and ground counter electrodes are able to support propeller rotation
and liftoff. Propellers up to 27.8 g and 25.5 cm in diameter were studied with a liftoff voltage range
of negative 9.5 kV to 60 kV and rotational speeds up to 80 rot/s. It appears that these are the first
EHD devices to liftoff and fly on their own without carrying a power supply [7]. This validates a rotary-based
system as a new principle for propulsion with potentially improved stability and control characteristics
versus the current EHD devices. Design optimization and scaling seem possible and EHD drone design
feasible. Other applications may include EHD motors, fans, or sensors.
