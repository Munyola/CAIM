We develop a formalism suitable for studying Maxwell's equations in the presence of a medium that
is axially symmetric, in particular with respect to Casimir-Polder interaction energies. As an
application, we derive the Casimir-Polder interaction energy between an electric $\delta$-function
plate and an anisotropically polarizable molecule for arbitrary orientations of the principal
axes of polarizabilities of the molecule. We show that in the perfect conductor limit for the plate
the interaction is insensitive to the orientation of the polarizabilities of the molecule. We obtain
the Casimir-Polder energy between an electric $\delta$-function sphere and an anisotropically
polarizable molecule, again for arbitrary orientations of the principal axes of polarizabilities
of the molecule. We derive results when the polarizable molecule is either outside the sphere, or
inside the sphere. We present the perfectly conducting limit for the $\delta$-function sphere,
and also the interaction energy for the special case when the molecule is at the center of the sphere.
Our general proposition is that the Casimir-Polder energy between a dielectric body with axial
symmetry and an unidirectionally polarizable molecule placed on the axis with its polarizability
parallel to the axis gets non-zero contribution only from the $m=0$ azimuth mode. This feature in
conjunction with the property that the $m=0$ mode separates into transverse electric and transverse
magnetic modes allows the evaluation of Casimir-Polder energies for axially symmetric systems
in a relatively easy manner.
