Surface transportation systems are an essential part of urban transportation infrastructure
and are susceptible to damage from earthquakes. This damage, along with the lack of prior warning
of earthquake events, may lead to severe and unexpected disruption of normal traffic patterns,
which may seriously impair post-disaster response. Accordingly, it is important to understand
and model the performance of urban transportation systems immediately following an earthquake,
to evaluate its capability to support emergency response, e.g., the movement of firefighters,
search and rescue teams and medical personnel, and the transportation of injured people to emergency
treatment facilities. For this purpose, a scenario-based methodology is developed to model the
performance of a transportation network immediately following an earthquake using an agent-based
model. This methodology accounts for the abrupt changes in destination, irrational behavior of
drivers, unavailability of traffic information and the impairment to traffic capacity due to bridge
damage and building debris. An illustration using the road network of Tangshan City, China shows
that the method can capture the traffic flow characteristics immediately after an earthquake and
can determine the capability of the transportation network to transfer injured people to hospitals
considering the above factors. Thus, it can provide rational support for evaluating the performance
of the surface transportation system under immediate post-disaster emergency conditions.
