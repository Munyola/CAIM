The aim of this study is to derive accurate models for quantities characterizing the dynamics of
droplets of non-vanishing viscosity in capillaries. In particular, we propose models for the uniform-film
thickness separating the droplet from the tube walls, for the droplet front and rear curvatures
and pressure jumps, and for the droplet velocity in a range of capillary numbers, $Ca$, from $10^{-4}$
to $1$ and inner-to-outer viscosity ratios, $\lambda$, from $0$, i.e. a bubble, to high viscosity
droplets. Theoretical asymptotic results obtained in the limit of small capillary number are combined
with accurate numerical simulations at larger $Ca$. With these models at hand, we can compute the
pressure drop induced by the droplet. The film thickness at low capillary numbers ($Ca<10^{-3}$)
agrees well with Bretherton's scaling for bubbles as long as $\lambda<1$. For larger viscosity
ratios, the film thickness increases monotonically, before saturating for $\lambda>10^3$ to
a value $2^{2/3}$ times larger than the film thickness of a bubble. At larger capillary numbers,
the film thickness follows the rational function proposed by Aussillous \& Qu\'er\'e (2000) for
bubbles, with a fitting coefficient which is viscosity-ratio dependent. This coefficient modifies
the value to which the film thickness saturates at large capillary numbers. The velocity of the droplet
is found to be strongly dependent on the capillary number and viscosity ratio. We also show that the
normal viscous stresses at the front and rear caps of the droplets cannot be neglected when calculating
the pressure drop for $Ca>10^{-3}$.
