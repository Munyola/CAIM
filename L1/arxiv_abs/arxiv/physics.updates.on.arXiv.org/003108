High-harmonic generation in two-colour ($\omega-2\omega$) counter-rotating circularly polarised
laser fields opens the path to generate isolated attosecond pulses and attosecond pulse trains
with controlled ellipticity. The generated harmonics have alternating helicity, and the ellipticity
of the generated attosecond pulse depends sensitively on the relative intensities of two adjacent,
counter-rotating harmonic lines. For the $s$-type ground state, such as in Helium, the successive
harmonics have nearly equal amplitude, yielding isolated attosecond pulses and attosecond pulse
trains with linear polarisation, rotated by 120$^{{\circ}}$ from pulse to pulse. In this work,
we suggest a solution to overcome the limitation associated with the $s$-type ground state. It is
based on modifying the three propensity rules associated with the three steps of the harmonic generation
process: ionisation, propagation, and recombination. We control the first step by seeding high
harmonic generation with XUV light tuned well below the ionisation threshold, which generates
virtual excitations with the angular momentum co-rotating with the $\omega$-field. We control
the propagation step by increasing the intensity of the $\omega$-field relative to the $2\omega$-field,
further enhancing the chance of the $\omega$-field being absorbed versus the $2\omega$-field,
thus favouring the emission co-rotating with the seed and the $\omega-$field. We demonstrate our
proposed control scheme using Helium atom as a target and solving time-dependent Schr{\"o}dinger
equation in two and three-dimensions.
