Cyborg in the brain-machine interface field has attracted more attention in recent years. To control
a creature via a machine called cyborg method, three stages are considerable: stimulation of neurons,
neural response, and the behavioral reaction of the subject. Our main concern was to know how electrical
stimulation induces neural activity and leads to a behavioral response. Additionally, we were
interested to explore which type of electrical stimulation is optimal from different aspects such
as maximum response with minimum induction stimulus field, minimum damage of the tissue and the
electrode, reduction of the noxiousness of stimuli or pain in the living creature. In this article,
we proposed a new model for the induction of neural activity led to locomotion responses through
electrical stimulation. Furthermore, based on this model, we developed a new approach of electrical
neural stimulation to provide a better locomotion control of living beings. This approach was verified
through the empirical data of fish cyborg. We stimulated the fish brain by use of an ultra-high frequency
signal which careered by a random low frequency. According to our model, we could control the locomotion
of fish in a novel and innovative way. In this study, we categorized the different cyborg methods
based on the nervous system areas and the stimulation signal properties to reach the better and optimal
behavioral control of creature. According to this, we proposed a new stimulation method theoretically
and confirmed it experimentally.
