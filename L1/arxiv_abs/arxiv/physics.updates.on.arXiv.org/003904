The local arrangement of atoms is one of the most important predictors of mechanical and functional
properties of materials. However, algorithms for identifying the geometrical arrangements of
atoms in complex materials systems are lacking. To address this challenge, we present a point-pattern
matching algorithm that can detect instances of a `template' structure in a given set of atom coordinates.
To our knowledge this is the first geometrical comparison technique for atomistic configurations
with very different number of atoms, and when the optimal rotations and translations required to
align the configurations are unknown. The pattern matching algorithm can be combined with an appropriate
set of metrics to quantify the similarity or dissimilarity between configurations of atoms. We
demonstrate the unique capabilities of the point-pattern matching algorithm using two examples
where the automated analysis of local atomistic structure can help advance the understanding of
structure-property relationships in material science: (a) identifying local three-dimensional
polyhedral units along interfacial defects, and (b) the analysis of quasi-icosahedral topologies
in the atomistic structure of metallic glasses. We anticipate that the pattern matching algorithm
will be applicable in the analysis of atomistic structures in broad areas of condensed matter systems,
including biological molecules, polymers and disordered metallic systems. An online implementation
of the algorithm is provided via the open source code hosted on GitHub (https://github.com/spatala/ppm3d).
