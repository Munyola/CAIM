We investigate the turbulence statistics in a {multiphase plume made of heavy particles (particle
Reynolds number at terminal velocity is 450)}. Using refractive-index-matched stereoscopic
particle image velocimetry, we measure the locations of particles {whose buoyancy drives the formation
of a multiphase plume,} {together with the local velocity of the induced flow in the ambient salt-water}.
{Measurements in the plume centerplane exhibit self-similarity in mean flow characteristics
consistent with classic integral plume theories.} The turbulence characteristics resemble those
measured in a bubble plume, {including strong anisotropy in the normal Reynolds stresses. However,
we observe structural differences between the two multiphase plumes. First, the skewness of the
probability density function (PDF) of the axial velocity fluctuations is not that which would be
predicted by simply reversing the direction of a bubble plume. Second, in contrast to a bubble plume,
the particle plume has a non-negligible fluid-shear production term in the turbulent kinetic energy
(TKE) budget. Third, the radial decay of all measured terms in the TKE budget is slower than those
in a bubble plume.} Despite these dissimilarities, a bigger picture emerges that applies to both
flows. The TKE production by particles (or bubbles) roughly balances the viscous dissipation,
except near the plume centerline. The one-dimensional power-spectra of the velocity fluctuations
show a -3 power-law that puts both the particle and bubble plume in a category different from single-phase
shear-flow turbulence.
