The undergraduate courses on modern physics generally consider the particle interpretation of
Compton effect. Motivated by a student's solution in an undergraduate examination on modern physics
here we consider the wave characteristics of recoiled electrons in the Compton effect. The de Broglie
wavelength, wave and clock frequency of the scattered electrons are expressed in terms of the wavelength
and the frequency of the incident and the scattered photons respectively using the familiar particle
interpretation of the Compton effect, where initially the electron is at rest and its spin is ignored.
Both non-relativistic and relativistic cases are considered. Numerical values of de Broglie wavelength,
wave and clock frequency of the scattered electron are calculated for an incident photon energy
that was used in the original experiment of Compton as a function of the scattering angle of the recoiled
electron. Considering the relativistic effects which are however insignificant for the de Broglie
wavelength of the recoiled electron under these conditions, the minimum value obtained is in the
range of X-rays. The non-relativistic de Broglie wave frequency obtained by neglecting the rest
mass of the electron leads to an underestimation of its value. The implications of de Broglie wavelength
and clock frequency for Compton scattering experiments are briefly discussed and possible extensions
of the obtained mathematical formulations are indicated. The results are useful for understanding
the wave-particle duality of the recoiled electron in the context of the Compton effect.
