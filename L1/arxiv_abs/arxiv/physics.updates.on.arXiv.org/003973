Radiometric dating with 39Ar covers a unique timespan and offers key advances in interpreting environmental
archives of the last millennium. Although this tracer has been acknowledged for decades, studies
so far have been limited by the low abundance and radioactivity, thus requiring huge sample sizes.
Atom Trap Trace Analysis, an application of techniques from quantum physics such as laser cooling
and trapping, allows to reduce the sample volume by several orders of magnitude, compared to conventional
techniques. Here we show that the adaptation of this method to 39Ar is now available for glaciological
applications, by demonstrating the first Argon Trap Trace Analysis (ArTTA) dating of alpine glacier
ice samples. Ice blocks as small as a few kilograms are sufficient and have been obtained at two artificial
glacier caves. Importantly, both sites offer direct access to the stratigraphy at the glacier base
and validation against existing age constraints. The ice blocks obtained at Chli Titlis glacier
in 3030 m all (Swiss Alps) have been dated by state-of-the-art micro-radiocarbon analysis in a previous
study. The unique finding of a bark fragment and a larch needle within the ice of Schaufelferner glacier
in 2870 m asl (Stubai Alps, Austria) allows for conventional radiocarbon dating. At both sites,
results of 39Ar dating match the existing age information based on radiocarbon dating and visual
stratigraphy. With our results, we establish Argon Trap Trace Analysis as the key to decipher so
far untapped glacier archives of the last millennium.
