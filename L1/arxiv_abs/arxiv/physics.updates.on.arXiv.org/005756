Background: Qualitative interviewing is a common tool that has been utilized by Science, Technology,
Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education researchers to explore and describe the experiences
of students, educators, or other educational stakeholders. Some interviewing techniques use
co-creation of an artifact, such as a personal timeline, as a unique way to elicit a detailed narrative
from a respondent. The purpose of this commentary is to describe an interview artifact called a life
grid. First used and validated in medical sociology to conduct life course research, we adapted
the life grid for use in research on undergraduate STEM education. We applied the life grid interview
technique to two contexts: 1) students in an advance degree program reflecting on their entire undergraduate
career as a biology major, and 2) students in an undergraduate physics program reflecting on a multi-week
lab project. Results: We found that the life grid supported four important attributes of an interview:
facilitation of the respondents' agency, establishment of rapport between interviewers and respondents,
enhanced depth of the respondents' narratives, and the construction of more accurate accounts
of events. We situate our experiences with respect to those attributes and compare them with the
experiences detailed in literature. Conclusions: We conclude with recommendations for future
use of the life grid technique in undergraduate STEM education research. Overall, we find the life
grid to be a valuable tool to use when conducting interviews about phenomena with a chronological
component.
