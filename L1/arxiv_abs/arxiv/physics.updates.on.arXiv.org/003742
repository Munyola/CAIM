A key overall goal of biomolecular simulations is the characterization of "mechanism" -- the pathways
through configuration space of processes such as conformational transitions and binding. Some
amount of heterogeneity is intrinsic to the ensemble of pathways, in direct analogy to thermal configurational
ensembles. Quantification of that heterogeneity is essential to a complete understanding of mechanism.
We propose a general approach for characterizing path ensembles based on mapping individual trajectories
into pathway classes whose populations and uncertainties can be analyzed as an ordinary histogram,
providing a quantitative "fingerprint" of mechanism. In contrast to prior flux-based analyses
used for discrete-state models, stochastic deviations from average behavior are explicitly included
via direct classification of trajectories. The histogram approach, furthermore, is applicable
to analysis of continuous trajectories. It enables straightforward comparison between ensembles
produced by different methods or under different conditions. To implement the formulation, we
develop approaches for classifying trajectories, including a clustering-based approach suitable
for both continuous-space (e.g., molecular dynamics) or discrete-state (e.g., Markov state model)
trajectories, as well as a "fundamental sequence" approach tailored for discrete-state trajectories
but also applicable to continuous trajectories through a mapping process. We apply the pathway
histogram analysis to a toy model and an extremely long atomistic molecular dynamics trajectory
of protein folding.
