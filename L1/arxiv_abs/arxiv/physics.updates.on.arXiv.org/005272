We theoretically investigate the dynamics and stability of a temporal cavity soliton (CS) excited
inside a silicon-based microresonator that exhibits free-carrier generation as a results of two-photon
absorption (TPA). The optical propagation of the CS is modelled through a mean field Lugiato-Lefever
equation (LLE) coupled with an ordinary differential equation accounting for the generation of
free carriers owing to TPA. The CS experiences several perturbations (like intrapulse Raman scattering
(IRS), TPA, free-carrier absorption (FCA), free-carrier dispersion (FCD) etc.) during its round-trip
evolution inside the cavity. We develop a full variational analysis based on Ritz optimization
principle which is useful in deriving simple analytical expressions describing the dynamics of
individual pulse parameters of the CS under perturbation. TPA and FCA limit the efficient comb generation
and modify the stability condition of the CS. We determine the critical condition of stability modification
due to TPA and derive closed form expressions of the saturated amplitude and width of stable CS. The
CS experiences FCD which leads to a temporal acceleration resulting in spectral blue-shift. Exploiting
the variational analysis we estimate these temporal and spectral shifts. We also include IRS in
our perturbation theory and analytically estimate the frequency red-shifting. Finally we study
the effect of pump-phase-modulation on stable CS. All our analytical results are found to be in good
agreement with the numerical data obtained from the full solution of LLE.
