Typical multispecies compressible Navier-Stokes computations employ conservative equations
for mass fraction transport. Upwind discretisations of these governing equations produce spurious
pressure oscillations at diffuse contact surfaces between gases of differing ratio of specific
heat capacities which degrade the convergence rate of the algorithm. Adding quasi-conservative
equations for volume fraction can solve this error, however this approach has been derived only
for immiscible fluids. Here, a five-equation quasi-conservative model is proposed that includes
the effects of species diffusion, viscosity and thermal conductivity. The derivation of the model
is presented, along with a numerical method to solve the governing equations at second order accuracy
in space and time. Formal convergence studies demonstrate the expected order of accuracy is achieved
for three benchmark problems, cross-validated against two standard mass fraction models. In these
test cases, the new model has between 2 and 10 times lower error for a given grid size. Simulations
of a two-dimensional air-SF_6 Richtmyer-Meshkov instability demonstrate that the new model converges
to the solution with four times fewer points in each direction when compared to the mass fraction
model in an identical numerical framework. This represents an ~40 times lower computational cost
for an equivalent error in two-dimensional computations. The proposed model is thus very suitable
for Direct Numerical Simulation and Large Eddy Simulation of compressible mixing.
