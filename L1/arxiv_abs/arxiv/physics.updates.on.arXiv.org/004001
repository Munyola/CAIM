We treat continuum electrodynamics as an axiomatic formal theory based on the macroscopic Maxwell--Minkowski
equations applied to a thermodynamically closed system consisting of an antireflection-coated
block of a simple linear dielectric material situated in free-space that is illuminated by a quasimonochromatic
field. We prove that valid theorems of the formal theory of Maxwellian continuum electrodynamics
are inconsistent with conservation laws for the inviscid incoherent flow of non-interacting particles
(photons) in the continuum limit (light field) in the absence of external forces, pressures, or
constraints. We also show that valid theorems of Maxwellian continuum electrodynamics are contradicted
by the refractive index-independent Lorentz factor of von Laue's application of Einstein's special
relativity to a dielectric medium. Obviously, the fundamental physical principles in the vacuum
are not affected. However, the extant theoretical treatments of electrodynamics, special relativity,
and energy--momentum conservation must be regarded as being mutually inconsistent in a simple
linear dielectric in which the effective speed of light is $c/n$. Having proven that the established
applications of fundamental physical principles to dielectric materials lead to mutually inconsistent
theories, we derive, from first principles, a mutually consistent, alternative theoretical treatment
of electrodynamics, special relativity, and energy--momentum conservation in an isotropic,
homogeneous, linear dielectric-filled, flat, non-Minkowski, continuous material spacetime.
