We develop first-principles theory of kinetic plasma turbulence governed by the Vlasov-Maxwell-Landau
equations in the limit of vanishing collision rates. Following an exact renormalization-group
approach pioneered by Onsager, we demonstrate the existence of a "collisionless range" of scales
(lengths and velocities) in 1-particle phase space where the ideal Vlasov-Maxwell equations are
satisfied in a "coarse-grained sense". Entropy conservation may nevertheless be violated in that
range by a "dissipative anomaly" due to nonlinear entropy cascade. We derive "4/5th-law" type expressions
for the entropy flux, which allow us to characterize the singularities (structure-function scaling
exponents) required for its non-vanishing. Conservation laws of mass, momentum and energy are
not afflicted with anomalous transfers in the collisionless limit. In a subsequent limit of small
gyroradii, however, anomalous contributions to inertial-range energy balance may appear due
both to cascade of bulk energy and to turbulent redistribution of internal energy in phase space.
In that same limit the "generalized Ohm's law" derived from the particle momentum balances reduces
to an "ideal Ohm's law", but only in a coarse-grained sense that does not imply magnetic flux-freezing
and that permits magnetic reconnection at all inertial-range scales. We compare our results with
prior theory based on the gyrokinetic (high gyro-frequency) limit, with numerical simulations,
and with spacecraft measurements of the solar wind and terrestrial magnetosphere.
