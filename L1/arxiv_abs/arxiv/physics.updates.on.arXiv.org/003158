Here we propose a conceptual framework of aeolian sediment transport initiation that includes
the role of turbulence. Upon increasing the wind shear stress $\tau$ above a threshold value $\tau^\prime_t$,
particles resting at the bed surface begin to rock in their pockets because the largest turbulent
fluctuations of the instantaneous wind velocity above its mean value $\overline{u}$ induce fluid
torques that exceed resisting torques. Upon a slight further increase of $\tau$, rocking turns
into a rolling regime (i.e., rolling threshold $\tau_t\simeq\tau^\prime_t$) provided that the
ratio between the integral time scale $T_i\propto\delta/\overline{u}$ (where $\delta$ is the
boundary layer thickness) and the time $T_e\propto\sqrt{d/[(1-1/s)g]}$ required for entrainment
(where $d$ is the particle diameter and $s$ the particle-fluid-density ratio) is sufficiently
large. Rolling then evolves into mean-wind-sustained saltation transport provided that the mean
wind is able to compensate energy losses from particle-bed rebounds. However, when $T_i/T_e$ is
too small, $\tau_t$ may be larger than $\tau^\prime_t$ because fluctuations are too short-lived.
Theoretical analysis and experiments suggest that the threshold scales as $\tau_t/\tau^\prime_t\propto{T}_e/T_i\propto{s}d^2/\delta^2$
in this regime. Because $\delta/d$ controls $T_i/T_e$ and the relative amplitude of turbulent
wind velocity fluctuations, it may not be justified to extrapolate threshold measurements from
wind tunnel experiments to natural atmospheric conditions.
