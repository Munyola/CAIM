The potential for improving the penetration depth of optical coherence tomography systems by using
increasingly longer wavelength light sources has been known since the inception of the technique
in the early 1990s. Nevertheless, the development of mid-infrared optical coherence tomography
has long been challenged by the maturity and fidelity of optical components in this spectral region,
resulting in slow acquisition, low sensitivity, and poor axial resolution. In this work, a mid-infrared
spectral-domain optical coherence tomography system operating at 4 micron central wavelength
with an axial resolution of 8.6 microns is demonstrated. The system produces 2D cross-sectional
images in real-time enabled by a high-brightness 0.9-4.7 micron mid-infrared supercontinuum
source with 1 MHz pulse repetition rate for illumination and broadband upconversion of more than
1 micron bandwidth from 3.58-4.63 microns to 820-865 nm, where a standard 800 nm spectrometer can
be used for fast detection. Images produced by the mid-infrared system are compared with those delivered
by a state-of-the-art ultra-high-resolution near-infrared optical coherence tomography system
operating at 1.3 {\mu}m, and the potential applications and samples suited for this technology
are discussed. In doing so, the first practical mid-infrared optical coherence tomography system
is demonstrated, with immediate applications in real-time non-destructive testing for the inspection
of defects and thickness measurements in samples that are too highly scattering at shorter wavelengths.
