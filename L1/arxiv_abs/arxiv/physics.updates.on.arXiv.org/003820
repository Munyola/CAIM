Nanoparticle drug carriers play an important role in facilitating efficient targeted drug delivery,
i.e., improving treatment success and reducing drug costs and side effects. However, the mobility
of nanoparticle drug carriers poses a challenge in designing drug delivery systems. Moreover,
healing results critically depend on the rate and time duration of drug absorption. Therefore,
in this paper, we aim to design a controlled-release drug delivery system with a mobile drug carrier
that minimizes the total amount of released drugs while ensuring a desired rate of drug absorption
during a prescribed time period. We model the mobile drug carrier as a mobile transmitter, the targeted
diseased cells as an absorbing receiver, and the channel between the transceivers as a time-variant
channel since the carrier mobility results in a time-variant absorption rate of the drug molecules.
Based on this, we develop a molecular communication (MC) framework to design the controlled-release
drug delivery system. In particular, we develop new analytical expressions for the mean, variance,
probability density function, and cumulative distribution function of the channel impulse response
(CIR). Equipped with the statistical analysis of the CIR, we design and evaluate the performance
of the controlled-release drug delivery system. Numerical results show significant savings in
the amount of released drugs compared to a constant-release rate design and reveal the necessity
of accounting for drug carrier mobility for reliable drug delivery.
