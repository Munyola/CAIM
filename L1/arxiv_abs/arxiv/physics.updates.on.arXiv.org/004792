Mechanical strain and stress play a major role in biological processes such as wound healing or morphogenesis.
To assess this role quantitatively, fixed or live images of tissues are acquired at a cellular precision
in large fields of views. To exploit these data, large numbers of cells have to be analyzed to extract
cell shape anisotropy and cell size. Most frequently, this is performed through detailed individual
cell contour determination, using so-called segmentation computer programs, complemented if
necessary by manual detection and error corrections. However, a coarse grained and faster technique
can be recommended in at least three situations. First, when detailed information on individual
cell contours is not required, for instance in studies which require only coarse-grained average
information on cell anisotropy. Second, as an exploratory step to determine whether full segmentation
can be potentially useful. Third, when segmentation is too difficult, for instance due to poor image
quality or too large a cell number. We developed a user-friendly, Fourier transform-based image
analysis pipeline. It is fast (typically $10^4$ cells per minute with a current laptop computer)
and suitable for time, space or ensemble averages. We validate it on one set of artificial images
and on two sets of fully segmented images, one from a Drosophila pupa and the other from a chicken embryo;
the pipeline results are robust. Perspectives include \textit{in vitro} tissues, non-biological
cellular patterns such as foams, and $xyz$ stacks.
