A uniform or periodic dielectric slab can serve as an optical waveguide for which guided modes are
important, and it can also be used as a diffraction structure for which resonant modes with complex
frequencies are relevant. Guided modes are normally studied below the lightline where they exist
continuously and emerge from points on the lightline, but isolated guided modes may exist above
the lightline and they are the so-called bound states in the continuum. Resonant modes are usually
studied above the lightline (defined using the real part of the complex frequency), but they are
not connected to the guided modes on the lightline. In this work, through analytic and numerical
calculations for uniform and periodic slabs, we establish an indirect link between the resonant
and guided modes. It is shown that as the (Bloch) wavenumber is increased, a resonant mode continues
its existence below the lightline, until it reaches its end at an Exceptional Point (EP) where a pair
of improper modes emerge, and one branch of improper modes eventually approaches the lightline
at the starting point of a guided mode. Leaky modes with a real frequency and a complex (Bloch) wavenumber
(propagation constant) are also related to the improper modes. They emerge at EPs in eigenvalue
formulations where the frequency is regarded as a parameter. Our study is based on a non-Hermitian
eigenvalue formulation that includes resonant, improper and leaky modes, and provides a complete
picture for different kinds of eigenmodes on uniform and periodic slabs.
