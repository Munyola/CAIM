In this work we undertake a comprehensive numerical study of the ground state structures and optical
absorption spectra of isomers of B$_{12}$ cluster. Geometry optimization was performed at the
coupled-cluster-singles-doubles (CCSD) level of theory, employing cc-pVDZ extended basis sets.
Once the geometry of a given isomer was optimized, its ground state energy was calculated more accurately
at the coupled-cluster-singles-doubles along with perturbative treatment of triples (CCSD(T))
level of theory, employing larger cc-pVTZ basis sets. Thus, our computed values of binding energies
of various isomers are expected to be quite accurate. Our geometry optimization reveals ten distinct
isomers, along with their point group, and electronic ground state symmetries. We also performed
vibrational frequency analysis on the three lowest energy isomers, and found them to be stable.
Therefore, we computed the linear optical absorption spectra of these isomers of B\textsubscript{12},
employing large-scale multi-reference singles-doubles configuration-interaction (MRSDCI)
approach, and found a strong structure-property relationship. This implies that the spectral
fingerprints of the geometries can be utilized for optical detection, and characterization, of
various isomers of B$_{12}$. While, in bulk boron, icosahedron is the basic structural unit, but,
in the isolated form, we demonstrate it to be unstable. We argue that the disc-like lowest-energy
structure of B$_{12}$ cluster can be seen as a consequence of the Jahn-Teller distortion of its icosohedral
isomer.
