Family members' life course tendencies to remain geographically close to each other or to migrate
due to education or job opportunities have been studied relatively little. Here we investigate
migration patterns of parents and their children between 19 administrative regions of Finland
from 1970 to 2012. Using the FinnFamily register dataset of 60 000 index individuals and their family
members, we investigate the patterns of regional migration and regional co-residence of parents
and their children. Specifically, we analyse how likely it is for children to reside in the same region
as their parents at any specific age, whether parents and children who live in different regions
are likely to reunite, and whether siblings function as regional attractors to each other. Results
show an intense regional migration of people to the capital area. The migration propensity of individuals
is high in early childhood and peaks in early adulthood. About two thirds of Finnish children live
in the same region as their parents throughout their adult lives. Females show higher propensity
to migrate than males, since daughters move away from their parents earlier and with a higher rate
than sons do. The propensity for two full sibling brothers to be in the same region is higher than that
for other types of sibling dyads. We conclude that family members serve as important geographical
attractors to each other through the life course and that family attraction is stronger for sons
and brothers than for daughters and sisters in contemporary Finland.
