The Protvino accelerator facility located in the Moscow region, Russia, is in a good position to
offer a rich experimental research program in the field of neutrino physics. Of particular interest
is the possibility to direct a neutrino beam from Protvino towards the KM3NeT/ORCA detector, which
is currently under construction in the Mediterranean Sea 40 km offshore Toulon, France. This proposal
is known as P2O. Thanks to its baseline of 2595 km, this experiment would yield an unparalleled sensitivity
to matter effects in the Earth, allowing for the determination of the neutrino mass ordering with
a high level of certainty after only a few years of running at a modest beam intensity of $\approx$
90 kW. With a prolonged exposure ($\approx$ 1500 kW*yr), a 2$\sigma$ sensitivity to the leptonic
CP-violating Dirac phase can be achieved. A second stage of the experiment, comprising a further
intensity upgrade of the accelerator complex and a densified version of the ORCA detector (Super-ORCA),
would allow for up to a 6$\sigma$ sensitivity to CP violation and a 10$^\circ$-17$^\circ$ resolution
on the CP phase after 10 years of running with a 450 kW beam, competitive with other planned experiments.
The initial composition and energy spectrum of the neutrino beam would need to be monitored by a near
detector, to be constructed several hundred meters downstream from the proton beam target. The
same neutrino beam and near detector set-up would also allow for neutrino-nucleus cross section
measurements to be performed. A short-baseline sterile neutrino search experiment would also
be possible.
