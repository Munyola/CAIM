Inertial Confinement Fusion is a promising option to provide massive, clean, and affordable energy
for humanity in the future. The present status of research and development is hindered by hydrodynamic
instabilities occurring at the intense compression of the target fuel by energetic laser beams.
A recent proposal Csernai et al. (2018) combines advances in two fields: detonations in relativistic
fluid dynamics and radiative energy deposition by plasmonic nano-shells. The initial compression
of the target pellet can be eliminated or decreased, not to reach instabilities. A final and more
energetic laser pulse can achieve rapid volume ignition, which should be as short as the penetration
time of the light across the target. In the present study, we discuss a flat fuel target irradiated
from both sides simultaneously. Here we propose an ignition energy with smaller compression, largely
increased entropy and temperature increase, and instead of external indirect heating and huge
energy loss, a maximized internal heating in the target with the help of recent advances in nano-technology.
The reflectivity of the target can be made negligible, and the absorptivity can be increased by one
or two orders of magnitude by plasmonic nano-shells embedded in the target fuel. Thus, higher ignition
temperature and radiation dominated dynamics can be achieved. Here most of the interior will reach
the ignition temperature simultaneously based on the results of relativistic fluid dynamics.
This makes the development of any kind of instability impossible, which up to now prevented the complete
ignition of the target.
