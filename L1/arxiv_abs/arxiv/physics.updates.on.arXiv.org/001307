A modified-Bloch equation based on the fractal derivative is proposed to analyze pulsed field gradient
(PFG) anomalous diffusion. Anomalous diffusion exists in many systems such as in polymer or biological
systems. PFG anomalous diffusion could be analyzed based on the fractal derivative or the fractional
derivative. Compared to the fractional derivative, the fractal derivative is simpler, and it is
faster in numerical evaluations. In this paper, the fractal derivative is employed to build the
modified-Bloch equation that is a fundamental method to describe the spin magnetization evolution
affected by fractional diffusion, Larmor precession, and relaxation. An equivalent form of the
fractal derivative is proposed to convert the fractional diffusion equation, which can then be
combined with the precession and relaxation equations to get the modified-Bloch equation. This
modified-Bloch equation yields a general PFG signal attenuation expression that includes the
finite gradient pulse width (FGPW) effect, namely, the signal attenuation during field gradient
pulse. The FGPW effect needs to be considered in most clinical MRI applications, and including FGPW
effect allows the detecting of slower diffusion that is often encountered in polymer systems. Additionally,
the spin-spin relaxation effect can be analyzed, which provides a broad view of the dynamic process
in materials. The modified-Bloch equation based on the fractal derivative could provide a fundamental
theoretical model for PFG anomalous diffusion.
