The resonant state expansion (RSE), a rigorous perturbative method in electrodynamics, is developed
for three-dimensional open optical systems. Results are presented using the analytically solvable
homogeneous dielectric sphere as unperturbed system. Since any perturbation which breaks the
spherical symmetry mixes transverse electric (TE) and transverse magnetic (TM) modes, the RSE
is extended here to include TM modes and a zero-frequency pole of the Green's function. We demonstrate
the validity of the RSE for TM modes by verifying its convergence towards the exact result for a homogeneous
perturbation of the sphere. We then apply the RSE to calculate the modes for a selection of perturbations
sequentially reducing the remaining symmetry, given by a change of the dielectric constant of half-sphere
and quarter-sphere shape. Since no exact solutions are known for these perturbations, we verify
the RSE results by comparing them with the results of state of the art finite element method (FEM)
and finite difference in time domain (FDTD) solvers. We find that for the selected perturbations,
the RSE provides a significantly higher accuracy than the FEM and FDTD for a given computational
effort, demonstrating its potential to supersede presently used methods. We furthermore show
that in contrast to presently used methods, the RSE is able to determine the perturbation of a selected
group of modes by using a limited basis local to these modes, which can further reduce the computational
effort by orders of magnitude.
