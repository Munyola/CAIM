We present an advance towards accurately predicting the arrivals of coronal mass ejections (CMEs)
at the terrestrial planets, including Earth. For the first time, we are able to assess a CME prediction
model using data over 2/3 of a solar cycle of observations with the Heliophysics System Observatory.
We validate modeling results of 1337 CMEs observed with the Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory
(STEREO) heliospheric imagers (HI) (science data) from 8 years of observations by 5 in situ observing
spacecraft. We use the self-similar expansion model for CME fronts assuming 60 degree longitudinal
width, constant speed and constant propagation direction. With these assumptions we find that
23%-35% of all CMEs that were predicted to hit a certain spacecraft lead to clear in situ signatures,
so that for 1 correct prediction, 2 to 3 false alarms would have been issued. In addition, we find that
the prediction accuracy does not degrade with the HI longitudinal separation from Earth. Predicted
arrival times are on average within 2.6 +/- 16.6 hours difference of the in situ arrival time, similar
to analytical and numerical modeling, and a true skill statistic of 0.21. We also discuss various
factors that may improve the accuracy of space weather forecasting using wide-angle heliospheric
imager observations. These results form a first order approximated baseline of the prediction
accuracy that is possible with HI and other methods used for data by an operational space weather
mission at the Sun-Earth L5 point.
