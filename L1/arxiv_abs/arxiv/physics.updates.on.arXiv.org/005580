This study examines the impact of turbulent mixing on horizontal density compensation in the upper
ocean. A series of simulations model the role of mixing in scenarios initialized with geostrophically-adjusted
compensated and uncompensated thermohaline gradients. Numerical experiments isolate the influence
of mixing on these gradients using idealized conditions with zero surface heat and momentum flux.
Prompted by theoretical considerations and observed consequences of mixing, a new non-linear
horizontal diffusion scheme is introduced as an alternative to the standard Laplacian diffusion.
Results suggest that when horizontal mixing is parameterized using constant diffusivities, horizontal
density compensation is substantially unchanged as the gradients erode. Simulations using the
new scheme, which parameterizes mixing with horizontal diffusivities scaled by squared buoyancy
gradient, suggest that horizontal mixing can produce compensated gradients during this decay,
but only at scales of 10 km and less. Reducing vertical mixing to small background values has a similar
effect, increasing the degree of compensation at submesoscales. Reproducing observed compensated
thermohaline variability in the mixed layer at scales greater than 10 km requires external forcing.
These results show important influences of mixing on density compensation within the ageostrophic
submesoscale regime. In the transition from a horizontally compensated mixed layer to a partially
compensated thermocline, advection must play an important role; mixing alone is insufficient.
