Context. The spectrum of the hydrogen atom was explained by Bohr more than one century ago. We revisit
here some of the aspects of the underlying quantum structure, with a modern formalism, focusing
on the limit of the Balmer series. Aims. We investigate the behaviour of the absorption coefficient
of the isolated hydrogen atom in the neighbourhood of the Balmer limit. Methods. We analytically
computed the total cross-section arising from bound-bound and bound-free transitions in the isolated
hydrogen atom at the Balmer limit, and established a simplified semi-analytical model for the surroundings
of that limit. We worked within the framework of the formalism of Landi Degl'Innocenti & Landolfi
(2004, Astrophys. Space Sci. Lib., 307), which permits an almost straight-forward generalization
of our results to other atoms and molecules, and which is perfectly suitable for including polarization
phenomena in the problem. Results. We analytically show that there is no discontinuity at the Balmer
limit, even though the concept of a "Balmer jump" is still meaningful. Furthermore, we give a possible
definition of the location of the Balmer jump, and we check that this location is dependent on the
broadening mechanisms. At the Balmer limit, we compute the cross-section in a fully analytical
way. Conclusions. The Balmer jump is produced by a rapid drop of the total Balmer cross-section,
yet this variation is smooth and continuous when both bound-bound and bound-free processes are
taken into account, and its shape and location is dependent on the broadening mechanisms.
