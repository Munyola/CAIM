In a dynamical system, the transition between reactants and products is typically mediated by an
energy barrier whose properties determine the corresponding pathways and rates. The latter is
the flux through a dividing surface (DS) between the two corresponding regions and it is exact only
if it is free of recrossings. For time-independent barriers, the DS can be attached to the top of the
corresponding saddle point of the potential energy surface, and in time-dependent systems, the
DS is a moving object. The precise determination of reaction rates, eg using transition state theory,
requires the actual construction of a DS for a given saddle geometry which is in general a demanding
methodical and computational task, especially in high-dimensional systems. In this paper, we
demonstrate how such time-dependent, global, and recrossing-free DSs can be constructed using
neural networks. In our approach, the neural network uses the bath coordinates and time as input
and it is trained in a way that its output provides the position of the DS along the reaction coordinate.
An advantage of this procedure is that, once the neural network is trained, the complete information
about the dynamical phase space separation is stored in the network's parameters, and a precise
distinction between reactants and products can be made for all possible system configurations,
all times, and with little computational effort. We demonstrate this general method for two- and
three-dimensional systems, and explain its straightforward extension to even more degrees of
freedom.
