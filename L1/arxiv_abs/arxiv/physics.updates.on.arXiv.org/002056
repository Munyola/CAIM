We present numerical simulations of steady, laminar, axisymmetric convection of a Boussinesq
fluid in a shallow, rotating, cylindrical domain. The flow is driven by an imposed vertical heat
flux and shaped by the background rotation of the domain. The geometry is inspired by that of tropical
cyclones and the global flow pattern consists of a shallow, swirling vortex combined with a poloidal
flow in the r-z plane which is predominantly inward near the bottom boundary and outward along the
upper surface. Our numerical experiments confirm that, as suggested by Oruba et al 2017, an eye forms
at the centre of the vortex which is reminiscent of that seen in a tropical cyclone and is characterised
by a local reversal in the direction of the poloidal flow. We establish scaling laws for the flow and
map out the conditions under which an eye will, or will not, form. We show that, to leading order, the
velocity scales with V=(\alpha g \beta)^{1/2}H, where g is gravity, \alpha the expansion coefficient,
\beta the background temperature gradient, and H is the depth of the domain. We also show that the
two most important parameters controlling the flow are Re=VH/\nu and Ro=V/\Omega H, where \Omega
is the background rotation rate and \nu the viscosity. The Prandtl number and aspect ratio also play
an important, if secondary, role. Finally, and most importantly, we establish the criteria required
for eye formation. These consist of a lower bound on Re, upper and lower bounds on Ro, and an upper bound
on Ekman number.
