Intense short-wavelength pulses from free-electron lasers and high-harmonic-generation sources
enable diffractive imaging of individual nano-sized objects with a single x-ray laser shot. The
enormous data sets with up to several million diffraction patterns represent a severe problem for
data analysis, due to the high dimensionality of imaging data. Feature recognition and selection
is a crucial step to reduce the dimensionality. Usually, custom-made algorithms are developed
at a considerable effort to approximate the particular features connected to an individual specimen,
but facing different experimental conditions, these approaches do not generalize well. On the
other hand, deep neural networks are the principal instrument for today's revolution in automated
image recognition, a development that has not been adapted to its full potential for data analysis
in science. We recently published in Langbehn et al. (Phys. Rev. Lett. 121, 255301 (2018)) the first
application of a deep neural network as a feature extractor for wide-angle diffraction images of
helium nanodroplets. Here we present the setup, our modifications and the training process of the
deep neural network for diffraction image classification and its systematic benchmarking. We
find that deep neural networks significantly outperform previous attempts for sorting and classifying
complex diffraction patterns and are a significant improvement for the much-needed assistance
during post-processing of large amounts of experimental coherent diffraction imaging data.
