Light plays a key role in the regulation of different physiological processes, through several
visual and non-visual retinal phototransduction channels whose basic features are being unveiled
by recent research. The growing body of evidence on the significance of these effects has sparked
a renewed interest in the determination of the light field at the entrance pupil of the eye in indoor
spaces. Since photic interactions are strongly wavelength-dependent, a significant effort is
being devoted to assess the relative merits of the spectra of the different types of light sources
available for use at home and in the workplace. The spectral content of the light reaching the observer
eyes in indoor spaces, however, does not depend exclusively on the sources: it is partially modulated
by the spectral reflectance of the walls and surrounding surfaces, through the multiple reflections
of the light beams along all possible paths from the source to the observer. This modulation can modify
significantly the non-visual photic inputs that would be produced by the lamps alone, and opens
the way for controlling -to a certain extent- the subject's exposure to different regions of the
optical spectrum. In this work we evaluate the expected magnitude of this effect and we show that,
for factorizable sources, the spectral modulation can be conveniently described in terms of a set
of effective filter-like functions that provide useful insights for lighting design and light
pollution assessment. The radiance field also provides a suitable bridge between indoor and outdoor
light pollution studies.
