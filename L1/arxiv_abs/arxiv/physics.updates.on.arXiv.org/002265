The ultimate limits of performance for any classical optical system are set by sub-wavelength fluctuations
within the host material, that may be frozen-in or even dynamically induced. The most common manifestation
of such sub-wavelength disorder is Rayleigh light scattering, which is observed in nearly all wave-guiding
technologies today and can lead to both irreversible radiative losses as well as undesirable intermodal
coupling. While it has been shown that backscattering from disorder can be suppressed by breaking
time-reversal symmetry in magneto-optic and topological insulator materials, common optical
dielectrics possess neither of these properties. Here we demonstrate an optomechanical approach
for dynamically suppressing Rayleigh backscattering within dielectric resonators. We achieve
this by locally breaking time-reversal symmetry in a silica resonator through a Brillouin scattering
interaction that is available in all materials. Near-complete suppression of Rayleigh backscattering
is experimentally confirmed through three independent measurements -- the reduction of the back-reflections
caused by scatterers, the elimination of a commonly seen normal-mode splitting effect, and by measurement
of the reduction in intrinsic optical loss. More broadly, our results provide new evidence that
it is possible to dynamically suppress Rayleigh backscattering within any optical dielectric
medium, for achieving robust light propagation in nanophotonic devices in spite of the presence
of scatterers or defects.
