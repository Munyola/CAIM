The present work is related to the study of the nitrogen gas flow through diverging micro and nano-channels.
The direct simulation Monte-Carlo (DSMC) method has been used to study the flow. The Simplified
Bernoulli Trials (SBT) collision scheme has been employed to reduce the computational costs and
required amounts of the computer resources. The effects of various divergence angles on flow and
thermal fields have been studied for different Knudsen numbers in late-slip and early-transition
regimes. The inlet-to-outlet pressure ratio has been set to 2.5 for micro and nano-channels with
a uniform constant wall temperature. By analyzing the numerical results no flow separation has
been found due to slip at the wall which is different than flow behavior in continuum regime. The results
indicate that the viscous component has a relatively large contribution to the overall pressure
drop and flow behavior. It observed that for low divergence angles the effects of pressure forces
dominate the effects of shear stress and divergence angle and cause the flow to accelerate along
the channel while by increasing the divergence angle and therefore the effects of flow expansion,
the flow decelerates along the channel. The mass flow rate through channel increases by increasing
the divergence angle. Cold-to-hot heat transfer has been observed in diverging micro and nano-channels.
In order to investigate the thermal behavior in diverging micro and nano-channels, the results
have been compared to weakly non-linear constitutive laws derived from Boltzmann's equation.
