The thermo-kinetic inhibition mechanism of six imidazolium-based ionic liquids (ILs) on methane
clathrate hydrate formation and growth is studied in this work using classical molecular dynamics
(MD) simulation. The ionic liquids investigated include 1-(2,3-dihydroxypropyl)-3-methylimidazoliumbis(fluorosulfonyl)imide
([C3(OH)2mim][f2N]), 1-(2-hydroxyethyl)-3-methylimidazolium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide
([C2OHmim][f2N]), 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate ([C2mim][BF4]), 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium
tetrafluoroborate ([C4mim][BF4]), 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate ([C4mim][OAc]) and
1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium ethylsulfate ([C2mim][EtSO4]). Simulations showed that [C2OHmim][f2N]
and [C3(OH)2mim][f2N] are strongly hydrated compared to other ILs because of hydrogen bonding
between OH groups of the cation and water molecules. They also exhibit high diffusion rates towards
crystal surface and bond to it through strong intermolecular interactions. As a result, these two
ILs are stronger thermo-kinetic inhibitors for formation and growth of methane hydrates compared
to other ILs studied in this work as well as conventional inhibitors like methanol and NaCl. The simulations
also revealed that cations of [C3(OH)2mim][f2N] and [C2OHmim][f2N] show that the presence of ions
near the hydrate crystal causes hindrance for water and guest molecules adsorbing on the hydrate
surface, which inhibits the growth of hydrate crystals. In addition, it is shown that [C3(OH)2mim][f2N]
and [C2OHmim][f2N] are more likely to inhibit hydrate formation.
