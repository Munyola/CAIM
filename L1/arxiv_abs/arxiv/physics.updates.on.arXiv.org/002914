Several issues related to time directionality are discussed which are all directly or indirectly
relevant to gravitation theory. Important clarifications are achieved regarding in particular
the concept of negative energy and the associated notion of negative mass. Several difficulties
associated with the possibility for matter to occupy negative energy states are identified and
solutions to the problems they represent are suggested. An alternative interpretation of negative
energy states as voids in the positive energy portion of the vacuum is developed. Generalized gravitational
field equations which allow to fulfill the requirements set by the axioms derived from this analysis
are provided. A revised formulation of the discrete symmetry operations based on the insights gained
while addressing the problem of negative energy is then proposed which gives rise to an improved
notion of time reversal. Those results are then applied to provide significant new insight into
many aspects of the semi-classical theory of black hole thermodynamics and to provide solutions
to several long-standing problems in classical cosmology, including the problem of the small value
of the cosmological constant, the problem of the nature of dark matter, and that of structure formation.
Finally, it is shown that certain difficulties currently addressed through inflation theory,
including the flatness problem, the problem of matter creation, and the problem of the origin of
time asymmetry can be overcome more naturally by making use of the developments introduced while
solving the problem of negative energy.
