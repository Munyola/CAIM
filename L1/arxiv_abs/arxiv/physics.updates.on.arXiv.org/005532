Thousands of exoplanets have been detected to date, and with future planned missions this tally
will increase. Understanding the climate dependence on the planetary parameters is vital for the
study of terrestrial exoplanet habitability. Using an idealized general circulation model with
a seasonal cycle, we study the seasonal response of the surface temperature and Hadley circulation
to changes in the orbital, rotational and radiative timescales. Analyzing the climate's seasonal
response to variations in these timescales, we find a regime transition between planets controlled
by the annual mean insolation to planets controlled by the seasonal variability depending on the
relation between the length of the orbital period, obliquity and radiative timescale. Consequently,
planets with obliquity greater than $54^{\circ}$ and short orbital period will have a minimum surface
temperature at the equator. We also show that in specific configurations, mainly high atmospheric
mass and short orbital periods, high obliquity planets can still have an equable climate. Based
on the model results, we suggest an empirical power law for the ascending and descending branches
of the Hadley circulation and its strength. These power laws show that the Hadley circulation becomes
wider and stronger by increasing the obliquity and orbital period or by decreasing the atmospheric
mass and rotation rate. Consistent with previous studies, we show that the rotation rate plays an
essential role in dictating the width of the Hadley circulation.
