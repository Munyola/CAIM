Main ions influence impurity dynamics through a variety of mechanisms; in particular, via impurity-ion
collisions. To lowest order in an expansion in the main ion mass over the impurity mass, the impurity-ion
collision operator only depends on the component of the main ion distribution that is odd in the parallel
velocity. These lowest order terms give the parallel friction of the impurities with the main ions,
which is typically assumed to be the main cause of collisional impurity transport. Next-order terms
in the mass ratio expansion of the impurity-ion collision operator, proportional to the component
of the main ion distribution that is even in the parallel velocity, are usually neglected. However,
in stellarators, the even component of the main ion distribution can be very large. In this article,
such next-order terms in the mass ratio expansion of the impurity-ion collision operator are retained,
and analytical expressions for the neoclassical radial flux of trace impurities are calculated
in the Pfirsch-Schl\"uter, plateau and $1/\nu$ regimes. The new terms provide a drive for impurity
transport that is physically very different from parallel friction: they are associated to anisotropy
in the pressure of the main ions, which translates into impurity pressure anisotropy. It is argued
that main ion pressure anisotropy must be taken into account for a correct description of impurity
transport in certain realistic stellarator plasmas. Examples are given by numerically evaluating
the analytical expressions for the impurity flux.
