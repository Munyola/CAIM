Microwave phased array antennas (PAAs) are very attractive to defense applications and high-speed
wireless communications for their abilities of fast beam scanning and complex beam pattern control.
However, traditional PAAs based on phase shifters suffer from the beam-squint problem and have
limited bandwidths. True-time-delay (TTD) beamforming based on low-loss photonic delay lines
can solve this problem. But it is still quite challenging to build large-scale photonic TTD beamformers
due to their high hardware complexity. In this paper, we demonstrate a photonic TTD beamforming
network based on a miniature microresonator frequency comb (microcomb) source and dispersive
time delay. We show that microcombs can be promising candidate for TTD beamforming due to their compact
volume and wide spectra. The experimentally demonstrated TTD beamforming network can support
a PAA with 21 elements. The microwave frequency range is 8~20 GHz; and the beam scanning range is +/-
60.2 degree. Limited by the available components in our laboratory, a real antenna array was not
constructed; however, detailed measurements of the microwave amplitudes and phases were performed
that allow us to simulate the beamforming performance that could be obtained with a real array. The
scheme can potentially support larger PAAs with hundreds of elements by increasing the number of
comb lines with broadband microcomb generation. Arbitrary beam pattern control is also possible
by incorporating optical spectral shaping. Gaussian, rectangular beamforming, and beam notch
control are evaluated.
