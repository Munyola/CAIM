We show that activity of online news outlets follows a temporal fluctuation scaling law and we recover
this feature using an independent cascade model augmented with a varying \textit{hype} parameter
representing a viral potential of an original article. We use the Event Registry platform to track
activity of over 10,000 news outlets in 11 different topics in the course of the year 2016. Analyzing
over 22,000,000 articles, we found that fluctuation scaling exponents $\alpha$ depend on time
window size $\Delta$ in a characteristic way for all the considered topics -- news outlets activities
are partially synchronized for $\Delta>15\mathrm{min}$ with a cross-over for $\Delta=1\mathrm{day}$.
The proposed model was run on several synthetic network models as well as on a network extracted from
the real data. Our approach discards timestamps as not fully reliable observables and focuses on
co-occurrences of publishers in cascades of similarly phrased news items. We make use of the Event
Registry news clustering feature to find correlations between content published by news outlets
in order to uncover common information propagation paths in published articles and to estimate
weights of edges in the independent cascade model. While the independent cascade model follows
the fluctuation scaling law with a trivial exponent $\alpha=0.5$, we argue that besides the topology
of the underlying cooperation network a temporal clustering of articles with similar hypes is necessary
to qualitatively reproduce the fluctuation scaling observed in the data.
