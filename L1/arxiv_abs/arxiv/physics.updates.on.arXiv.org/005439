Relating the electromagnetic scattering and absorption properties of an individual particle
to the reflection and transmission coefficients of a two-dimensional material composed of these
particles is a crucial concept that has driven both fundamental and applied physics. It is at the
heart of both the characterization of material properties as well as the phase and amplitude engineering
of a wave. Here we propose a multipolar description of the reflection and transmission coefficients
across a monolayer of particles using a vector spherical harmonic decomposition. This enables
us to provide a generalized condition for perfect absorption which occurs when both the so-called
\textit{generalized Kerker condition} is reached and when the superposition of odd and even multipoles
reaches a critical value. Using these conditions, we are able to propose two very different designs
of two-dimensional materials that perfectly absorb a plane electromagnetic wave under normal
incidence. One is an infinite array of silica microspheres that operates at mid-infrared frequencies,
while the other is an infinite array of germanium nano-clusters that operates at visible frequencies.
Both systems operate in a deeply multipolar regime. Our findings are important to the metamaterials
and metasurfaces communities who design materials mainly restricted to the dipolar behavior of
individual resonators, as well as the self-assembly and nanochemistry communities who separate
the individual particle synthesis from the materials assembly.
