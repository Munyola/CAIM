The possibility of formation of massless structure particles with spin 1 (vector boson-\underline{\emph{hion}})
is considered. Using stochastic equations of the Weyl-Langevin type, it is proved that as a result
of multiscale random fluctuations of massless quantum vector fields, excitations (quasiparticles)
arise in the first phase of relaxation in the form of statistically stable quantized structures
localized on 2D topological manifolds. The wave state and geometric structure of the \emph{hion}
are studied in the case when the quasiparticle is free and when it interacts with a random environment.
In the second phase of relaxation, the symmetry of the quantum state of the \emph{hion} breaks down,
which leads to spontaneous transitions of quasiparticle to other massless and mass states. The
problem of entanglement of two \emph{hions} with opposite projections of the spins +1 and -1 and
the formation of a scalar zero-spin boson are studied in detail. The properties of the scalar field
(dark energy-\emph{quintessence}) are analyzed and it is shown that in fact it is a Bose-Einstein
(BE) condensate. The problems of the decay of a scalar boson, as well as a number of features characterizing
the stability of BE condensate, are investigated. The structure of the "\emph{empty}" space-time
is analyzed in the context of the new properties of the quantum vacuum, which allows us to assume the
existence of a natural quantum computer with complex logic in the form of a dark energy. The possibilities
of space-time engineering are discussed.
