With the axion being a prime candidate for dark matter, there has been some recent interest in direct
detection through a so called `Ferromagnetic haloscope.' Such devices exploit the coupling between
axions and electrons in the form of collective spin excitations of magnetic materials with the readout
through a microwave cavity. Here, we present a new, general, theoretical treatment of such experiments
in a Hamiltonian formulation for strongly coupled magnons and photons, which hybridise as cavity-magnon
polaritons. Such strongly coupled systems have an extended measurable dispersive regime. Thus,
we extend the analysis and operation of such experiments into the dispersive regime, which allows
any ferromagnetic haloscope to achieve improved bandwidth with respect to the axion mass parameter
space. This experiment was implemented in a cryogenic setup, and initial search results are presented
setting laboratory limits on the axion-electron coupling strength of $g_{aee}>3.7\times10^{-9}$
in the range $33.79~\mu$eV$< m_a<33.94~\mu$eV with $95\%$ confidence. The potential bandwidth
of the Ferromagnetic haloscope was calculated to be in two bands, the first of about $1$GHz around
$8.24$GHz (or $4.1~\mu$eV mass range around $34.1~\mu$eV) and the second of about $1.6$GHz around
$10$GHz ($6.6~\mu$eV mass range around $41.4~\mu$eV). Frequency tuning may also be easily achieved
via an external magnetic field which changes the ferromagnetic resonant frequency with respect
to the cavity frequency. The requirements necessary for future improvements to reach the DFSZ axion
model band are discussed in the paper.
