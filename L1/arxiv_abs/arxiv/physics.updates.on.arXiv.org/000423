Long-time atom interferometry is instrumental to various high-precision measurements of fundamental
physical properties, including tests of the equivalence principle. Due to rotations and gravity
gradients, the classical trajectories characterizing the motion of the wave packets for the two
branches of the interferometer do not close in phase space, an effect which increases significantly
with the interferometer time. The relative displacement between the interfering wave packets
in such open interferometers leads to a fringe pattern in the density profile at each exit port and
a loss of contrast in the oscillations of the integrated particle number as a function of the phase
shift. Paying particular attention to gravity gradients, we present a simple mitigation strategy
involving small changes in the timing of the laser pulses which is very easy to implement. A useful
representation-free description of the state evolution in an atom interferometer is introduced
and employed to analyze the loss of contrast and mitigation strategy in the general case. (As a by-product,
a remarkably compact derivation of the phase-shift in a general light-pulse atom interferometer
is provided.) Furthermore, exact results are obtained for (pure and mixed) Gaussian states which
allow a simple interpretation in terms of the alignment of Wigner functions in phase-space. Analytical
results are also obtained for expanding Bose-Einstein condensates within the time-dependent
Thomas-Fermi approximation. Finally, a combined strategy for rotations and nonaligned gravity
gradients is considered as well.
