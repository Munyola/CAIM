Recent research has suggested that the overall dependence of convection near coasts on large-scale
atmospheric conditions is weaker than over the open ocean or inland areas. This is due to the fact
that in coastal regions convection is often supported by meso-scale land-sea interactions and
the topography of coastal areas. As these effects are not resolved and not included in standard cumulus
parametrization schemes, coastal convection is among the most poorly simulated phenomena in global
models. To outline a possible parametrization framework for coastal convection we develop an idealized
modeling approach and test its ability to capture the main characteristics of coastal convection.
The new approach first develops a decision algorithm, or trigger function, for the existence of
coastal convection. The function is then applied in a stochastic cloud model to increase the occurrence
probability of deep convection when land-sea interactions are diagnosed to be important. The results
suggest that the combination of the trigger function with a stochastic model is able to capture the
occurrence of deep convection in atmospheric conditions often found for coastal convection. When
coastal effects are deemed to be present the spatial and temporal organization of clouds that has
been documented form observations is well captured by the model. The presented modeling approach
has therefore potential to improve the representation of clouds and convection in global numerical
weather forecasting and climate models.
