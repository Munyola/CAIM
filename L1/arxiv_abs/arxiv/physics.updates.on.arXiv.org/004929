The hydrostatic equilibrium state is the consequence of the exact hydrostatic balance between
hydrostatic pressure and external force. Standard finite volume or finite difference schemes
cannot keep this balance exactly due to their unbalanced truncation errors. In this study, we introduce
an auxiliary variable which becomes constant at isothermal hydrostatic equilibrium state and
propose a well-balanced gas kinetic scheme for the Navier-Stokes equations with a global reconstruction.
Through reformulating the convection term and the force term via the auxiliary variable, zero numerical
flux and zero numerical source term are enforced at the hydrostatic equilibrium state instead of
the balance between hydrostatic pressure and external force. Several problems are tested numerically
to demonstrate the accuracy and the stability of the new scheme, and the results confirm that, the
new scheme can preserve the exact hydrostatic solution. The small perturbation riding on hydrostatic
equilibria can be calculated accurately. The viscous effect is also illustrated through the propagation
of small perturbation and the Rayleigh-Taylor instability. More importantly, the new scheme is
capable of simulating the process of converging towards hydrostatic equilibrium state from a highly
non-balanced initial condition. The ultimate state of zero velocity and constant temperature
is achieved up to machine accuracy. As demonstrated by the numerical experiments, the current scheme
is very suitable for small amplitude perturbation and long time running under gravitational potential.
