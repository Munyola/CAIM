Light scattering in disordered media has been studied extensively due to its prevalence in natural
and artificial systems [1]. In the field of photonics most of the research has focused on understanding
and mitigating the effects of scattering, which are often detrimental. For certain applications,
however, intentionally introducing disorder can actually improve the device performance, e.g.,
in photovoltaics optical scattering improves the efficiency of light harvesting [2-5]. Here,
we utilize multiple scattering in a random photonic structure to build a compact on-chip spectrometer.
The probe signal diffuses through a scattering medium generating wavelength-dependent speckle
patterns which can be used to recover the input spectrum after calibration. Multiple scattering
increases the optical pathlength by folding the paths in a confined geometry, enhancing the spectral
decorrelation of speckle patterns and thus increasing the spectral resolution. By designing and
fabricating the spectrometer on a silicon wafer, we are able to efficiently channel the scattered
light to the detectors, minimizing the reflection loss. We demonstrate spectral resolution of
0.75 nm at a wavelength of 1500 nm in a 25 {\mu}m by 50 {\mu}m random structure. Furthermore, the phenomenal
control afforded by semiconductor nanofabrication technology enabled us to engineer the disorder
to reduce the out-of-plane scattering loss. Such a compact, high-resolution spectrometer that
is integrated on a silicon chip and robust against fabrication imperfections is well suited for
lab-on-a-chip spectroscopy applications.
