One recent breakthrough in the field of magnonics is the experimental realization of reconfigurable
spin-wave nanochannels formed by magnetic domain wall with a width of $10-100$ nm [Wagner \emph{et
al}., Nat. Nano. \textbf{11}, 432 (2016)]. This remarkable progress enables an energy-efficient
spin-wave propagation with a well-defined wave vector along its propagating path inside the wall.
In the mentioned experiment, a micro-focus Brillouin light scattering spectroscopy was taken
in a line-scans manner to measure the frequency of the bounded spin wave. Due to their localization
nature, the confined spin waves can hardly be detected from outside the wall channel, which guarantees
the information security to some extent. In this work, we theoretically propose a scheme to detect/eavesdrop
on the spin waves inside the domain-wall nanochannel via nonlinear three-magnon processes. We
send a spin wave in one magnetic domain to interact with the bounded mode in the wall. Two kinds of three-magnon
processes, i.e., confluence and splitting, are expected to occur. The confluence process is conventional.
We predict a stimulated three-magnon splitting (or "magnon laser") effect: the presence of a bound
magnon propagating along the domain wall channel assists the splitting of the incident wave into
two modes, one of which is identical to the bound mode in the channel. Micromagnetic simulations
confirm our theoretical analysis. These results demonstrate that one is able to uniquely infer
the spectrum of the spin-wave in the domain-wall nanochannel once we know both the injection and
the transmitted waves.
