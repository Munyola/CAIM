It is now over three decades since the first paper was published using the code that has come to be known
as LFM (Lyon-Fedder-Mobarry). The code, used since then extensively in heliophysics research,
had a number of novel features: eighth-order centered spatial differencing, the Partial Donor
Cell Method limiter for shock capturing, a non-orthogonal staggered spherical mesh with constrained
transport, conservative averaging-reconstruction for axis singularities and the capability
to handle multiple ion species. However the computational kernel of the LFM code, designed and optimized
for architectures long retired, has aged and is difficult to adapt to the modern multicore era of
supercomputing. To carry its legacy forward, we re-envisage the LFM as GAMERA, Grid Agnostic MHD
for Extended Research Applications, which preserves the core numerical philosophy of LFM while
also incorporating numerous algorithmic and computational improvements. The upgrades in the
numerical schemes include accurate grid metric calculations using high-order Gaussian quadrature
techniques, high-order upwind reconstruction, non-clipping options for interface values. The
improvements in the code implementation includes the use of data structures and memory access patterns
conducive to aligned, vector operations and the implementation of hybrid parallelism, using MPI
and OMP. Thus, while keeping the best elements of LFM, GAMERA is designed to be a portable and easy-to-use
code that provides multi-dimensional MHD simulations in non-orthogonal curvilinear geometries
on modern supercomputer architectures.
