A Richardson triple is an ideal fluid flow map $g_{t/\ep,t,\ep t} = h_{t/\ep}k_t l_{\ep t}$ composed
of three smooth maps with separated time scales: slow, intermediate and fast; corresponding to
the big, little, and lesser whorls in Richardson's well-known metaphor for turbulence. Under homogenisation,
as $\lim \ep\to0$, the composition $h_{t/\ep}k_t $ of the fast flow and the intermediate flow is
known to be describable as a single stochastic flow $\dd g$. The interaction of the homogenised stochastic
flow $\dd g$ with the slow flow of the big whorl is obtained by going into its non-inertial moving reference
frame, via the composition of maps $(\dd g)l_{\ep t}$. This procedure parameterises the interactions
of the three flow components of the Richardson triple as a single stochastic fluid flow in a moving
reference frame. The Kelvin circulation theorem for the stochastic dynamics of the Richardson
triple reveals the interactions among its three components. Namely, (i) the velocity in the circulation
integrand acquires is kinematically swept by the large scales; and (ii) the velocity of the material
circulation loop acquires additional stochastic Lie transport by the small scales. The stochastic
dynamics of the composite homogenised flow is derived from a stochastic Hamilton's principle,
and then recast into Lie-Poisson bracket form with a stochastic Hamiltonian. Several examples
are given, including fluid flow with stochastically advected quantities, and rigid body motion
under gravity, i.e., the stochastic heavy top in a rotating frame.
