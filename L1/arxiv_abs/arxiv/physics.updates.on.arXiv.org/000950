Classic economic science is reaching the limits of its explanatory powers. Complexity science
uses an increasingly larger set of different methods to analyze physical, biological, cultural,
social, and economic factors, providing a broader understanding of the socio-economic dynamics
involved in the development of nations worldwide. The use of tools developed in the natural sciences,
such as thermodynamics, evolutionary biology, and analysis of complex systems, help us to integrate
aspects, formerly reserved to the social sciences, with the natural sciences. This integration
reveals details of the synergistic mechanisms that drive the evolution of societies. By doing so,
we increase the available alternatives for economic analysis and provide ways to increase the efficiency
of decision-making mechanisms in complex social contexts. This interdisciplinary analysis seeks
to deepen our understanding of why chronic poverty is still common, and how the emergence of prosperous
technological societies can be made possible. This understanding should increase the chances
of achieving a sustainable, harmonious and prosperous future for humanity. The analysis evidences
that complex fundamental economic problems require multidisciplinary approaches and rigorous
application of the scientific method if we want to advance significantly our understanding of them.
The analysis reveals viable routes for the generation of wealth and the reduction of poverty, but
also reveals huge gaps in our knowledge about the dynamics of our societies and about the means to
guide social development towards a better future for all.
