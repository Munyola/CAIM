A discrete unified gas kinetic scheme (DUGKS) coupled with the immersed boundary (IB) method is
developed to perform interface-resolved simulation of particle-laden flows. The present method
(IB-DUGKS) preserves the respective advantages of the IB and DUGKS, i.e., the flexibility and efficiency
for treating complex flows, and the robustness and low numerical-dissipation. In IB-DUGKS, the
IB method is used to treat the fluid-solid interfaces and the DUGKS is applied to simulate the fluid
flow, making use of the Lagrangian and Eulerian meshes, respectively. Those two meshes are fully
independent, which contributes to the avoidance of grid regeneration when a solid particle moves.
Specifically, in the present implementation of IB-DUGKS, the no-slip boundary condition at the
particle surface is accurately enforced by introducing an efficient iterative forcing algorithm,
and the IB force induced by the particle boundary is conveniently incorporated into the DUGKS with
the Strange-Splitting scheme. The accuracy of the IB-DUGKS is first verified in the flows past a
stationary cylinder and an oscillating cylinder in a quiescent fluid. After that, several well-established
two- and three-dimensional particulate flow problems are simulated, including the sedimentation
of a particle and the DKT dynamics of two particles in a channel, and a group of particles settling
in an enclosure. In all test cases, the results are in good agreement with the data available in the
literature, demonstrating that the proposed IB-DUGKS is a promising tool for simulating particulate
flows.
