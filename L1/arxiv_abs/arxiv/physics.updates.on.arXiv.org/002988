This paper introduces a novel data clustering algorithm based on Langevin dynamics, where the associated
potential is constructed directly from the data. To introduce a self-consistent potential, we
adopt the potential model from the established Quantum Clustering method. The first step is to use
a radial basis function to construct a density distribution from the data. A potential function
is then constructed such that this density distribution is the ground state solution to the time-independent
Schrodinger equation. The second step is to use this potential function with the Langevin dynamics
at sub-critical temperature to avoid ergodicity. The Langevin equations take a classical Gibbs
distribution as the invariant measure, where the peaks of the distribution coincide with minima
of the potential surface. The time dynamics of individual data points lead to different metastable
states, which are interpreted as cluster centers. Clustering is therefore achieved when subsets
of the data aggregate - as a result of the Langevin dynamics for a moderate period of time - in the neighborhood
of a particular potential minimum. While the data points are pushed towards potential minima by
the potential gradient, Brownian motion allows them to effectively tunnel through local potential
barriers and escape saddle points into locations of the potential surface otherwise forbidden.
The algorithm's feasibility is first established based on several illustrating examples and theoretical
analyses, followed by a stricter evaluation using a standard benchmark dataset.
