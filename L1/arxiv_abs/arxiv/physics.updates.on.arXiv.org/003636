We propose a deep learning algorithm for seismic interface detection, with the neural networks
trained by synthetic high-frequency seismograms, efficiently generated by the frozen Gaussian
approximation (FGA). The usage of high-frequency data is advantageous due to the fact that it can
provide high resolution of substructures. However, generation of sufficient synthetic high-frequency
data sets for training neural networks are, in general, computationally challenging to well-known
methods. This bottleneck is overcome by a highly scalable computational platform built upon the
FGA, which comes from the semiclassical theory and approximates the wavefields by a sum of fixed-width
(frozen) Gaussian wave packets. We first generate the time series of synthetic seismogram data
by FGA, which contains accurate traveltime information (from the ray path) but not exact amplitude
information (with asymptotic errors not shrinking to zero even at extremely fine numerical resolution).
With the synthetic seismogram generated by the FGA, we build network models using an open source
API, GeoSeg, developed using Keras and Tensorflow. In particular, networks using encoder-decoder
and UNet architectures, despite only being trained on FGA data, can detect an interface with a high
success rate from the seismograms generated by the spectral element method (a different numerical
method with exact amplitude information at fine numerical resolution). All the tests are done for
P-waves (acoustic) and P- and S-waves (elastic), respectively.
