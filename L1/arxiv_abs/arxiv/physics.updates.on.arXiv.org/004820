$\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry --- invariance with respect to combined space reflection $\mathcal{P}$
and time reversal $\mathcal{T}$ --- provides a weaker condition than (Dirac) Hermiticity for ensuring
a real energy spectrum of a general non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric Hamiltonians
therefore form an intermediate class between Hermitian and non-Hermitian Hamiltonians. In this
work, we derive the conditions for $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry in the context of electronic structure
theory, and specifically, within the Hartree-Fock (HF) approximation. We show that the HF orbitals
are symmetric with respect to the $\mathcal{PT}$ operator \textit{if and only if} the effective
Fock Hamiltonian is $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric, and \textit{vice versa}. By extension, if an optimal
self-consistent solution is invariant under $\mathcal{PT}$, then its eigenvalues and corresponding
HF energy must be real. Moreover, we demonstrate how one can construct explicitly $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric
Slater determinants by forming $\mathcal{PT}$ doublets (i.e.~pairing each occupied orbital
with its $\mathcal{PT}$-transformed analogue), allowing $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry to be conserved
throughout the self-consistent process. Finally, considering the \ce{H2} molecule as an illustrative
example, we observe $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry in the HF energy landscape and find that the symmetry-broken
unrestricted HF wave functions (i.e.~diradical configurations) are $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric,
while the symmetry-broken restricted HF wave functions (i.e.~ionic configurations) break $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry.
