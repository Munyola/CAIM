We present an improved high-order weighted compact high resolution (WCHR) scheme that extends
the idea of weighted compact nonlinear schemes (WCNS's) using nonlinear interpolations in conjunction
with compact finite difference schemes for shock-capturing in compressible turbulent flows.
The proposed scheme has better resolution property than previous WCNS's. This is achieved by using
a compact (or spatially implicit) form instead of the traditional fully explicit form for the nonlinear
interpolation. Since compact interpolation schemes tend to have lower dispersion errors compared
to explicit interpolation schemes, the proposed scheme has the ability to resolve more fine-scale
features while still having the ability to provide sufficiently localized dissipation to capture
shocks and discontinuities robustly. Approximate dispersion relation characteristics of this
scheme are analyzed to show the superior resolution properties of the scheme compared to other WCNS's
of similar orders of accuracy. Conservative and high-order accurate boundary schemes are also
proposed for non-periodic problems. Further, a new conservative flux-difference form for compact
finite difference schemes is derived and allows for the use of positivity-preserving limiters
for improved robustness. Different test cases demonstrate the ability of this scheme to capture
discontinuities in a robust and stable manner while also localizing the required numerical dissipation
only to regions containing discontinuities and very high wavenumber features and hence preserving
smooth flow features better in comparison to WCNS's.
