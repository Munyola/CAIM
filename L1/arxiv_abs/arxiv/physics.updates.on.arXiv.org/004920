CaLIPSO is an innovative photon detector concept designed for high precision brain PET imaging.
For the first time, liquid trimethylbismuth is used as sensitive medium. The detector operates
as a time-projection chamber and detects both Cherenkov light and charge signal. Indeed, each 511-keV
photon releases a single primary electron that triggers a Cherenkov radiation and ionizes the medium.
As trimethylbismuth has never been studied before, we measured its free ion yield defined as the
number of electron-ion pairs released by the primary electron. To this end, we developed a low-noise
measuring system to determine the weak current induced by a 60Co source in the liquid with an accuracy
better than 5 fA for an electric field up to 7kV/cm. We used tetramethylsilane as benchmark liquid
to validate the apparatus and we measured a zero-field free ion yield of 0.53 +/- 0.03 in agreement
with literature. However, we found a zero-field free ion yield of 0.083 +/- 0.003 for trimethylbismuth,
which is a factor 7 lower than the typical values for similar dielectric liquids. Quantum chemistry
computations on heavy atoms tend to demonstrate the high ability of trimethylbismuth to capture
electrons, which could explain this weak value. This recombination mechanism marks a new step in
understanding charge transport in liquid detectors. Finally, to verify the detectability of individual
charge pulses, we developed a charge pulse measurement system which has been successfully validated
with TMSi. Measurements with TMBi are ongoing.
