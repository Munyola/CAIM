This paper investigates the application of mesh adaptation techniques in the Non-Ideal Compressible
Fluid Dynamic (NICFD) regime, a region near the vapor-liquid saturation curve where the flow behavior
significantly departs from the ideal gas model, as indicated by a value of the fundamental derivative
of gasdynamics less than one. A recent interpolation-free finite-volume adaptive scheme is exploited
to modify the grid connectivity in a conservative way, and the governing equations for compressible
inviscid flows are solved within the Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian framework by including special
fictitious fluxes representing volume modifications due to mesh adaptation.The absence of interpolation
of the solution to the new grid prevents spurious oscillations that may make the solution of the flow
field in the NICFD regime more difficult and less robust.Non-ideal gas effects are taken into account
by adopting the polytropic Peng-Robinson thermodynamic model. The numerical results focus on
the problem of a piston moving in a tube filled with siloxane $\mathrm{MD_4M}$, a simple configuration
which can be the core of experimental research activities aiming at investigating the thermodynamic
behavior of NICFD flows. Several numerical tests involving different piston movements and initial
states in 2D and 3D assess the capability of the proposed adaption technique to correctly capture
compression and expansion waves, as well as the generation and propagation of shock waves, in the
NICFD and in the non-classical regime.
