The cocrystallization landscape of benzamide and urea interacting with aliphatic and aromatic
carboxylic acids was studied both experimentally and theoretically. Ten new cocrystals of benzamide
were synthesized using an oriented samples approach via a fast dropped evaporation technique.
Information about types of known bi-component cocrystals augmented with knowledge of simple binary
eutectic mixtures was used for the analysis of virtual screening efficiency among 514 potential
pairs involving aromatic carboxylic acids interacting with urea or benzamide. Quantification
of intermolecular interaction was achieved by estimating the excess thermodynamic functions
of binary liquid mixtures under supercooled conditions within a COSMO-RS framework. The smoothed
histograms suggest that slightly more potential pairs of benzamide are characterized in the attractive
region compared to urea. Finally, it is emphasized that prediction of cocrystals of urea is fairly
direct, while it remains ambiguous for benzamide paired with carboxylic acids. The two known simple
eutectics of urea are found within the first two quartiles defined by excess thermodynamic functions,
and all known cocrystals are outside of this range belonging to the third or fourth quartile. On the
contrary, such a simple separation of positive and negative cases of benzamide miscibility in the
solid state is not observed. The difference in properties between urea and benzamide R2,2(8) heterosynthons
is also documented by alterations of substituent effects...
