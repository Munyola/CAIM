We present the first experiments of dissolution-driven convection of carbon dioxide (CO$_2$)
in a confined brine-saturated porous medium at high pressures. We designed a novel Hele-Shaw cell
that allows for both visual and quantitative analyses, and address the effects of free-phase CO$_2$
and brine composition on convective dissolution. The visual examination of the gas volume combined
with the measurement of pressure, which both evolve with dissolution, enable us to yield insights
into the dynamics of convection in conditions that more closely reflect the geologic conditions.
We find and analyze different dissolution events, including diffusive, early and late convection,
and shut-down regimes. Our experiments reveal that in intermediate regime, a so-called `quasi-steady'
state actually never happens. Dissolution flux continuously decreases in this regime, which is
due to a negative feedback loop: the rapid reduction of pressure following convective dissolution,
in turn, decreases the solubility of CO$_2$ at the gas-brine interface and thus the instability
strength. We introduce a new scaling factor that not only compensates the flux reduction but also
the nonlinearities that arise from different salt types. We present robust scaling relations for
the compensated flux and for the transition times between consecutive regimes in systems with NaCl
(Ra $\sim$ 3271--4841) and NaCl+CaCl$_2$ mixtures (Ra $\sim$ 2919--4283). We also find that NaCl+CaCl$_2$
mixtures enjoy a longer intermediate period before the shut-down of dissolution, but with a lower
dissolution flux, as compared to NaCl brines...
