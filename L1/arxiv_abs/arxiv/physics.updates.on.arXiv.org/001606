Informed by LES data and resolvent analysis of the mean flow, we examine the structure of turbulence
in jets in the subsonic, transonic, and supersonic regimes. Spectral (frequency-space) proper
orthogonal decomposition is used to extract energy spectra and decompose the flow into energy-ranked
coherent structures. The educed structures are generally well predicted by the resolvent analysis.
Over a range of low frequencies and the first few azimuthal mode numbers, these jets exhibit a low-rank
response characterized by Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) type wavepackets associated with the annular
shear layer up to the end of the potential core and that are excited by forcing in the very-near-nozzle
shear layer. These modes too the have been experimentally observed before and predicted by quasi-parallel
stability theory and other approximations--they comprise a considerable portion of the total
turbulent energy. At still lower frequencies, particularly for the axisymmetric mode, and again
at high frequencies for all azimuthal wavenumbers, the response is not low rank, but consists of
a family of similarly amplified modes. These modes, which are primarily active downstream of the
potential core, are associated with the Orr mechanism. They occur also as sub-dominant modes in
the range of frequencies dominated by the KH response. Our global analysis helps tie together previous
observations based on local spatial stability theory, and explains why quasi-parallel predictions
were successful at some frequencies and azimuthal wavenumbers, but failed at others.
