Scientific research funding is allocated largely through a system of soliciting and ranking competitive
grant proposals. In these competitions, the proposals themselves are not the deliverables that
the funder seeks, but instead are used by the funder to screen for the most promising research ideas.
Consequently, some of the funding program's impact on science is squandered because applying researchers
must spend time writing proposals instead of doing science. To what extent does the community's
aggregate investment in proposal preparation negate the scientific impact of the funding program?
Are there alternative mechanisms for awarding funds that advance science more efficiently? We
use the economic theory of contests to analyze how efficiently grant proposal competitions advance
science, and compare them with recently proposed, partially randomized alternatives such as lotteries.
We find that the effort researchers waste in writing proposals may be comparable to the total scientific
value of the research that the funding supports, especially when only a few proposals can be funded.
Moreover, when professional pressures motivate investigators to seek funding for reasons that
extend beyond the value of the proposed science (e.g., promotion, prestige), the entire program
can actually hamper scientific progress when the number of awards is small. We suggest that lost
efficiency may be restored either by partial lotteries for funding, or by funding researchers based
on past scientific success instead of proposals for future work.
