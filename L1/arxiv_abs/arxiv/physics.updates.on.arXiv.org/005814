Purpose: Respiratory motion and the interplay effect cause the dose delivered to a patient with
spot-scanned proton therapy to differ from the dose planned for during optimization. A new 4D robust
optimization methodology was developed which incorporates patient breathing and the interplay
effect, as well as their uncertainties, into the optimization process... Methods: The 4D robust
optimizer used a 4DCT image set to obtain information regarding patient breathing and included
a beam-delivery simulation to incorporate the interplay effect. The doses from potential spots
were calculated on all breathing phases using Monte Carlo simulation, deformed to a reference phase
using deformable image registration, and then added in a weighted sum. The weights for the different
phases were based on the beam-delivery simulation. Robustness was added to the optimization by
considering range and setup uncertainties as physical-uncertainty scenarios and uncertainties
in the patient breathing and treatment delivery as temporal uncertainty scenarios... Results:
The 4D robustly optimized plans exhibited improved target coverage with an average increase in
the dose to 98% of the target volume of 4.9%, improved homogeneity with an average decrease in the
homogeneity index of 6.0%, and improved robustness with decreased ranges in coverage and homogeneity
amongst all uncertainty scenarios by averages of 35.0% and 52.5%, respectively... Conclusions:
A 4D robust optimizer was developed which included the interplay effect and did not depend on the
synchronization of breathing and delivery...
