Academic esteem is difficult to quantify in objective terms. Network theory offers the opportunity
to use a mathematical formalism to model both the esteem associated with an academic and the relationships
between academic colleagues. Early attempts using this line of reasoning have focused on intellectual
genealogy as constituted by supervisor student networks. The process of examination is critical
in many areas of study but has not played a part in existing models. A network theoretical "social"
model is proposed as a tool to explore and understand the dynamics of esteem in the academic hierarchy.
It is observed that such a model naturally gives rise to the idea that the esteem associated with a
node in the graph (the esteem of an individual academic) can be viewed as a dynamic quantity that evolves
with time based on both local and non-local changes in the properties in the network. The toy model
studied here includes both supervisor-student and examiner-student relationships. This gives
an insight into some of the key features of academic genealogies and naturally leads to a proposed
model for "esteem propagation" on academic networks. This propagation is not solely directed forward
in time (from teacher to progeny) but sometimes also flows in the other direction. As collaborators
do well, this reflects well on those with whom they choose to collaborate and those that taught them.
Furthermore, esteem as a quantity continues to be dynamic even after the end of a relationship or
career. In other words, esteem can be thought of as flowing both forward and backward in time.
