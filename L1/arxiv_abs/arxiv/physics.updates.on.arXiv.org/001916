Based on operations prescribed under the paradigm of Complex Transformation Optics (CTO) [1-5],
it was recently shown in [5] that a complex source point (CSP) can be mimicked by a parity-time ($\mathcal{PT}$)
transformation media. Such coordinate transformation has a mirror symmetry for the imaginary
part, and results in a balanced loss/gain metamaterial slab. A CSP produces a Gaussian beam and,
consequently, a point source placed at the center of such metamaterial slab produces a Gaussian
beam propagating away from the slab. Here, we extend the CTO analysis to non-symmetric complex coordinate
transformations as put forth in [6] and verify that, by using simply a (homogeneous) doubly anisotropic
gain-media metamaterial slab, one can still mimic a CSP and produce Gaussian beam. In addition,
we show that a Gaussian-like beams can be produced by point sources placed {\it outside} the slab
as well [6]. By making use of the extra degrees of freedom (real and imaginary part of the coordinate
transformation) provided by CTO, the near-zero requirement on the real part of the resulting constitutive
parameters can be relaxed to facilitate potential realization of Gaussian-like beams. We illustrate
how beam properties such as peak amplitude and waist location can be controlled by a proper choice
of (complex-valued) CTO Jacobian elements. In particular, the beam waist location may be moved
bidirectionally by allowing for negative entries in the Jacobian (equivalent to inducing negative
refraction effects). These results are then interpreted in light of the ensuing CSP location.
