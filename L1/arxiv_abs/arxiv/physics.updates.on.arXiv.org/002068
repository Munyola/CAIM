Empirical studies have shown that individuals' behaviors are largely influenced by social conformity,
including punishment. However, a coevolutionary theoretical framework that takes into account
effects of conformity on individuals' punishment behaviors has not been put forward yet. Herein
we propose a coevolutionary game model to extend the theory of cooperation with conformity in spatial
public goods game by considering pool punishment, as well as two converse feedback modes of conformity
that strongly affect cooperators' punishment behaviors. We focus on how different parameters
and spatial structures govern evolutionary dynamics on three different kinds of networks by employing
mean-field analysis based on replicator dynamics and Monte Carlo simulations. On regular lattices,
defectors are overall extincted since cooperators, especially selfish cooperators, have great
evolutionary advantages due to strong network reciprocity, and at the same time the number of altruistic
cooperators decays. Conversely, abundant shortcuts in regular random networks lead to the prevalence
of altruistic cooperators, but cooperators suffer from free-riding behaviors of defectors. Of
particular interest, we find that small-world topology can simultaneously help cooperators successfully
outperform defectors by means of strong network reciprocity, and enable rich contacting opportunities
with defectors to facilitate the expansion of altruistic cooperators. Therefore, we clarify that
small world is the optimal topology subject to the dominance of altruistic cooperators.
