The MAJORANA DEMONSTRATOR is an array of point-contact Ge detectors fabricated from Ge isotopically
enriched to 88% in Ge-76 to search for neutrinoless double beta decay. The processing of Ge for germanium
detectors is a well-known technology. However, because of the high cost of Ge enriched in Ge-76,
special procedures were required to maximize the yield of detector mass and to minimize exposure
to cosmic rays. These procedures include careful accounting for the material; shielding it to reduce
cosmogenic generation of radioactive isotopes; and development of special reprocessing techniques
for contaminated solid germanium, shavings, grindings, acid etchant and cutting fluids from detector
fabrication. Processing procedures were developed that resulted in a total yield in detector mass
of 70%. However, none of the acid-etch solution and only 50% of the cutting fluids from detector fabrication
were reprocessed. Had they been processed, the projections for the recovery yield would be between
80 -- 85%. Maximizing yield is critical to justify a possible future ton-scale experiment. A process
for recovery of germanium from the acid-etch solution was developed with yield of about 90%. All
material was shielded or stored underground whenever possible to minimize the formation of Ge-68
by cosmic rays, which contributes background in the double-beta decay region of interest and cannot
be removed by zone refinement and crystal growth. Formation of Ge-68 was reduced by a significant
factor over that in natural abundance detectors not protected from cosmic rays.
