Based on Minima Hopping and its capabilities of exploring potential energy surfaces we have developed
Minima Hopping Accelerated Path Search (MHAPS) which is a novel algorithm for efficiently finding
the reaction paths of complex chemical reactions by sampling collections of energetically low-lying
minima and first order saddle points of potential energy surfaces. For this new reaction path search
method we developed a highly reliable approach for computing saddle points which is based on the
idea of a bar rolling downwards the potential energy landscape. For Lennard-Jones benchmark systems,
Minima Hopping Accelerated Path Search was compared to a known mode-following based approach for
sampling collections of minima and first order transition states. Although we used a stabilized
mode-following technique that reliably allows to follow distinct directions that are defined
by the eigenvectors of the Hessian matrix, we observed that Minima Hopping Accelerated Path Search
is far superior in finding lowest-barrier reaction paths. By applying Minima Hopping Accelerated
Path Search to 75-atom and 102-atom Lennard Jones systems we found previously unknown reaction
paths that connect the two lowest minima of the 75-atom system. Compared to previously known paths,
the new paths contain a smaller number of intermediate transition states and the highest energy
along the paths is significantly lower in energy. In case of the 102-atom system Minima Hopping Accelerated
Path Search found a previously unknown energetically low-lying funnel.
