Archetypal scenarios for change detection generally consider two images acquired through sensors
of the same modality. However, in some specific cases such as emergency situations, the only images
available may be those acquired through sensors with different characteristics. This paper addresses
the problem of unsupervisedly detecting changes between two observed images acquired by different
sensors. These sensor dissimilarities introduce additional issues in the context of operational
change detection that are not addressed by most of classical methods. This paper introduces a novel
framework to effectively exploit the available information by modeling the two observed images
as a sparse linear combination of atoms belonging to an overcomplete pair of coupled dictionaries
learnt from each observed image. As they cover the same geographical location, codes are expected
to be globally similar except for possible changes in sparse spatial locations. Thus, the change
detection task is envisioned through a dual code estimation which enforces spatial sparsity in
the difference between the estimated codes associated with each image. This problem is formulated
as an inverse problem which is iteratively solved using an efficient proximal alternating minimization
algorithm accounting for nonsmooth and nonconvex functions. The proposed method is applied to
real multisensor images with simulated yet realistic and real images. A comparison with state-of-the-art
change detection methods evidences the accuracy of the proposed strategy.
