The PandaX-III experiment plans to search for neutrinoless double beta decay (0$\nu\beta\beta$)
of $^{136}$Xe in the China JinPing underground Laboratory (CJPL). The experiment will use a high
pressure gaseous Time Projection Chamber (TPC) to register both the energy and the electron track
topology of an event. This article is devoted to the software side of the experiment. As software
tool we use REST, a framework developed for the reconstruction and simulation of TPC-based detector
systems. We study the potential for background reduction by introducing appropiate parameters
based on the properties of 0$\nu\beta\beta$ events. We exploit for the first time not only the energy
density of the electron track-ends, but also the electron scattering angles produced by an electron
near the end of its trajectory. To implement this, we have added new algorithms for detector signal
and track processing inside REST. Their assessment shows that background can be reduced by about
7 orders of magnitude while keeping 0$\nu\beta\beta$ efficiency above 20% for the PandaX-III baseline
readout scheme, a 2-dimensional 3mm-pitch stripped readout. More generally, we use the potential
of REST to handle 2D/3D data to assess the impact on signal-to-background significance at different
detector granularities, and to validate the PandaX-III baseline choice. Finally, we demonstrate
the potential to discriminate surface background events generated at the readout plane in the absence
of $t_o$, by making use of event parameters related with the diffusion of electrons.
