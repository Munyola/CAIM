I argue that Immanuel Kant's critical philosophy---in particular the doctrine of transcendental
idealism which grounds it---is best understood as an `epistemic' or `metaphilosophical' doctrine.
As such it aims to show how one may engage in the natural sciences and in metaphysics under the restriction
that certain conditions are imposed on our cognition of objects. Underlying Kant's doctrine, however,
is an ontological posit, of a sort, regarding the fundamental nature of our cognition. This posit,
sometimes called the `discursivity thesis', while considered to be completely obvious and uncontroversial
by some, has nevertheless been denied by thinkers both before and after Kant. One such thinker is
Jakob Friedrich Fries, an early neo-Kantian thinker who, despite his rejection of discursivity,
also advocated for a metaphilosophical understanding of critical philosophy. As I will explain,
a consequence for Fries of the denial of discursivity is a radical reconceptualisation of the method
of critical philosophy; whereas this method is a priori for Kant, for Fries it is in general empirical.
I discuss these issues in the context of quantum theory, and I focus in particular on the views of the
physicist Niels Bohr and the Neo-Friesian philosopher Grete Hermann. I argue that Bohr's understanding
of quantum mechanics can be seen as a natural extension of an orthodox Kantian viewpoint in the face
of the challenges posed by quantum theory, and I compare this with the extension of Friesian philosophy
that is represented by Hermann's view.
