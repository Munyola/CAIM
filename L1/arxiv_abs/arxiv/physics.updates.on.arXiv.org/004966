The workhorse of atomic physics, quantum electrodynamics, is one of the best-tested theories in
physics. However recent discrepancies have shed doubt on its accuracy for complex atomic systems.
To facilitate the development of the theory further we aim to measure transition dipole matrix elements
of metastable helium (He*) (the ideal 3 body test-bed) to the highest accuracy thus far. We have undertaken
a measurement of the `tune-out wavelength' which occurs when the contributions to the dynamic polarizability
from all atomic transitions sum to zero; thus illuminating an atom with this wavelength of light
then produces no net energy shift. This provides a strict constraint on the transition dipole matrix
elements without the complication and inaccuracy of other methods. Using a novel atom-laser based
technique we have made the first measurement of the tune-out wavelength in metastable helium between
the $3^{3}P_{1,2,3}$ and $2^{3}P_{1,2,3}$ states at 413.07(2) nm which compares well with the
predicted value\cite{Mitroy2013} of 413.02(9) nm. We have additionally developed many of the
methods necessary to improve this measurement to the 100 fm level of accuracy where it will form the
most accurate determination of transition rate information ever made in He* and provide a stringent
test for atomic QED simulations. We believe this measurement to be one of the most sensitive ever
made of an optical dipole potential, able to detect changes in potentials of $\sim$200 pK and is widely
applicable to other species and areas of atom optics.
