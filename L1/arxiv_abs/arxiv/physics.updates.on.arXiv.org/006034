Recent simulation studies of the surface tension, and other properties of thin free-standing films,
have revealed unexpected finite size effects in which the variance of the properties vary monotonically
with the in-plane width of the films, complicating the extrapolation of estimates of film properties
to the thermodynamic limit. We carried out molecular dynamics simulations to determine the origin
of this phenomenon, and to address the practical problem of developing a more reliable methodology
for estimating the surface tension in the thermodynamic limit. We find that there are two distinct
finite size effects that must be addressed in a finite size analysis of the surface tension in thin
films. The first finite size scale is the in-plane width of the films and the second scale is the simulation
cell size in the transverse direction. Increasing the first scale enhances fluctuations in the
surface tension, measured by the standard deviation of their distribution, while increasing the
second reduces the surface tension fluctuations due to a corresponding increased "freedom" of
the film to fluctuate out of plane. We find that by using progressively large simulation cells in
the transverse direction, while keeping the film width fixed to an extent in which the full bulk liquid
zone is developed, allows us to obtain a smooth extrapolation to the thermodynamic limit, enabling
a reduction of the surface tension uncertainty to a magnitude on the order of 1% for systems having
a reasonable large size, i.e., O(1 micrometer).
