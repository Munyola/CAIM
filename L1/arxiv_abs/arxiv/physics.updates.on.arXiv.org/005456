Computational drug discovery provides an efficient tool helping large scale lead molecules screening.
One of the major tasks of lead discovery is identifying molecules with promising binding affinities
towards a target, a protein in general. The accuracies of current scoring functions which are used
to predict the binding affinity are not satisfactory enough. Thus, machine learning (ML) or deep
learning (DL) based methods have been developed recently to improve the scoring functions. In this
study, a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) model (called OnionNet) is introduced and the
features are based on rotation-free element-pair specific contacts between ligands and protein
atoms, and the contacts were further grouped in different distance ranges to cover both the local
and non-local interaction information between the ligand and the protein. The prediction power
of the model is evaluated and compared with other scoring functions using the comparative assessment
of scoring functions (CASF-2013) benchmark and the v2016 core set of PDBbind database. When compared
to a previous CNN-based scoring function, our model shows improvements of 0.08 and 0.16 in the correlations
(R) and standard deviations (SD) of regression, respectively, between the predicted binding affinities
and the experimental measured binding affinities. The robustness of the model is further explored
by predicting the binding affinities of the complexes generated from docking simulations instead
of experimentally determined PDB structures.
