Thermal systems are an attractive setting for exploring the connections between the lumped-element
approximations of elementary circuit theory and the partial-differential field equations of
mathematical physics, a topic that has been neglected in physics curricula. In a calculation suitable
for an undergraduate course in mathematical physics, we show that the response function between
an oscillating heater and temperature probe has a smooth crossover between a low-frequency, "lumped-element"
regime where the system behaves as an electrical capacitor and a high-frequency regime dominated
by the spatial dependence of the temperature field. Undergraduates can easily (and cheaply) explore
these ideas experimentally in a typical advanced laboratory course. Because the characteristic
frequencies are low, ($\approx$ 30 s)$^{-1}$, measuring the response frequency by frequency is
slow and challenging; to speed up the measurements, we introduce a useful, if underappreciated
experimental technique based on a multisine power signal that sums carefully chosen harmonic components
with random phases. Strikingly, we find that the simple model of a one-dimensional, finite rod predicts
a temperature response in the frequency domain that closely approximates experimental measurements
from an irregular, blob-shaped object. The unexpected conclusion is that the frequency response
of this irregular thermal system is nearly independent of its geometry, an example of---and justification
for---the "spherical cow" approximations so beloved of physicists.
