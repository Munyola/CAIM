The beyond mean-field dynamics of a bent dark soliton embedded in a two-dimensional repulsively
interacting Bose-Einstein condensate is explored. We examine the case of a single bent dark soliton
comparing the mean-field dynamics to a correlated approach, the Multi-Configuration Time-Dependent
Hartree method for Bosons. Dynamical snaking of this bent structure is observed, signaling the
onset of fragmentation which becomes significant during the vortex nucleation. In contrast to
the mean-field approximation "filling" of the vortex core is observed, leading in turn to the formation
of filled-core vortices, instead of the mean-field vortex-antivortex pairs. The resulting smearing
effect in the density is a rather generic feature, occurring when solitonic structures are exposed
to quantum fluctuations. Here, we show that this filling owes its existence to the dynamical building
of an antidark structure developed in the next-to-leading order orbital. We further demonstrate
that the aforementioned beyond mean-field dynamics can be experimentally detected using the variance
of single shot measurements. Additionally, a variety of excitations including vortices, oblique
dark solitons, and open ring dark soliton-like structures building upon higher-lying orbitals
is observed. We demonstrate that signatures of the higher-lying orbital excitations emerge in
the total density, and can be clearly captured by inspecting the one-body coherence. In the latter
context, the localization of one-body correlations exposes the existence of the multi-orbital
vortex-antidark structure.
