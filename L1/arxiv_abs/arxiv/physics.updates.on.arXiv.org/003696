Unrestricted DFT methods are typically expected to describe the homolytic dissociation of nonpolar
single bonds in neutral species with qualitative accuracy, due to the lack of significant delocalization
error. We however find that many widely used density functional approximations fail to describe
features along the dissociation curve of the simple H$_2$ molecule. This is not an universal failure
of DFT in the sense that many classic functionals like PBE and B3LYP give very reasonable results,
as do some more modern methods like MS2. However, some other widely used functionals like B97-D (empirically
fitted) and TPSS (non-empirically constrained) predict qualitatively wrong static polarizabilities,
force constants and some even introduce an artificial barrier against association of independent
H atoms to form H$_2$. The polarizability and force constant prediction failures appear to stem
from incomplete spin localization into individual H atoms beyond the Coulson-Fisher point, resulting
in `fractionally bonded' species where the ionic contributions to the Slater determinant are not
completely eliminated, unlike the case of unrestricted Hartree-Fock. These errors therefore
appear to be a consequence of poor self-consistent density prediction by the problematic functional.
The same reasons could potentially lead to spurious barriers towards H atom association, indirectly
also leading to incorrect forces. These unphysicalities suggest that the use of problematic functionals
is probably unwise in \textit{ab initio} dynamics calculations, especially if strong electrostatic
interactions are possible.
