Ultrasound computed tomography (USCT) holds great promise for breast cancer screening. Waveform
inversion-based image reconstruction methods account for higher order diffraction effects and
can produce high-resolution USCT images, but are computationally demanding. Recently, a source
encoding technique was combined with stochastic gradient descent to greatly reduce image reconstruction
times. However, this method bundles the stochastic data fidelity term with the deterministic regularization
term. This limitation can be overcome by replacing stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with a structured
optimization method, such as the regularized dual averaging (RDA) method, that exploits knowledge
of the composition of the cost function. In this work, the dual averaging method is combined with
source encoding techniques to improve the effectiveness of regularization while maintaining
the reduced reconstruction times afforded by source encoding. It is demonstrated that each iteration
can be decomposed into a gradient descent step based on the data fidelity term and a proximal update
step corresponding to the regularization term. Furthermore, the regularization term is never
explicitly differentiated, allowing non-smooth regularization penalties to be naturally incorporated.
The wave equation is solved by use of a time-domain method. The effectiveness of this approach is
demonstrated through computer-simulation and experimental studies. The results suggest that
the dual averaging method can produce images with less noise and comparable resolution to those
obtained by use of stochastic gradient descent.
