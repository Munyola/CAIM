Multicellular organisms consist of cells that interact via elaborate adhesion complexes. Desmosomes
are membrane-associated adhesion complexes that mechanically tether the cytoskeletal intermediate
filaments (IFs) between two adjacent cells, creating a network of tough connections in tissues
such as skin and heart. Desmoplakin (DP) is the key desmosomal protein that binds IFs, and the DP-IF
association poses a quandary: desmoplakin must stably and tightly bind IFs to maintain the structural
integrity of the desmosome. Yet, newly synthesized DP must traffick along the cytoskeleton to the
site of nascent desmosome assembly without 'sticking' to the IF network, implying weak or transient
DP--IF contacts. Recent work reveals that these contacts are modulated by post-translational
modifications (PTMs) in DP's C-terminal tail. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we have elucidated
the structural basis of these PTM-induced effects. Our simulations, nearing 2 microseconds in
aggregate, indicate that phosphorylation of S2849 induces an 'arginine claw' in desmoplakin's
C-terminal tail (DPCTT). If a key arginine, R2834, is methylated, the DPCTT preferentially samples
conformations that are geometrically well-suited as substrates for processive phosphorylation
by the cognate kinase GSK3. We suggest that DPCTT is a molecular switch that modulates, via its conformational
dynamics, DP's efficacy as a substrate for GSK3. Finally, we show that the fluctuating DPCTT can
contact other parts of DP, suggesting a competitive binding mechanism for the modulation of DP--IF
interactions.
