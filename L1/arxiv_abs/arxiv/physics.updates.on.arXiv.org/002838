Radical recombination has been proposed to lead to the formation of complex organic molecules (COMs)
in CO-rich ices in the early stages of star formation. These COMs can then undergo hydrogen addition
and abstraction reactions leading to a higher or lower degree of saturation. Here, we have studied
14 hydrogen transfer reactions for the molecules glyoxal, glycoaldehyde, ethylene glycol, and
methylformate and an additional three reactions where \ce{CH_nO} fragments are involved. Over-the-barrier
reactions are possible only if tunneling is invoked in the description at low temperature. Therefore
the rate constants for the studied reactions are calculated using instanton theory that takes quantum
effects into account inherently. The reactions were characterized in the gas phase, but this is
expected to yield meaningful results for CO-rich ices due to the minimal alteration of reaction
landscapes by the CO molecules. We found that rate constants should not be extrapolated based on
the height of the barrier alone, since the shape of the barrier plays an increasingly larger role
at decreasing temperature. It is neither possible to predict rate constants based only on considering
the type of reaction, the specific reactants and functional groups play a crucial role. Within a
single molecule, though, hydrogen abstraction from an aldehyde group seems to be always faster
than hydrogen addition to the same carbon atom. Reactions that involve heavy-atom tunneling, e.g.,
breaking or forming a C--C or C--O bond, have rate constants that are much lower than those where H
transfer is involved.
