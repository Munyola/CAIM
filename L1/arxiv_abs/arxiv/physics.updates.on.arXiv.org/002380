A system for online measurement of the transverse beam emittance was developed. It is named $^{4}$PrOB$\varepsilon$aM
(4-Profiler Online Beam Emittance Measurement) and was conceived to measure the emittance in a
fast and efficient way using the multiple beam profiler method. The core of the system is constituted
by four consecutive UniBEaM profilers, which are based on silica fibers passing across the beam.
The $^{4}$PrOB$\varepsilon$aM system was deployed for characterization studies of the 18~MeV
proton beam produced by the IBA Cyclone 18 MeV cyclotron at Bern University Hospital (Inselspital).
The machine serves daily radioisotope production and multi-disciplinary research, which is carried
out with a specifically conceived Beam Transport Line (BTL). The transverse RMS beam emittance
of the cyclotron was measured as a function of several machine parameters, such as the magnetic field,
RF peak voltage, and azimuthal angle of the stripper. The beam emittance was also measured using
the method based on the quadrupole strength variation. The results obtained with both techniques
were compared and a good agreement was found. In order to characterize the longitudinal dynamics,
the proton energy distribution was measured. For this purpose, a method was developed based on aluminum
absorbers of different thicknesses, a UniBEaM detector, and a Faraday cup. The results were an input
for a simulation of the BTL developed in the MAD-X software. This tool allows machine parameters
to be tuned online and the beam characteristics to be optimized for specific applications.
