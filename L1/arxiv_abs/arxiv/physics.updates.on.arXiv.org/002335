The implementation of non-classical light sources is becoming increasingly important for various
quantum applications. A particularly interesting approach is to integrate such functionalities
on a single chip as this could pave the way towards fully scalable quantum photonic devices. Several
approaches using dielectric systems have been investigated in the past. However, it is still not
understood how on-chip nanoplasmonic antennas, interacting with a single quantum emitter, affect
the quantum statistics of photons reflected or transmitted in the guided mode of a waveguide. Here
we investigate a quantum photonic platform consisting of an evanescently coupled nanoplasmonic
cavity-emitter system and discuss the requirements for non-classical light generation. We develop
an analytical model that incorporates quenching due to the nanoplasmonic cavity to predict the
quantum statistics of the transmitted and reflected guided waveguide light under weak coherent
pumping. The analytical predictions match numerical simulations based on a master equation approach.
It is moreover shown that for resonant excitation the degree of anti-bunching in transmission is
maximized for an optimal cavity modal volume $V_{c}$ and cavity-emitter distance $s$. In reflection,
perfectly anti-bunched light can only be obtained for specific $(V_{c},s)$ combinations. Finally,
our model also applies to dielectric cavities and as such can guide future efforts in the design and
development of on-chip non-classical light sources using dielectric and nanoplasmonic cavity-emitter
systems.
