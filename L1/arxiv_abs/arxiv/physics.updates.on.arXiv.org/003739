For more than 100 years, humanity (both specialists and enthusiastic laics) has been searching
for extraterrestrial life hoping we are not alone. The first step in the quest for extraterrestrial
life is to define what and where exactly to look for. Thus, the basic definition of living matter is
a conditio sine qua non for the quest. The diversity of species on Earth is so large that our quest for
extraterrestrial life cannot be limited to forms and shapes present and known to us from our environment.
However, there are two formal conditions that must be fulfilled in order for something to be assumed
as living matter. First, it should represent a growing open thermodynamic system (in biological
terms - a cell), and thus be a system out of equilibrium. Second, it must perform synthesis, self-assembly
and accumulation processes (in biological terms to grow, maintain homeostasis, respond to environment,
reproduce, exchange matter and energy, evolve). Populated planets are consisted of two components:
biosphere and its environment (geosphere, hydrosphere and atmosphere). Living matter and its
environment are out of equilibrium. Thus, the candidate planets are dynamic inhomogeneous systems
for two reasons. First, a planet receives energy from its star, which leads to disequilibrium for
external reasons. Animate matter contributes to disequilibrium for internal reasons: accumulation
of matter and self-assembly. In practice, for a screening, an astrobiologist should search for
increase in inhomogeneity on a candidate planet.
