Non-equilibrium wall turbulence with mean-flow three-dimensionality is ubiquitous in geophysical
and engineering flows. Under these conditions, turbulence may experience a counter-intuitive
depletion of the turbulent stresses, which has important implications for modelling and control.
Yet, current turbulence theories have been established mainly for statistically two-dimensional
equilibrium turbulence. In the present work, we investigate the non-equilibrium response of wall-bounded
turbulence under the sudden imposition of three-dimensional strain. The analysis is performed
via direct numerical simulation of transient three-dimensional turbulent channel flows at friction
Reynolds numbers up to 1,000, subjected to a sudden imposition of spanwise pressure gradient. We
show that the observed flow regimes and scaling properties of the Reynolds stress are consistent
with a model comprising momentum-carrying eddies with sizes and time scales proportional to their
distance to the wall. We further show that the reduction in Reynolds stress follows a spatially and
temporally self-similar evolution caused by the relative horizontal displacement between the
core of the momentum-carrying eddies and the layer underneath. The inspection of the flow energetics
also reveals that this mechanism is related to wall-normal turbulent diffusion which ultimately
inhibits the Reynolds stress. Finally, we assess the ability of the state-of-the-art wall-modelled
large-eddy simulation to predict non-equilibrium, three-dimensional flows.
