To complete the computation of Displacements per Atom (DPA) cross sections, the present work shows
the methods of calculating DPA cross sections with the nuclear data of energy-angular distribution
in both the laboratory and the Center-of-Mass (CM) frames. The method of direct calculation with
data in the CM frame is proposed and recommended to decrease the computation burden and keep all information.
Theoretical analyses reveal that more than 7-point Gauss-Legendre Quadrature (GLQ) should be
used to ensure the convergence of the angular integration for DPA computations. Numerical results
show that 8-point GLQ is sufficient for the continuum inelastic neutron scattering, while 64-point
GLQ is implemented in NJOY. Because the integrand over secondary energy is not derivable in the whole
domain of the secondary energy, the trapezoidal integration is used to perform the numerical integration.
The numerical calculations show that the trapezoidal integration is suitable to perform the integration
over the secondary energy on the fine grid given by nuclear data files at least for 56Fe. The present
work reveals that the direct interpolation of energy-angular-integrated damage can give the same
results computed with standard interpolated energy-angular distributions. The DPA cross sections
will be overestimated if isotropic angular distributions are assumed. However, the first-order
Legendre polynomial can give DPA cross sections within 0.4% deviation, while 12 orders are required
to describe the anisotropic angular distribution.
