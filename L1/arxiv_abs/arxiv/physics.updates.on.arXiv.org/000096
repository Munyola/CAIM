Organic molecules store the energy of absorbed light in the form of charge-neutral molecular excitations
-- Frenkel excitons. Usually, in amorphous organic materials, excitons are viewed as quasiparticles,
localized on single molecules, which diffuse randomly through the structure. However, the picture
of incoherent hopping is not applicable to some classes of molecular aggregates -- assemblies of
molecules that have strong near field interaction between electronic excitations in the individual
subunits. Molecular aggregates can be found in nature, in photosynthetic complexes of plants and
bacteria, and they can also be produced artificially in various forms including quasi-one dimensional
chains, two-dimensional films, tubes, etc. In these structures light is absorbed collectively
by many molecules and the following dynamics of molecular excitation possesses coherent properties.
This energy transfer mechanism, mediated by the coherent exciton dynamics, resembles the propagation
of electromagnetic waves through a structured medium on the nanometer scale. The absorbed energy
can be transferred resonantly over distances of hundreds of nanometers before exciton relaxation
occurs. Furthermore, the spatial and energetic landscape of molecular aggregates can enable the
funneling of the exciton energy to a small number of molecules either within or outside the aggregate.
In this review we establish a bridge between the fields of photonics and excitonics by describing
the present understanding of exciton dynamics in molecular aggregates.
