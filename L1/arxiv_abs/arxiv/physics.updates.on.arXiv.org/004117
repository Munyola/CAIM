Given a reaction-diffusion system interacting via a complex network, we propose two different
techniques to modify the network topology while preserving its dynamical behaviour. In the region
of parameters where the homogeneous solution gets spontaneously destabilized, perturbations
grow along the unstable directions made available across the networks of connections, yielding
irregular spatio-temporal patterns. We exploit the spectral properties of the Laplacian operator
associated to the graph in order to modify its topology, while preserving the unstable manifold
of the underlying equilibrium. The new network is isodynamic to the former, meaning that it reproduces
the dynamical response (pattern) to a perturbation, as displayed by the original system. The first
method acts directly on the eigenmodes, thus resulting in a general redistribution of link weights
which, in some cases, can completely change the structure of the original network. The second method
uses localization properties of the eigenvectors to identify and randomize a subnetwork that is
mostly embedded only into the stable manifold. We test both techniques on different network topologies
using the Ginzburg-Landau system as a reference model. Whereas the correlation between patterns
on isodynamic networks generated via the first recipe is larger, the second method allows for a finer
control at the level of single nodes. This work opens up a new perspective on the multiple possibilities
for identifying the family of discrete supports that instigate equivalent dynamical responses
on a multispecies reaction-diffusion system.
