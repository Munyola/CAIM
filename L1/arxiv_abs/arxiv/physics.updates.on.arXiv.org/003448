Stellarators are generically small current and relatively low plasma beta ($\beta= p/B^2\ll1$)
devices. Often the construction of vacuum magnetic fields with relatively good magnetic surfaces
is the starting point for an equilibrium calculation. Although in cases with some continuous spatial
symmetry flux functions can always be found for vacuum magnetic fields, an analogous function does
not, in general, exist in three dimensions. This work examines several relatively simple equilibrium
and vacuum magnetic field problems with the intent of demonstrating the possibilities and limitations
in the construction of such states. Starting with a very simple vacuum magnetic field with closed
field lines in a topological torus, we obtain a self-consistent formal perturbation series using
the amplitude of the non-symmetric vacuum fields as a small parameter. We show that systems possessing
stellarator symmetry allow the construction order by order. We further indicate the significance
of stellarator symmetry in the amplitude expansion of the full ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD)
problem as well. We then investigate the conditions that guarantee neighboring flux surfaces given
the data on one surface, by expanding in the distance from that surface. We show that it is much more
difficult to find low shear vacuum fields with surfaces than force-free fields or ideal MHD equilibrium.
Finally, we demonstrate the existence of a class of vacuum magnetic fields, analogous to "snakes"
observed in tokamaks, which can be expanded to all orders.
