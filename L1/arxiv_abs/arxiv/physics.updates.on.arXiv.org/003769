This letter presents the concept of Total Internal Reflection metasurface (TIR-MS) which supports
the realization of structure-embedded subwavelength acoustic shields for elastic waves propagating
in thin waveguides. The proposed metasurface design exploits extreme phase gradients, implemented
via locally resonant elements, in order to achieve operating conditions that are largely beyond
the critical angle. Such artificial discontinuity is capable of producing complete reflection
of the incoming waves regardless of the specific angle of incidence. From a practical perspective,
the TIR-MS behaves as a sound hard barrier that is impenetrable to long-wavelength modes at a selected
frequency. The TIR metasurface concept is first conceived for a flat interface embedded in a rectangular
waveguide and designed to block longitudinal S0-type guided modes. Then, it is extended to circular
plates in order to show how enclosed areas can be effectively shielded by incoming waves. Given the
same underlying physics, an equivalent dynamic behavior was also numerically and experimentally
illustrated for flexural A0-type guided modes. This study shows numerical and experimental evidence
that, when the metasurface is excited at the target frequency, significant vibration isolation
can be achieved in presence of waves having any arbitrary angle of incidence. These results open
interesting paths to achieve vibration isolation and energy filtering in certain prototypical
structures of interest for practical engineering applications.
