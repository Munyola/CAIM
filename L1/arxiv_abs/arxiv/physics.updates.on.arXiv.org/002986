This work investigated the vorticity dynamics and stability of leading-edge vortices (LEVs) in
revolving wings. Previous studies suggested that Coriolis acceleration and spanwise flow both
played key roles in stabilizing the LEV; however, the exact mechanism remains unclear. The current
study examined a mechanism that relates the effects of Coriolis acceleration, spanwise flow, and
the tilting of the planetary vortex on limiting the growth of the LEV. Specifically, this mechanism
states that a vertical gradient in spanwise flow can create a vertical gradient in Coriolis acceleration,
which will in turn produce oppositely-signed vorticity within the LEV. This gradient of Coriolis
acceleration corresponds to the spanwise (radial) component of planetary vortex tilting (PVTr)
that reorients the planetary vortex into the spanwise direction therefore creating oppositely-signed
LEV vorticity. Using an in-house, immersed-boundary-method flow solver, this mechanism was investigated
alongside the other vorticity dynamics for revolving wings of varying aspect ratio (AR=3, 5, and
7) and Reynolds number (Re=110, and 1400). Analyses of vorticity dynamics showed that the PVTr consistently
produced oppositely-signed vorticity for all values of AR and Re investigated, although other
three-dimensional phenomena play a similar but more dominant role when Re = 1400. In addition, the
relative strength of the PVTr increased with increasing AR due to a decrease in the magnitude of advection.
Finally, the effects of AR and Re on the vorticity dynamics and LEV stability were also investigated.
