This study presents active beam steering and afocal zooming of light by incorporating liquid crystals
(LCs) with graded index photonic crystal (GRIN PC). The GRIN PC structures are composed of low refractive
index polymer annular rods having gradually varied radii of holes. To actively manipulate incident
light, the annular rods are infiltrated with nematic LCs. By applying an external voltage to the
infiltrated LCs, the effective index profile of the low-index GRIN PC structure is modulated without
introducing any mechanical movement. The incident beam deflection and corresponding focal distance
modulation are tuned only by controlling the applied bias voltage. In the present work, hyperbolic
secant refractive index profile is chosen to design GRIN PC structures. To design GRIN PC structure
with annular PCs, Maxwell-Garnett effective medium approximation is employed. Moreover, we analytically
express the relation between infiltrated LCs and gradient parameter to show the physical background
of the tuning ability of the proposed devices. Also, beam steering and afocal zooming devices are
analytically investigated via geometrical optics and numerically realized with the help of the
finite-difference time-domain method. A beam deflection with an angle change of {\Delta}{\theta}out=
44{\deg} and a light magnification with maximum x2.15 are obtained. LCs are inexpensive materials
and work under low voltage/power condition. This feature can be used for designing an electro-optic
GRIN PC device that can be useful in various optical applications.
