For thin networked materials, which are spatial discrete structures constructed by continuum
components, a paradox on the effective thickness defined by the in-plane and out-of-plane stiffnesses
is found, i.e. the effective thickness is not a constant but varies with loading modes. To reveal
the mechanism underneath the paradox, we have established a micromechanical framework to investigate
the deformation mechanism and predict the stiffness matrix of the networked materials. It is revealed
that the networked materials can carry in-plane loads by axial stretching/compression of the components
in the networks and resist out-of-plane loading by bending and torsion of the components. The bending
deformation of components has a corresponding relation to the axial stretching/compression through
the effective thickness, as the continuum plates do, while the torsion deformation has no relation
to the axial stretching/compression. The isolated torsion deformation breaks the classical stiffness
relation between the in-plane stiffness and the out-of-plane stiffness, which can even be further
distorted by the stiffness threshold effect in randomly networked materials. Accordingly, a new
formula is summarized to describe the anomalous stiffness relation. This network model can also
apply in atomic scale 2D nanomaterials when combining with the molecular structural mechanics
model. This work gives an insight into the understanding of the mechanical properties of discrete
materials/structures ranging from atomic scale to macro scale.
