We present velocity power spectra computed by the so-called direct method from burst type laser
Doppler anemometer (LDA) data, both measured in a turbulent round jet and generated in a computer.
Using today's powerful computers we have been able to study more properties of the computed spectra
than was previously possible, and we noted some unexpected features of the spectra that we now attribute
to the unavoidable influence of a finite measurement volume (MV). The most prominent effect, which
initially triggered these studies, was the appearance of damped oscillations in the higher frequency
range, starting around the cut-off frequency due to the size of the MV. Using computer generated
data mimicking the LDA data, these effects have previously been shown to appear due to the effect
of dead time, i.e., the finite time during which the system is not able to acquire new measurements.
These dead times can be traced back to the fact that the burst-mode LDA cannot measure more than one
signal burst at a time. Since the dead time is approximately equal to the residence time for a particle
traversing a measurement volume, we are dealing with widely varying dead times, which, however,
are assumed to be measured for each data point. In addition, the detector and processor used in the
current study introduce a certain amount of fixed processing and data transfer times, which further
contribute to the distortion of the computed spectrum. However, we show excellent agreement between
a measured spectrum and our modeled LDA data thereby confirming the validity of our model for the
LDA burst processor.
