Laser ablation in liquid (LAL) is important perspective way to compose nanoparticles (NP) necessary
for modern technologies. LAL is not fully understood. Deep understanding is necessary to optimize
processes and decrease high price of the LAL NPs. Today there are two groups of studies: in one of them
scientists go from analyzing of bubble dynamics (thus they proceed from the late stages), while
in another one scientists investigate early stages of ablation. In the present paper we consider
the process as whole: from ablation and up to formation of a bubble and its inflation. Thus we cover
extremely wide range of spatiotemporal scales. We consider role of absorbed energy and duration
of pulse (femtosecond, multi-picosecond, nanosecond). Importance of supercritical states is
emphasized. Diffusive atomic and hydrodynamic mixing due to Rayleigh-Taylor instability and
their mutual interdependence are described. Liquid near contact with metal is heated by dissipation
in strong shock and due to small but finite heat conduction in liquid; metal absorbing laser energy
is hot and thus it serves as a heater for liquid. Spatial expansion and cooling of atomically mixed
liquid and metal causes condensation of metal into NPs when pressure drops below critical pressure
for metal. Development of bubble takes place during the next stages of decrease of pressure below
critical parameters for liquid and below ambient pressure in liquid. Thin hot layer of liquid near
contact expands in volume to many orders of magnitude filling the inflating bubble.
