The voter model with multiple states has found applications in areas as diverse as population genetics,
opinion formation, species competition and language dynamics, among others. In a single step of
the dynamics, an individual chosen at random copies the state of a random neighbor in the population.
In this basic formulation it is assumed that the copying is perfect, and thus an exact copy of an individual
is generated at each time step. Here we introduce and study a variant of the multi-state voter model
in mean-field that incorporates a variable degree of imperfection or error in the copying process.
We found that the ordering properties of the system, measured by a parameter $\psi$ in $[0,1]$, depend
on the amplitude of the copying error $\eta$ in $[0,1]$ and the population size $N$. In the case of
perfect copying $\eta=0$ the system reaches an absorbing configuration with complete order $\psi=1$
for all values of $N$. However, for any degree of imperfection $\eta>0$, we show that the average
value of the order parameter at the stationary state decreases with $N$ as $\langle \psi \rangle
\simeq 6/(\pi^2 \eta^2 N)$ for $\eta \ll 1$ and $\eta^2 N \gtrsim 1$. Therefore, the system becomes
totally disordered in the thermodynamic limit $N \to \infty$. Besides, we also show that $\langle
\psi \rangle \simeq 1- 1.64 \, \eta^2 N$ in the vanishing small error limit $\eta \to 0$ and thus, in
average, complete order is only achieved for $\eta=0$. These results are supported by Monte Carlo
simulations of the model, which allow to study other scenarios as well.
