Background: We have previously demonstrated that cortical folding across mammalian species follows
a universal scaling law that can be derived from a simple theoretical model. The same scaling law
has also been shown to hold across brains of our own species, irrespective of age or sex. These results,
however, only relate measures of complete cortical hemispheres. There are known systematic variations
in morphology between different brain regions, and region-specific changes with age. It is therefore
of interest to extend our analyses to different cortical regions, and analyze the scaling law within
an individual brain. Methods: To directly compare the morphology of sub-divisions of the cortical
surface in a size-independent manner, we base our method on a topological invariant of closed surfaces.
We reconstruct variables of a complete hemisphere from each lobe of the brain so that it has the same
gyrification index, average thickness and average Gaussian curvature. Results: We show that different
lobes are morphologically diverse but obey the same scaling law that was observed across human subjects
and across mammalian species. This is also the case for subjects with Alzheimer's disease. The age-dependent
offset changes at similar rates for all lobes in healthy subjects, but differs most dramatically
in the temporal lobe in Alzheimer's disease. Significance: Our results further support the idea
that while morphological parameters can vary locally across the cortical surface/across subjects
of the same species/across species, the processes that drive cortical gyrification are universal.
