The NASA/IPAC Teacher Archive Research Program (NITARP) provides a year-long authentic astronomy
research project by partnering a research astronomer with small groups of educators. NITARP has
worked with a total of 103 educators since 2005. In this paper, surveys are explored that were obtained
from 74 different educators, at up to four waypoints during the course of 13 months, from the class
of 2010 through the class of 2017; those surveys reveal how educator participants describe the major
changes and outcomes in themselves fostered by NITARP. Three-quarters of the educators self-report
some or major changes in their understanding of the nature of science. The program provides educators
with experience collaborating with astronomers and other educators, and forges a strong link to
the astronomical research community; the NITARP community of practice encourages and reinforces
these linkages. During the experience, educators get comfortable with learning complex new concepts,
with ~40% noting in their surveys that their approach to learning has changed. Educators are provided
opportunities for professional growth; at least 12% have changed career paths substantially in
part due to the program, and 14\% report that the experience was "life changing." At least 60% express
a desire to include richer, more authentic science activities in their classrooms. This work illuminates
what benefits the program brings to its participants; the NITARP approach could be mirrored in similar
professional development (PD) programs in other STEM subjects.
