For the simulation of disruptions in tokamak fusion plasmas, a fluid model describing the evolution
of relativistic runaway electrons and their interaction with the background plasma is presented.
The overall aim of the model is to self-consistently describe the nonlinear coupled evolution of
runaway electrons (REs) and plasma instabilities during disruptions. In this model, the runaway
electrons are considered as a separate fluid species in which the initial seed is generated through
the Dreicer source, which eventually grows by the avalanche mechanism (further relevant source
mechanisms can easily be added). Advection of the runaway electrons is considered primarily along
field lines, but also taking into account the ExB drift. The model is implemented in the nonlinear
magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) code JOREK based on Bezier finite elements, with current coupling to
the thermal plasma. Benchmarking of the code with the one-dimensional runaway electron code GO
is done using an artificial thermal quench on a circular plasma. As a first demonstration, the code
is applied to the problem of an axisymmetric cold vertical displacement event in an ITER plasma,
revealing significantly different dynamics between cases computed with and without runaway electrons.
Though it is not yet feasible to achieve fully realistic runaway electron velocities close to the
speed of light in complete simulations of slowly evolving plasma instabilities, the code is demonstrated
to be suitable to study various kinds of MHD-RE interactions in MHD-active and disruption relevant
plasmas.
