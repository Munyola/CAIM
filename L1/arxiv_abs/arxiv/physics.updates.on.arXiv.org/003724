The M87 jet is extensively examined by utilizing general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD)
simulations as well as the steady axisymmetric force-free electrodynamic (FFE) solution. Quasi-steady
funnel jets are obtained in GRMHD simulations up to the scale of $\sim 100$ gravitational radius
($r_{\rm g}$) for various black hole (BH) spins. As is known, the funnel edge is approximately determined
by the following equipartitions; i) the magnetic and rest-mass energy densities and ii) the gas
and magnetic pressures. Our numerical results give an additional factor that they follow the outermost
parabolic streamline of the FFE solution, which is anchored to the event horizon on the equatorial
plane. We also identify the matter dominated, non-relativistic corona/wind play a dynamical role
in shaping the funnel jet into the parabolic geometry. We confirm a quantitative overlap between
the outermost parabolic streamline of the FFE jet and the edge of jet sheath in VLBI observations
at $\sim 10^{1}$-$10^{5} \, r_{\rm g}$, suggesting that the M87 jet is likely powered by the spinning
BH. Our GRMHD simulations also indicate a lateral stratification of the bulk acceleration (i.e.,
the spine-sheath structure) as well as an emergence of knotty superluminal features. The spin characterizes
the location of the jet stagnation surface inside the funnel. We suggest that the limb-brightened
feature could be associated with the nature of the BH-driven jet, if the Doppler beaming is a dominant
factor. Our findings can be examined with (sub-)mm VLBI observations, giving a clue for the origin
of the M87 jet.
