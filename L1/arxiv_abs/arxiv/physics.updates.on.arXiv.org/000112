Theory of general relativity (GR) has been scrutinized by experts for almost a century and describes
accurately all gravitational phenomena ranging from the solar system to the universe. However,
this success is achieved provided one admits three completely independent new components in the
energy-stress tensor $T^{\mu\nu}$$-$inflaton, dark matter and dark energy, which though do not
have any non-gravitational or laboratory evidence and have remained generally speculative. Moreover,
the dark energy poses a serious confrontation between fundamental physics and cosmology. The present
situation reminds us of Einstein's `biggest blunder' when he forced his theory to predict a static
universe, perhaps guided by his religious conviction that the universe must be eternal and unchanging.
It seems that we are making a similar blunder by forcing $T^{\mu\nu}$ into the field equations while
the observations indicate that it is not needed. We seem to have a deep-rooted conviction that the
spacetime will remain empty unless we fill it by the energy-stress tensor. However, we have been
ignoring numerous evidences earnestly indicating otherwise. From a critical analysis of the present
situation, we develop an entirely new insight about the source of curvature in equations $R^{\mu\nu}=0$
which, though may appear orthogonal to the usual understanding, is in striking agreement with all
known phenomena in GR. Moreover, it answers some hitherto unexplained puzzles and circumvents
some long-standing problems of the standard paradigm.
