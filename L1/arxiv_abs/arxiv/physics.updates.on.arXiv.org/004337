Recent years have witnessed an extraordinary spurt in attention toward the wave manipulating strategies
revealed by coding metasurfaces as they build up a bridge between the physical and digital worlds.
Newly, it has been shown that when two different coding patterns responsible for doing separate
missions are added together based on the superposition theorem, the mixed coding pattern will perform
both missions at the same time. In this paper, via a semi-analytical procedure, we demonstrate that
such a theorem is not necessarily valid for all possible functionalities with considering phase-only
coding distributions and ignoring the element pattern function. By revisiting the addition theorem,
we introduce the concept of asymmetric spatial power divider (ASPD) with arbitrary power ratio
levels in which modulating both amplitude and phase of the meta-atoms is inevitable to fully control
the power intensity pattern of the metasurface. Numerical simulations illustrate that the proposed
ASPD driven by proper coding sequences can directly generate a desired number of beams with pre-determined
orientations and power budgets. The phase/amplitude-encoded Pancharatnam-Berry meta-atoms
realize the required coding pattern in each case and good conformity between simulations and theoretical
predictions verifies the presented formalism. This work exposes a new opportunity to implement
spatial power dividers for various applications such as multiple-target radar systems, beamforming
networks, and multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication.
