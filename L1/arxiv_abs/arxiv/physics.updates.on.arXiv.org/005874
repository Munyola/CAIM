Purpose: Various dose calculation algorithms are available for radiation therapy for cancer patients.
However, these algorithms are faced with the tradeoff between efficiency and accuracy. The fast
algorithms are generally less accurate, while the accurate dose engines are often time consuming.
In this work, we try to resolve this dilemma by exploring deep learning (DL) for dose calculation.
Methods: We developed a new radiotherapy dose calculation engine based on a modified Hierarchically
Densely Connected U-net (HD U-net) model and tested its feasibility with prostate intensity-modulated
radiation therapy (IMRT) cases. Mapping from an IMRT fluence map domain to a 3D dose domain requires
a deep neural network of complicated architecture and a huge training dataset. To solve this problem,
we first project the fluence maps to the dose domain using a modified ray-tracing algorithm, and
then we use the HD U-net to map the ray-tracing dose distribution into an accurate dose distribution
calculated using a collapsed cone convolution/superposition (CS) algorithm. Results: It takes
about one second to compute a 3D dose distribution for a typical 7-field prostate IMRT plan, which
can be further reduced to achieve real-time dose calculation by optimizing the network. For all
eight testing patients, evaluation with Gamma Index and various clinical goals for IMRT optimization
shows that the DL dose distributions are clinically identical to the CS dose distributions. Conclusions:
We have shown the feasibility of using DL for calculating radiotherapy dose distribution with high
accuracy and efficiency.
