Complex boundary lines can be characterized by fractal dimension, which provides important information
for spatial analysis of complex geographical phenomena such as cities. However, it is difficult
to calculate fractal dimension of boundaries systematically when image data is limited. An approximation
estimation formulae of boundary dimension based on square is widely applied in urban and ecological
studies. But sometimes, the boundary dimension is overestimated. This paper is devoted to developing
a series of practicable formulae for boundary dimension estimation using ideas from fractals.
A number of regular figures are employed as reference shapes, from which the corresponding geometric
measure relations are constructed; from these measure relations, two sets of fractal dimension
estimation formulae are derived for describing irregular boundaries. Correspondingly, a group
of shape indexes can be defined. A finding is that different formulae have different merits and spheres
of application, and the second set of boundary dimensions is a function of the new shape indexes.
Under condition of data shortage, these formulae can be utilized to estimate boundary dimension
values rapidly. Moreover, the relationships between boundary dimension and shape indexes are
revealing to understand the association and differences between characteristic scales and scaling
in spatial analysis. The formulae may be useful for the fractal studies in geography, geomorphology,
ecology, landscape science, and especially, urban science.
