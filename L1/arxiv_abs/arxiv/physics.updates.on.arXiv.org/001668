It is generally believed that, when a linguistic item acquires a new meaning, its overall frequency
of use in the language rises with time with an S-shaped growth curve. Yet, this claim has only been
supported by a limited number of case studies. In this paper, we provide the first corpus-based quantitative
confirmation of the genericity of the S-curve in language change. Moreover, we uncover another
generic pattern, a latency phase of variable duration preceding the S-growth, during which the
frequency of use of the semantically expanding word remains low and more or less constant. We also
propose a usage-based model of language change supported by cognitive considerations, which predicts
that both phases, the latency and the fast S-growth, take place. The driving mechanism is a stochastic
dynamics, a random walk in the space of frequency of use. The underlying deterministic dynamics
highlights the role of a control parameter, the strength of the cognitive impetus governing the
onset of change, which tunes the system at the vicinity of a saddle-node bifurcation. In the neighborhood
of the critical point, the latency phase corresponds to the diffusion time over the critical region,
and the S-growth to the fast convergence that follows. The duration of the two phases is computed
as specific first passage times of the random walk process, leading to distributions that fit well
the ones extracted from our dataset. We argue that our results are not specific to the studied corpus,
but apply to semantic change in general.
