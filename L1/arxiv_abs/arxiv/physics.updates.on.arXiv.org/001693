The theory for generalized auto-balanced Ramsey spectroscopy (GABRS) with an unprecedented robustness
to arbitrary relaxation and various technical pulse imperfections during the interrogation protocol
is presented. Such a universal two-loop real time correction requires two Ramsey sequences to be
interleaved with different dark times, including a periodic clock frequency measurement and an
concomitant variable parameter control loop to adjust the clock frequency correction. It is analytically
proven that the method always leads to perfect compensation of residual uncompensated light shifts
with an efficient stabilization of the clock frequency. This is in contrast to previously known
Hyper-Ramsey schemes, which can suffer from relaxation, time dependent pulse fluctuations, and
phase-jump modulation errors. Several variants of GABRS are explored based on different variable
parameters, including added relative phase shifts between Ramsey pulses, external frequency-step
compensation, and variable second-pulse duration. We demonstrate that a universal anti-symmetrical
error signal is generated only if an additional frequency-step applied during both Ramsey pulses
is used as the concomitant variable parameter. This universal technique can be applied to the fields
of atomic clocks, high-resolution molecular spectroscopy, magnetically-induced and two-photon
probing schemes, Ramsey-type mass spectrometry, and to the field of precision measurements. Some
variants of GABRS can also be applied for rf atomic clocks using CPT-based Ramsey spectroscopy of
the two-photon dark resonance.
