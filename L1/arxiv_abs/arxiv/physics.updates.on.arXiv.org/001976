Backward stimulated Raman scattering in gases provides a promising route to compression and amplification
of a Stokes seed-pulse by counter-propagating against a pump-pulse, as has been already demonstrated
in various platforms, mainly in free-space. However, the dynamics governing this process when
seeded by noise has not yet been investigated in a fully controllable collinear environment. Here
we report the first unambiguous observation of efficient noise-seeded backward stimulated Raman
scattering in a hydrogen-filled hollow-core photonic crystal fiber. At high gas pressures, when
the backward Raman gain is comparable with, but lower than, the forward gain, we report quantum conversion
efficiencies exceeding 40% to the backward Stokes at 683 nm from a narrowband 532-nm-pump. The efficiency
increases to 65% when the backward process is seeded by a small amount of back-reflected forward-generated
Stokes light. At high pump powers the backward Stokes signal, emitted in a clean fundamental mode
and spectrally pure, is unexpectedly always stronger than its forward-propagating counterpart.
We attribute this striking observation to the unique temporal dynamics of the interacting fields,
which cause the Raman coherence (which takes the form of a moving fine-period Bragg grating) to grow
in strength towards the input end of the fiber. A good understanding of this process, together with
the rapid development of novel anti-resonant-guiding hollow-core fibers, may lead to improved
designs of efficient gas-based Raman lasers and amplifiers operating at wavelengths from the ultraviolet
to the mid-infrared.
