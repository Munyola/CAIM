Liquid crystal based spatial light modulators are widely used in applied optics due to their ability
to continuously modulate the phase of a light field with very high spatial resolution. A common problem
in these devices is the pixel crosstalk, also called the fringing field effect, which causes the
response of these devices to deviate from the ideal behavior. This fringing effect decreases the
performance of the spatial light modulator and is shown to cause an asymmetry in the diffraction
efficiency between positive and negative diffraction orders. We use simulations of the director
distribution to reproduce diffraction efficiency measurements of binary and blazed gratings.
To overcome these limitations in performance, the simulations of the director distribution in
the liquid crystal layer are used to develop a fast and precise model to compute the phase response
of the spatial light modulator. To compensate the fringing field effect, we implement this model
in phase retrieval algorithms and calculate the phase profile corresponding to a regular spot pattern
as a generic example. With this method, we are able to increase the spot uniformity significantly
compared to a calculation without considering the fringing field effect. Additionally, polarization
conversion efficiencies of various simple phase patterns are simulated and measured for different
orientations of the spatial light modulator. We found that the polarization conversion has the
the smallest effect for a setup in which the liquid crystal molecules at the alignment layer lie in
the plane of incidence of the light beam.
