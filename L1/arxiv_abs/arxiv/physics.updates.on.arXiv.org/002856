Comb-based Fourier-transform spectroscopy utilizes two optical frequency combs to map the optical
field's spectrum to a radio-frequency, allowing improved speed, and accuracy. Despite its promises,
this scheme is compounded by the associated cost, complexity, and demanding stability requirements
of multiple laser frequency combs. Here, we overcome these challenges and demonstrate simultaneous
generation of multiple frequency combs from a single optical microresonator. Similar to space
division multiplexing in fibre optical communication, we generate several dissipative Kerr soliton
states, i.e. continuously circulating solitonic pulses driven by a continuous wave laser, in different
spatial modes of a $\rm MgF2$ microresonator. Up to three different soliton states are produced
simultaneously using a single pump laser, which enables both dual and triple frequency comb to be
generated from one device. The resulting combs have excellent mutual coherence and can have substantial
repetition rate differences, enabling fast acquisition speed, and effective suppression of intermodulation
products. Dual-comb spectroscopy with amplitude and phase retrieval is realised with the free-running
system, as well as coherent optical sampling to image the soliton dynamical instabilities. The
demonstrated triple-comb source, is amenable to photonic integrated resonators and has the potential
to extend comb-based spectroscopy to higher dimensionality, or enable advanced comb-based distance
measurement schemes that have remained impractical with current technology.
