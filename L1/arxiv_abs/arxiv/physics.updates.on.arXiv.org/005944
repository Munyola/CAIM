This review summarizes the coherent structures (CS) based on two-point correlations and their
applications, with a focus on the interpretation of statistic coherent structures and their characteristics.
We review studies on this topic, which have attracted attention in recent years, highlighting improvements,
expansions, and promising future directions for two-point statistics of coherent structures
in turbulent flow. The CS is one of typical structures of the turbulent flow, transporting energy
from large-scale to small-scale structures. To investigate the CS in the turbulence, a large amount
of two-point correlation techniques for CS identification and visualization have been, and are
currently being, intensively studied by researchers. Two-point correlations with examples and
comparisons between different methods are briefly reviewed at first. Some of the uses of correlations
in both Eulerian and Lagrangian frames of reference to obtain their properties at consecutive spatial
locations and time events are surveyed. Two-point correlations, involving space-time correlations,
two-point spatial correlations, and cross correlations, as essential to theories and models of
turbulence and for the analyses of experimental and numerical turbulence data are then discussed.
The velocity-vorticity correlation structures (VVCS) as one of the statistical CS based on two-point
correlations are reiterated in detail. Finally, we summarize the current understanding of two-point
correlations of turbulence and conclude with future issues for this field.
