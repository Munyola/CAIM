Mathematics demonstrates that an ideally evolving magnetic field has an exponentially increasing
sensitivity to non-ideal effects for all but truly exceptional evolutions. The implication is
that the theory of magnetic reconnection requires reconsideration in the limit as non-ideal effects
become small. Traditional theories are based on two-coordinate models, which exclude the exponentiation
effect that is robustly present for magnetic fields in three-dimensional space. Two issues not
explained by traditional theories are explained by the exponentiation effect: Why a near-ideal
evolution from an arbitrary initial state naturally leads to a state of fast magnetic reconnection.
What length of time is required to reach that state. Fast magnetic reconnection means at a rate determined
by Alfv\'enic, not resistive, physics. The exponentiation effect also explains why magnetic helicity
is conserved by a fast magnetic reconnection. What is paradoxical is how the energy can be rapidly
transferred from the magnetic field to the plasma in the limit as non-ideal effects become small.
This question is addressed by deriving the equation for the drive for Alfv\'en waves, a mechanism
that has been discussed before, as well as deriving a new effect, an effective parallel electric
field $\mathcal{E}_{||}$ that can accelerate particles even when the effect of the true parallel
electric field $E_{||}$ on particle acceleration is negligible. The paper is essentially self-contained,
but its relation to earlier work is explained.
