Fractal dimension (D) is an effective parameter to represent the irregularity and fragmental property
of a self-affine surface, which is common in physical vapor deposited thin films. D could be evaluated
through the scaling performance of surface roughness by using atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements,
but lots of AFM images with different scales (L) are needed. In this study, a surface roughness prediction
(SRP) method was proposed to evaluate D values of a single AFM image, in which the roughness at smaller
L was estimated by image segmentation with flatten modification. Firstly, a series of artificial
fractal surfaces with ideal dimension (Di) values ranging from 2.1 to 2.9 were generated through
Weierstrass-Mandelbrot (W-M) function, in order to compare SRP method with traditional methods
such as box counting method and power spectral density method. The calculated dimension (Dc) by
SRP method was much closer to Di than the other methods, with a mean relative error of only 0.64%. Secondly,
SRP method was utilized to deal with real surfaces, which were AFM images of amorphous alumina thin
films with L of 1-70 {\mu}m. Dc obtained by SRP method based on a single AFM image was also close to the
result in our previous study by multi-image analysis at L above 10 {\mu}m, while the larger Dc at smaller
L was consisted with the actual surface feature. The validity of SRP method and the physics nature
of real surfaces were discussed, which might be helpful to obtain more understandings of fractal
geometry.
