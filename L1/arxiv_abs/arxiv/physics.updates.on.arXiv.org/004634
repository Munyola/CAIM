Unconditionally secure communication, being pursued for thousands of years, however, hasn't
been reached yet due to continuous competitions between encryption and hacking. Quantum key distribution
(QKD), harnessing the quantum mechanical nature of superposition and non-cloning, may promise
unconditional security by incorporating the one-time pad algorithm rigorously proved by Claude
Shannon. Massive efforts have been made in building practical and commercial QKD systems, in particular,
decoy states are employed to detect photon-number splitting attack against single-photon source
loophole, and measurement-device-independent (MDI) QKD has further closed all loopholes in detection
side, which leads to a seemingly real-life application. Here, we propose and experimentally demonstrate
an MDI-QKD hacking strategy on the trusted source assumption by using injection locking technique.
Eve injects near off-resonance photons in randomly chosen polarization into sender's laser, where
injection locking in a shifted frequency can happen only when Eve's choice matches with sender's
state. By setting a shifted window and switching the frequency of photons back afterwards, Eve in
principle can obtain all the keys without terminating the real-time QKD. We observe the dynamics
of a semiconductor laser with injected photons, and obtain a hacking success rate reaching 60.0%.
Our results suggest that the spear-and-shield competitions on unconditional security may continue
until all potential loopholes are discovered and closed ultimately.
