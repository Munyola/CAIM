Charge transport layers (CTLs) are key components of diffusion controlled perovskite solar cells,
however, they can induce additional non-radiative recombination pathways which limit the open
circuit voltage (V_OC) of the cell. In order to realize the full thermodynamic potential of the perovskite
absorber, both the electron and hole transport layer (ETL/HTL) need to be as selective as possible.
By measuring the quasi-Fermi level splitting (QFLS) of perovskite/CTL heterojunctions, we quantify
the non-radiative interfacial recombination current for a wide range of commonly used CTLs, including
various hole-transporting polymers, spiro-OMeTAD, metal oxides and fullerenes. We find that
all studied CTLs limit the V_OC by inducing an additional non-radiative recombination current
that is significantly larger than the loss in the neat perovskite and that the least-selective interface
sets the upper limit for the V_OC of the device. The results also show that the V_OC equals the internal
QFLS in the absorber layer of (pin, nip) cells with selective CTLs and power conversion efficiencies
of up to 21.4%. However, in case of less selective CTLs, the V_OC is substantially lower than the QFLS
which indicates additional losses at the contacts and/or interfaces. The findings are corroborated
by rigorous device simulations which outline several important considerations to maximize the
V_OC. This work shows that the real challenge to supress non-radiative recombination losses in
perovskite cells on their way to the radiative limit lies in the suppression of carrier recombination
at the perovskite/CTL interfaces.
