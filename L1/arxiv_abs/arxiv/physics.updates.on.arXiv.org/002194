Diffusion MRI (dMRI) is a valuable tool in the assessment of tissue microstructure. By fitting a
model to the dMRI signal it is possible to derive various quantitative features. Several of the most
popular dMRI signal models are expansions in an appropriately chosen basis, where the coefficients
are determined using some variation of least-squares. However, such approaches lack any notion
of uncertainty, which could be valuable in e.g. group analyses. In this work, we use a probabilistic
interpretation of linear least-squares methods to recast popular dMRI models as Bayesian ones.
This makes it possible to quantify the uncertainty of any derived quantity. In particular, for quantities
that are affine functions of the coefficients, the posterior distribution can be expressed in closed-form.
We simulated measurements from single- and double-tensor models where the correct values of several
quantities are known, to validate that the theoretically derived quantiles agree with those observed
empirically. We included results from residual bootstrap for comparison and found good agreement.
The validation employed several different models: Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI), Mean Apparent
Propagator MRI (MAP-MRI) and Constrained Spherical Deconvolution (CSD). We also used in vivo data
to visualize maps of quantitative features and corresponding uncertainties, and to show how our
approach can be used in a group analysis to downweight subjects with high uncertainty. In summary,
we convert successful linear models for dMRI signal estimation to probabilistic models, capable
of accurate uncertainty quantification.
