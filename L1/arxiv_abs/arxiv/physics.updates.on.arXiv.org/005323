Constructing a classical potential suited to simulate a given atomic system is a remarkably difficult
task. This chapter presents a framework under which this problem can be tackled, based on the Bayesian
construction of nonparametric force fields of a given order using Gaussian process (GP) priors.
The formalism of GP regression is first reviewed, particularly in relation to its application in
learning local atomic energies and forces. For accurate regression it is fundamental to incorporate
prior knowledge into the GP kernel function. To this end, this chapter details how properties of
smoothness, invariance and interaction order of a force field can be encoded into corresponding
kernel properties. A range of kernels is then proposed, possessing all the required properties
and an adjustable parameter $n$ governing the interaction order modelled. The order $n$ best suited
to describe a given system can be found automatically within the Bayesian framework by maximisation
of the marginal likelihood. The procedure is first tested on a toy model of known interaction and
later applied to two real materials described at the DFT level of accuracy. The models automatically
selected for the two materials were found to be in agreement with physical intuition. More in general,
it was found that lower order (simpler) models should be chosen when the data are not sufficient to
resolve more complex interactions. Low $n$ GPs can be further sped up by orders of magnitude by constructing
the corresponding tabulated force field, here named "MFF".
