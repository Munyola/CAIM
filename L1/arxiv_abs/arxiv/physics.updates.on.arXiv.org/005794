The magnetic compression experiment at General Fusion was a repetitive non-destructive test to
study plasma physics applicable to Magnetic Target Fusion compression. A compact torus (CT) is
formed with a co-axial gun into a containment region with an hour-glass shaped inner flux conserver,
and an insulating outer wall. External coil currents keep the CT off the outer wall (radial levitation)
and then rapidly compress it inwards. The optimal external coil configuration greatly improved
both the levitated CT lifetime and the rate of shots with good flux conservation during compression.
As confirmed by spectrometer data, the improved levitation field profile reduced plasma impurity
levels by suppressing the interaction between plasma and the insulating outer wall during the formation
process. Significant increases in magnetic field, density, and ion temperature were routinely
observed at magnetic compression despite the prevalence of an instability, thought be an external
kink, at compression. Matching the decay rate of the levitation coil currents to that of the internal
CT currents resulted in a reduced level of MHD activity associated with unintentional compression
by the levitation field, and a higher probability of long-lived CTs. An axisymmetric finite element
MHD code that conserves system energy, particle count, angular momentum, and toroidal flux, was
developed to study CT formation into a levitation field and magnetic compression. An overview of
the principal experimental observations, and comparisons between simulated and experimental
diagnostics are presented.
