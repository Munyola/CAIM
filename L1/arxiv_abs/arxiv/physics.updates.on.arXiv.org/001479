Swirl-switching is a low-frequency oscillatory phenomenon which affects the Dean vortices in
bent pipes and may cause fatigue in piping systems. Despite thirty years worth of research, the mechanism
that causes these oscillations and the frequencies that characterise them remain unclear. Here
we show that a three-dimensional wave-like structure is responsible for the low-frequency switching
of the dominant Dean vortex. The present study, performed via direct numerical simulation, focuses
on the turbulent flow through a 90 \degree pipe bend preceded and followed by straight pipe segments.
A pipe with curvature 0.3 (defined as ratio between pipe radius and bend radius) is studied for a bulk
Reynolds number Re = 11 700, corresponding to a friction Reynolds number Re_\tau \approx 360. Synthetic
turbulence is generated at the inflow section and used instead of the classical recycling method
in order to avoid the interference between recycling and swirl-switching frequencies. The flow
field is analysed by three-dimensional proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) which for the first
time allows the identification of the source of swirl-switching: a wave-like structure that originates
in the pipe bend. Contrary to some previous studies, the flow in the upstream pipe does not show any
direct influence on the swirl-switching modes. Our analysis further shows that a three- dimensional
characterisation of the modes is crucial to understand the mechanism, and that reconstructions
based on 2D POD modes are incomplete.
