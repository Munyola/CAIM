Levitation of optical scatterers provides a new mean to develop free-space volumetric displays.
The principle is to illuminate a levitating particle displaced at high velocity in three dimensions
(3D) to create images based on persistence of vision (POV). Light scattered by the particle can be
observed all around the volumetric display and therefore provides a true 3D image that does not rely
on interference effects and remains insensitive to the angle of observation. The challenge is to
control with a high accuracy and at high speed the trajectory of the particle in three dimensions.
Systems that use light to generate free-space images either in plasma or with a bead are strictly
dependent of the scanning method used. Mechanical systems are required to scan the particles in
the volume which weakens the time dynamics. Here we use electrically driven planar Paul traps (PPTs)
to control the trajectory of electrically charged particles. A single gold particle colloid is
manipulated in three dimensions through AC and DC electrical voltages applied to a PPT. Electric
voltages can be modulated at high frequencies (150 kHz) and allow for a high speed displacement of
particles without moving any other system component. The optical scattering of the particle in
levitation yields free-space images that are imaged with conventional optics. The trajectory
of the particle is entirely encoded in the electric voltage and driven through stationary planar
electrodes. We show in this paper, the proof-of-concept for the generation of 3D free space graphics
with a single electrically scanned particle.
