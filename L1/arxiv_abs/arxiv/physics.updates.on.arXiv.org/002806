Secondary electron emission (SEE) from inner linings of plasma chambers in electric thrusters
for space propulsion can have a disruptive effect on device performance and efficiency. SEE is typically
calculated using elastic and inelastic electron scattering theory by way of Monte Carlo simulations
of independent electron trajectories. However, in practice the method can only be applied for ideally
smooth surfaces and thin films, not representative of real material surfaces. Recently, micro-architected
surfaces with nanometric features have been proposed to mitigate SEE and ion-induced erosion in
plasma-exposed thruster linings. In this paper, we propose an approach for calculating secondary
electron yields from surfaces with arbitrarily-complex geometries using an extension of the \emph{ray
tracing} Monte Carlo (RTMC) technique. We study nanofoam structures with varying porosities as
representative micro-architected surfaces, and use RTMC to generate primary electron trajectories
and track secondary electrons until their escape from the outer surface. Actual surfaces are represented
as a discrete finite element meshes obtained from X-ray tomography images of tungsten nanofoams.
At the local level, primary rays impinging into surface elements produce daughter rays of secondary
electrons whose number, energies and angular characteristics are set by pre-calculated tables
of SEE yields and energies from ideally-flat surfaces. We find that these micro-architected geometries
can reduce SEE by up to 50\% with respect to flat surfaces depending on porosity and primary electron
energy.
