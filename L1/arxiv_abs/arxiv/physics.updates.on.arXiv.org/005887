Plasmon-polaritons are among the most promising candidates for next generation optical sensors
due to their ability to support extremely confined electromagnetic fields and empower strong coupling
of light and matter. Here we propose quantum plasmonic immunoassay sensing as an innovative scheme,
which embeds immunoassay sensing with recently demonstrated room temperature strong coupling
in nanoplasmonic cavities. In our protocol, the antibody-antigen-antibody complex is chemically
linked with a quantum emitter label. Placing the quantum-emitter enhanced antibody-antigen-antibody
complexes inside or close to a nanoplasmonic (hemisphere dimer) cavity facilitates strong coupling
between the plasmon-polaritons and the emitter label resulting in signature Rabi splitting. Through
rigorous statistical analysis of multiple analytes randomly distributed on the substrate in extensive
realistic computational experiments, we demonstrate a drastic enhancement of the sensitivity
up to nearly 1500% compared to conventional shifting-type plasmonic sensors. Most importantly
and in stark contrast to classical sensing, we achieve in the strong-coupling (quantum) sensing
regime an enhanced sensitivity that is no longer dependent on the concentration of antibody-antigen-antibody
complexes -- down to the single-analyte limit. The quantum plasmonic immunoassay scheme thus not
only leads to the development of plasmonic bio-sensing for single molecules but also opens up new
pathways towards room-temperature quantum sensing enabled by biomolecular inspired protocols
linked with quantum nanoplasmonics.
