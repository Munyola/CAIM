We construct two classes of magnetohydrostatic (MHS) equilibria for an axisymmetric vertical
flux tube spanning from the photosphere to the lower part of the transition region within a realistic
stratified solar atmosphere subject to solar gravity. We assume a general quadratic expression
of the magnetic flux function for the gas pressure and poloidal current and solve the Grad-Shafranov
equation analytically. The solution is a combination of a homogeneous and a particular part where
the former is separable by a Coulomb function in $r$ and exponential in $z$, while the particular
part is an open configuration that has no $z$ dependence. We also present another open field solution
by using a self-similar formulation with two different profile functions and incorporating stratified
solar gravity to maintain the magnetohydrostatic equilibria, which is a modification of earlier
self-similar models with a twist. We study the admitted parameter space that is consistent with
the conditions in the solar atmosphere and derive magnetic and the thermodynamic structures inside
the flux tube that are reasonably consistent with the photospheric magnetic bright points (MBPs)
for both open and closed field Coulomb function and self-similar models as estimated from observations
and simulations. The obtained open and closed field flux tube solutions can be used as the background
conditions for the numerical simulations for the study of the wave propagation through the flux
tubes. The solutions can also be used to construct realistic magnetic canopies.
