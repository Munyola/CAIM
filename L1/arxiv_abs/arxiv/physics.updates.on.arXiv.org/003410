Strongly correlated systems of fermions have an interesting phase diagram arising from the Hubbard
gap. Excitation across the gap leads to the formation of doubly occupied lattice sites (doublons).
This state offers interesting electronic and optical properties. Moreover, when the system is
driven out of equilibrium interesting collective dynamics may arise that are related to the spatial
propagation of doublons. Here, a novel mechanism that was recently proposed by us [Balzer \textit{et
al.}, submitted for publication] is verified by exact diagonalization and nonequilibrium Green
functions (NEGF) simulations---fermionic doublon creation by the impact of energetic ions. We
report the formation of a nonequilibrium steady state with homogeneous doublon distribution.
A physically intuitive picture is given in terms of an analytical model for a two-site system where
the doublon formation is explained in terms of a two-fold passage of an avoided crossing (Landau-Zener
picture). The effect should be particularly important for strongly correlated finite systems,
such as graphene nanoribbons, and directly observable with fermionic atoms in optical lattices.
We demonstrate that doublon formation and propagation in correlated lattice systems can be accurately
simulated with NEGF. In addition to two-time results we present single-time results within the
generalized Kadanoff-Baym ansatz (GKBA) with Hartree-Fock propagators (HF-GKBA), and we present
systematic improvements that use correlated propagators (correlated GKBA).
