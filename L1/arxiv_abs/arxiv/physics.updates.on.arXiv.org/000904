We present a full two-fluid magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) description for a completely ionized hydrogen
plasma, retaining the effects of the Hall current, electron pressure and electron inertia. According
to this description, each plasma species introduces a new spatial scale: the ion inertial length
$\lambda_{i}$ and the electron inertial length $\lambda_{e}$, which are not present in the traditional
MHD description. In the present paper, we seek for possible changes in the energy power spectrum
in fully developed turbulent regimes, using numerical simulations of the two-fluid equations
in two-and-a-half dimensions (2.5D). We have been able to reproduce different scaling laws in different
spectral ranges, as it has been observed in the solar wind for the magnetic energy spectrum. At the
smallest wavenumbers where plain MHD is valid, we obtain an inertial range following a Kolmogorov
$k^{-5/3}$ law. For intermediate wavenumbers such that $\lambda_{i}^{-1} << k <<
\lambda_{e}^{-1}$, the spectrum is modified to a $k^{-7/3}$ power-law, as has also been obtained
for Hall-MHD (HMHD) neglecting electron inertia terms. When electron inertia is retained, a new
spectral region given by $k > \lambda_{e}^{-1}$ arises. The power spectrum for magnetic energy
in this region is given by a $k^{-11/3}$ power law. Finally, when the terms of electron inertia are
retained, we study the self-consistent electric field. Our results are discussed and compared
with those obtained in solar wind observations and previous simulations.
