An approach to a Unified Field Theory (UFT) is developed as an attempt to establish unification of
the Theory of Quantum Fields (QFT) and General Theory of Relativity (GTR) on the background of a covariant
differential calculus. A dual State Vector field (DSV)consisting of covariant and contravariant
N-component functions of variables of a N-dimensional unified manifod (UM)is introduced to represents
matter. DSV is supposed to transform in a way distinct from that of the differentials of the UM variables.
Consequently, the hybrid tensors and a hybrid affine tensor (Dynamic Connection, DC) are introduced.
The hybrid curvature form (HCF) is introduced as a covariant derivative of DC. A system of covariant
Euler-Lagrange (EL) equations for DSV, DC, and a twin couple of the triadic hybrid tensors (Split
Metric, SM)is derived. A scalar Lagrangian form is composed based on a set of principles suited for
UFT, including the homogeneity in the UM space, differential irreducibility and scale invariance.
The type of the manifold geometry is not specified in advance, in neither local (signature) nor regional
(topology) aspects. Equations for DSV play role of the Schroedinger-Dirac equation in space of
UM. By the correspondent EL equations, DC and SM are connected to DSV and become responsible for the
non-linear features of the system i.e. interactions. In this paper we mark breaking of a background
paradigm of the modern QFT, the superposition principle. The issue of the UM-MF dimensionality
will be addressed, and relations to the principles and methodology of QFT and GTR will be discussed.
