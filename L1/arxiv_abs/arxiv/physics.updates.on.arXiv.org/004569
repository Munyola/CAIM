In this paper, we demonstrate a simple scheme of 6.835 GHz microwave frequency synthesizer based
on the sub-sampling phase lock loop (PLL) technique. The application of the sub-sampling PLL is
the key to simplify the architecture of the synthesizer in this scheme. A 100 MHz oven controlled
crystal oscillator (OCXO) with ultra-low phase noise is used as the initial signal source. Then
a dielectric resonant oscillator (DRO) of 6.8 GHz is directly phase locked to the 100 MHz OCXO utilizing
the sub-sampling PLL. Benefiting from the sub-sampling PLL, the processes of microwave frequency
multiplication and phase lock which are necessary in the development of microwave synthesizer
are greatly simplified. Therefore, the architecture of the synthesizer is very simple. Correspondingly,
the power consumption and cost of the synthesizer are low. The absolute phase noises of the 6.835
GHz output signal are measured to be -47 dBc/Hz, -77 dBc/Hz, -104 dBc/Hz and -121 dBc/Hz at 1 Hz, 10
Hz, 100 Hz and 1 kHz offset frequencies, respectively. he synthesizer can be used as the local oscillator
of the Rb atomic clocks. For the Rb atomic clocks operated in the continuous or pulsed optically pumped
(POP) mode, Tthe short-term frequency stability limited by the absolute phase noises of the synthesizer
through the intermodulation or the Dick effect is theoretically calculated to be better than 5.0E10^-14/t^1/2.
This low phase noise microwave frequency synthesizer can be used in other experiments of fundamental
physics measurement.
