Polaritons in 2D and van der Waals (vdW) materials have been investigated in several recent works
as an innovative platform for light-matter interaction, rich of new physical phenomena.Hexagonal
Boron Nitride (h-BN), in particular, is an out of plane anisotropic material (while it is in-plane
isotropic) with two very strong phonon polaritons bands where the permittivity becomes negative.
In the first restrahlen band (RS1, 780-830 cm-1) the relative out of plane permittivity is negative,
while in the second restrahlen band (RS2, 1370-1610 cm-1) the relative in-plane permittivity is
negative. Due to these optical properties, thin h-BN flakes support guided modes which have been
observed experimentally both via far field and near field methods. In this work, we show how selectively
excite the more confined modes in the RS1 and RS2 bands. The supported guided modes have phase and
group velocities respectively tens and hundreds of times slower than the speed of light. We also
show the possibility of full hyperspectral nano-imaging of modes in RS1 band by means of photo-induced
force microscopy (PiFM). Moreover, a direct comparison of (PiFM) and scattering-type near-field
microscopy (s-SNOM) is obtained by imaging the modes of the RS2 band with both techniques implemented
on the same platform. The possibility of addressing ultraslow (ultraconfined) polaritonic modes
of h-BN crystal flakes together with the possibility of optical nano-imaging in both the restrahlen
bands have many innovative aspects that can lead to unprecedented schemes for strong light-matter
interaction, slow and confined light.
