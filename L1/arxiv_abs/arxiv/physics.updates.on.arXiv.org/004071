Manifold-learning techniques are routinely used in mining complex spatiotemporal data to extract
useful, parsimonious data representations/parametrizations; these are, in turn, useful in nonlinear
model identification tasks. We focus here on the case of time series data that can ultimately be modelled
as a spatially distributed system (e.g. a partial differential equation, PDE), but where we do not
know the space in which this PDE should be formulated. Hence, even the spatial coordinates for the
distributed system themselves need to be identified - to emerge from - the data mining process. We
will first validate this emergent space reconstruction for time series sampled without space labels
in known PDEs; this brings up the issue of observability of physical space from temporal observation
data, and the transition from spatially resolved to lumped (order-parameter-based) representations
by tuning the scale of the data mining kernels. We will then present actual emergent space discovery
illustrations. Our illustrative examples include chimera states (states of coexisting coherent
and incoherent dynamics), and chaotic as well as quasiperiodic spatiotemporal dynamics, arising
in partial differential equations and/or in heterogeneous networks. We also discuss how data-driven
spatial coordinates can be extracted in ways invariant to the nature of the measuring instrument.
Such gauge-invariant data mining can go beyond the fusion of heterogeneous observations of the
same system, to the possible matching of apparently different systems.
