We study the theoretical foundations for the pressure shifts in high-precision atomic beam spectrosopy
of hydrogen, with a particular emphasis on transitions involving higher excited P states. In particular,
the long-range interaction of an excited hydrogen atom in a 4P state with a ground-state and metastable
hydrogen atom is studied, with a full resolution of the hyperfine structure. It is found that the
full inclusion of the 4P_1/2 and 4P_3/2 manifolds becomes necessary in order to obtain reliable
theoretical predictions, because the 1S ground state hyperfine frequency is commensurate with
the 4P fine-structure splitting. An even more complex problem is encountered in the case of the 4P-2S
interaction, where the inclusion of quasi-degenerate 4S-2P_1/2 state becomes necessary in view
of the dipole couplings induced by the van der Waals Hamiltonian. Matrices of dimension up to 40 have
to be treated despite all efforts to reduce the problem to irreducible submanifolds within the quasi-degenerate
basis. We focus on the phenomenologically important second-order van der Waals shifts, proportional
to 1/R^6 where R is the interatomic distance, and obtain results with full resolution of the hyperfine
structure. The magnitude of van der Waals coefficients for hydrogen atom-atom collisions involving
excited P states is drastically enhanced due to energetic quasi-degeneracy; we find no such enhancement
for atom-molecule collisions involving atomic nP states, even if the complex molecular spectrum
involving ro-vibrational levels requires a deeper analysis.
