We review a scalable two- and three-dimensional computer code for low-temperature plasma simulations
in multi-material complex geometries. Our approach is based on embedded boundary (EB) finite volume
discretizations of the minimal fluid-plasma model on adaptive Cartesian grids, extended to also
account for charging of insulating surfaces. We discuss the spatial and temporal discretization
methods, and show that the resulting overall method is second order convergent, monotone, and conservative
(for smooth solutions). Weak scalability with parallel efficiencies over 70\% are demonstrated
up to 8192 cores and more than one billion cells. We then demonstrate the use of adaptive mesh refinement
in multiple two- and three-dimensional simulation examples at modest cores counts. The examples
include two-dimensional simulations of surface streamers along insulators with surface roughness;
fully three-dimensional simulations of filaments in experimentally realizable pin-plane geometries,
and three-dimensional simulations of positive plasma discharges in multi-material complex geometries.
The largest computational example uses up to $800$ million mesh cells with billions of unknowns
on $4096$ computing cores. Our use of computer-aided design (CAD) and constructive solid geometry
(CSG) combined with capabilities for parallel computing offers possibilities for performing
three-dimensional transient plasma-fluid simulations, also in multi-material complex geometries
at moderate pressures and comparatively large scale.
