This paper uses asymptotic analysis within the generalized acoustic analogy formulation (Goldstein.
J. Fluid Mech 488, pp. 315-333, 2003) to develop a noise prediction model for the peak sound of axisymmetric
round jets at subsonic acoustic Mach numbers ($Ma$). The analogy shows that the exact formula for
the acoustic pressure is given by a convolution product of a propagator tensor (determined by the
vector Green's function of the adjoint linearized Euler equations for a given jet mean flow) and
a generalized source term representing the jet turbulence field. Using a low frequency/small spread
rate asymptotic expansion of the propagator, mean flow non-parallelism enters the lowest order
Green's function solution via the streamwise component of the mean flow advection vector in a hyperbolic
partial differential equation (PDE). We then address the predictive capability of the solution
to this PDE when used in the analogy through first-of-its-kind numerical calculations when an experimentally-verified
model of the turbulence source structure is used together with Reynolds-averaged Navier Stokes
solutions for the jet mean flow. Our noise predictions show a reasonable level of accuracy in the
peak noise direction at $Ma=0.9$, for Strouhal number up to about $0.6$, and at $Ma=0.5$ using modified
source coefficients. Possible reasons for this are discussed. Moreover, the prediction range
can be extended beyond unity Strouhal number by using an approximate composite asymptotic formula
for the vector Green's function that reduces to the locally parallel flow limit at high frequencies.
