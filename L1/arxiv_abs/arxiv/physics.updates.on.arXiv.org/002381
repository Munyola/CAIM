The biotransport of the intravascular nanoparticle (NP) is influenced by both the complex cellular
flow environment and the NP characteristics. Being able to computationally simulate such intricate
transport phenomenon with high efficiency is of far-reaching significance to the development
of nanotherapeutics, yet challenging due to large length-scale discrepancies between NP and red
blood cell (RBC) as well as the complexity of NP dynamics. Recently, a lattice-Boltzmann (LB) based
multiscale simulation method has been developed to capture both NP scale and cellular level transport
phenomenon at high computational efficiency. The basic components of this method include the LB
treatment for the fluid phase, a spectrin-link method for RBCs, and a Langevin dynamics (LD) approach
to capturing the motion of the suspended NPs. Comprehensive two-way coupling schemes are established
to capture accurate interactions between each component. The accuracy and robustness of the LB-LD
coupling method are demonstrated through the relaxation of a single NP with initial momentum and
self-diffusion of NPs. This approach is then applied to study the migration of NPs in a capillary
vessel under physiological conditions. It is shown that Brownian motion is most significant for
the NP distribution in capillary vessels. For 1~100 nm particles, the Brownian diffusion is the
dominant radial diffusive mechanism compared to the RBC-enhanced diffusion. For ~500 nm particles,
the Brownian diffusion and RBC-enhanced diffusion are comparable drivers for the particle radial
diffusion process.
