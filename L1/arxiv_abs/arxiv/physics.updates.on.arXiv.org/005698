In car-following models, the driver reacts according to his physical and psychological abilities
which may change over time. However, most car-following models are deterministic and do not capture
the stochastic nature of human perception. It is expected that purely deterministic traffic models
may produce unrealistic results due to the stochastic driving behaviors of drivers. This paper
is devoted to the development of a distinct car-following model where a stochastic process is adopted
to describe the time-varying random acceleration which essentially reflects the random individual
perception of driver behavior with respect to the leading vehicle over time. In particular, we apply
coupled Langevin equations to model complex human driver behavior. In the proposed model, an extended
Cox-Ingersoll-Ross (CIR) stochastic process will be used to describe the stochastic speed of the
follower in response to the stimulus of the leader. An important property of the extended CIR process
is to enhance the non-negative properties of the stochastic traffic variables (e.g. non-negative
speed) for any arbitrary model parameters. Based on stochastic process theories, we derive stochastic
linear stability conditions which, for the first time, theoretically capture the effect of the
random parameter on traffic instabilities. Our stability results conform to the empirical results
that the traffic instability is related to the stochastic nature of traffic flow at the low speed
conditions, even when traffic is deemed to be stable from deterministic models.
