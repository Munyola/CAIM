The current study investigates the far wake region behind helicopter hub models composed of geometrically
simple, canonical bluff body shapes. The models consisted of a 4-arm rotor mounted on a shaft above
a 2-arm (scissor) rotor with all the arms having a rectangular cross section. The relative phase
between the 2- and 4-arm rotors was either $0\deg$ (in-phase) or $45\deg$ (out- of-phase). The rotors
were oriented at a zero angle-of-attack and rotated at $30$ Hz. Their wakes were measured with particle-image-velocimetry
within a water tunnel operating at a freestream speed of 10 m/s, which produced a hub diameter based
Reynolds number of $760,000$ and a $0.2$ advance ratio. Mean profiles, fluctuating profiles and
spectral analysis using time-series analysis as well as dynamic mode decomposition were used to
characterize the wake and identify coherent structures associated with specific frequency content.
The canonical geometry produced coherent structures that were consistent with previous results
using more complex geometries. It was shown that the dominant structures ($2$ and $4$ times per hub
revolution) decay slowly and were not sensitive to the relative phase between the rotors. Conversely,
the next strongest structure ($6$ times per hub revolution) was sensitive to the relative phase
with almost no coherence observed for the in-phase model. This study demonstrates that the far wake
region is dominated by the main rotor arms wake, the scissor rotor wake and interactions between
these two features.
