Numerous geological observations evidence that inelastic deformation occurs during sills and
laccoliths emplacement. However, most models of sill and laccolith emplacement neglect inelastic
processes by assuming purely elastic deformation of the host rock. This assumption has never been
tested, so that the role of inelastic deformation on the growth dynamics of magma intrusions remains
poorly understood. In this paper, we introduce the first analytical model of shallow sill and laccolith
emplacement that accounts for elasto-plastic deformation of the host rock. It considers the intrusion's
overburden as a thin elastic bending plate attached to an elastic-perfectly-plastic foundation.
We find that, for geologically realistic values of the model parameters, the horizontal extent
of the plastic zone lp is much smaller than the radius of the intrusion a. By modeling the quasi-static
growth of a sill, we find that the ratio lp/a decreases during propagation, as 1/ $\sqrt$ a 4 $\Delta$P
, with $\Delta$P the magma overpressure. The model also shows that the extent of the plastic zone
decreases with the intrusion's depth, while it increases if the host rock is weaker. Comparison
between our elasto-plastic model and existing purely elastic models shows that plasticity can
have a significant effect on intrusion propagation dynamics, with e.g. up to a doubling of the overpressure
necessary for the sill to grow. Our results suggest that plasticity effects might be small for large
sills, but conversely that they might be substantial for early sill propagation. 2
