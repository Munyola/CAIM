The primordial confrontation underlying the existence of our universe can be conceived as the battle
between entropy and complexity. The law of ever-increasing entropy (Boltzmann H-theorem) evokes
an irreversible, one-directional evolution (or rather involution) going uniformly and monotonically
from birth to death. Since the 19th century, this concept is one of the cornerstones and in the same
time puzzles of statistical mechanics. On the other hand, there is the empirical experience where
one witnesses the emergence, growth and diversification of new self-organized objects with ever-increasing
complexity. When modeling them in terms of simple discrete elements one finds that the emergence
of collective complex adaptive objects is a rather generic phenomenon governed by a new type of laws.
These 'emergence' laws, not connected directly with the fundamental laws of the physical reality,
nor acting 'in addition' to them but acting through them were called by Phil Anderson 'More is Different',
'das Maass' by Hegel etc. Even though the 'emergence laws' act through the intermediary of the fundamental
laws that govern the individual elementary agents, it turns out that different systems apparently
governed by very different fundamental laws: gravity, chemistry, biology, economics, social
psychology, end up often with similar emergence laws and outcomes. In particular the emergence
of adaptive collective objects endows the system with a granular structure which in turn causes
specific macroscopic cycles of intermittent fluctuations.
