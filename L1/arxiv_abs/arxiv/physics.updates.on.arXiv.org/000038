In a semiclassical view superconductivity is attributed exclusively to the advance of atoms' outer
s electrons through the nuclei of neighbor atoms in a solid. The necessary progression of holes in
the opposite direction has the electric and magnetic effect as if two electrons were advancing instead
of each actual one. Superconductivity ceases when the associated lateral oscillation of the outer
s electrons extends between neighbor atoms. If such overswing occurs already at T = 0, then the material
is a normal conductor. Otherwise, lateral overswing can be caused by lattice vibrations at a critical
temperature Tc or by a critical magnetic field Bc. Lateral electron oscillations are reduced - and
Tc is increased - when the atoms of the outer s electrons are squeezed, be it in the bulk crystal, in
a thin film, or under external pressure on the sample. The model is applied to alkali metals and alkali-doped
fullerenes. Aluminum serves as an example of a simple metal with superconductivity. Application
of the model to transition metals, intertransitional alloys and compounds of transition metals
with other elements sheds light on the pattern of their critical temperature. More examples of the
squeeze effect are provided by the superconductivity of PdH, MgB2, borocarbides, ferropnictides,
and organic charge-transfer salts. The model also provides the superconduction mechanism in the
oxide superconductors, exemplified by YBa2Cu3O7. Finally the model suggests which steps to take
in order to reach superconductivity at room temperature and above.
