Modern coordinate measurement machines (CMM) are universal tools to measure geometric features
of complex three-dimensional workpieces. To use them as reliable means of quality control, the
suitability of the device for the specific measurement task has to be proven. Therefore, the ISO
14253 standard requires, knowledge of the measurement uncertainty and, that it is in reasonable
relation with the specified tolerances. Hence, the determination of the measurement uncertainty,
which is a complex and also costly task, is of utmost importance. The measurement uncertainty is
usually influenced by several contributions of various sources. Among those of the machine itself,
e.g., guideway errors and the influence of the probe and styli play an important role. Furthermore,
several properties of the workpiece, such as its form deviations and surface roughness, have to
be considered. Also the environmental conditions, i.e., temperature and its gradients, pressure,
relative humidity and others contribute to the overall measurement uncertainty. Currently, there
are different approaches to determine task-specific measurement uncertainties. This work reports
on recent advancements extending the well-established method of PTB's Virtual Coordinate Measuring
Machine (VCMM) to suit present-day needs in industrial applications. The VCMM utilizes numerical
simulations to determine the task-specific measurement uncertainty incorporating broad knowledge
about the contributions of, e.g., the used CMM, the environment and the workpiece.
