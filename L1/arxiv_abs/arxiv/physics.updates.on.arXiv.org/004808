Collective motion emerges spontaneously in many biological systems such as bird flocks, insect
swarms and tissue under dynamic reorganization. This phenomenon is often modeled within the framework
of active fluids, where the constituent active particles, when interactions with other particles
are switched off, perform normal diffusion at long times. However, single-particle superdiffusion
and fat-tailed displacement statistics are also widespread in biology as, e.g., they can represent
optimal search strategies for living organisms. The collective properties of interacting systems
exhibiting such anomalous diffusive dynamics - which we call "active L\'evy matter" - cannot be
captured by current active fluid theories. Here, we formulate a hydrodynamic theory of active L\'evy
matter by coarse-graining a microscopic model of aligning polar active particles performing superdiffusion
manifest as L\'evy flights. Using a linear stability analysis, our theory predicts spatially homogeneous
disordered and ordered phases at high and low orientational noise levels, respectively, as in ordinary
active fluids; however, in contrast to its conventional counterpart, the order-disorder transition
can become critical. We further support our analytical predictions with simulation results. This
work not only highlights the need for more realistic models of active matter integrating both anomalous
diffusive motility and inter-particle interactions, but also potentially enriches the universal
properties of active systems.
