The efficient amplification and lasing of electromagnetic radiation at terahertz (THz) frequencies
is a non-trivial task achieved mainly by quantum cascade laser configurations with limited tunability
and narrowband functionality. There is a strong need of compact and efficient THz electromagnetic
sources with reconfigurable operation in a broad frequency range. Photoexcited graphene can act
as the gain medium to produce coherent radiation at low THz frequencies but its response is very weak
due to its ultrathin thickness. In this work, we demonstrate an alternative design to achieve efficient
tunable and compact THz amplifiers and lasers with broadband operation based on active THz hyperbolic
metamaterials (HMM) designed by multiple stacked photoexcited graphene layers separated by thin
dielectric sheets. The hyperbolic THz response of the proposed ultrathin active HMM is analytically
and numerically studied and characterized. When the graphene-based HMM structure is periodically
patterned, a broadband slow-wave propagation regime is identified, thanks to the hyperbolic dispersion.
In this scenario, reconfigurable amplification of THz waves in a broad frequency range is obtained,
which can be made tunable by varying the quasi-Fermi level of graphene. We demonstrate that the THz
response of the presented tunable THz amplifiers or lasers is controlled by the incident optical
pumping (photodoping) and the loaded dielectric materials in the HMM waveguide array, an interesting
property that can have great potential for THz amplification, emission, and sensing applications.
