Plasmon coupling and hybridization in complex nanostructures constitutes a fertile playground
for controlling light at the nanoscale. Here, we present a semi-analytical model to describe the
emergence of hybrid plasmon modes guided along 2D nano-slits. In particular, we find two new coupled
plasmonic resonances arising from symmetric and antisymmetric hybridizations of the edge plasmons
of the constituent half-sheets. These give rise to an antibonding and a bonding mode, lying above
and below the energy of the bare edge plasmon. Our treatment is notably generic, being able to account
for slits of arbitrary width, and remains valid irrespective of the 2D conductive material (e.g.,
doped graphene, 2D transition metal dichalcogenides, or phosphorene). We derive the dispersion
relation of the hybrid modes of a 2D nano-slit along with the corresponding induced potential and
electric field distributions. We also discuss the plasmonic spectrum of a 2D slit together with
the one from its complementarity structure, that is, a ribbon. Finally, the case of a nano-slit made
from an anisotropic 2D material is considered. Focusing on black phosphorus (which is highly anisotropic),
we investigate the features of its plasmonic spectrum along the two main crystal axes. Our results
offer insights into the interaction of plasmons in complex 2D nanostructures, thereby expanding
the current toolkit of plasmonic resonances in 2D materials, and paving the way for the emergence
of future compact devices based on atomically thin plasmonics.
