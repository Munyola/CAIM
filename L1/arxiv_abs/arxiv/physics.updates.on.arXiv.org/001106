Side-by-side comparison of detailed kinetic models using a new tool to aid recognition of species
structures reveals significant discrepancies in the published rates of many reactions and thermochemistry
of many species. We present a first automated assessment of the impact of these varying parameters
on observable quantities of interest - in this case, autoignition delay - using literature experimental
data. A recent kinetic model for the isomers of butanol was imported into a common database. Individual
reaction rate and thermodynamic parameters of species were varied using using values encountered
in combustion models from recent literature. The effects of over 1,600 alternative parameters
were considered. Separately, experimental data were collected from recent publications and converted
into the standard YAML-based ChemKED format. The Cantera-based model validation tool, PyTeCK,
was used to automatically simulate autoignition using the generated models and experimental data,
to judge the performance of the models. Taken individually, most of the parameter substitutions
have little effect on the overall model performance, although a handful have quite large effects,
and are investigated more thoroughly. Additionally, models varying multiple parameters simultaneously
were evolved using a genetic algorithm to give fastest and slowest autoignition delay times, showing
changes exceeding a factor of 10 in ignition delay time are possible by cherry-picking from only
accepted, published, parameters. All data and software used in this study are available openly.
