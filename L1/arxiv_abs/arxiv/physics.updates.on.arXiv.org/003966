Physical models of biological systems can become difficult to interpret when they have a large number
of parameters. But the models themselves actually depend on (i.e. are sensitive to) only a subset
of those parameters. Rigorously identifying this subset of "stiff" parameters has been made possible
by the development of parameter space compression (PSC). However, PSC has only been applied to analytically-solvable
physical models. We have generalized this powerful method by developing a numerical approach to
PSC that can be applied to any computational model. We validated our method against analytically-solvable
models of random walk with drift and protein production and degradation. We then applied our method
to an active area of biophysics research, namely to a simple computational model of microtubule
dynamic instability. Such models have become increasingly complex, perhaps unnecessarily. By
adding two new parameters that account for prominent structural features of microtubules, we identify
one that can be "compressed away" (the "seam" in the microtubule) and another that is essential to
model performance (the "tapering" of microtubule ends). Furthermore, we show that the microtubule
model has an underlying, low-dimensional structure that explains the vast majority of our experimental
data. We argue that numerical PSC can identify the low-dimensional structure of any computational
model in biophysics. The low-dimensional structure of a model is easier to interpret and identifies
the mechanisms and experiments that best characterize the system.
