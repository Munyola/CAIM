The monitoring of the impact of aerosols in Latin America on a local scale is usually limited due to
the infrastructure and instrumentation available. In Colombia, there are two international ground
surface monitoring networks, the AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) and the Latin American LIDAR
NETwork (LALINET). However, the AERONET performance relies on only one sun photometer which makes
measurements distributed among five ground-based stations in different cities such as Bogot\'a
and Medell\'in. On the other hand, LALINET has only one ground-based station formed by an elastic
LiDAR system located at Medell\'in. Although Cali is the largest city of Colombian southwestern,
with an accelerated grown rate of both urban and vehicular fleet, and counts with the third largest
population of this country, is not reached by these networks. Here, we report on the implementation
of a monostatic-coaxial multispectral LiDAR system using a pulsed Nd:YAG laser with 450 mJ of average
energy at 1064 nm. To perform the atmospheric measurements, this system is capable of spatially
resolving elastic backscatter down to 3.75 m with a Pulse Repetition Frequency (PRF) of 10 Hz. We
have developed a hybrid algorithm for data analysis by combining the Fitting and Gradient method
and the Klett-Fernald algorithm to estimate the Planetary Boundary Layer (PBL) Top and the optical
properties of aerosols. This work constitutes the first quantitative atmospheric exploration
to study the aerosols dynamics and the PBL in the northwest of South America.
