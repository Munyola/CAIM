This paper investigates the implications of the future continuation of the demonstrated past (1960-2012)
strong correlation between first-difference atmospheric CO2 and global surface temperature.
It does this, for the period from the present to 2050, for a comprehensive range of future global fossil
fuel energy use scenarios. The results show that even for a business-as-usual (the mid-level IPCC)
fossil fuel use estimate, global surface temperature will rise at a slower rate than for the recent
period 1960-2000. Concerning peak fossil fuel, for the most common scenario the currently observed
(1998-2013)temperature plateau will turn into a decrease. The observed trend to date for temperature
is compared with that for global climate disasters: these peaked in 2005 and are notably decreasing.
The temperature and disaster results taken together are consistent with either a reduced business-as-usual
fossil fuel use scenario into the future, or a peak fossil fuel scenario, but not with the standard
business-as-usual scenario. If the future follows a peak fossil fuel pathway, a markedly decreasing
trend in global surface temperature should become apparent over the next few years. If entertained,
these results are evidence that the climate problem may require less preventative action. If so,
the same evidence is support for the case that the peak fossil fuel problem does require preventative
action. This action is the same as it would have been for climate - the rapid transition to a predominantly
renewable global energy system.
