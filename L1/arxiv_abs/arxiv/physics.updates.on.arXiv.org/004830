We propose a deep learning algorithm for seismic interface and pocket detection with neural networks
trained by synthetic high-frequency displacement data efficiently generated by the frozen Gaussian
approximation (FGA). In seismic imaging high-frequency data is advantageous since it can provide
high resolution of substructures. However, generation of sufficient synthetic high-frequency
data sets for training neural networks is computationally challenging. This bottleneck is overcome
by a highly scalable computational platform built upon the FGA, which comes from the semiclassical
theory and approximates the wavefields by a sum of fixed-width (frozen) Gaussian wave packets.
Data is generated from a forward simulation of the elastic wave equation using the FGA. This data
contains accurate traveltime information (from the ray path) but not exact amplitude information
(with asymptotic errors not shrinking to zero even at extremely fine numerical resolution). Using
this data we build convolutional neural network models using an open source API, GeoSeg, developed
using Keras and Tensorflow. On a simple model, networks, despite only being trained on FGA data,
can detect an interface with a high success rate from displacement data generated by the spectral
element method. Benchmark tests are done for P-waves (acoustic) and P- and S-waves (elastic) generated
using the FGA and a spectral element method. Further, results with a high accuracy are shown for more
complicated geometries including a three layered model, and a 2D-pocket model where the neural
networks trained by both clean and noisy data.
