In liquid spray applications, the sprays are often created by the formation and destabilization
of a liquid sheet or jet. The disadvantage of such atomization processes is that the breakup is often
highly irregular, causing a broad distribution of droplet sizes. As these sizes are controlled
by the ligament corrugation and size, a monodisperse spray should consist of ligaments that are
both smooth and of equal size. A straightforward way of creating smooth and equally sized ligaments
is by droplet impact on a mesh. In this work we show that this approach does however not produce monodisperse
droplets, but instead the droplet size distribution is very broad, with a large number of small satellite
drops. We demonstrate that the fragmentation is controlled by a jet instability, where initial
perturbations caused by the injection process result in long-wavelength disturbances that determine
the final ligament breakup. During destabilization the crests of these disturbances are connected
by thin ligaments which are the leading cause of the large number of small droplets. A secondary coalescence
process, due to small relative velocities between droplets, partly masks this effect by reducing
the amount of small droplets. Of the many parameters in this system, we describe the effect of varying
the mesh size, mesh rigidity, impact velocity, wetting properties, keeping the liquid properties
the same by focusing on water droplets only. We further perform Lattice Boltzmann modeling of the
impact process that reproduces key features seen in the experimental data.
