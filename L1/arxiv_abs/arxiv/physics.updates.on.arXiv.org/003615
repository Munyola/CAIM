Performing linear operations using optical devices is a crucial building block in many fields ranging
from telecommunication to optical analogue computation and machine learning. For many of these
applications, key requirements are robustness to fabrication inaccuracies and reconfigurability.
Current designs of custom-tailored photonic devices or coherent photonic circuits only partially
satisfy these needs. Here, we propose a way to perform linear operations by using complex optical
media such as multimode fibers or thin scattering layers as a computational platform driven by wavefront
shaping. Given a large random transmission matrix (TM) representing light propagation in such
a medium, we can extract a desired smaller linear operator by finding suitable input and output projectors.
We discuss fundamental upper bounds on the size of the linear transformations our approach can achieve
and provide an experimental demonstration. For the latter, first we retrieve the complex medium's
TM with a non-interferometric phase retrieval method. Then, we take advantage of the large number
of degrees of freedom to find input wavefronts using a Spatial Light Modulator (SLM) that cause the
system, composed of the SLM and the complex medium, to act as a desired complex-valued linear operator
on the optical field. We experimentally build several $16\times16$ complex-valued operators,
and are able to switch from one to another at will. Our technique offers the prospect of reconfigurable,
robust and easy-to-fabricate linear optical analogue computation units.
