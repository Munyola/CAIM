Several analytical forms of cloud particle size distributions (PSDs) have been used in numerical
modeling and remote sensing retrieval studies of clouds and precipitation, including exponential,
gamma, lognormal, and Weibull distributions. However, there is no satisfying physical explanation
as to why certain distribution forms preferentially occur instead of others. Theoretically, the
analytical form of a PSD can be derived by directly solving the general dynamic equation, but no analytical
solutions have been found yet. Instead of a process level approach, the use of the principle of maximum
entropy (MaxEnt) for determining the analytical form of PSDs from the perspective of system is examined
here. MaxEnt theory states that the probability density function with the largest information
entropy among a group satisfying the given properties of the variable should be chosen. Here, the
issue of variability under coordinate transformations that arises using the Gibbs/Shannon definition
of entropy is identified, and the use of the concept of relative entropy to avoid these problems is
discussed. Focusing on cloud physics, the four-parameter generalized gamma distribution is proposed
as the analytical form of a PSD using the principle of maximum (relative) entropy with assumptions
on power law relations between state variables, scale invariance and a further constraint on the
expectation of one state variable (e.g. bulk water mass). The four parameter generalized gamma
distribution is very flexible to accommodate various type of constraints that could be assumed
for cloud PSDs.
