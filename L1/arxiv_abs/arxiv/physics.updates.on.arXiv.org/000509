We develop a high-precision model for laser ranging interferometric (LRI) observables of the GRACE
Follow-On (GRACE-FO) mission. For this, we study the propagation of an electromagnetic wave in
the gravitational field in the vicinity of an extended body, in the post-Newtonian approximation
of the general theory of relativity. We present a general relativistic model for the phase of a plane
wave that accounts for contributions of all the multipoles of the gravitating body, its angular
momentum, as well as the contribution of tidal fields produced by external sources. We develop a
new approach to model a coherent signal transmission in the gravitational field of the solar system
that relies on a relativistic treatment of the phase. We use this approach to describe high-precision
interferometric measurements on GRACE-FO and formulate the key LRI observables, namely the phase
and phase rate of a coherent laser link between the two spacecraft. We develop a relativistic model
for the LRI-enabled range between the two GRACE-FO spacecraft, accurate to less than 1 nm, and a high-precision
model for the corresponding range rate, accurate to better than 0.1 nm/s. We also formulate high-precision
relativistic models for the double one-way range (DOWR) and DOWR-enabled range rate observables
originally used on GRACE and now studied for interferometric measurements on GRACE-FO. Our formulation
justifies the basic assumptions behind the design of the GRACE-FO mission and highlights the importance
of achieving nearly circular and nearly identical orbits for the GRACE-FO spacecraft.
