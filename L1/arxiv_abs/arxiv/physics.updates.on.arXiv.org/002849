Two-dimensional materials exhibit a fascinating range of electronic and photonic properties
vital for nanophotonics, quantum optics and emerging quantum information technologies. Merging
concepts from the fields of ab initio materials science and nanophotonics, there is now an opportunity
to engineer new photonic materials whose optical, transport, and scattering properties are tailored
to attain thermodynamic and quantum limits. Here, we present first-principles calculations predicting
that Argentene, a single-crystalline hexagonal close-packed monolayer of Ag, can dramatically
surpass the optical properties and electrical conductivity of conventional plasmonic materials.
In the low-frequency limit, we show that the scattering rate and resistivity reduce by a factor of
three compared to the bulk three-dimensional metal. Most importantly, the low scattering rate
extends to optical frequencies in sharp contrast to e.g. graphene, whose scattering rate increase
drastically in the near-infrared range due to optical-phonon scattering. Combined with an intrinsically
high carrier density, this facilitates highly-confined surface plasmons extending to visible
frequencies. We evaluate Argentene across three distinct figures of merit, spanning the spectrum
of typical plasmonic applications; in each, Argentene outperforms the state-of-the-art. This
unique combination of properties will make Argentene a valuable addition to the two-dimensional
heterostructure toolkit for quantum electronic and photonic technologies.
