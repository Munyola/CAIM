In this paper, we demonstrate a computationally efficient new approach based on deep learning (DL)
techniques for analysis, design, and optimization of electromagnetic (EM) nanostructures. We
use the strong correlation among features of a generic EM problem to considerably reduce the dimensionality
of the problem and thus, the computational complexity, without imposing considerable errors.
By employing the dimensionality reduction concept using the more recently demonstrated autoencoder
technique, we redefine the conventional many-to-one design problem in EM nanostructures into
a one-to-one problem plus a much simpler many-to-one problem, which can be simply solved using an
analytic formulation. This approach reduces the computational complexity in solving both the
forward problem (i.e., analysis) and the inverse problem (i.e., design) by orders of magnitude
compared to conventional approaches. In addition, it provides analytic formulations that, despite
their complexity, can be used to obtain intuitive understanding of the physics and dynamics of EM
wave interaction with nanostructures with minimal computation requirements. As a proof-of-concept,
we applied such an efficacious method to design a new class of on-demand reconfigurable optical
metasurfaces based on phase-change materials (PCM). We envision that the integration of such a
DL-based technique with full-wave commercial software packages offers a powerful toolkit to facilitate
the analysis, design, and optimization of the EM nanostructures as well as explaining, understanding,
and predicting the observed responses in such structures.
