The measurement of the spectral diffraction efficiencies of a diffraction grating is essential
for improving the manufacturing technique and for assessing the grating's function in practical
applications. The drawback of the currently popular measurement technique is its slow speed due
to the hundreds of repetitions of two kinds of time-consuming mechanical movements during the measuring
process (i.e., the rotation of the mechanical arm to capture the light beam, and the mechanical variation
of the output wavelength of the grating monochromator). This limitation greatly restricts the
usage of this technique in dynamic measurement. In this manuscript, we present a motionless and
fast measurement technique for obtaining the spectral diffraction efficiencies of a plane grating,
effectively eliminating the aforementioned two kinds of mechanical movement. Herein, the proposed
solution for removing the first kind of mechanical movement is tested, and the experimental result
shows that the proposed method can be successfully used to measure the plane transmission grating's
spectral diffraction efficiencies in the wavelength range of 550-750 nm. The method for eliminating
the second kind of mechanical movement is not verified in this manuscript; however, we think that
it is very straightforward and commercially available. We estimate that the spectral measurement
can be achieved on a millisecond timescale by combining the two solutions. Our motionless and fast
measuring technique will find broad applications in dynamic measurement environments and mass
industrial testing.
