Fueled by their excellent stiffness-to-weight ratio and the availability of mature manufacturing
technologies, filament wound carbon fiber reinforced polymers represent ideal materials for
thin-walled laminate structures. However, their strong anisotropy reduces structural resistance
to wall instabilities under shear and buckling. Increasing laminate thickness degrades weight
and structural efficiencies and the application of a dense internal core is often uneconomical
and labor-intensive. In this contribution, we introduce a convex linear semidefinite programming
formulation for truss topology optimization to design an efficient non-uniform lattice-like
internal structure. The internal structure not only reduces the effect of wall instabilities,
mirrored in the increase of the fundamental free-vibration eigenfrequency, but also keeps weight
low, secures manufacturability using conventional three-dimensional printers, and withstands
the loads induced during the production process. We showcase a fully-automatic procedure in detail
for the design, prototype manufacturing, and verification of a simply-supported composite machine
tool component, including validation with roving hammer tests. The results confirm that the 3D-printed
optimized internal structure almost doubles the fundamental free-vibration eigenfrequency,
allowing to increase working frequency of the machine tool, even though the ratio between elastic
properties of the carbon composite and the ABS polymer used for 3D printing exceeds two orders of
magnitude.
