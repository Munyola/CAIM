When society maintains a competitive system to promote an abstract goal, competition by necessity
relies on imperfect proxy measures. For instance profit is used to measure value to consumers, patient
volumes to measure hospital performance, or the Journal Impact Factor to measure scientific value.
Here we note that \textit{any proxy measure in a competitive societal system becomes a target for
the competitors, promoting corruption of the measure}, suggesting a general applicability of
what is best known as Campbell's or Goodhart's Law. Indeed, prominent voices have argued that the
scientific reproducibility crisis or inaction to the threat of global warming represent instances
of such competition induced corruption. Moreover, competing individuals often report that competitive
pressures limit their ability to act according to the societal goal, suggesting lock-in. However,
despite the profound implications, we lack a coherent theory of such a process. Here we propose such
a theory, formalized as an agent based model, integrating insights from complex systems theory,
contest theory, behavioral economics and cultural evolution theory. The model reproduces empirically
observed patterns at multiple levels. It further suggests that any system is likely to converge
towards an equilibrium level of corruption determined by i) the information captured in the proxy
and ii) the strength of an intrinsic incentive towards the societal goal. Overall, the theory offers
mechanistic insight to subjects as diverse as the scientific reproducibility crisis and the threat
of global warming.
