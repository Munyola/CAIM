Living systems are capable of locomotion, reconfiguration, and replication. To perform these
tasks, cells spatiotemporally coordinate the interactions of force-generating, "active" molecules
that create and manipulate non-equilibrium structures and force fields that span up to millimeter
length scales [1-3]. Experimental active matter systems of biological or synthetic molecules
are capable of spontaneously organizing into structures [4,5] and generating global flows [6-9].
However, these experimental systems lack the spatiotemporal control found in cells, limiting
their utility for studying non-equilibrium phenomena and bioinspired engineering. Here, we uncover
non-equilibrium phenomena and principles by optically controlling structures and fluid flow
in an engineered system of active biomolecules. Our engineered system consists of purified microtubules
and light-activatable motor proteins that crosslink and organize microtubules into distinct
structures upon illumination. We develop basic operations, defined as sets of light patterns,
to create, move, and merge microtubule structures. By composing these basic operations, we are
able to create microtubule networks that span several hundred microns in length and contract at
speeds up to an order of magnitude faster than the speed of an individual motor. We manipulate these
contractile networks to generate and sculpt persistent fluid flows. The principles of boundary-mediated
control we uncover may be used to study emergent cellular structures and forces and to develop programmable
active matter devices.
