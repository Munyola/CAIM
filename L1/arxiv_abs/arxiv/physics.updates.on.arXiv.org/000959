Recently, Squire & Hopkins (2017) showed any coupled dust-gas mixture is subject to a class of linear
'resonant drag instabilities' (RDI). These can drive large dust-to-gas ratio fluctuations even
at arbitrarily small dust-to-gas mass ratios $\mu$. Here, we explore the RDI in the simple case where
the gas satisfies neutral hydrodynamics and supports acoustic waves ($\omega^{2}=c_{s}^{2}\,k^{2}$).
The gas and dust are coupled via an arbitrary drag law and subject to external accelerations (e.g.
gravity, radiation pressure). If there is any dust drift velocity, the system is unstable. The instabilities
exist for all dust-to-gas ratios $\mu$ and their growth rates depend only weakly on $\mu$, as $\sim\mu^{1/3}$.
The behavior changes depending on whether the drift velocity is larger or smaller than the sound
speed $c_{s}$. In the supersonic limit a 'resonant' instability appears with growth rate increasing
without limit with wavenumber, even for vanishingly small $\mu$ and values of the coupling strength
('stopping time'). In the subsonic limit instabilities always exist, but their growth rates no
longer increase indefinitely towards small wavelengths. The results are robust to the drag law
and equation-of-state of the gas. The instabilities directly drive exponentially growing dust-to-gas-ratio
fluctuations, which can be large even when the modes are otherwise weak. We discuss physical implications
for cool-star winds, AGN-driven winds and torii, and starburst winds: the instabilities alter
the character of these outflows and will drive clumping and turbulence in both gas and dust.
