Central pattern generators (CPGs) appear to have evolved multiple times throughout the animal
kingdom, indicating that their design imparts a significant evolutionary advantage. Insight
into how this design is achieved is hindered by the difficulty inherent in examining relationships
among electrophysiological properties of the constituent cells of a CPG and their functional connectivity.
That is: experimentally it is challenging to estimate the values of more than two or three of these
properties simultaneously. We employ a method of statistical data assimilation (D.A.) to estimate
the synaptic weights, synaptic reversal potentials, and maximum conductances of ion channels
of the constituent neurons in a multi-modal network model. We then use these estimates to predict
the functional mode of activity that the network is expressing. The measurements used are the membrane
voltage time series of all neurons in the circuit. We find that these measurements provide sufficient
information to yield accurate predictions of the network's associated electrical activity. This
experiment can apply directly in a real laboratory using intracellular recordings from a known
biological CPG whose structural mapping is known, and which can be completely isolated from the
animal. The simulated results in this paper suggest that D.A. might provide a tool for simultaneously
estimating tens to hundreds of CPG properties, thereby offering the opportunity to seek possible
systematic relationships among these properties and the emergent electrical activity.
