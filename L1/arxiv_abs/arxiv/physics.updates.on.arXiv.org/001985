The complex physics of the interaction between short pulse high intensity lasers and solids is so
far hardly accessible by experiments. As a result of missing experimental capabilities to probe
the complex electron dynamics and competing instabilities, this impedes the development of compact
laser-based next generation secondary radiation sources, e.g. for tumor therapy [Bulanov2002,ledingham2007],
laboratory-astrophysics [Remington1999,Bulanov2015], and fusion [Tabak2014]. At present,
the fundamental plasma dynamics that occur at the nanometer and femtosecond scales during the laser-solid
interaction can only be elucidated by simulations. Here we show experimentally that small angle
X-ray scattering of femtosecond X-ray free-electron laser pulses facilitates new capabilities
for direct in-situ characterization of intense short-pulse laser plasma interaction at solid
density that allows simultaneous nanometer spatial and femtosecond temporal resolution, directly
verifying numerical simulations of the electron density dynamics during the short pulse high intensity
laser irradiation of a solid density target. For laser-driven grating targets, we measure the solid
density plasma expansion and observe the generation of a transient grating structure in front of
the pre-inscribed grating, due to plasma expansion, which is an hitherto unknown effect. We expect
that our results will pave the way for novel time-resolved studies, guiding the development of future
laser-driven particle and photon sources from solid targets.
