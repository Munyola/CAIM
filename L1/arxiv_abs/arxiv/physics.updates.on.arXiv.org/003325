Medium and large insects in normal hovering have horizontal, planar up- and downstrokes1-4. The
lift of the two half-strokes, generated by the leading-edge vortex, provides the weight-supporting
vertical force. But for small insects (wing length R less than about 4 mm and Reynolds number Re very
low, about 80 to 10), because of the large effect of air viscosity (as Re becomes very low, moving in
air is like in oil), sufficient vertical force could not be produced if using the above wing kinematics.
Small insects must use different flapping mode. Here, through analyzing flight data from our recent
studies on a relatively-large small insect (fruitfly: R=3 mm, Re=80) and a very small insect (wasp:
R=0.5 mm, Re=10), we put forward a hypothesis on how the flapping pattern will change: as insect-size
or Re decreasing, a deeper and deeper U-shape upstroke will be used to overcome the viscous effect.
And we test this hypothesis by measuring the wing kinematics for species of different sizes to obtain
data for Re ranging from 80 to 10 and by computing the aerodynamic forces. The data and computation
support our hypothesis: the planar upstroke changes to U-shape upstroke which becomes deeper as
size or Re becomes smaller; for relatively-large small insects, the U-shape upstroke produces
a larger vertical force than a planar upstroke by having a larger wing velocity, and for very small
insects, the deep U-shape upstroke produces a large transient drag that points almost upwards by
fast downward acceleration of the wing, providing the required vertical force.
