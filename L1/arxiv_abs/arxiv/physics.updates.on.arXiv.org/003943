A non-local dynamic homogenization technique for the analysis of a viscoelastic heterogeneous
material which displays a periodic microstructure is herein proposed. The asymptotic expansion
of the micro-displacement field in the transformed Laplace domain allows obtaining, from the expression
of the micro-scale field equations, a set of recursive differential problems defined over the periodic
unit cell. Consequently, the cell problems are derived in terms of perturbation functions depending
on the geometrical and physical-mechanical properties of the material and its microstructural
heterogeneities. A down-scaling relation is formulated in a consistent form, which correlates
the microscopic to the macroscopic transformed displacement field and its gradients through the
perturbation functions. Average field equations of infinite order are determined by substituting
the down-scale relation into the micro-field equation. Based on a variational approach, the macroscopic
field equations of a non-local continuum is delivered and the local and non-local overall constitutive
and inertial tensors of the homogenized continuum are determined. The problem of wave propagation
in case of a bi-phase layered material with orthotropic phases and axis of orthotropy parallel to
the direction of layers is investigated as an example. In such a case, the local and non-local overall
constitutive and inertial tensors are determined analytically and the dispersion curves obtained
from the non-local homogenized model are analysed.
