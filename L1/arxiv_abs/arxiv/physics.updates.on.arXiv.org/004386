Here we report a comprehensive analysis of the robustness of five high-quality real-world complex
weighted networks to errors and attacks of nodes and links. We analyze C. Elegans, Cargo ship, E.
Coli, Us Airports and Human brain real-world complex weighted networks. We use measures of the network
damage conceived for a binary (e.g. largest connected cluster LCC, and binary efficiency Effbin)
or a weighted network structure (e.g. the efficiency Eff, and the total energy-information En).
We find that removing a very small fraction of nodes and links with respectively higher strength
and weight triggers an abrupt collapse of the weighted functioning measures while measures that
evaluate the binary-topological connectedness are almost unaffected. These findings unveil
a problematic response-state of the real-world complex networks where the attack of a small fraction
of nodes-links returns these systems in a connected but highly inefficient state. Our findings
unveil how the robustness may be heavily overestimated focusing on the connectedness of the components
only. Last, to understand how the networks robustness is generally affected by link weights heterogeneity,
we randomly assign link weights over the topological structure of the real-world networks. We find
that highly heterogeneous networks experienced a faster efficiency decrease under nodes-links
removal: i.e. the robustness of the real-world complex networks against both random than attack
is negatively correlated with links weight heterogeneity.
