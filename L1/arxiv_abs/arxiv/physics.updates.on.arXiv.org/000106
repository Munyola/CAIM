A strong candidate for the Standard Model Scalar boson, H(126), has been discovered by the Large
Hadron Collider (LHC) experiments. In order to study this fundamental particle with unprecedented
precision, and to perform precision tests of the closure of the Standard Model, we investigate the
possibilities offered by An e+e- storage ring collider. We use a design inspired by the B-factories,
taking into account the performance achieved at LEP2, and imposing a synchrotron radiation power
limit of 100 MW. At the most relevant centre-of-mass energy of 240 GeV, near-constant luminosities
of 10^34 cm^{-2}s^{-1} are possible in up to four collision points for a ring of 27km circumference.
The achievable luminosity increases with the bending radius, and for 80km circumference, a luminosity
of 5 10^34 cm^{-2}s^{-1} in four collision points appears feasible. Beamstrahlung becomes relevant
at these high luminosities, leading to a design requirement of large momentum acceptance both in
the accelerating system and in the optics. The larger machine could reach the top quark threshold,
would yield luminosities per interaction point of 10^36 cm^{-2}s^{-1} at the Z pole (91 GeV) and
2 10^35 cm^{-2}s^{-1} at the W pair production threshold (80 GeV per beam). The energy spread is reduced
in the larger ring with respect to what is was at LEP, giving confidence that beam polarization for
energy calibration purposes should be available up to the W pair threshold. The capabilities in
term of physics performance are outlined.
