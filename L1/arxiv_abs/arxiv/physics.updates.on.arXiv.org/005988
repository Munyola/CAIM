Population-based metaheuristic algorithms are powerful tools in the design of neutron scattering
instruments and the use of these types of algorithms for this purpose is becoming more and more commonplace.
Today there exists a wide range of algorithms to choose from when designing an instrument and it is
not always initially clear which may provide the best performance. Furthermore, due to the nature
of these types of algorithms, the final solution found for a specific design scenario cannot always
be guaranteed to be the global optimum. Therefore, to explore the potential benefits and differences
between the varieties of these algorithms available, when applied to such design scenarios, we
have carried out a detailed study of some commonly used algorithms. For this purpose, we have developed
a new general optimization software package which combines a number of common metaheuristic algorithms
within a single user interface and is designed specifically with neutronic calculations in mind.
The algorithms included in the software are implementations of Particle-Swarm Optimization (PSO),
Differential Evolution (DE), Artificial Bee Colony (ABC), and a Genetic Algorithm (GA). The software
has been used to optimize the design of several problems in neutron optics and shielding, coupled
with Monte-Carlo simulations, in order to evaluate the performance of the various algorithms.
Generally, the performance of the algorithms depended on the specific scenarios, however it was
found that DE provided the best average solutions in all scenarios investigated in this work.
