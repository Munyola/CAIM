We investigate a fermionic susceptible-infected-susceptible model with mobility of infected
individuals on uncorrelated scale-free networks with a power-law degree distribution $P (k) \sim
k^{-\gamma}$ of exponent $2<\gamma<3$. Two diffusive processes with diffusion rate $D$ of an infected
vertex are considered. In the \textit{standard diffusion}, one of the nearest-neighbors is chosen
with equal chance while in the \textit{biased diffusion} this choice happens with probability
proportional to the neighbor's degree. A non-monotonic dependence of the epidemic threshold on
$D$ with an optimum diffusion rate $D_\ast$, for which the epidemic spreading is more efficient,
is found for standard diffusion while monotonic decays are observed in the biased case. The epidemic
thresholds go to zero as the network size is increased and the form that this happens depends on the
diffusion rule and degree exponent. Analyses on star and max $k$-core subgraphs explain several
features of the diffusive epidemic process. We analytically investigated the dynamics using quenched
and heterogeneous mean-field theories. The former present, in general, a better performance for
standard and the latter for biased diffusion models, indicating different activation mechanisms
of the epidemic phases that are rationalized in terms of hubs or max $k$-core subgraphs. The transition
to the absorbing state is smeared for networks with $\gamma>2.5$ in the case of biased diffusion
while a regular critical transition with diverging fluctuations is found for standard diffusion.
