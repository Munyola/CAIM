We study strange stars in the framework of $f\left(R,\mathcal{T}\right)$ theory of gravity where
the strange quark matter distribution inside the stellar system is governed by the phenomenological
MIT Bag model equation of state (EOS). Further, for a specific value of $B$ and observed values of
mass of the strange star candidates we obtain the exact solution of the modified Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff
(TOV) equation in the framework of $f\left(R,\mathcal{T}\right)$ gravity and have studied in
detail the dependence of the different physical parameters due to the chosen different values of
$\chi$. To check the physical acceptability and stability of the stellar system based on the obtained
solutions we have performed different physical tests, viz., the energy conditions, Herrera cracking
concept, adiabatic index etc. In this work, we also have explained the effects, those are arising
due to the interaction between the matter and the curvature terms in $f\left(R,\mathcal{T}\right)$
gravity, on the anisotropic compact stellar system. It is interesting to note that as the values
of $\chi$ increase the strange stars become more massive and their radius increase gradually so
that eventually they gradually turn into less dense compact objects. The present study reveals
that the modified $f\left(R,\mathcal{T}\right)$ gravity is a suitable theory to explain massive
stellar systems like recent magnetars, massive pulsars and super-Chandrasekhar stars, which
can not be explained in the framework of GR. However, for $\chi=0$ the standard results of Einsteinian
gravity are retrieved.
