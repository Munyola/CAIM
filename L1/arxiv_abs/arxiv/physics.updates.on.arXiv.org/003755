Circular Rydberg states with $n=70$ have been prepared in helium using a modified version of the
crossed-fields method. This approach to the preparation of high-$n$ circular Rydberg states overcomes
limitations of the standard crossed-fields method which arise at this, and higher, values of $n$.
The experiments were performed with atoms traveling in pulsed supersonic beams that were initially
laser photoexcited from the metastable 1s2s$\,^3$S$_1$ level to the 1s73s$\,^3$S$_1$ level by
resonance-enhanced two-color two-photon excitation in a magnetic field of 16.154 G. These excited
atoms were then polarized using a perpendicular electric field of 0.844~V/cm, and transferred
by a pulse of microwave radiation to the state that, when adiabatically depolarized, evolves into
the $n=70$ circular state in zero electric field. The excited atoms were detected by state-selective
electric field ionization. Each step of the circular state preparation process was validated by
comparison with the calculated atomic energy level structure in the perpendicular electric and
magnetic fields used. Of the atoms initially excited to the 1s73s$\,^3$S$_1$ level, $\sim80$\%
were transferred to the $n=70$ circular state. At these high values of $n$, $\Delta n = 1$ circular-to-circular
Rydberg state transitions occur at frequencies below 20 GHz. Consequently, atoms in these states,
and the circular state preparation process presented here, are well suited to hybrid cavity QED
experiments with Rydberg atoms and superconducting microwave circuits.
