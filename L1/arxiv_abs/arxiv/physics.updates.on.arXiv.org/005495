Determining which proteins interact together is crucial to a systems-level understanding of the
cell. Recently, algorithms based on Direct Coupling Analysis (DCA) pairwise maximum-entropy
models have allowed to identify interaction partners among the paralogs of ubiquitous prokaryotic
proteins families, starting from sequence data alone. Since DCA allows to infer the three-dimensional
structure of protein complexes, its success in predicting protein-protein interactions could
be mainly based on contacting residues coevolving to remain physicochemically complementary.
However, interacting proteins often possess similar evolutionary histories, which also gives
rise to correlations among their sequences. What is the role of purely phylogenetic correlations
in the performance of DCA-based methods to infer interaction partners? To address this question,
we employ controlled synthetic data that only involves phylogeny and no interactions or contacts.
We find that DCA accurately identifies the pairs of synthetic sequences that only share evolutionary
history. It performs as well as methods explicitly based on sequence similarity, and even slightly
better with large and accurate training sets. We further demonstrate the ability of these various
methods to correctly predict pairings among actual paralogous proteins with genome proximity
but no known direct physical interaction, which illustrates the importance of phylogenetic correlations
in real data. However, for actually interacting and strongly coevolving proteins, DCA and mutual
information outperform sequence similarity.
