Optimizing an industrial-scale supercritical water gasification process requires detailed
knowledge of chemical reaction pathways, rates, and product yields. Laboratory-scale reactors
are employed to develop this knowledge base. The rationale behind designs and component selection
of continuous flow, laboratory-scale supercritical water gasification reactors is analyzed.
Some design challenges have standard solutions, such as pressurization and preheating, but issues
with solid precipitation and feedstock pretreatment still present open questions. Strategies
for reactant mixing must be evaluated on a system-by-system basis, depending on feedstock and experimental
goals, as mixing can affect product yields, char formation, and reaction pathways. In-situ Raman
spectroscopic monitoring of reaction chemistry promises to further fundamental knowledge of
gasification and decrease experimentation time. High-temperature, high-pressure spectroscopy
in supercritical water conditions is performed, however, long-term operation flow cell operation
is challenging. Comparison of Raman spectra for decomposition of formic acid in the supercritical
region and cold section of the reactor demonstrates the difficulty in performing quantitative
spectroscopy in the hot zone. Future designs and optimization of SCWG reactors should consider
well-established solutions for pressurization, heating, and process monitoring, and effective
strategies for mixing and solids handling for long-term reactor operation and data collection.
