Photons are almost involved in each field of science and daily life of everyone. However, there are
still some fundamental and puzzling questions such as what a photon is. Here, we propose the expressions
of electromagnetic fields of a photon, calculate the energy, momentum, and spin angular momentum
of a photon from the present expressions, derive the relations between the photon size and wavelength,
and reveal the differences between a photon and its copy. The results show that the present expressions
properly describe the particle characteristics of a photon; the length of a photon is half of the
wavelength, and the radius is proportional to square root of the wavelength; a photon and its copy
have the phase difference of {\pi} and constitute a phase-entangled photon pair. A photon can ionize
a hydrogen atom at the ground state only if its radius is less than the Bohr radius. The phase-entangled
n-photon train, i.e. wave train in optics, results from the sequential stimulated emissions and
corresponds to a Fock or number state. A laser beam, which is usually described by a plane electromagnetic
wave, is an ensemble of the n-photon trains and corresponds to a coherent state. The threshold power
of a laser is equal to power of the n-photon train, and the intensity or electric field in the plane
wave is the average intensity or electric field of the n-photon trains. These provide a bridge between
the wave theory of light and quantum optics and will further advance research and application of
quantum optics and the other related fields.
