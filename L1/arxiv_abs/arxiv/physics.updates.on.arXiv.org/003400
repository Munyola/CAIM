A comprehensive analysis of 38 previously published Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) transmission spectra
is performed using a hierarchy of nested-sampling retrievals: with versus without clouds, grey
versus non-grey clouds, isothermal versus non-isothermal transit chords and with water, hydrogen
cyanide and/or ammonia. We revisit the "normalisation degeneracy": the relative abundances of
molecules are degenerate at the order-of-magnitude level with the absolute normalisation of the
transmission spectrum. Using a suite of mock retrievals, we demonstrate that the normalisation
degeneracy may be partially broken using WFC3 data alone, even in the absence of optical/visible
data and without appealing to the presence of patchy clouds, although lower limits to the mixing
ratios may be prior-dominated depending on the measurement uncertainties. With James Webb Space
Telescope-like spectral resolutions, the normalisation degeneracy may be completely broken
from infrared spectra alone. We find no trend in the retrieved water abundances across nearly two
orders of magnitude in exoplanet mass and a factor of 5 in retrieved temperature (about 500 to 2500
K). We further show that there is a general lack of strong Bayesian evidence to support interpretations
of non-grey over grey clouds (only for WASP-69b and WASP-76b) and non-isothermal over isothermal
atmospheres (no objects). 35 out of 38 WFC3 transmission spectra are well-fitted by an isothermal
transit chord with grey clouds and water only, while 8 are adequately explained by flat lines. Generally,
the cloud composition is unconstrained.
