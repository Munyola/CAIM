The Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) makes certain assumptions which guide all
current search programs. To illustrate some, this includes (1) that interstellar flight is not
possible (2) that the motivations of interstellar cultures are based largely on anthropomorphic
understandings of homo sapiens (3) that the Fermi Paradox and the Drake equation are the starting
point (axioms) of all reasoning (4) that definitions of 'life' are based largely on our understanding
of homeostasis (5) that radio waves are the most likely method of interstellar communications (6)
that unknown single event source signatures detected in space are not amenable to scrutiny due to
the demands of the scientific method to be reproducible (7) that such anomalous signatures are either
astronomical or communications based in type with no consideration for emissions from advanced
industrialisation or propulsion and power technology. These assumptions, and others, have guided
the SETI community towards a constrained level of thinking that is equivalent to philosophical
dogma. In this paper, we unpack these assumptions, and others, and argue that the potential for life
and intelligent life in the Cosmos may be much greater than the SETI community currently appears
to conclude. It is also argued that more progress in our underanding of our place in the Cosmos can
be made, if the separate disciplines of astronomy, interstellar spacecraft design, SETI, biology
and philosophy can work together in a complementary way. Presented at the 47th IAA Symposium on the
