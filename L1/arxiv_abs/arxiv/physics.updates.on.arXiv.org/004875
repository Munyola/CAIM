We present a technique for continuous generation of volumetric images during radiotherapy treatments
using periodic kV images and an external respiratory surrogate signal to drive a patient-specific
PCA motion model. Using the on-board imager, kV radiographs are acquired every 3 seconds and used
to fit the parameters of a motion model so that it matches observed changes in internal patient anatomy.
A multi-dimensional correlation model is established between the motion model parameters and
the external surrogate position and velocity, enabling volumetric image reconstruction between
kV imaging time points. Performance of the algorithm was evaluated using 10 digital eXtended CArdiac-
Torso (XCAT) phantom datasets for comparison against a full 3D ground truth. The phantoms were programmed
with clinically measured 3D tumor motion traces, and the recorded external surrogate trace was
used for correlation modeling, providing a dataset with realistic breathing irregularities and
changes in internal-external correlation. The three-dimensional tumor positions are reconstructed
with an average root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.47 mm, and an average 95th percentile 3D positional
error of 2.80 mm. This technique enables continuous 3D anatomical image generation based on periodic
kV imaging of internal anatomy without the additional dose of continuous kV imaging. The 3D anatomical
images produced using this method can be used for treatment verification and delivered dose computation
in the presence of irregular respiratory motion.
