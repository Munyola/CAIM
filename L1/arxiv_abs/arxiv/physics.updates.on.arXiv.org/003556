Contact friction is a key influence factor for the shearing behaviour of granular media. In the discrete
element method (DEM) contact friction is usually modelled with Coulomb's law assuming a constant
interparticle friction coefficient. From tribology it is known that friction is influenced by
several factors, e.g., temperature, normal stress, surface condition, etc. None of these influences
can be modelled with the constant interparticle friction coefficient from Coulomb's law. For a
given granular material (particle shape distribution), the usage of constant interparticle friction
in DEM models generally results in constant bulk friction coefficients in the simulation of direct
shear tests. While this is frequently seen in experiments with equi-sized spherical particles,
papers exist in literature which report a stress dependency of bulk friction for non-spherical
particles of certain materials. In this work, a stress dependency of bulk friction is obtained by
introducing a model for stress dependent interparticle friction in DEM simulations. For validation
experimental results of direct shear tests conducted on single or paired glass beads are used. While
the bulk friction of paired spheres clearly decreases with increasing normal stress, it is nearly
constant for single spheres. DEM simulations with the stress dependent interparticle friction
are in good accordance with the experimental results of both single and paired spheres. A comparison
with simulations, using constant interparticle friction, clearly shows the advantage of the proposed
model.
