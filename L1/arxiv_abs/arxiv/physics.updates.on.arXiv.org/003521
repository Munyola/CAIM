This paper analyzes turbulence-chemistry interactions for an n-dodecane-air flame, focusing
on the degree to which fuel oxidation pathways change in turbulent flames relative to their corresponding
laminar flames. This work is based on a lean n-dodecane-air flame DNS database from Aspden et al.
(Proc. Combust. Institute, 36 (2017) 2005-2016). The relative roles of dominant reactions that
release heat and produce/consume radicals are examined at various turbulence intensities and
compared with stretched flame calculations from counterflow flames and perfectly stirred reactors.
These results show that spatially integrated (i.e. integrated heat release or radical production
rate metrics averaged over the entire flame) chemical pathways are relatively insensitive to turbulence
intensity and mimic the behavior of stretched flames. In other words, the contribution of a given
reaction to heat release or radical production, integrated over the entire flame, is nearly independent
to turbulence. Localized analysis conditioned on topological feature of the flame and on temperature
is also performed. The former analysis reveals that much larger alteration of pathways occurs in
the positively-curved regions of the flame. The latter localized analysis shows that peak activity
in the low temperature (i.e. below 1200K) region shift towards higher temperatures with increases
in Karlovitz number. This result is particularly interesting given that prior work with lighter
fuels showed the opposite behavior suggesting a disparate response of the reactions involved in
the fuel oxidation process to increased turbulence.
