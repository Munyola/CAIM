A systematic study is carried out on a fully resolved fluid-particle model which couples the Lattice
Boltzmann Method (LBM) and the Discrete Element Method (DEM) using an immersed moving boundary
technique. Similar algorithms have been reported in the past decade, however, the roles of major
model parameters are yet to be fully understood. To examine various numerical errors, a series of
benchmark cases with a wide range of Reynolds number are performed, starting from a single stationary
particle to multiple moving particles. It is found that for flow with low and intermediate Reynolds
numbers, 20 fluid cells per one particle diameter are necessary to achieve sufficient accuracy
(within 5%). For a flow with high Reynolds number, a turbulence model shall be incorporated so that
the effects of unresolved small eddies can be captured in an accurate and efficient manner. Besides,
the LBM-DEM results are also sensitive to the relaxation time, especially when the spatial resolution
is inadequate. A large relaxation time can introduce additional diffusion of fluid momentum into
the fluid-particle system, leading to weakened hydrodynamic interactions. By choosing a small
relaxation time greater than the lower limit 0.5, a small fluid compressibility error and a strong
coupling between fluids and particles can be achieved, at the cost of computational effort. The
test cases also demonstrate the capability of LBM-DEM to describe the rheology of particle suspensions
by capturing the pore-scale hydrodynamic interactions. Finally, a guideline for quickly establishing
a high-quality LBM-DEM model is provided.
