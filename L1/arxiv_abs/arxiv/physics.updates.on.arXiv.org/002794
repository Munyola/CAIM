Spontaneous decays of small, hot silver cluster anions Ag$_{n}$, $n=4-7$ have been studied using
one of the rings of the Double ElectroStatic Ion Ring ExpEriment (DESIREE). Observation of these
decays over very long time scales is possible due to the very low residual gas pressure ($\sim10^{-14}$)
and cryogenic (13 K) operation of DESIREE. The yield of neutral particles from stored beams of Ag$_{6}$
and Ag$_{7}$ anions were measured for 100 milliseconds and were found to follow single power law
behaviour with millisecond time scale exponential cut-offs. The Ag$_{4}$ and Ag$_{5}$ anions
were stored for 60 seconds and the observed decays show two-component power law behaviors. We present
calculations of the rate constants for electron detachment from, and fragmentation of Ag$_{4}$
and Ag$_{5}$. In these calculations, we assume that the internal energy distribution of the clusters
are flat and with this we reproduce the early steep parts of the experimentally measured decay curves
for Ag$_{4}$ and Ag$_{5}$, which extends to tens and hundreds of milliseconds, respectively. The
fact that the calculations reproduce the early slopes of Ag$_{4}$ and Ag$_{5}$, which differ for
the two cases, suggests that it is the changes in fragmentation rates with internal cluster energies
of Ag$_{4}$ and Ag$_{5}$ rather than conditions in the ion source that determines this behavior.
Comparisons with the measurements strongly suggest that the neutral particles detected in these
time domains originate from Ag$_{4} \rightarrow$ Ag$_{3}+$ Ag and Ag$_{5}\rightarrow$ Ag$_{3}+$
Ag$_{2}$ fragmentation processes.
