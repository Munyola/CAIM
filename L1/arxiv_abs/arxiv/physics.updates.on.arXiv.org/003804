When molecules whose collision induced vibrational decay rates are small are probed by molecular
absorption spectroscopic (MAS) techniques the absorption signal can, under certain conditions,
be reduced and distorted. The reason has been attributed to the fact that a substantial fraction
of the molecules in the interaction region will reside in excited vibrational states, which leads
to a depletion of the vibrational ground state. One type of molecule in which this can take place is
methane. A model for this phenomenon, based on $\text{CH}_4$ in trace concentrations in either
$\text{N}_2$ or dry air in a cylindrical gas cell, detected by mid-infrared light in the 1 - 100 Torr
pressure range, is presented. Due to a fast collisional coupling between various rotational states
and velocity groups we suggest that depletion in MAS can be modeled adequately by a simple three-level
system to which the transport of molecules in the system is coupled as diffusion according to Fick's
law, applied to each level individually. The model is verified in a separate work [Hausmaninger
T et al., J Quant Spectrosc Radiat Tr. 2017;205:59-70] with good agreement. It predicts that depletion
has a strong pressure dependence in the 1 - 30 Torr range, that it is significantly more pronounced
in $\text{N}_2$ than in air, and that considerable degrees of depletion can be obtained for mW powers
of light (> 10% for powers > 20 mW). The findings indicate that, unless precautions are taken, depletion
can adversely affect quantitative assessments performed by MAS. Means of how to reduce depletion
are given.
