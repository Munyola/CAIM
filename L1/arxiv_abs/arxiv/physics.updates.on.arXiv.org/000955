Understanding the dynamics of positron cooling in gases, including the fraction of positrons surviving
to thermalisation, is critical for accurate interpretation of positron lifetime spectra, for
the development of efficient positron cooling in traps and accumulators, and for a cryogenically
cooled, ultra-high-energy-resolution, trap-based positron beam. Here, positron cooling and
annihilation in noble gases is simulated using accurate scattering and annihilation cross sections
calculated \emph{ab initio} with many-body theory. It is shown that a strikingly small fraction
of positrons survive to thermalisation: $\sim$0.1 in He, $\sim$0 in Ne (due to cooling effectively
stalling in the relatively deep momentum-transfer cross-section minimum), $\sim$0.15 in Ar,
$\sim$0.05 in Kr and $\sim$0.01 in Xe. For Xe, the time-varying annihilation rate $\bar{Z}_{\rm
eff}(\tau)$ is shown to be highly sensitive to the depletion of the distribution due to annihilation,
conclusively explaining the long-standing discrepancy between gas-cell and trap-based measurements
in Xe. The \emph{ab initio} calculations enable the first simultaneous probing of the energy dependence
of the the scattering cross section and annihilation rate. Overall, the use of the accurate atomic
data gives $\bar{Z}_{\rm eff}(\tau)$ in close agreement with experiment for all noble gases except
Ne, the experiment for which is proffered to have suffered from incomplete knowledge of the fraction
of positrons surviving to thermalisation and/or the presence of impurities.
