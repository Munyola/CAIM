The location of the terrestrial magnetopause (MP) and it's subsolar stand-off distance depends
not only on the solar wind dynamic pressure and the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF), both of
which play a crucial role in determining it's shape, but also on the nature of the processes involved
in the interaction between the solar wind and the magnetosphere. The stand-off distance of the earth's
MP and bow shock (BS) also define the extent of terrestrial magnetic fields into near-earth space
on the sunward side and have important consequences for space weather. However, asymmetries due
to the direction of the IMF are hard to account for, making it nearly impossible to favour any specific
model over the other in estimating the extent of the MP or BS. Thus, both numerical and empirical models
have been used and compared to estimate the BS and MP stand-off distances as well as the MP shape, in
the period Jan. 1975-Dec. 2016, covering solar cycles 21-24. The computed MP and BS stand-off distances
have been found to be increasing steadily over the past two decades, since ~1995, spanning solar
cycles 23 and 24. The increasing trend is consistent with earlier reported studies of a long term
and steady decline in solar polar magnetic fields and solar wind micro-turbulence levels. The present
study, thus, highlights the response of the terrestrial magnetosphere to the long term global changes
in both solar and solar wind activity, through a detailed study of the extent and shape of the terrestrial
MP and BS over the past four solar cycles, a period spanning the last four decades.
