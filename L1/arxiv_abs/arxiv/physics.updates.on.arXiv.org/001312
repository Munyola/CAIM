With a large spatiotemporal coverage, the satellite-derived aerosol optical depth (AOD) has been
widely used to estimate ground-level PM2.5 concentrations (AOD-PM modeling). However, the retrieval
errors exit in the AOD products, and they will be accumulated in PM2.5 estimation. To avoid the intermediate
error/process, a novel solution to estimate PM2.5 directly from satellite top-of-atmosphere
(TOA) reflectance (denoted as Ref-PM modeling) is proposed. Using multiple linear regression,
neural networks, and deep learning to establish the specific relationship between PM2.5, satellite
reflectance, and other predictors, the Ref-PM modeling is validated with data from Wuhan Metropolitan
Area in 2016. Furthermore, the geographical correlation is incorporated into deep belief network
(Geoi-DBN) to better estimate PM2.5 concentrations. The results show that the performance of Ref-PM
modeling (cross-validation R2=0.64 for DBN) has a competitive advantage than that of conventional
AOD-PM modeling (cross-validation R2=0.46 for DBN). Moreover, the out-of-sample cross-validation
R2 and RMSE for Geoi-DBN in Ref-PM modeling are 0.87 and 9.89 ug/m3, respectively. On this basis,
the daily distributions of PM2.5 with a resolution of 0.01 degree are mapped, and they have similar
spatial patterns with ground station measurements. These results demonstrate that the proposed
Ref-PM modeling is effective for estimating ground-level PM2.5 concentrations from satellite
reflectance. This study will significantly promote the application of satellite remote sensing
in environmental monitoring.
