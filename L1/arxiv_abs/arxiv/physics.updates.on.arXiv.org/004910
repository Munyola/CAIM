This study examines several techniques to improve the efficiency of the linearized multireference
driven similarity renormalization group truncated to one- and two-body operators [MR-LDSRG(2)].
We propose a sequential MR-LDSRG(2) [sq-MR-LDSRG(2)] approach, in which one-body rotations are
folded exactly into the Hamiltonian. This new approach is combined with density fitting (DF) to
reduce the storage cost of two-electron integrals. To further avoid the storage of large four-index
intermediates, we propose a non-interacting virtual orbit (NIVO) approximation in which tensor
blocks labeled by three and four virtual indices are neglected. The NIVO approximation reduces
the computational cost prefactor of the MR-LDSRG(2) bringing it closer to that of coupled cluster
with singles and doubles (CCSD). We test the effect of the DF and NIVO approximations on the MR-LDSRG(2)
and sq-MR-LDSRG(2) methods by computing properties of eight diatomic molecules. The diatomic
constants obtained by DF-sq-MR-LDSRG(2)+NIVO are found to be as accurate as those from the original
MR-LDSRG(2) and coupled cluster theory with singles, doubles, and perturbative triples. Finally,
we demonstrate that the DF-sq-MR-LDSRG(2)+NIVO scheme can be applied to chemical systems with
more than 550 basis functions by computing the automerization energy of cyclobutadiene with a quintuple-zeta
basis set. The predicted automerization energy is found similar to the values computed with Mukherjee's
state-specific multireference coupled cluster theory with singles and doubles.
