X-ray mirrors with high focusing performances are in use in both mirror modules for X-ray telescopes
and in synchrotron and FEL (Free Electron Laser) beamlines. A degradation of the focus sharpness
arises in general from geometrical deformations and surface roughness, the former usually described
by geometrical optics and the latter by physical optics. In general, technological developments
are aimed at a very tight focusing, which requires the mirror profile to comply with the nominal shape
as much as possible and to keep the roughness at a negligible level. However, a deliberate deformation
of the mirror can be made to endow the focus with a desired size and distribution, via piezo actuators
as done at the EIS-TIMEX beamline of FERMI@Elettra. The resulting profile can be characterized
with a Long Trace Profilometer and correlated with the expected optical quality via a wavefront
propagation code. However, if the roughness contribution can be neglected, the computation can
be performed via a ray-tracing routine, and, under opportune assumptions, the focal spot profile
(the Point Spread Function, PSF) can even be predicted analytically. The advantage of this approach
is that the analytical relation can be reversed; i.e, from the desired PSF the required mirror profile
can be computed easily, thereby avoiding the use of complex and time-consuming numerical codes.
The method can also be suited in the case of spatially inhomogeneous beam intensities, as commonly
experienced at Synchrotrons and FELs. In this work we expose the analytical method and the application
to the beam shaping problem.
