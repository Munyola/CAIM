We re-examine the physics of the magnetic mirror mode in its final state of saturation, the thermodynamic
equilibrium, to demonstrate that the mirror mode is the analogue of a superconducting effect in
a classical anisotropic-pressure space plasma. Two different spatial scales are identified which
control the behaviour of its evolution. These are the ion inertial scale $\lambda_{im}(\tau)$
based on the excess density $N_m(\tau)$ generated in the mirror mode, and the Debye scale $\lambda_D(\tau)$.
The Debye length plays the role of the correlation length in superconductivity. Their dependence
on the temperature ratio $\tau=T_\|/T_\perp<1$ is given, with $T_\perp$ the critical temperature.
The mirror mode equilibrium structure under saturation is determined by the Landau-Ginzburg ratio
$\kappa_D=\lambda_{im}/\lambda_D$, or $\kappa_\rho=\lambda_{im}/\rho$, depending on whether
the Debye length or the thermal-ion gyroradius $\rho$ serve as correlation lengths. Since in all
space plasmas $\kappa_D\gg1$, plasmas with $\lambda_D$ as relevant correlation length always
behave like type II superconductors, naturally giving rise to chains of local depletions of the
magnetic field of the kind observed in the mirror mode. In this way they provide the plasma with a magnetic
bubble texture. The problem becomes more subtle when $\rho$ is taken as correlation length. In this
case the evolution of mirror modes is more restricted. Their existence as chains or trains of mirror
bubbles implies that another threshold, $V_A>\upsilon_{\perp th}$, is exceeded.
