The ability of mixing colors with remarkable results had long been exclusive to the talents of master
painters. By finely combining colors at different amounts on the palette intuitively, they obtain
smooth gradients with any given color. Creating such smooth color variations through scattering
by the structural patterning of a surface, as opposed to color pigments, has long remained a challenge.
Here, we borrow from the painter's approach and demonstrate color mixing generated by an optical
metasurface. We propose a single-layer plasmonic color pixel and a method for nanophotonic structural
color mixing based on the additive RGB color model. The color pixels consist of plasmonic nanorod
arrays that generate vivid primary colors and enable independent control of color brightness without
affecting chromaticity, by simply varying geometric in-plane parameters. By interleaving different
nanorod arrays, we combine up to three primary colors on a single pixel. Based on this, two and three
color mixing is demonstrated, enabling the continuous coverage of a plasmonic RGB color gamut and
yielding a palette with a virtually unlimited number of colors. With this multi-resonant color
pixel, we show the photorealistic printing of color and monochrome images at the nanoscale, with
ultra-smooth transitions in color and brightness. Our color mixing approach can be applied to a
broad range of scatterer designs and materials, and has the potential to be used for multi-wavelength
color filters and dynamic photorealistic displays.
