Recording of flash-ADC traces is challenging from both the transmission bandwidth and storage
cost perspectives. This paper presents a configuration-free lossless compression algorithm
which addresses both limitations, by compressing the data on-the-fly in the controlling field-programmable
gate array (FPGA). Thus the difference predicted trace compression (DPTC) can easily be used directly
in front-end electronics. The method first computes the differences between consecutive samples
in the traces, thereby concentrating the most probable values around zero. The values are then stored
as groups of four, with only the necessary least-significant bits in a variable-length code, packed
in a stream of 32-bit words. To evaluate the efficiency, the storage cost of compressed traces is
modeled as a baseline cost including the ADC noise, and a cost for pulses that depends on their amplitude
and width. The free parameters and the validity of the model are determined by comparing it with the
results of compressing a large set of artificial traces with varying characteristics. The compression
method was also applied to actual data from different types of detectors, thereby demonstrating
its general applicability. The compression efficiency is found to be comparable to popular general-purpose
compression methods, while available for FPGA implementation using limited resources. A typical
storage cost is around 4 to 5 bits per sample. Code for the FPGA implementation in VHDL and for the CPU
decompression routine in C of DPTC are available as open source software, both operating at multi-100
Msamples/s speeds.
