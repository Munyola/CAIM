A group of dimensionless numbers, termed DLV (Density-Length-Velocity) system, is put forward
to represent the scaled behavior of structures under impact loads. It is obtained by means of the
Buckingham Pi theorem with an alternative basis. The distinct features of this group of dimensionless
numbers are that it relates physical quantities of the impacted structure with essential basis
of the Density, the Length and the Velocity, and thus it can represent the scaled influence of material
property, geometry characteristic and velocity on the behavior of structures. The newly 15 proposed
dimensionless numbers reflect three advantages. (1) The intuitively clear physical significance
of these dimensionless numbers, such as the ratios of force intensity, force, moment of inertia
to the corresponding dynamic quantities, the Johnson's damage number Dn and Zhao's response number
Rn etc. are naturally included. (2) The property of direct matching the dimensionless expression
of response equations of dynamic problems with these dimensionless numbers through simple equation
analysis; (3) The ability of addressing non-scaling problems for different materials and strain-rate-sensitive
as well as the VSG (initial impact Velocity-dynamic flow Stress-impact mass G) system. Four classical
impact models are used to verify the direct matching property and the non-scaling addressing ability
of the DLV system by equation analysis. The results show that the proposed dimensionless number
system is simple, clear and efficient, and we suggest using it to represent the scaled behavior of
structures under impact loads.
