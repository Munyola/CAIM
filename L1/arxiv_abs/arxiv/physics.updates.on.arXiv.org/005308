This paper addresses a reflection-type dual-band 2-bit coding metasurface (CM) design to achieve
the dual-band functionalities in two different operating bands, independently. We are particularly
interested to control linearly-polarized incident waves by encoding the propagation / dynamic
phase in order to realize and fully control the orbital angular momentum (OAM) vortex beam (VB) for
dual-band, independently. In this regard, we perform digital addition operations to combine the
coding sequences of traditional OAM and phase-gradient to construct the proposed CM. The proposed
CM generates and steers the OAM-VB with different topological charges in both lower and higher bands,
independently. Similarly, the proposed CM is further extended for OAM-VB shaping by combining
the coding sequences of traditional OAM and splitting phase unit-cells, and, we discuss two different
scenarios. Firstly, OAM-VB splitting is performed to achieve different topological charges in
both lower and higher bands, independently. Secondly, quad-beam shaping is realized to verify
the proposed concept of this paper. Finally yet importantly, we also examine that the reflected
beam directions can be further independently controlled to achieve anomalous, negative and retro-reflection
at two different operating bands. The proposed concept will open up possibilities of multi-functional
meta-devices and will be useful in many applications such as optical spanners, quantum optics,
spatial mode multiplexing for telecommunications, and astronomy etc.
