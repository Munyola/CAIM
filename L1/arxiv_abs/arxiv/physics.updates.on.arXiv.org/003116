Ocean flows are routinely inferred from low-resolution satellite altimetry measurements of sea
surface height assuming a geostrophic balance. Recent nonlinear dynamical systems techniques
have revealed that surface currents derived from altimetry can support mesoscale eddies with material
boundaries that do not filament for many months, thereby representing effective transport mechanisms.
However, the long-range Lagrangian coherence assessed for mesoscale eddy boundaries detected
from altimetry is constrained by the impossibility of current altimeters to resolve ageostrophic
submesoscale motions. These may act to prevent Lagrangian coherence from manifesting in the rigorous
form described by the nonlinear dynamical systems theories. Here we use a combination of satellite
ocean color and surface drifter trajectory data, rarely available simultaneously over an extended
period of time, to provide observational evidence for the enduring Lagrangian coherence of a Loop
Current ring detected from altimetry. We also seek indications of this behavior in the flow produced
by a data-assimilative system which demonstrated ability to reproduce observed relative dispersion
statistics down into the marginally submesoscale range. However, the simulated flow, total surface
and subsurface or subsampled emulating altimetry, is not found to support the long-lasting Lagrangian
coherence that characterizes the observed ring. This highlights the importance of the Lagrangian
metrics produced by the nonlinear dynamical systems tools employed here in assessing model performance.
