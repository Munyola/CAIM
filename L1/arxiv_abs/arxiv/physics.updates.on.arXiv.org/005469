The present work is concerned with the propagation of electro-magneto-thermoelastic plane waves
of assigned frequency in a homogeneous isotropic and finitely conducting elastic medium permeated
by a primary uniform external magnetic field. We formulate our problem under the theory of Green
and Naghdi of type-III (GN-III) to account for the interactions between the elastic, thermal as
well as magnetic fields. A general dispersion relation for coupled waves is deduced to ascertain
the nature of waves propagating through the medium. Perturbation technique has been employed to
obtain the solution of dispersion relation for small thermo-elastic coupling parameter and identify
three different types of waves. We specially analyze the nature of important wave components like,
phase velocity, specific loss and penetration depth of all three modes of waves. We attempt to compute
these wave components numerically to observe their variations with frequency. The effect of presence
of magnetic field is analyzed. Comparative results under theories of type GN-I, II and III have been
presented numerically in which we have found that the coupled thermoelastic waves are un-attenuated
and nondispersive in case of Green-Naghdi-II model which is completely in contrast with the theories
of type-I and type-III. Furthermore, the thermal mode wave is observed to propagate with finite
phase velocity in case of GN-II model, whereas the phase velocity of thermal mode wave is found to
be an increasing function of frequency in other two cases. We achieve significant variations among
the results predicted by all three theories.
