Steady states and traveling waves play a fundamental role in understanding hydrodynamic problems.
Even when unstable, these states provide the bifurcation-theoretic explanation for the origin
of the observed states. In turbulent wall-bounded shear flows, these states have been hypothesized
to be saddle points organizing the trajectories within a chaotic attractor. These states must be
computed with Newton's method or one of its generalizations, since time-integration cannot converge
to unstable equilibria. The bottleneck is the solution of linear systems involving the Jacobian
of the Navier-Stokes or Boussinesq equations. Originally such computations were carried out by
constructing and directly inverting the Jacobian, but this is unfeasible for the matrices arising
from three-dimensional hydrodynamic configurations in large domains. A popular method is to seek
states that are invariant under numerical time integration. Surprisingly, equilibria may also
be found by seeking flows that are invariant under a single very large Backwards-Euler Forwards-Euler
timestep. We show that this method, called Stokes preconditioning, is 10 to 50 times faster at computing
steady states in plane Couette flow and traveling waves in pipe flow. Moreover, it can be carried
out using Channelflow (by Gibson) and Openpipeflow (by Willis) without any changes to these popular
spectral codes. We explain the convergence rate as a function of the integration period and Reynolds
number by computing the full spectra of the operators corresponding to the Jacobians of both methods.
