Objective: We aim to improve operational robustness of liquid scanning probes. Two main failure
modes to be addressed are an obstruction of the flow path of the processing liquid and a deviation
from the desired gap distance between probe and sample. Methods: We introduce a multi-functional
design element, a microfluidic bypass channel, which can be operated in dc and in ac mode, each preventing
one of the two main failure modes. Results: In dc mode, the bypass channel is filled with liquid and
exhibits resistive behavior, enabling the probe to passively react to an obstruction. In the case
of an obstruction of the flow path, the processing liquid is passively diverted through the bypass
to prevent its leakage and to limit the build-up of high pressure levels. In ac mode, the bypass is
filled with gas and has capacitive characteristics, allowing the gap distance between the probe
and the sample to be monitored by observing a phase shift in the motion of two gas-liquid interfaces.
For a modulation of the input pressure at 4 Hz, significant changes of the phase shift were observed
up to a gap distance of 25 {\mu}m. Conclusion: The presented passive design element counters both
failure modes in a simple and highly compatible manner. Significance: Liquid scanning probes enabling
targeted interfacing with biological surfaces are compatible with a wide range of workflows and
bioanalytical applications. An improved operational robustness would facilitate rapid and widespread
adoption of liquid scanning probes in research as well as in diagnostics.
