Using the notion of effective distance proposed by Brockmann and Helbing, complex spatiotemporal
processes of epidemic spreading can be reduced to circular wave propagation patterns with well-defined
wavefronts. This hidden homogeneity of contagion phenomena enables the mapping of virtual mobility
networks to physical propagation channels. Subsequently, we propose a novel communications-inspired
model of epidemic spreading and mitigation by establishing the one-to-one correspondence between
the essential components comprising information and disease transmissions. The epidemic processes
can be regarded as macroscale molecular communications, in which individuals are macroscale information
molecules carrying messages (epidemiological states). We then present the notions of normalized
ensemble-average prevalence (NEAP) and prevalence delay profile (PDP) to characterize the relative
impact and time difference of all the spreading paths, which are analogous to the classical description
methods of path loss and power delay profile in communications. Furthermore, we introduce the metric
of root mean square (RMS) delay spread to measure the distortion of early contagion dynamics caused
by multiple infection transmission routes. In addition, we show how social and medical interventions
can be understood from the perspectives of various communication modules. The proposed framework
provides an intuitive, coherent, and efficient approach for characterization of the disease outbreaks
by applying the deep-rooted communications theories as the analytical lens.
