The treatment of atomic anions with Kohn-Sham density functional theory (DFT) has long been controversial
since the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy, $E_{HOMO}$, is often calculated to
be positive with most approximate density functionals. We assess the accuracy of orbital energies
and electron affinities for all three rows of elements in the periodic table (H-Ar) using a variety
of theoretical approaches and customized basis sets. Among all of the theoretical methods studied
here, we find that a non-empirically tuned range-separated approach (constructed to satisfy DFT-Koopmans'
theorem for the anionic electron system) provides the best accuracy for a variety of basis sets -
even for small basis sets where most functionals typically fail. Previous approaches to solve this
conundrum of positive $E_{HOMO}$ values have utilized non-self-consistent methods; however
electronic properties, such as electronic couplings/gradients (which require a self-consistent
potential and energy), become ill-defined with these approaches. In contrast, the non-empirically
tuned range-separated procedure used here yields well-defined electronic couplings/gradients
and correct $E_{HOMO}$ values since both the potential and resulting electronic energy are computed
self-consistently. Orbital energies and electron affinities are further analyzed in the context
of the electronic energy as a function of electronic number (including fractional numbers of electrons)
to provide a stringent assessment of self-interaction errors for these complex anion systems.
