Physics labs provide a unique opportunity for students to grow their physics identity and science
identity in general since they provide students with opportunity to tinker with experiments and
analyze data in a low-stakes environment. However, it is important to ensure that all students are
benefiting from the labs equally and have a positive growth trajectory. Through interviews and
reflexive ethnographic observations, we identify and analyze two common modes of work that may
disadvantage female students in introductory physics labs. Students who adopt the Secretary archetype
are relegated to recording and analyzing data, and thus miss out on much of the opportunity to grow
their physics and science identities by engaging fully in the experimental work. Meanwhile, students
in the Hermione mode shoulder a disproportionate amount of managerial work, and also do not get adequate
opportunity to engage with different aspects of the experimental work that are essential for helping
them develop their physics and science identities. Using a physics identity framework, we analyze
interviews and observational data to investigate how students under these modes of work may experience
stunted growth in their physics and science identity trajectories in their physics lab course.
This stunted growth then perpetuates and reinforces societal stereotypes and biases about who
does physics. This categorization not only gives a vocabulary to discussions about equity in the
lab, but can also serve as a useful touchstone for those who seek to center equity in efforts to transform
physics instruction.
