Based on the results of a large-scale survey, we construct an agent-based network model for the independent
inbound tourism of China and, by the approach of numerical simulation, investigate the dynamical
responses of the tourist flows to external perturbations in different scenarios, including the
closure of a tourist city, the opening of a new port in western China, and the increase of the tourism
attractiveness of a specific city. Numerical results show that: (1) the closure of a single city
in general will affect the tourist visitations of many other cities in the network and, comparing
to the non-port cities, the overall visitation volume of the system is more influenced by closing
a port city; (2) the opening of a new port city in western China will attract more tourists to the western
cities, but has a negligible impact on either the overall visitation volume or the imbalanced tourist
distribution; and (3) the increase of the tourism attractiveness of a non-port (port) city normally
increases (decreases) the overall visitation volume, yet there are exceptions due to the spillover
effect. Furthermore, by increasing the tourism attractiveness of a few cities simultaneously,
we investigate also the strategy of multiple-city-upgrade in tourism development. Numerical
results show that the overall tourist volume is better improved by upgrading important non-port
cities that are geographically distant from each other. The study reveals the rich dynamics inherent
in complex tourism network, and the findings could be helpful to the development and management
of China inbound tourism.
