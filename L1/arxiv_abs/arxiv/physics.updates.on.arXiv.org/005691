Disordered packings of colloidal spheres show angle-independent structural color when the particles
are on the scale of the wavelength of visible light. Previous work has shown that the positions of
the peaks in the reflectance spectra can be predicted accurately from a single-scattering model
that accounts for the effective refractive index of the material. This agreement shows that the
main color peak arises from short-range correlations between particles. However, the single-scattering
model does not quantitatively reproduce the observed color: the main peak in the reflectance spectrum
is much broader and the reflectance at low wavelengths is much larger than predicted by the model.
We use a combination of experiment and theory to understand these features. We find that one significant
contribution to the breadth of the main peak is light that is scattered, totally internally reflected
from the boundary of the sample, and then scattered again. The high reflectance at low wavelengths
also results from multiple scattering but can be traced to the increase in the scattering cross-section
of individual particles with decreasing wavelength. Both of these effects tend to reduce the saturation
of the structural color, which limits the use of these materials in applications. We show that while
the single-scattering model cannot reproduce the observed saturations, it can be used to design
materials in which multiple scattering is suppressed and the color saturated, even in the absence
of absorbing components.
