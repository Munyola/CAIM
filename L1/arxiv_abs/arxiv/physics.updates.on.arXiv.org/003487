Background: Treatment verification with PET imaging in charged particle therapy is conventionally
done by comparing measurements of spatial distributions with Monte Carlo (MC) predictions. However,
decay curves can provide additional independent information about the treatment and the irradiated
tissue. Most studies performed so far focus on long time intervals. Here we investigate the reliability
of MC predictions of space and time (decay rate) profiles shortly after irradiation, and we show
how the decay rates can give an indication about the elements of which the phantom is made up. Methods
and Materials: Various phantoms were irradiated in clinical and near-clinical conditions at the
Cyclotron Centre of the Bronowice proton therapy centre. PET data were acquired with a planar 16x16
cm$^2$ PET system. MC simulations of particle interactions and photon propagation in the phantoms
were performed using the FLUKA code. The analysis included a comparison between experimental data
and MC simulations of space and time profiles, as well as a fitting procedure to obtain the various
isotope contributions in the phantoms. Results and conclusions: There was a good agreement between
data and MC predictions in 1-dimensional space and decay rate distributions. The fractions of $^{11}$C,
$^{15}$O and $^{10}$C that were obtained by fitting the decay rates with multiple simple exponentials
generally agreed well with the MC expectations. We found a small excess of $^{10}$C in data compared
to what was predicted in MC, which was clear especially in the PE phantom.
