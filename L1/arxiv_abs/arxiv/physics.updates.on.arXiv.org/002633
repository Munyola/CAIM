We present an experimental study of the absorption, between 40 and 640 cm$^{-1}$, by CO$_2$, CH$_4$
and H$_2$ gases as well as by H$_2$+CO$_2$ and CH$_4$+CO$_2$ mixtures at room temperature. A Fourier
transform spectrometer associated to a multi-pass cell, whose optics were adjusted to obtain a
152 m pathlength, were used to record transmission spectra at total pressures up to about 0.98 bar.
These measurements provide information concerning the collision-induced absorption (CIA) bands
as well as about the wing of the CO$_2$ 15 $\mu$m band. Our results for the CIAs of pure gases are, within
uncertainties, in agreement with previous determinations, validating our experimental and data
analysis procedures. We then consider the CIAs by H$_2$+CO$_2$ and CH$_4$+CO$_2$ and the low frequency
wing of the pure CO$_2$ 15 $\mu$m band, for which there are, to our knowledge, no previous measurements.
We confirm experimentally the theoretical prediction of Wordsworth et al. 2017 that the H$_2$+CO$_2$
and CH$_4$+CO$_2$ CIAs are significantly stronger in the 50-550 cm$^{-1}$ region than those of
H$_2$+N$_2$ and CH$_4$+N$_2$, respectively. However, we find that the shape and the strength of
these recorded CIAs differ from the aforementioned predictions. For the pure CO$_2$ line-wings,
we show that both the $\chi$-factor deduced from measurements near 4 $\mu$m and a line-mixing model
very well describe the observed strongly sub-Lorentzian behavior in the 500-600 cm$^{-1}$ region.
These experimental results open renewed perspectives for studies of the past climate of Mars and
extrasolar analogues.
