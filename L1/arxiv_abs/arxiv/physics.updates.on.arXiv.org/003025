The ability of viscous layer models to describe the attenuation of waves propagating in grease-pancake
ice covered ocean is investigated. In particular, the Keller's model Keller [1998], the two-layer
viscous model [De Carolis and Desiderio 2002] and the close-packing model [De Santi and Olla 2017]
are extensively validated by using wave attenuation data collected during two different field
campaigns (Weddell Sea, Antarctica, April 2000; western Arctic Ocean, autumn 2015). We use these
data to validate the three models by minimizing the differences between the measured and model wave
attenuation; the retrieved ice thickness is then compared with measured data. The three models
allow to fit the observation data, but with important differences in the three cases. The close-packing
model shows good agreement with the data for values of the ice viscosity comparable to those of grease
ice in laboratory experiments. For thin ice, the Keller's model performance is similar to that of
the close-packing model, while for thick ice much larger values of the ice viscosity are required,
which reflects the different ability of the two models to take into account the effect of pancakes.
The improvement of performance over the Keller's model achieved by the two-layer viscous model
is minimal, which reflects the marginal role in the dynamics of a finite eddy viscosity in the ice-free
layer. A good ice thickness retrieval can be obtained by considering the ice layer as the only source
in the wave dynamics, so that the wind input can be disregarded.
