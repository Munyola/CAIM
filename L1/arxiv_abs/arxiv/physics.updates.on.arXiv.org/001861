Processes of propagation and interaction of nonlinear gravity-capillary waves on the free surface
of a deep non-conducting liquid with high dielectric constant under the action of a tangential electric
field are numerically simulated. The computational method is based on the time-dependent conformal
transformation of the region occupied by the fluid into a half-plane. In the limit of a strong electric
field, when the gravitational and capillary forces are negligibly small, there exists an exact
analytical solution of the electro-hydrodynamic equations describing propagation without distortions
of nonlinear surface waves along (or against) the electric field direction. In the situation where
gravity and capillarity are taken into account, the results of numerical simulations indeed show
that, for large external field, the waves traveling in a given direction tend to preserve their shape.
In the limit of a strong electric field, the interaction of counter-propagating waves leads to the
formation of regions, where the electrostatic and dynamic pressures undergo a discontinuity,
and the curvature of the surface increases infinitely. The Fourier spectrum of the surface perturbations
tends to the power-law distribution (k^-2). In the case of a finite electric field, the wave interaction
results in a radiation of massive cascade of small-scale capillary waves that causes the chaotic
behavior of the system. The investigated mechanism of interaction between oppositely-traveling
waves can enhance development of the capillary turbulence of the fluid surface.
