Radiation-pressure-induced optomechanical coupling permits exquisite control of micro- and
mesoscopic mechanical oscillators. This ability to manipulate and even damp mechanical motion
with light---a process known as dynamical backaction cooling---has become the basis for a range
of novel phenomena within the burgeoning field of cavity optomechanics, spanning from dissipation
engineering to quantum state preparation. As this field moves toward more complex systems and dynamics,
there has been growing interest in the prospect of cooling traveling-wave phonons in continuous
optomechanical waveguides. Here, we demonstrate optomechanical cooling in a continuous system
for the first time. By leveraging the dispersive symmetry breaking produced by inter-modal Brillouin
scattering, we achieve continuous mode optomechanical cooling in an extended 2.3-cm silicon waveguide,
reducing the temperature of a band of traveling-wave phonons by more than 30 K from room temperature.
This work reveals that optomechanical cooling is possible in macroscopic linear waveguide systems
without an optical cavity or discrete acoustic modes. Moreover, through an intriguing type of wavevector-resolved
phonon spectroscopy, we show that this system permits optomechanical control over continuously
accessible groups of phonons and produces a new form of nonreciprocal reservoir engineering. Beyond
this study, this work represents a first step towards a range of novel classical and quantum traveling-wave
operations in continuous optomechanical systems.
