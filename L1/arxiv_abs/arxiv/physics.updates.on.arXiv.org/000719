We describe how the semiclassical theory of radical pair recombination reactions recently introduced
by two of us [D. E. Manolopoulos and P. J. Hore, J. Chem. Phys. 139, 124106 (2013)] can be generalised
to allow for different singlet and triplet recombination rates. This is a non-trivial generalisation
because when the recombination rates are different the recombination process is dynamically coupled
to the coherent electron spin dynamics of the radical pair. Furthermore, because the recombination
operator is a two-electron operator, it is no longer sufficient simply to consider the two electrons
as classical vectors: one has to consider the complete set of 16 two-electron spin operators as independent
classical variables. The resulting semiclassical theory is first validated by comparison with
exact quantum mechanical results for a model radical pair containing 12 nuclear spins. It is then
used to shed light on the spin dynamics of a carotenoid-porphyrin-fullerene (CPF) triad containing
considerably more nuclear spins which has recently been used to establish a 'proof of principle'
for the operation of a chemical compass [K. Maeda et al., Nature 453, 387 (2008)]. We find in particular
that the intriguing biphasic behaviour that has been observed in the effect of an Earth-strength
magnetic field on the time-dependent survival probability of the photo-excited C+PF- radical
pair arises from a delicate balance between its asymmetric recombination and the relaxation of
the electron spin in the carotenoid radical.
