Recent developments in synthetic and supramolecular chemistry have created opportunities to
design organic systems with tailored nanoscale structure for various technological applications.
A key application area is the capture of light energy and its conversion into electrochemical or
chemical forms for photovoltaic or sensing applications. In this work we consider cylindrical
assemblies of chromophores that model structures produced by several supramolecular techniques.
Our study is especially guided by the versatile structures produced by virus-templated assembly.
We use a multi-objective optimization framework to determine design principles and limitations
in light harvesting performance for such assemblies, both in the presence and absence of disorder.
We identify a fundamental trade-off in cylindrical assemblies that is encountered when attempting
to maximize both efficiency of energy transfer and absorption bandwidth. We also rationalize the
optimal design strategies and provide explanations for why various structures provide optimal
performance. Most importantly, we find that the optimal design strategies depend on the amount
of energetic and structural disorder in the system. The aim of these studies is to develop a program
of quantum-informed rational design for construction of organic assemblies that have the same
degree of tailored nanoscale structure as biological photosynthetic light harvesting complexes,
and also have the potential to reproduce their remarkable light harvesting performance.
