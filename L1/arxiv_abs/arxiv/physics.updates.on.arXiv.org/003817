First-order reversal curves (FORC) diagram method is one of the most successful characterization
techniques used to characterize complex hysteretic phenomena not only in magnetism, but also in
other areas of science like in ferroelectricity, geology, archeology, light-induced and pressure
hysteresis in spin-transition materials, etc. Because the definition of the FORC diagram involves
a second-order derivative, the main problem in their numerical calculation is that the derivative
of a function for which only discrete noise-contaminated data values are available magnifies the
noise that is inevitably present in measurements. In this paper we present doFORC tool for calculating
FORC diagrams of noise scattered data. It can provide both a smooth approximation of the measured
magnetization and all its partial derivatives. doFORC is a free, portable application working
on various operating systems, with an easy to use graphical interface, with four regression methods
implemented to obtain a smooth approximation of the data which may then be differentiated to obtain
approximations for derivatives. In order to perform the diagnostics and goodness of fit doFORC
computes residuals to characterize the difference between observed and predicted values, generalized
cross-validation to measure the predictive performance, two information criteria to quantify
the information that is lost by using an approximate model, and three degrees of freedom to compare
different amounts of smoothing being performed by different smoothing methods. Based on these
doFORC can perform automatic smoothing parameter selection.
