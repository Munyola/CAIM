Understanding gas transport in porous media and its mechanism has broad applications in various
research areas, such as carbon sequestration in deep saline aquifers and gas explorations in reservoir
rocks. Gas transport is mainly controlled by pore space geometrical and morphological characteristics.
In this study, we apply a physically-based model developed using concepts from percolation theory
(PT) and the effective-medium approximation (EMA) to better understand diffusion and permeability
of gas in packings of angular and rounded sand grains as well as glass beads. Two average sizes of grain
i.e., 0.3 and 0.5 mm were used to pack sands in a column of 6 cm height and 4.9 cm diameter so that the total
porosity of all packs was near 0.4. Water content, gas-filled porosity (also known as gas content),
gas diffusion, and gas permeability were measured at different capillary pressures. The X-ray
computed tomography method and the 3DMA-Rock software package were applied to determine the average
pore coordination number z. Results showed that both saturation-dependent diffusion and permeability
of gas showed almost linear behavior at higher gas-filled porosities, while deviated substantially
from linear scaling at lower gas saturations. Comparing the theory with the diffusion and permeability
experiments showed that the determined value of z ranged between 2.8 and 5.3, not greatly different
from X-ray computed tomography results. The obtained results clearly indicate that the effect
of the pore-throat size distribution on gas diffusion and permeability was minimal in these sand
and glass bead packs.
