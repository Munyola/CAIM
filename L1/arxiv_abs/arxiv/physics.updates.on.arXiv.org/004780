The time dependent master equation from the seminal article by Ragazzini, Randall and Russell [J.
R. Ragazzini, R. H. Randall and F. A. Russell, "Analysis of Problems in Dynamics by Electronic Circuits",
Proc. of the I.R.E., Vol. 35, pp. 11--19, (1947)] is recovered as necessary tool for the analysis
of contemporary circuits with operational amplifiers. This equation gives the relation between
time dependent the output voltage $U_0(t)$ and the difference between the input voltages ($U_{+}(t)$
and $U_{-}(t)$). The crossover frequency $f_0$ is represented the time constant $\tau_{_0}$ of
this equation. The work of the master equation is illustrated by two typical examples: a) the stability
criterion of the devices with negative impedance converters, which we consider as a new result b)
the frequency dependence of the amplifiers with operational amplifiers given in the technical
specifications without citations of time dependent equation. A simple circuit for determination
of $f_0$ is suggested and the method is illustrated by determination of crossover frequency for
the low-noise and high speed ADA4898 operational amplifier. It is concluded that for an exact calculation
of the pass bandwidth of amplifiers with active filters the 70 years old master equation is a useful
technique implicitly included in the contemporary software. The frequency dependent formulae
for the amplification coefficient of inverting and non-inverting amplifiers are given for the
case of non-zero conductivity between the inputs of the operational amplifiers.
