Chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS), the effect of helical molecules acting as room temperature
hard magnets that confer spin polarization to electrical current, is an intriguing effect with
potential applications in nanospintronics. In this scenario, molecules that are paramagnetic
as well as helical would introduce a new degree of freedom in the same nano-scale device that has not
been explored so far. Here, in order to investigate this idea, we propose the preparation of self-assembled
monolayers (SAMs) based on a helical lanthanide binding tag peptide (LnLBTC) on a ferromagnetic
substrate. We confirmed room temperature spin filtering of LnLBTC SAMs by well-established electrochemical
approach and by direct local spin transport measurements in solid state devices. The latter were
studied by a common liquid-metal drop electron transport system, easily implemented for spin dependent
measurements. Electrochemistry shows an averaged spin polarization (SP) of ~5% in presence of
a saturation magnetic field (H = 350 mT) while local measurements performed in solid state showed
a SP of ~50 $\pm$ 20% thanks to the reduction of the contribution of pure electron transport in non-covered
areas. Calculations showed that conduction electrons interact strongly with the coordinated
lanthanide ion, meaning a fixed chirality-based spin filtering can coexist with a spin filtering
that is dependent on the polarization of the magnetic metal ion. This opens the door to all-organic
single-molecule memristive devices.
