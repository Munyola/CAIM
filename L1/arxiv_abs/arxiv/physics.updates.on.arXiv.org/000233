In recent years diode laser sources have become widespread and reliable tools in magneto-optical
spectroscopy. In particular, laser-driven atomic magnetometers have found a wide range of practical
applications. More recently, so-called magnetically silent variants of atomic magnetometers
have been developed. While in conventional magnetometers the magnetic resonance transitions
between atomic sublevels are phase-coherently driven by a weak oscillating magnetic field, silent
magnetometers use schemes in which either the frequency (FM) or the amplitude (AM) of the light beam
is modulated. Here we present a theoretical model that yields algebraic expressions for the parameters
of the multiple resonances that occur when either amplitude-, frequency- or polarization-modulated
light of circular polarization is used to drive the magnetic resonance transition in a transverse
magnetic field. The relative magnitudes of the resonances that are observed in the transmitted
light intensity at harmonic m of the Larmor frequency \omega_L (either by DC or phase sensitive detection
at harmonics q of the modulation frequency \omega_mod) of the transmitted light are expressed in
terms of the Fourier coefficients of the modulation function. Our approach is based on an atomic
multipole moment representation that is valid for spin-oriented atomic states with arbitrary
angular momentum F in the low light power limit. We find excellent quantitative agreement with an
experimental case study using (square-wave) amplitude-modulated (AM) light.
