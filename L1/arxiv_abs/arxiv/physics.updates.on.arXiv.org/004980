Protracted conflict is one of the largest human challenges that have persistently undermined economic
and social progress. In recent years, there has been increased emphasis on using statistical and
physical science models to better understand both the universal patterns and the underlying mechanics
of conflict. Whilst macroscopic power-law fractal patterns have been shown for death-toll in wars
and self-excitation models have been shown for roadside ambush attacks, very few works deal with
the challenge of complex dynamics between gangs at the intra-city scale. Here, based on contributions
to the historical memory of the conflict in Colombia, Medellin's gang-confrontation-network
is presented. It is shown that socio-economic and violence indexes are moderate to highly correlated
to the structure of the network. Specifically, the death-toll of conflict is strongly influenced
by the leading eigenvalues of the gangs' conflict adjacency matrix, which serves a proxy for unstable
self-excitation from revenge attacks. The distribution of links based on the geographic distance
between gangs in confrontation leads to the confirmation that territorial control is a main catalyst
of violence and retaliation among gangs. Additionally, the Boltzmann-Lotka-Volterra (BLV) dynamic
interaction network analysis is applied to quantify the spatial embeddedness of the dynamic relationship
between conflicting gangs in Medellin, results suggest that more involved and comprehensive models
are needed to described the dynamics of Medellin's armed conflict.
