Mapping of magnetic field lines is important for studies of the solar wind and the sources and propagation
of energetic particles between the Sun and observers. A recently developed mapping approach is
generalised to use a more advanced solar wind model that includes the effects of solar wind acceleration,
non-radial intrinsic magnetic fields and flows at the source surface/inner boundary, and conservation
of angular momentum. The field lines are mapped by stepping along local magnetic field $\bm{B}$
and via a Runge-Kutta algorithm, leading to essentially identical maps. The new model's maps for
Carrington rotation CR 1895 near solar minimum (19 April to 15 May 1995) and a solar rotation between
CR 2145 and CR 2146 near solar maximum (14 January to 9 February 2014) are compared with the published
maps for a constant solar wind model. The two maps are very similar on a large scale near both solar
minimum and solar maximum, meaning that the field line orientations, winding angles, and connectivity
generally agree very well. However, close inspection shows that the field lines have notable small-scale
structural differences. An interpretation is that inclusion of the acceleration and intrinsic
azimuthal velocity has significant effects on the local structure of the magnetic field lines.
Interestingly, the field lines are more azimuthal for the accelerating solar wind model for both
intervals. In addition, predictions for the pitch angle distributions (PADs) for suprathermal
electrons agree at the $90$ -- $95\%$ level with observations for both solar wind models for both
intervals.
