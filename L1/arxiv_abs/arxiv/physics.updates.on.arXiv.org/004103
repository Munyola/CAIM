Experiments are conducted in a laboratory flume on the propagation of a surface wave against unidirectional
flow with a sediment bed. This paper presents the spatial variation of bed forms induced by the wave-blocking
phenomenon by a suitably tuned uniform fluid flow and a counter-propagating wave. The occurrence
of wave-blocking is confirmed by finding a critical wave frequency in a particular flow discharge
in which the waves are effectively blocked and is established using the linear dispersion relation.
The novelty of this work is to identify the wave-blocking and its influence on the development of
bed forms over the sediment bed. Interesting bed form signatures are observed at a transition of
bed forms in three zones, with asymmetric ripples having a steeper slope downstream face induced
by the incoming current, followed by flat sand bars beneath the wave-blocking zone and more symmetric
ripples below the wave-dominated region at the downstream. This phenomenon suggests that the sediment
bed is segmented into three different regions of bed geometry along the flow. The deviations of mean
flows, Reynolds stresses, turbulent kinetic energy, and power spectral density due to the wave-blocking
phenomenon are presented along the non-uniform flow over sediment bed. The bottom shear stress,
bed roughness and stochastic nature of the bed form features are also discussed. The results are
of relevance to engineers and geoscientists concerned with contemporary process as well as those
interested in the interpretation of palaeoenvironmental conditions from fossil bed forms.
