We perform direct numerical simulations of wall sheared Rayleigh-B\'enard (RB) convection for
Rayleigh numbers up to $Ra=10^8$, Prandtl number unity, and wall Reynolds numbers up to $Re_w=10000$.
Using the Monin-Obukhov length $L$ we identify three different flow states, a buoyancy dominated
regime ($L \lesssim \lambda_{\theta}$; with $\lambda_{\theta}$ the thermal boundary layer thickness),
a transitional regime ($0.5H \gtrsim L \gtrsim \lambda_{\theta}$; with $H$ the height of the domain),
and a shear dominated regime ($L\gtrsim 0.5H$). In the buoyancy dominated regime the flow dynamics
are similar to that of turbulent thermal convection. The transitional regime is characterized
by rolls that are increasingly elongated with increasing shear. The flow in the shear dominated
regime consists of very large-scale meandering rolls, similar to the ones found in conventional
Couette flow. As a consequence of these different flow regimes, for fixed $Ra$ and with increasing
shear, the heat transfer first decreases, due to the breakup of the thermal rolls, and then increases
at the beginning of the shear dominated regime. For $L \gtrsim 0.5H$ the Nusselt number $Nu$ effectively
scales as $Nu \sim Ra^{\alpha}$, with $\alpha \ll 1/3$ while we find $\alpha \simeq 0.31$ in the buoyancy
dominated regime. In the transitional regime the effective scaling exponent is $\alpha > 1/3$,
but the temperature and velocity profiles in this regime are not logarithmic yet, thus indicating
transient dynamics and not the ultimate regime of thermal convection.
