Future long baseline neutrino experiments such as the DUNE experiment under construction at Fermilab
will perform precision measurements of neutrino oscillations, including the potential for the
discovery of CP violation in the lepton sector. These measurements require an understanding of
the unoscillated neutrino beam with unprecedented accuracy. This will be provided by complex near
detectors which consist of different subsystems including tracking elements and electromagnetic
calorimetry. A high granularity in the calorimeter, provided by scintillator tiles with SiPM readout
as used in the CALICE analog hadron calorimeter, provides the capability for direction reconstruction
of photon showers, which can be used to determine the decay positions of neutral pions. This can enable
the association of neutral pions to neutrino interactions in the tracker volume, improving the
event reconstruction of the near detector. Beyond photon and electron reconstruction, the calorimeter
also provides sensitivity to neutrons. In this presentation, we will discuss a simulation study
exploring the potential of high granularity for the electromagnetic calorimeter of the DUNE near
detector. Particular emphasis will be placed on the combination with a high pressure TPC as tracking
detector, which puts particularly stringent requirements on the calorimeter. The dependence
of the projected detector performance on granularity, absorber material and absorber thickness
as well as geometric arrangement satisfying the constraints of the TPC are explored.
