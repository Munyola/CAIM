Multiple sclerosis is a neurological disorder in which the myelin sheaths of axons are damaged by
the immune response. We report here a three-dimensional structural analysis of brain and spinal
cord tissues of a mouse model of multiple sclerosis, known as experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis
(EAE). EAE-induced mice were raised with or without administration of fingolimod, which is used
in the treatment of multiple sclerosis. Brains and spinal cords dissected from the EAE mice were
lyophilized so as to reconstitute the intrinsic contrast of tissue elements, such as axons, in X-ray
images. Three-dimensional structures of the brain hemispheres and spinal cords of the EAE mice
were visualized with synchrotron radiation microtomography. Microtomographic cross sections
reconstructed from the X-ray images revealed dilation of capillary vessels and vacuolation in
the spinal cord of the EAE mice. Vacuolation was also observed in the cerebellum, suggesting that
the neuroinflammatory response progressed in the brain. The vessel networks and vacuolation lesions
in the spinal cords were modelled by automatically tracing the three-dimensional image in order
to analyze the tissue structures quantitatively. The results of the analysis indicated that the
distribution of vacuolations was not uniform but three-dimensionally localized. The mean vessel
diameter showed a linear correlation with the clinical score, indicating that vasodilation is
relevant to paralysis severity in the disease model. We suggest that vasodilation and vacuolation
are related with neurological symptoms of multiple sclerosis.
