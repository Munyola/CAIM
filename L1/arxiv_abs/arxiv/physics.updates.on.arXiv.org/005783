Massively parallel computer architectures create new opportunities for the performance of long-timescale
molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Here, we introduce the path-accelerated molecular dynamics
(PAMD) method that takes advantage of distributed computing to reduce the wall-clock time of MD
simulation via parallelization with respect to MD timesteps. The marginal distribution for the
time evolution of a system is expressed in terms of a path integral, enabling the use of path sampling
techniques to numerically integrate MD trajectories. By parallelizing the evaluation of the path
action with respect to time and by initializing the path configurations from a non-equilibrium
distribution, the algorithm enables significant speedups in terms of the length of MD trajectories
that can be integrated in a given amount of wall-clock time. The method is demonstrated for Brownian
dynamics, although it is generalizable to other stochastic equations of motion including open
systems. We apply the method to two simple systems, a harmonic oscillator and a Lennard-Jones liquid,
and we show that in comparison to the conventional Euler integration scheme for Brownian dynamics,
the new method can reduce the wall-clock time for integrating trajectories of a given length by more
than three orders of magnitude in the former system and more than two in the latter. This new method
for parallelizing MD in the dimension of time can be trivially combined with algorithms for parallelizing
the MD force evaluation to achieve further speedup.
