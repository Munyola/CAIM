The Displacement per Atom (DPA) rate is conventionally computed with DPA cross sections in reactor
applications. The method of direct calculation with energy-angular distributions given in the
Center of Mass (CM) frame is proposed and recommended in the present work. The methods for refining
and verifying the calculations of DPA cross sections are proposed: (i) Gauss-Legendre-Quadrature-based
Piecewise Integration (GLQPI) for ensuring the numeric convergence of integral over emission
angle due to the discontinuity of integrand; (ii) verification of the convergence for trapezoidal
integration over the secondary energy; (iii) interpolation of double-differential cross sections.
For 56Fe of JEFF-3.1.1, the current numeric integration over emission angle is shown not convergent,
whereas the direct trapezoidal over the secondary energy and the direct interpolation of energy-angle-integrated
damage are shown accurate. On the other hand, it is shown that the DPA cross sections are overestimated
if isotropic angular distributions are assumed. However, the DPA cross section is not sensitive
to the high-order Legendre polynomials because the former is an angle-integrated quantity. Numerical
results of neutron elastic scattering show that 2 orders of Legendre polynomials can give the DPA
rates of 56Fe within 0.5% overestimation for fission reactors, while 4 orders are required for fusion
reactors. For neutron inelastic scatterings-induced DPA, the first order Legendre polynomial
is sufficient for both fission and fusion reactors.
