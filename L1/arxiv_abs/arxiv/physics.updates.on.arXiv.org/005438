DNA surface-hybridization biosensors utilize the selective hybridization of target sequences
in solution to surface-immobilized probes. In this process, the target is usually assumed to be
in excess, so that its concentration does not significantly vary while hybridizing to the surface-bound
probes. If the target is initially at low concentrations and/or if the number of probes is very large
and have high affinity for the target, the DNA in solution may get depleted. In this paper we analyze
the equilibrium and kinetics of hybridization of DNA biosensors in the case of strong target depletion,
by extending the Langmuir adsorption model. We focus, in particular, on the detection of a small
amount of a single-nucleotide "mutant" sequence (concentration $c_2$) in a solution with an abundant
"wild-type" sequence (concentration $c_1 \gg c_2$). We show that depletion can give rise to a strongly-enhanced
sensitivity of the biosensors. Using representative values of rate constants and hybridization
free energies, we find that in the depletion regime one could detect relative concentrations $c_2/c_1$
that are up to three orders of magnitude smaller than in the conventional approach. The kinetics
is surprisingly rich, and exhibits a non-monotonic adsorption with no counterpart in the no-depletion
case. Finally, we show that, alongside enhanced detection sensitivity, this approach offers the
possibility of sample enrichment, by substantially increasing the relative amount of the mutant
over the wild-type sequence.
