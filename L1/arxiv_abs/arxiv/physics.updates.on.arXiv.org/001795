The US Supreme Court throughout the 20th century has been characterized as being divided between
liberal and conservative wings, suggesting that justices with similar ideologies would have voted
similarly had they overlapped in tenure. What if they had? We build a quantitative voting model of
this counterfactual hypothesis using pairwise maximum entropy to infer how 36 justices from 1946-2016
would have all voted on a Super Supreme Court. As with historical courts, the Super Court is dominated
by consensus. The rate at which consensus decays as more justices are included is extremely slow,
nearly 100 years, and indicates the modern Supreme Court is an extremely conservative, stable institution.
Beyond consensus, we discover a rich structure of dissenting blocs that are distributed along a
heavy-tailed Zipf's law. The heavy tail means that there are no dominant dissenting modes, and thus
Supreme Court voting over time cannot be captured by a low-dimensional representation like ideology.
Focusing on individuals, we find idiosyncratic justices who dissent alone unusually often and
might be considered mavericks in the history of the Court. When we group cases by legal topic, information
about the topic is encoded in the structure of dissenting blocs such that intuitively similar topics
correspond to similar patterns of dissent. Despite the simplicity of the model, it aligns with previous
observations of the Court while expressing the complex structure of political voting through the
language of statistical physics.
