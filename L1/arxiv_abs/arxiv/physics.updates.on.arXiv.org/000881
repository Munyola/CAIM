The spread of tick-borne pathogens represents an important threat to human and animal health in
many parts of Eurasia. Here, we analysed a 9-year time series of Ixodes ricinus ticks feeding on Apodemus
flavicollis mice (main reservoir-competent host for tick-borne encephalitis, TBE) sampled in
Trentino (Northern Italy). The tail of the distribution of the number of ticks per host was fitted
by three theoretical distributions: Negative Binomial (NB), Poisson-LogNormal (PoiLN), and
Power-Law (PL). The fit with theoretical distributions indicated that the tail of the tick infestation
pattern on mice is better described by the PL distribution. Moreover, we found that the tail of the
distribution significantly changes with seasonal variations in host abundance. In order to investigate
the effect of different tails of tick distribution on the invasion of a non-systemically transmitted
pathogen, we simulated the transmission of a TBE-like virus between susceptible and infective
ticks using a stochastic model. Model simulations indicated different outcomes of disease spreading
when considering different distribution laws of ticks among hosts. Specifically, we found that
the epidemic threshold and the prevalence equilibria obtained in epidemiological simulations
with PL distribution are a good approximation of those observed in simulations feed by the empirical
distribution. Moreover, we also found that the epidemic threshold for disease invasion was lower
when considering the seasonal variation of tick aggregation.
