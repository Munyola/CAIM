The study of the critical dynamics in complex systems is always interesting yet challenging. Here,
we choose financial market as an example of a complex system, and do a comparative analyses of two
stock markets - the S&P 500 (USA) and Nikkei 225 (JPN). Our analyses are based on the evolution of crosscorrelation
structure patterns of short time-epochs for a 32-year period (1985-2016). We identify "market
states" as clusters of similar correlation structures, which occur more frequently than by pure
chance (randomness). The dynamical transitions between the correlation structures reflect the
evolution of the market states. Power mapping method from the random matrix theory is used to suppress
the noise on correlation patterns, and an adaptation of the intra-cluster distance method is used
to obtain the "optimum" number of market states. We find that the USA is characterized by four market
states and JPN by five. We further analyze the co-occurrence of paired market states; the probability
of remaining in the same state is much higher than the transition to a different state. The transitions
to other states mainly occur among the immediately adjacent states, with a few rare intermittent
transitions to the remote states. The state adjacent to the critical state (market crash) may serve
as an indicator or a "precursor" for the critical state and this novel method of identifying the long-term
precursors may be very helpful for constructing the early warning system in financial markets,
as well as in other complex systems.
