With the advent of optical clocks featuring fractional frequency uncertainties on the order of
$10^{-17}$ and below, new applications such as chronometric levelling with few-cm height resolution
emerge. We are developing a transportable optical clock based on a single trapped aluminium ion,
which is interrogated via quantum logic spectroscopy. We employ singly-charged calcium as the
logic ion for sympathetic cooling, state preparation and readout. Here we present a simple and compact
physics and laser package for manipulation of $^{40}\mathrm{Ca}^+$. Important features are a
segmented multi-layer trap with separate loading and probing zones, a compact titanium vacuum
chamber, a near-diffraction-limited imaging system with high numerical aperture based on a single
biaspheric lens, and an all-in-fiber \ca repump laser system. We present preliminary estimates
of the trap-induced frequency shifts on $^{27}\mathrm{Al}^+$, derived from measurements with
a single calcium ion. The micromotion-induced second-order Doppler shift for $^{27}\mathrm{Al}^+$
has been determined to be $\frac{\delta\nu_\mathrm{EMM}}{\nu}=\left({-0.4}^{+{0.4}}_{-{0.3}}\right)\times10^{-18}$
and the black-body radiation shift is $\delta\nu_\mathrm{BBR}/\nu=(-4.0\pm0.4)\times10^{-18}$.
Moreover, heating rates of less than 10 quanta per second have been measured for all three motional
modes at trap frequencies of $\omega_\mathrm{rad,Ca+} \approx2\pi\times2.5\,\mathrm{MHz}$
($\omega_\mathrm{ax,Ca+} \approx2\pi\times1.5\,\mathrm{MHz}$) in radial (axial) direction,
enabling interrogation times of 100s of milliseconds.
