We present an analysis of the impact of automated accounts, or bots, on opinions in a social network.
We model the opinions using a variant of the famous DeGroot model, which connects opinions with network
structure. We find a strong correlation between opinions based on this network model and based on
the tweets of Twitter users discussing the 2016 U.S. presidential election between Hillary Clinton
and Donald Trump, providing evidence supporting the validity of the model. We then utilize the network
model to predict what the opinions would have been if the network did not contain any bots which may
be trying to manipulate opinions. Using a bot detection algorithm, we identify bot accounts which
comprise less than 1% of the network. By analyzing the bot posts, we find that there are twice as many
bots supporting Donald Trump as there are supporting Hillary Clinton. We remove the bots from the
network and recalculate the opinions using the network model. We find that the bots produce a significant
shift in the opinions, with the Clinton bots producing almost twice as large a change as the Trump
bots, despite being fewer in number. Analysis of the bot behavior reveals that the large shift is
due to the fact that the bots post one hundred times more frequently than humans. The asymmetry in
the opinion shift is due to the fact that the Clinton bots post 50% more frequently than the Trump bots.
Our results suggest a small number of highly active bots in a social network can have a disproportionate
impact on opinions.
