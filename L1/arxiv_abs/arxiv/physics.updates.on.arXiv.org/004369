The propagation of electromagnetic surface waves guided by the planar interface of two isotropic
chiral materials, namely materials $\calA$ and $\calB$, was investigated by numerically solving
the associated canonical boundary-value problem. Isotropic chiral material $\calB$ was modeled
as a homogenized composite material, arising from the homogenization of an isotropic chiral component
material and an isotropic achiral, nonmagnetic, component material characterized by the relative
permittivity $\eps_a^\calB$. Changes in the nature of the surface waves were explored as the volume
fraction $f_a^\calB$ of the achiral component material varied. Surface waves are supported only
for certain ranges of $f_a^\calB$; within these ranges only one surface wave, characterized by
its relative wavenumber $q$, is supported at each value of $f_a^\calB$. For $\mbox{Re} \lec \eps_a^\calB
\ric > 0 $, as $\left| \mbox{Im} \lec \eps_a^\calB \ric \right|$ increases surface waves are supported
for larger ranges of $f_a^\calB$ and $\left| \mbox{Im} \lec q \ric \right|$ for these surface waves
increases. For $\mbox{Re} \lec \eps_a^\calB \ric < 0 $, as $ \mbox{Im} \lec \eps_a^\calB \ric $ increases
the ranges of $f_a^\calB$ that support surface-wave propagation are almost unchanged but $ \mbox{Im}
\lec q \ric $ for these surface waves decreases. The surface waves supported when $\mbox{Re} \lec
\eps_a^\calB \ric < 0 $ may be regarded as akin to surface-plasmon-polariton waves, but those supported
for when $\mbox{Re} \lec \eps_a^\calB \ric > 0 $ may not.
