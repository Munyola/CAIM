The interdiffusion coefficients are estimated either following the Wagner's method expressed
with respect to the composition (mol or atomic fraction) normalized variable after considering
the molar volume variation or the den Broeder's method expressed with respect to the concentration
(composition divided by the molar volume) normalized variable. On the other hand, the relations
for estimation of the intrinsic diffusion coefficients of components as established by van Loo
and integrated diffusion coefficients in a phase with narrow homogeneity range as established
by Wagner are currently available with respect to the composition normalized variable only. In
this study, we have first derived the relation proposed by den Broeder following the line of treatment
proposed by Wagner. Further, the relations for estimation of the intrinsic diffusion coefficients
of the components and integrated interdiffusion coefficient are established with respect to the
concentration normalized variable, which were not available earlier. The veracity of these methods
is examined based on the estimation of data in Ni-Pd, Ni-Al and Cu-Sn systems. Our analysis indicates
that both the approaches are logically correct and there is small difference in the estimated data
in these systems although a higher difference could be found in other systems. The integrated interdiffusion
coefficients with respect to the concentration (or concentration normalized variable) can only
be estimated considering the ideal molar volume variation. This might be drawback in certain practical
systems.
