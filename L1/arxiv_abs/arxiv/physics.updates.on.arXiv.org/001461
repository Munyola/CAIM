Advances in techniques for monitoring pH in complex fluids could have significant impact on analytical
and biomedical applications ranging from water quality assessment to in vivo diagnostics. We developed
flexible graphene microelectrodes (GEs) for rapid (< 5 seconds), very low power (femtowatt) detection
of the pH of complex biofluids. The method is based on real-time measurement of Faradaic charge transfer
between the GE and a solution at zero electrical bias. For an idealized sample of phosphate buffer
solution (PBS), the Faradaic current varied monotonically and systematically with the pH with
resolution of ~0.2 pH unit. The current-pH dependence was well described by a hybrid analytical-computational
model where the electric double layer derives from an intrinsic, pH-independent (positive) charge
associated with the graphene-water interface and ionizable (negative) charged groups described
by the Langmuir-Freundlich adsorption isotherm. We also tested the GEs in more complex bio-solutions.
In the case of a ferritin solution, the relative Faradaic current, defined as the difference between
the measured current response and a baseline response due to PBS, showed a strong signal associated
with the disassembly of the ferritin and the release of ferric ions at pH ~ 2.0. For samples of human
serum, the Faradaic current showed a reproducible rapid (<20s) response to pH. By combining the
Faradaic current and real time current variation, the methodology is potentially suitable for
use to detect tumor-induced changes in extracellular pH.
