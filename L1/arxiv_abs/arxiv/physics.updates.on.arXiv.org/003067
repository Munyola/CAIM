This study combines a one-dimensional (1D) model with micro-CT imaging and hemodynamic data to
quantify uncertainty of flow and pressure predictions in the pulmonary arteries in a control and
hypoxia induced hypertensive mouse. We use local and global sensitivity and correlation analysis
to determine parameters that can be inferred from the model and available data. Least squares optimization
is used to estimate mouse specific parameters, and Bayesian as well as asymptotic uncertainty quantification
techniques are employed to determine confidence, credible, and prediction intervals for the model
parameters and response. These techniques are used to examine the effects of network size and to
understand how parameters change with disease (hypertension). Results showed that the peripheral
vascular resistance is the most sensitive, and as the network size increases the parameter behavior
changes. Correlation analysis revealed that in hypertension large vessel stiffness is correlated
with proximal resistance in the boundary. We were able to estimate identifiable parameters using
both deterministic and Bayesian techniques (the maxima of the parameter distributions determined
using Bayesian analysis aligned with local optima). From these estimates we determined confidence
and prediction intervals, which all were within physiological expectation. Analysis of estimated
parameter values for the representative mice studied here showed that the hypertensive mouse has
stiffer (but larger) vessels and that compliance is decreased both in the proximal and peripheral
vasculature.
