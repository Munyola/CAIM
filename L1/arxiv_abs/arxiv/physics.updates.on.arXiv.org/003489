The current study investigates the long-age wake behind rotating helicopter hub models composed
of geometrically simple, canonical bluff body shapes. The models consisted of a 4-arm rotor mounted
on a shaft above a 2-arm (scissor) rotor with all the rotor arms having a rectangular cross section.
The relative phase between the 2- and 4-arm rotors was either $0\deg$ (in-phase) or $45\deg$ (out-of-phase).
The rotors were oriented at zero angle-of-attack and rotated at 30 Hz. Their wakes were measured
with particle-image-velocimetry within a water tunnel at a hub diameter based Reynolds number
of $820,000$ and an advance ratio of $0.2$. Mean profiles, fluctuating profiles and spectral analysis
using time-series analysis as well as dynamic mode decomposition were used to characterize the
wake and identify coherent structures associated with specific frequency content. The canonical
geometry produced coherent structures that were consistent with previous results using more complex
geometries. It was shown that the dominant structures (2 and 4 times per hub revolution) decay slowly
and were not sensitive to the relative phase between the rotors. Conversely, the next strongest
structure (6 times per hub revolution) was sensitive to the relative phase with almost no coherence
observed for the in-phase model. This is strong evidence that the 6 per revolution content is a nonlinear
interaction between the 2 and 4 revolution structures. This study demonstrates that the far wake
region is dominated by the main rotor arms wake, the scissor rotor wake and interactions between
these two features.
