We describe one-dimensional stationary scattering of a two-component wave field by a non-Hermitian
matrix potential which features odd-$PT$ symmetry, i.e., symmetry with $(PT)^2=-1$. The scattering
is characterized by a $4\times 4$ transfer matrix. The main attention is focused on spectral singularities
which are classified into two types. Weak spectral singularities are characterized by zero determinant
of a diagonal $2\times 2$ block of the transfer matrix. This situation corresponds to the lasing
or coherent perfect absorption of pairs of oppositely polarized modes. Strong spectral singularities
are characterized by zero diagonal block of the transfer matrix. We show that in odd-$PT$-symmetric
systems any spectral singularity is self-dual, i.e., lasing and coherent perfect absorption occur
simultaneously. Detailed analysis is performed for a case example of a $PT$-symmetric coupler
consisting of two waveguides, one with localized gain and another with localized absorption, which
are coupled by a localized antisymmetric medium. For this coupler, we discuss weak self-dual spectral
singularities and their splitting into complex-conjugate eigenvalues which represent bound
states characterized by propagation constants with real parts lying in the continuum. A rather
counterintuitive restoration of the unbroken odd-$PT$-symmetric phase subject to the increase
of the gain-and-loss strength is also revealed. The comparison between odd- and even-$PT-$symmetric
couplers, the latter characterized by $(PT)^2=1$, is also presented.
