Introduction: Stenotic aortic valve disease (AS) causes pressure overload of the left ventricle
(LV) that may trigger adverse remodeling and precipitate progression towards heart failure (HF).
As myocardial energetics can be impaired during AS, LV wall stresses and biomechanical power provide
a complementary view of LV performance that may aide in better assessing the state of disease. Objectives:
Using a high-resolution electro-mechanical (EM) in silico model of the LV as a reference, we evaluated
clinically feasible Laplace-based methods for assessing global LV wall stresses and biomechanical
power. Methods: We used N = 4 in silico finite element (FE) EM models of LV and aorta of patients suffering
from AS. All models were personalized with clinical data under pre-treatment conditions. LV wall
stresses and biomechanical power were computed accurately from FE kinematic data and compared
to Laplace-based estimation methods which were applied to the same FE model data. Results and Conclusion:
Laplace estimates of LV wall stress are able to provide a rough approximation of global mean stress
in the circumferential-longitudinal plane of the LV. However, according to FE results spatial
heterogeneity of stresses in the LV wall is significant, leading to major discrepancies between
local stresses and global mean stress. Assessment of mechanical power with Laplace methods is feasible,
but these are inferior in accuracy compared to FE models. The accurate assessment of stress and power
density distribution in the LV wall is only feasible based on patient-specific FE modeling.
