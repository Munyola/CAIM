We investigate the prospects for micron-scale acoustic wave components and circuits on chip in
solid planar structures that do not require suspension. We leverage evanescent guiding of acoustic
waves by high slowness contrast materials readily available in silicon complementary metal-oxide
semiconductor (CMOS) processes. High slowness contrast provides strong confinement of GHz frequency
acoustic fields in micron-scale structures. We address the fundamental implications of intrinsic
material and radiation losses on operating frequency, bandwidth, device size and as a result practicality
of multi-element microphononic circuits based on solid embedded waveguides. We show that a family
of acoustic components based on evanescently guided acoustic waves, including waveguide bends,
evanescent couplers, Y-splitters, and acoustic-wave microring resonators, can be realized in
compact, micron-scale structures, and provide basic scaling and performance arguments for these
components based on material properties and simulations. We further find that wave propagation
losses are expected to permit high quality factor (Q), narrowband resonators and propagation lengths
allowing delay lines and the coupling or cascading of multiple components to form functional circuits,
of potential utility in guided acoustic signal processing on chip. We also address and simulate
bends and radiation loss, providing insight into routing and resonators. Such circuits could be
monolithically integrated with electronic and photonic circuits on a single chip with expanded
capabilities.
