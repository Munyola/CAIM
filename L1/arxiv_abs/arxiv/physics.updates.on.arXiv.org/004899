Previous studies indicate that interplanetary small magnetic flux ropes (SMFRs) are manifestations
of microflare-associated small coronal mass ejections (CMEs), and the hot material with high charge
states heated by related microflares are found in SMFRs. Ordinary CMEs are frequently associated
with prominence eruptions,and cool prominencematerialsare found within some magnetic clouds
(MCs). Therefore, the predicted small CMEs may also be frequently associated with small prominence
eruptions. In this work, we aim to search for cool prominence materials within SMFRs.We examined
all the O5+ and Fe6+ fraction data obtained by the Advanced Composition Explorer spacecraft during
1998 to 2008 and found that 13 SMFRs might exhibit low-charge-state signatures of unusual O5+and/or
Fe6+abundances.One of the 13 SMFRs also exhibited signatures of high ionic charge states. We also
reported a SMFR with highFe6+ fraction, but the values of Fe6+is a little lower than the threshold
defining unusualFe6+.However, the SDO/AIA observations confirmed that the progenitor CME of
this SMFR is associated with a small eruptive prominence, and the observations also supported the
prominence materials were embedded in the CME.These observations are at the edge of the capabilities
of ACE/SWICS and it cannot be ruled out that they are solely caused by instrumental effects. If these
observations are real, they provide new evidence for the conjecture that SMFRs are small-scale
MCs but also imply that the connected small CMEs could be associated with flares and prominence eruptions.
