We investigate the computational performance of various numerical methods for the integration
of the equations of motion and the variational equations for some typical classical many-body models
of condensed matter physics: the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou (FPUT) chain and the one- and two-dimensional
disordered, discrete nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations (DDNLS). In our analysis we consider
methods based on Taylor series expansion, Runge-Kutta discretization and symplectic transformations.
The latter have the ability to exactly preserve the symplectic structure of Hamiltonian systems,
which results in keeping bounded the error of the system's computed total energy. We perform extensive
numerical simulations for several initial conditions of the studied models and compare the numerical
efficiency of the used integrators by testing their ability to accurately reproduce characteristics
of the systems' dynamics and quantify their chaoticity through the computation of the maximum Lyapunov
exponent. We also report the expressions of the implemented symplectic schemes and provide the
explicit forms of the used differential operators. Among the tested numerical schemes the symplectic
integrators $ABA864$ and $SRKN^a_{14}$ exhibit the best performance, respectively for moderate
and high accuracy levels in the case of the FPUT chain, while for the DDNLS models $s9\mathcal{ABC}6$
and $s11\mathcal{ABC}6$ (moderate accuracy), along with $s17\mathcal{ABC}8$ and $s19\mathcal{ABC}8$
(high accuracy) proved to be the most efficient schemes.
