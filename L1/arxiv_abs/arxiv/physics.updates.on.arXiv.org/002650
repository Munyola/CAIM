Protracted conflict is one of the largest human challenges that have persistently undermined economic
and social progress.In recent years, there has been increased emphasis on using statistical and
physical science models to better understand both the universal patterns and the underlying mechanics
of conflict. Whilst macroscopic power-law fractal patterns have been shown for death-toll in wars
and self-excitation models have been shown for roadside ambush attacks, very few works deal with
the challenge of complex dynamics between gangs at the intra-city scale. Here, the Boltzmann-Lotka-Volterra
dynamic interaction network analysis is applied to quantify the spatial embeddedness of the dynamic
relationship between conflicting gangs in Medellin, Colombia over a 20-year timescale. The results
show that: (i) the spatial embeddedness of conflict remains largely constant across the period,
despite dramatic changes in both the urban structure and the socioeconomic landscape; and (ii)
the death-toll of conflict is strongly influenced by the leading eigenvalues of the gangs' conflict
adjacency matrix, which serves a proxy for unstable self-excitation from revenge attacks. Both
results lead to the conclusion that the main catalyst of violence and retaliation among gangs is
due to territorial control. Translating research into impact, we highlight both socioeconomic
measures to reduce the recruitment pool and military blockades at strategic urban junctions as
being the most effective measures to mitigate gang violence escalation.
