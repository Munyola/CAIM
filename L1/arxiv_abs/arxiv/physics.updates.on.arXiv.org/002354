The dynamical characteristics of electromagnetic fields include energy, momentum, angular momentum
(spin) and helicity. We analyze their spatial distributions near the planar interface between
two transparent and non-dispersive media, when the incident monochromatic plane wave with arbitrary
polarization is totally reflected, and an evanescent wave is formed in the medium with lower optical
density. Based on the recent arguments in favor of the Minkowski definition of the electromagnetic
momentum in a material medium [Phys. Rev. A 83, 013823 (2011); 86, 055802 (2012); Phys. Rev. Lett.
119, 073901 (2017)], we derive the explicit expressions for the dynamical characteristics in both
media, with special attention to their behavior at the interface. Especially, the "extraordinary"
spin and momentum components orthogonal to the plane of incidence are described, and the canonical
(spin - orbital) momentum decomposition is performed that contains no singular terms. The field
energy, helicity, the spin momentum and orbital momentum components are everywhere regular but
experience discontinuities at the interface; the spin components parallel to the interface appear
to be continuous, which testifies for the consistency of the adopted Minkowski picture. The results
supply a meaningful example of the electromagnetic momentum decomposition, with separation of
spatial and polarization degrees of freedom, in inhomogeneous media, and can be used in engineering
the structured fields designed for optical sorting, dispatching and micromanipulation.
