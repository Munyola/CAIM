The electron beam-plasma system is ubiquitous in the space plasma environment. Here, using a Darwin
particle-in-cell method, the excitation of electrostatic and whistler instabilities by a gyrating
electron beam is studied in support of recent laboratory experiments. It is assumed that the total
plasma frequency $\omega_{pe}$ is larger than the electron cyclotron frequency $\Omega_e$. The
fast-growing electrostatic beam-mode waves saturate in a few plasma oscillations by slowing down
and relaxing the electron beam parallel to the background magnetic field. Upon their saturation,
the finite amplitude electrostatic beam-mode waves can resonate with the tail of the background
thermal electrons and accelerate them to the beam parallel velocity. The slower-growing whistler
waves are excited in primarily two resonance modes: (a) through Landau resonance due to the inverted
slope of the beam electrons in the parallel velocity; (b) through cyclotron resonance by scattering
electrons to both lower pitch angles and smaller energies. It is demonstrated that, for a field-aligned
beam, the whistler instability can be suppressed by the electrostatic instability due to a faster
energy transfer rate between beam electrons and the electrostatic waves. Such a competition of
growth between whistler and electrostatic waves depends on the ratio of $\omega_{pe}/\Omega_e$.
In terms of wave propagation, beam-generated electrostatic waves are confined to the beam region
whereas beam-generated whistler waves transport energy away from the beam.
