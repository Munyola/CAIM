(Please refer to arXiv:1810.08050, which has completely different aims but contains all the main
contents of this paper) In this work, we propose to access the information of criticality and excitations
of one-dimensional quantum systems by a matrix product state (MPS) defined in the (imaginary) time
direction. This state, dubbed as time MPS (tMPS), is a boundary state of tensor network (TN) that
represents the ground-state simulation after Trotter-Suzuki decomposition. We show that the
tMPS exhibits the structure of the continuous MPS originally proposed for the field theories. The
information of excitations, e.g., dynamic correlation length and energy gap, can be accurately
calculated from the tMPS. The non-universal renormalization of velocity of the excitations is
given by a ratio between the correlations of the ground state and the tMPS. When the system is at the
quantum critical point, the tMPS is found to show the logarithmic scaling law, where the scaling
coefficient gives the central charge that characterizes the criticality of the theory. Our work
also implies that the spectra of the transfer matrices defined by the ground state and tMPS provide
information of the low-lying masses of the theory in the continuous limit. This could help to understand
the role of the finiteness of the bond dimension as an infra red regulator. Furthermore, we show from
the perspective of methodology that, the tMPS emerges from a generalized TN ab-initio optimization
principle scheme, which unifies the infinite density matrix renormalization group and the infinite
time-evolving block decimation algorithms.
