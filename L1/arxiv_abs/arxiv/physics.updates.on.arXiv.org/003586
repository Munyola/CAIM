For increasingly rarefied flowfields, the Navier-Stokes (NS) equations lose accuracy partially
due to the single temperature approximation. To overcome this barrier, a continuum multi-temperature
model based on the Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook (BGK) equation coupled with the Landau-Teller-Jeans
relaxation model has been proposed for two-dimensional hypersonic non-equilibrium multi-temperature
flow computation. In recent study, a two-stage fourth-order gas-kinetic scheme (GKS) has been
developed for equilibrium flows, which achieves a fourth-order accuracy in space and time as well
as high efficiency and robustness. In this paper, targeting for accurate and efficient simulation
of multi-temperature non-equilibrium flows, a high-order three-dimensional multi-temperature
GKS is implemented under the two-stage fourth-order framework, with the fourth-order Simpson
interpolation rule for the newly emerged source term. Simulations on decaying homogeneous isotropic
turbulence, low-density nozzle flow, rarefied hypersonic flow over a flat plate, and type IV shock-shock
interaction are used to validate the multi-temperature model through the comparison with experimental
measurements. The unified gas kinetic scheme (UGKS) results, and the Direct simulation Monte Carlo
(DSMC) solutions will be used as well in some cases for validation. Computational results not only
confirm the high-order accuracy and quite robustness of this scheme, but also show the significant
improvement on computational efficiency compared with UGKS and DSMC, especially in the near continuum
flow regime.
