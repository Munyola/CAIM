The initiation and development of fractures in rocks is the key part of many problems from academic
to industrial, such as fracture network development, faulting, folding, rock mass characterization,
reservoir characterization, etc. Conventional ways of evaluating the fracture mechanical origin
and historical deformations depend on the geologists' visual interpretation of the indicating
structures such as offsets, plumose structures, fault striation and fault steps, and hence suffer
from problems like subjectivity and the absence of obvious indicating structures. In this study,
we propose a quantitative method to derive historical shear deformations of rock fractures based
on the analysis of effects of indicating structures on the shear strength parameter $\theta_{max}^*/C$
(Grasselli et al., 2002) (the three-dimensional description) of the fracture surface. This method
fit a model that combines effects of isotropic base shear strength and anisotropic shear deformations'
indicating structures to this shear strength parameter of the fracture. The amount of indicating
structures and their occurrences are estimated, and the historical shear deformations can be inferred.
The validity of the proposed method was proved by testing it on fracture surfaces with clear indicating
structures. The application of this method on an example outcrop shows two different deformation
patterns of rock mass with and without preexisting fractures and an intuitive idea of how the rock
mass was deformed, and hence demonstrate the effectiveness and high potential utility of the proposed
method.
