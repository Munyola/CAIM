The present work deals with the cosmological consequences of the variable cosmological term $\Lambda(a)=\Lambda_0
+ \Lambda_1 a^{-r} + \Lambda_2 a^{-s},$ where $a$ is the scale factor of the Robertson-Walker space-time.
The covariant conservation of the energy-momentum tensor, the intrinsic coupling parameter $\alpha$
which describe the interaction between the cosmological constant and non-relativistic matter/radiation
and the parameter ranges $3 <r<12/(4-\alpha),\Lambda_1<0$ and $4<s, 0<\Lambda_2$ leads to an
attractive density $\rho_{\text{dm}} \sim a^{-r}$ and a repulsive density $\rho_{\text{infl}}
\sim a^{-s}.$ The identification of the energy density of space-time expansion in an empty universe
with the zero-point density and a more accurate analysis of the parameter $\Lambda_1,r$ and $\alpha$
demonstrates that the scale discrepancy of the cosmological constant problem is avoided and that
the missing mass problem of dark matter is solved. As the consequence, the model under consideration
is compatible with observations of rotational curves of galaxies and with constraints from the
standard model of particle physics. Moreover, there exists a time $t_1$ such that the time before
that becomes imaginary. The adaption of $\Lambda_2$ and $s$ such that $t_1$ equals the Planck time
solves the flatness, the horizon and the magnetic-monopole problem without a hypothetical scalar
field, which avoids speculations about the origin of this field. These macroscopic conclusions
agree with the quantum arguments introduced by Hartle and Hawking.
