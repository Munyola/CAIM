Magneto-inductive (MI) Terahertz (THz) wireless channels provide significant theoretical performances
for MI communications (MIC) and wireless power transmission (WPT) in nanoscale networks. Energy
harvesting (EH) and signal generation are critical for autonomous operation in challenging medium
including biomedical channels. State of the art electromagnetic (EM) vibrational devices have
millimeter dimensions while targeting low frequency EH without any real-time communications.
In this article, graphene resonators are combined with single molecule magnets (SMMs) to realize
nanoscale EH, MIC and WPT with novel modulation methods achieving simultaneous wireless information
and PT (SWIPT). Unique advantages of graphene including atomic thickness, ultra-low weight, high
strain and resonance frequencies in the Kilohertz to Terahertz band are combined with high and stable
magnetic moments of Terbium(III) bis(phthalocyanine) SMMs. Numerical analyses provide tens
of nanowatts powers and efficiencies of $10^4 \, W/m^3$ in acoustic and ultrasound frequencies
comparable with vibrational EH devices while millimeter wave carrier generation is numerically
analyzed. Proposed model and communication theoretical analysis present a practical framework
for challenging applications in the near future by promising simple mechanical design. Applications
include nanoscale biomedical tagging including human cells, sensing and communication for diagnosis
and treatment, EH and modulation for autonomous nano-robotics, and magnetic particle imaging
(MPI).
