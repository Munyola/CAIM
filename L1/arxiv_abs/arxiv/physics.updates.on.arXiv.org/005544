The current climate change is calling for drastic reduction of energy demand as well as of greenhouse
gases. Besides this, cities also need to adapt to face the challenges related to climate change.
Cities, with their complex urban texture and fabric can be represented as a diverse ecosystem that
do not have a clear and defined boundary. Multiple tools that have been developed, in the recent years,
for assessment of urban climate, building energy demand, the outdoor thermal comfort and the energy
systems. In this review, we, however, noted that these tools often address only one or two of these
urban planning aspects. There is however an intricate link between them. For instance, the outdoor
comfort assessment has showed that there is a strong link between biometeorology and architecture
and urban climate. Additionally, to address the challenges of the energy transition, there will
be a convergence of the energy needs in the future with an energy nexus regrouping the energy demand
of urban areas. It is also highlighted that the uncertainty related to future climatic data makes
urban adaptation and mitigation strategies complex to implement and to design given the lack of
a comprehensive framework. We thus conclude by suggesting the need for a holistic interface to take
into account this multi-dimensional problem. With the help of such a platform a positive loop in
urban design can be initiated leading to the development of low carbon cities and/or with the use
of blue and green infrastructure to have a positive impact on the mitigation and adaptation strategies.
