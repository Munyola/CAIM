In this article, we first derive the wavevector- and frequency-dependent, microscopic current
response tensor which corresponds to the naive "macroscopic" ansatz $\vec D = \varepsilon_0 \varepsilon_{\mathrm{eff}}
\vec E$ and $\vec B = \mu_0 \mu_{\mathrm{eff}} \vec H$ with wavevector- and frequency-independent,
"effective" material constants $\varepsilon_{\mathrm{eff}}$ and $\mu_{\mathrm{eff}}$. We
then deduce the electromagnetic and optical properties of this effective material model by employing
exact, microscopic response relations. In particular, we argue that for recovering the standard
relation $n^2 = \varepsilon_{\mathrm{eff}} \mu_{\mathrm{eff}}$ between the refractive index
and the effective material constants, it is imperative to start from the microscopic wave equation
in terms of the transverse dielectric function, $\varepsilon_{\mathrm{T}}(\vec k, \omega) =
0$. At the same time, this result refutes again the relation $n^2 = \varepsilon_{\mathrm{r}} \mu_{\mathrm{r}}$
in terms of the microscopic response functions, and thus confirms the recently developed microscopic
theory of the refractive index [Optik 140, 62 (2017)]. On the phenomenological side, our result
is especially relevant for metamaterials research, which draws directly on the standard relation
for the refractive index in terms of effective material constants. Since for a wide class of materials,
the current response tensor can be calculated from first principles and compared to the model expression
derived here, this work also paves the way for a systematic search for new metamaterials.
