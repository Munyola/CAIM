We report on experimental observations on the modifications in the propagation characteristics
of precursor solitons due to the different shapes and sizes of the object over which the dust fluid
flows. The experiments have been performed in a $\Pi$ shaped Dusty Plasma Experimental (DPEx) device
where dusty plasma is created in a DC glow discharge Ar plasma using kaolin particles. A floating
copper wire installed radially on the cathode, acts as a charged object in the plasma environment.
The flow on the dust fluid is initiated by suddenly lowering the potential of the charged object from
grounded potential to close to floating potential. The size (height and width) of the potential
hill is then varied by drawing current from the wire through a variable resistance. With a decrease
in the height of the potential hill, the amplitude, velocity and the number of exciting precursor
solitons are found to decrease whereas the widths of the solitons are seen to increase. It is found
that below a threshold value these solitary waves are not excited and the dust fluid simply flows
over the hill. To examine the effect due to the shape of the potential profiles, the wire is replaced
by a triangular object. Only trailing wakes are seen to be excited when the dust fluid faces the linearly
increasing slope of the potential profile whereas both solitons and wakes get excited when the object
is placed with the sharp edge facing the flow. All the experimental findings qualitatively agree
with numerical solutions obtained with different source terms in the forced-Korteweg de Vries
(f-KdV) model equation.
