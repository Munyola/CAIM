The interaction between light and motion has been harnessed in the field of optomechanics to perform
precision measurements, create complex quantum states, and build new technologies. Bulk acoustic
wave (BAW) resonators are mechanical systems that have shown great potential for mediating interactions
between a variety of quantum systems such as optical photons, microwaves, and artificial atoms.
These macroscopic resonators have a collection of properties, including high frequencies, long
coherence times, ease of fabrication, and robustness against thermal decoherence, that make them
particularly well suited for applications such as storage, retrieval, and transduction of quantum
information. In this paper, we strongly couple multiple high-frequency (12.6 GHz) modes of a BAW
resonator to a single optical mode and use this multimode strong coupling to control decoherence
in the system. We probe the non-trivial dynamics associated with multimode strong coupling by performing
both frequency- and time-domain measurements and identify hybridized modes with lifetimes that
are significantly longer than that of any mode of the uncoupled system. This surprising effect,
which results from the interference of decay channels, showcases the use of multimode strong coupling
as a general strategy for mitigating extrinsic loss mechanisms. These results show that our system
can be used to study novel phenomena in a previously unexplored regime of optomechanics and could
be an important building block for future quantum devices.
