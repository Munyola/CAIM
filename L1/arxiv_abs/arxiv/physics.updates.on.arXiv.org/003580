The symmetrical quasi-classical dynamics method based on the Meyer-Miller mapping Hamiltonian
(MM-SQC) shows the great potential in the treatment of the nonadiabatic dynamics of complex systems.
We performed the comprehensive benchmark calculations to evaluate the performance of the MM-SQC
method in various site-exciton models with respect to the accurate results of quantum dynamics
method multilayer multiconfigurational time-dependent Hartree (ML-MCTDH). The parameters
of the site-exciton models are chosen to represent a few of prototypes used in the description of
photoinduced excitonic dynamics processes in photoharvesting systems and organic solar cells,
which include the rather board situations with the fast or slow bath and different system-bath couplings.
When the characteristic frequency of the bath is low, the MM-SQC method performs extremely well,
and it gives almost the identical results to those of ML-MCTDH. When the fast bath is considered,
the deviations exist between the MM-SQC and ML-MCTDH results if the high-frequency bath modes are
improperly treated by the classical manner. When the so-called adiabatic renormalization was
employed to construct the reduced Hamiltonian by freezing high-frequency modes, the MM-SQC dynamics
can give the results comparable to the ML-MCTDH ones. Thus, the MM-SQC method itself provide reasonable
results in all test site-exciton models, while the proper treatments of the bath modes must be employed.
The possible dependence of the MM-SQC dynamics on the different initial sampling methods for the
nuclear degrees of freedom is also discussed.
