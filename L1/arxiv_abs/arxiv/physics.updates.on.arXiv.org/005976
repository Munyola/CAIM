The continuity equation requires that energy released in nuclear fusion flows away from the point
of interaction and is not immediately thermalised into the CMB. It is seen that consequently the
bulk of thermo-nuclear energy released in BBN is converted by radiation pressure to kinetic energy
of gas motions and generates instability in homogeneous initial conditions. High levels of turbulence
follow, triggering the Jeans mechanism and leading to the formation of galaxies and large-scale
structure in the order of 10 Myrs. Friedmann cosmology is perturbed, creating a fractal Voronoi
matter distribution and providing energy for reionisation. In keeping with observations, general
relativity predicts that there is no bound on the size of the structures produced. The true (overall)
rate of expansion is substantially below the observed (local) value of Hubble's constant, and is
consistent with published estimates from the CMB for void models. The CMB is predicted to show near
flatness over the observed region. It is seen from observation of fluid flows, from established
physics, and from numerical solution of the Navier-Stokes equations that bisymmetric spiral vortices
form where gas flows meet. These vortices necessarily have flat rotation curves at large radii and
create conditions for spiral galaxy formation. It is shown by N-body simulation that enduring Sa,
Sb and Sc spiral galaxies result from appropriate initial conditions. The simulations and analysis
of spiral potential show that orbital velocities are greater than would be the case in an axisymmetric
potential.
