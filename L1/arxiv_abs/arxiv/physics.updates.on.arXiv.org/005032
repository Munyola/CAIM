Using a coarse-grained model, self-organized assembly of proteins (e.g. CorA and its inner segment
iCorA) is studied by examining quantities such as contact profile, radius of gyration, and structure
factor as a function of protein concentration at a range of low (native phase) to high (denature phase)
temperatures. Visual inspections show distinct structures, i.e. isolated globular bundles to
entangled network on multiple length scales in dilute to crowded protein concentrations. In native
phase, the radius of gyration of the protein does not vary much with the protein concentration while
that of its inner segment increases systematically. In contrast, the radius of gyration of the protein
shows enormous growth with the concentration due to entanglement while that of the inner segment
remains almost constant in denatured phase. The multi-scale morphology of the collective assembly
is quantified by estimating the effective dimension D of protein from scaling of the structure factor:
collective assembly from inner segments remains globular (D aroud 3) at almost all length scales
in its native phase while that from protein chains shows sparsely distributed morphology with D
around 2 in entire temperature range due to entanglement except in crowded environment at low temperature
where D around 2.6. Higher morphological response of chains with only the inner-segments due to
selective interactions in its native phase may be more conducive to self-organizing mechanism
than that of the remaining segments of the protein chains.
