Simultaneous measurements of sea spray aerosol (SSA), wind, wave, underwater acoustic noise,
and microwave brightness temperature are obtained in the open ocean. These data are analyzed to
clarify the ocean surface processes important to SSA production. Parameters are formulated to
represent surface processes with characteristic length scales over a broad range, from tens of
meters to a few centimeters. The result shows that the correlation coefficients between SSA properties
(number, volume and flux) and surface process parameters improve toward the shortest length scale.
This suggests that whereas surface wave breaking is a necessary initial and boundary condition,
the final state of the atmospheric SSA properties is controlled primarily by turbulent processes
characterized by the ocean surface roughness. The investigation also reveals distinct differences
of the SSA properties in rising winds and falling winds, with higher efficiency of breaking production
in low or falling winds. Previous studies show that the length scale of breaking waves is shorter
in mixed seas than in wind seas. Combining the observations together, it is suggestive that larger
air cavities are entrained in rising winds (with wind seas more likely). The larger air cavities
escape before they can be fully broken down into small bubbles for the subsequent SSA production.
In contrast, the shorter breakers in low or falling winds (with mixed seas more likely) trap smaller
air cavities that stay underwater longer for more efficient bubble breakup by turbulence.
