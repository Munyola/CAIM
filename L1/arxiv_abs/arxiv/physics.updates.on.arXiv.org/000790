Understanding the interaction of vortices with inclusions in type-II superconductors is a major
outstanding challenge both for fundamental science and energy applications. At application-relevant
scales, the long-range interactions between a dense configuration of vortices and the dependence
of their behavior on external parameters, such as temperature and an applied magnetic field, are
all important to the net response of the superconductor. Capturing these features, in general,
precludes analytical description of vortex dynamics and has also made numerical simulation prohibitively
expensive. Here we report on a highly optimized iterative implicit solver for the time-dependent
Ginzburg-Landau equations suitable for investigations of type-II superconductors on massively
parallel architectures. Its main purpose is to study vortex dynamics in disordered or geometrically
confined mesoscopic systems. In this work, we present the discretization and time integration
scheme in detail for two types of boundary conditions. We describe the necessary conditions for
a stable and physically accurate integration of the equations of motion. Using an inclusion pattern
generator, we can simulate complex pinning landscapes and the effect of geometric confinement.
We show that our algorithm, implemented on a GPU, can provide static and dynamic solutions of the
Ginzburg-Landau equations for mesoscopically large systems over thousands of time steps in a matter
of hours. Using our formulation, studying scientifically-relevant problems is a computationally
reasonable task.
