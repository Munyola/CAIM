The moist-air entropy can be used to analyze and better understand the general circulation of the
atmosphere or convective motions. Isentropic analyses are commonly based on studies of different
equivalent potential temperatures, all of which are assumed to fully represent the entropy of moist
air. It is, however, possible to rely either on statistical physics or the third law of thermodynamics
when defining and computing the absolute entropy of moist air and to study the corresponding third-law
potential temperature, which is different from the previous ones. The third law assumes that the
entropy for the most stable crystalline state of all substances is zero when approaching absolute
zero temperature. This paper shows that the way all these moist-air potential temperatures are
defined has a large impact on: (i) the plotting of the isentropes for a simulation of the Hurricane
DUMILE; (ii) the changes in moist-air entropy computed for a steam cycle defined for this Hurricane;
(iii) the analyses of isentropic stream functions computed for this Hurricane; and (iv) the computations
of the heat input, the work function, and the efficiency defined for this steam cycle. The moist-air
entropy is a state function and the isentropic analyses must be completely determined by the local
moist-air conditions. The large differences observed between the different formulations of moist-air
entropy are interpreted as proof that the isentropic analyses of moist-air atmospheric motions
must be achieved by using the third-law potential temperature defined from general thermodynamics.
