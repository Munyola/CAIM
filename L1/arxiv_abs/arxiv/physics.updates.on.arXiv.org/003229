Purpose: High-permittivity materials in the form of flexible 'dielectric pads' have proved very
useful for addressing RF inhomogeneities in high field MRI. Finding the optimal design of such pads
is however a tedious task, reducing the impact of this technique. In this work we present an easy to
use software tool which allows researchers and clinicians to design dielectric pads efficiently
on standard computer systems, for 7T neuroimaging and 3T body imaging applications. Methods: The
tool incorporates advanced computational methods based on field decomposition and model order
reduction as a framework to efficiently evaluate the B1+ fields resulting from dielectric pads.
The tool further incorporates an optimization routine to perform either straightforward design
for one or two pads based on a target field approach, or a trade-off analysis between homogeneity
and efficiency of the B1+ field in a specific region of interest. The 3T version further allows for
shifting of the imaging landmark to enable different imaging targets to be centered in the body coil.Results:
Example design results are shown for imaging the inner ear at 7T and for cardiac imaging at 3T. Computation
times for all cases were under a couple of minutes. The change in homogeneity and efficiency with
the pad's dimensions, location, and constitution are clearly listed. Conclusion: The developed
tool can be easily used to design pads for any 7T neuroimaging and 3T body imaging application within
minutes. This bridges the gap between the advanced design methods and the practical application
by the MR community.
