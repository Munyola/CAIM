Recently, some authors have shown that a DNA molecule produces electromagnetic signals and communicates
with other DNA molecules or other molecules. In fact, a DNA acts like a receiver or transmitter of
radio waves. In this paper, we suggest a mathematical model for the DNA molecule and use of its communication
to cure some diseases like cancer. In this model, first, by using concepts from string theory and
M-theory, we calculate the energy of a DNA in terms of interactions between free electrons and bound
electrons. We show that when a DNA is damaged, its energy changes and an extra current is produced.
This extra current causes the electromagnetic signals of a damaged DNA molecule to be different
when compared to the electromagnetic signals of a normal DNA molecule. The electromagnetic signals
of a damaged DNA molecule induces an extra current in a normal DNA molecule and leads to its destruction.
By sending crafted electromagnetic signals to normal DNA molecules and inducing an opposite current
with respect to this extra current, we can prevent the destruction of normal DNA. Finally, we argue
that the type of packing of DNA in chromosomes of men and women are different. This causes radiated
waves from DNAs of men and women to have opposite signs and cancel the effect of each other in a pair.
Using this property, we suggest another mechanism to cancel the effect of extra waves, which are
produced by DNAs in cancer cells of a male or a female, by extra waves which are produced by DNAs in similar
cells of a female or a male and prevent the progression of the disease.
