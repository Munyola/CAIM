A theoretical model is proposed for interfacial gravity waves containing strong bores (hydraulic
jumps). The model is based on the locally conservative form of shallow-water momentum equation
for the two-layer system bounded by a rigid lid. Using a linear combination of the basic irrotationality
conservation equations to eliminate the pressure gradient along the interface, we obtain a generalised
local momentum conservation equation which contains a free parameter $\alpha.$ This parameter
defines the relative contribution of each layer to the pressure at the interface and is supposed
to depend on the ratio of densities which is the sole dimensionless parameter in this problem. For
nearly equal densities, symmetry considerations suggest $\alpha\approx 0,$ which corresponds
to both layers affecting the pressure with equal weight coefficients. The front propagation velocities
that follow from this assumption and the Rankine-Hugoniot jump conditions for the mass and momentum
conservation equations agree well with experimental and numerical results in a wide range of bore
strengths. With $\alpha=\pm 1,$ our model reproduces the classical front conditions due to Wood
and Simpson (1984, J. Fluid Mech. 140, 329) and Klemp et al. (1997, J. Fluid Mech. 331, 81), which are
commonly thought to be outside the scope of the hydrostatic shallow-water approximation. In contrast
to previous shallow-water models, our locally conservative momentum conservation equation requires
no external closure conditions and provides a unified framework for numerical modelling of strong
internal bores and gravity currents.
