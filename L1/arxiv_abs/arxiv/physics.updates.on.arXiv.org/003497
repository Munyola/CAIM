The outer hair cell (OHC) of the organ of Corti underlies a mechanically based process that enhances
hearing, termed cochlear amplification. The cell possesses a unique motor protein, prestin, which
senses voltage and consequently changes conformation to cause large cell length changes, termed
electromotility (eM). In OHCs studied in vitro, the prestin voltage sensor generates a capacitance
that is both voltage and frequency dependent, peaking in magnitude at a characteristic membrane
voltage (Vh), which can be greater than the linear capacitance of the cell. Consequently, the OHC
membrane time constant is multifarious depending upon resting potential and frequency of AC evaluation.
After precisely correcting for this influence on the whole-cell voltage clamp time constant, we
find that OHC eM is low pass in nature, substantially attenuating in magnitude within the frequency
bandwidth of human speech. The frequency response is slowest at Vh, with a cut-off near 1.5 kHz, but
increases up to six-fold in a U shaped manner as holding voltage deviates from Vh. NLC measures follow
this pattern. Viscous drag alone cannot account for such eM behavior; nor can it arise from viscous
drag in combination with a sigmoidal voltage-dependent OHC stiffness. However, viscous drag combined
with kinetics of prestin, likely corresponding to its bell-shaped conformational gating compliance
(Iwasa, 2000), is in line with our observations. How OHC eM influences cochlear amplification at
higher frequencies needs reconsideration.
