Georg Von Bekesy was awarded a nobel price in 1961 for his pioneering work on the cochlea function
in the mammalian hearing organ. He postulated that the placement of sensory cells in the cochlea
corresponds to a specific frequency of sound. This theory, known as tonotopy, is the ground of our
understanding on this complex organ. With the advance of technologies, this knowledge broaden
continuously and seems to confirm Bekesy initial observations. However, a mystery still lies in
the center of this organ: how does its microscopic tissues exactly act together to decode the sounds
that we perceive? One of these tissues, the Reissner membrane, forms a double cell layer elastic
barrier separating two fundamental ducts of this organ. Yet, until recently, this membrane, was
not considered in the modelling of the inner ear due to its smallness. Nowadays, objects of this size
are at the reach of the medical imagining and measuring expertise. Newly available observations
coupled with the increasing availability of computational resources should enable modellers
to consider the impact of these microscopic tissues in the inner ear mechanism. In this report, we
explore the potential fluid-structure interactions happening in the inner ear, more particularly
on the Reissner membrane. This study aims at answering two separate questions. Can nowadays computational
fluid dynamics solvers simulate interaction with inner ear microscopic tissues? Has the Reissner
membrane function on the auditory system been overlooked?
