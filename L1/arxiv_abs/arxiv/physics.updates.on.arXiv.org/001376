With the rapidly growing interest in bifacial photovoltaics (PV), a worldwide map of their potential
performance can help assess and accelerate the global deployment of this emerging technology.
However, the existing literature only highlights optimized bifacial PV for a few geographic locations
or develops worldwide performance maps for very specific configurations, such as the vertical
installation. It is still difficult to translate these location- and configuration-specific
conclusions to a general optimized performance of this technology. In this paper, we present a global
study and optimization of bifacial solar modules using a rigorous and comprehensive modeling framework.
Our results demonstrate that with a low albedo of 0.25, the bifacial gain of ground-mounted bifacial
modules is less than 10% worldwide. However, increasing the albedo to 0.5 and elevating modules
1 m above the ground can boost the bifacial gain to 30%. Moreover, we derive a set of empirical design
rules, which optimize bifacial solar modules across the world, that provide the groundwork for
rapid assessment of the location-specific performance. We find that ground-mounted, vertical,
east-west-facing bifacial modules will outperform their south-north-facing, optimally tilted
counterparts by up to 15% below the latitude of 30 degrees, for an albedo of 0.5. The relative energy
output is the reverse of this in latitudes above 30 degrees. A detailed and systematic comparison
with experimental data from Asia, Europe, and North America validates the model presented in this
paper.
