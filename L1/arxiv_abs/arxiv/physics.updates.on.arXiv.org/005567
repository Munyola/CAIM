Recent research shows that the surface wave energy dissipation, which is the vertical energy flux
across the air-sea interface, can be calculated as the product of air density, reference wind speed
cubed and an energy transfer coefficient determined by the dimensionless parameters made of wind
speed, significant wave height and dominant wave period. In a similar way, the horizontal wave energy
flux of wind generated waves can be represented by the same dimensionless wind and wave parameters.
Satellite altimeters routinely report reference wind speed and significant wave height. An algorithm
to derive the characteristic wave period of ocean waves in the altimeter footprint using the similarity
properties of ocean wind and waves is described. The vertical and horizontal energy fluxes derived
from the satellite altimeter are in very good agreement with the estimation from ocean buoy measurements
in four geography locations with significantly different wind and wave climates. The vertical
energy flux follows closely the cubic wind speed dependence, reflecting the dominance of short
wave contribution in wave generation and breaking dissipation. The wind speed dependence of horizontal
energy flux is much weaker especially in mild to moderate wind speed, reflecting its dominance by
long swell component. Application of the energy flux parameterization functions to satellite
altimeter measurements offers an efficient method of estimating the air-sea exchange and ocean
energy budget in global scale. Such data are extremely difficult to acquire using other means.
