In this work, we report the results of a series of density functional theory (DFT) based ab initio
molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations of ambient liquid water using a hierarchy of exchange-correlation
(XC) functionals to investigate the individual and collective effects of exact exchange (Exx),
via the PBE0 hybrid functional, non-local vdW/dispersion interactions, via a fully self-consistent
density-dependent dispersion correction, and approximate nuclear quantum effects (aNQE), via
a 30 K increase in the simulation temperature, on the microscopic structure of liquid water. Based
on these AIMD simulations, we found that the collective inclusion of Exx, vdW, and aNQE as resulting
from a large-scale AIMD simulation of (H$_2$O)$_{128}$ at the PBE0+vdW level of theory, significantly
softens the structure of ambient liquid water and yields an oxygen-oxygen structure factor, $S_{\rm
OO}(Q)$, and corresponding oxygen-oxygen radial distribution function, $g_{\rm OO}(r)$, that
are now in quantitative agreement with the best available experimental data. This level of agreement
between simulation and experiment as demonstrated herein originates from an increase in the relative
population of water molecules in the interstitial region between the first and second coordination
shells, a collective reorganization in the liquid phase which is facilitated by a weakening of the
hydrogen bond strength by the use of the PBE0 hybrid XC functional, coupled with a relative stabilization
of the resultant disordered liquid water configurations by the inclusion of non-local vdW/dispersion
interactions.
