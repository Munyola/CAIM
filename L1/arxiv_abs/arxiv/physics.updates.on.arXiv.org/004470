The macroscale structure and microscale fluctuation statistics of late-time asymptotic steady
state flows in cylindrical geometries is studied using the methods of equilibrium statistical
mechanics. The axisymmetric assumption permits an effective two-dimensional description in
terms of the (toroidal) flow field $\sigma$ about the cylinder axis and the vorticity field $\xi$
that generates mixing within the (poloidal) planes of fixed azimuth. As for a number of other 2D fluid
systems, extending the classic 2D Euler equation, the flow is constrained by an infinite number
of conservation laws, beyond the usual kinetic energy and angular momentum. All must be accounted
for in a consistent equilibrium description. It is shown that the most directly observable impact
of the conservation laws is on $\sigma$, which displays interesting large-scale radius-dependent
flow structure. However, unlike in some previous treatments, we find that the thermodynamic temperature
is always positive. As a consequence, except for an infinitesimal boundary layer that maintains
the correct (conserved) value of the overall poloidal circulation, the impact on $\xi$ resides
in the statistics of the strongly fluctuating, fine-scale mixing, where it is sensitive to `antiferromagnetic'
microscale correlations that help maintain the analogue of local charge neutrality. The poloidal
flow is macroscopically featureless, displaying no large scale circulating jet- or eddy-like
features (which typically emerge as negative temperature states in analogous Euler and quasigeostrophic
equilibria).
