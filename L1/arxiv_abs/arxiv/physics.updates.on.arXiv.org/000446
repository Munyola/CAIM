We derive 15 classes of time-dependent two-state models solvable in terms of the confluent Heun
functions. These classes extend over all the known families of 3- and 2-parametric models solvable
in terms of the Gauss hypergeometric and the Kummer confluent hypergeometric functions to more
general four-parametric classes involving three-parametric detuning modulation functions.
The classes suggest a variety of families of field configurations possessing useful properties
not covered by the previously known analytic models. In the case of constant detuning the field configurations
defined by the derived classes describe excitations of two-state quantum systems by symmetric
or asymmetric pulses of controllable width and edge-steepness. The particular classes out of the
derived fifteen that provide constant detuning pulses of finite area are identified and the factors
controlling the corresponding pulse shapes are discussed in detail. The positions of the pulse
edges for the case of step-wise edges are determined. We show that the asymmetry and the peak heights
are mostly defined by two of the three parameters of the detuning modulation function, while the
pulse width is mainly controlled by the third one, the constant term in the detuning modulation function.
It is shown that the pulse width diverges as this parameter goes to infinity. Furthermore, it is shown
that rectangular box pulses, as well as infinitely narrow pulses are possible, and the conditions
for these to be achieved are obtained. Several examples of such field configurations are mentioned
and their basic properties are discussed.
