Compared with the classical irreversible failure propagation, the spontaneous recovery model
can better depict the failure propagation on network systems such as financial and transportation
networks. In this paper, we study how the non-Markovian recovery process influences cascading
failure dynamics in the spontaneous recovery systems. To this end, we compare two kinds of failure-recovery
models: the non-Markovian recovery (NMR) model and the corresponding Markovian recovery (MR)
model. We first develop a Pairwise approximation theory for the MR and NMR models, which can predict
the time evolution, steady state, and hysteresis behavior of failure-recovery systems more accurately
than the classical mean-field (MF) method. We find that although the non-Markovian recovery mechanism
does not essentially affect the steady state and hysteresis behavior of failure-recovery systems,
the two models exhibit distinct evolution processes. When investigating the effect of initial
conditions on the phase transition and hysteresis behavior, we find in the hysteresis region, the
NMR model exhibits a non-monotonic growth characteristic: with the increase of initial failed
nodes, the steady state staying in relative low-failure phase first turns into relative high-failure
phase, and then into relative low-failure phase again. We then use the MF theory to explain the phenomenon
qualitatively and point out when considering non-Markovian dynamics, we should study the steady
state not only from the perspective of the variation of parameters, but also from the initial conditions.
