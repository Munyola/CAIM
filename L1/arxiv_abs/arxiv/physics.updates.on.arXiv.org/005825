Tensor network (TN), a young mathematical tool of high vitality and great potential, has been undergoing
extremely rapid developments in the last two decades, gaining tremendous success in condensed
matter physics, atomic physics, quantum information science, statistical physics, and so on.
In this lecture notes, we focus on the contraction algorithms of TN as well as some of the applications
to the simulations of quantum many-body systems. Starting from basic concepts and definitions,
we first explain the relations between TN and physical problems, including the TN representations
of classical partition functions, quantum many-body states (by matrix product state, tree TN,
and projected entangled pair state), time evolution simulations, etc. These problems, which are
challenging to solve, can be transformed to TN contraction problems. We present then several paradigm
algorithms based on the ideas of the numerical renormalization group and/or boundary states, including
density matrix renormalization group, time-evolving block decimation, coarse-graining/corner
tensor renormalization group, and several distinguished variational algorithms. Finally, we
revisit the TN approaches from the perspective of multi-linear algebra (also known as tensor algebra
or tensor decompositions) and quantum simulation. Despite the apparent differences in the ideas
and strategies of different TN algorithms, we aim at revealing the underlying relations and resemblances
in order to present a systematic picture to understand the TN contraction approaches.
