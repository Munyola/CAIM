We propose a microscopic model to describe how individual opinions shared between interacting
agents initiate excessive collective expectations about a new idea or an innovation, followed
by a swift collapse towards a dramatic collective disillusionment. The basic assumption which
underlies the dynamics is that the information gathering process is not instantaneous but requires
maturation. Agents steadily refine and update their personal opinion via a recurrent consultation
of a public pool which stores information tokens (ITs). The expectation for the innovative idea
is monitored in real-time by counting the number of stored ITs. The flow dynamics of ITs is assimilated
to a single node queuing system (QS) with feedback loop. It incorporates the information pool (the
waiting room), an IT inflow, and a service outflow that stylizes the information gathering process.
Contrary to basic queuing theory, here the ITs roaming the QS are endowed with time-dependent internal
variables. This additional dynamic information is used to construct the information maturation
process. Such a maturation of the information introduces response delays into the dynamics, which
ultimately generates the collective disillusionment trough. We illustrate the introduced generic
modeling framework by considering in details the hype cycle dynamics, a key managerial topic when
dealing with diffusion of innovation. In a second part of the paper, we introduce a stylized framework
to detect, as soon as possible, the onset of the collective disillusionment phase, while minimizing
the frequency of false alarms.
