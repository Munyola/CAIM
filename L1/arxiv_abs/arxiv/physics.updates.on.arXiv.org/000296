The generation of two non-identical membrane compartments via exchange of vesicles is considered
to require two types of vesicles specified by distinct cytosolic coats that selectively recruit
cargo and two membrane-bound SNARE pairs that specify fusion and differ in their affinities for
each type of vesicles. The mammalian Golgi complex is composed of 6-8 non-identical cisternae that
undergo gradual maturation and replacement yet features only two SNARE pairs. We present a model
that explains how the distinct composition of Golgi cisternae can be generated with two and even
a single SNARE pair and one vesicle coat. A decay of active SNARE concentration in aging cisternae
provides the seed for a cis > trans SNARE gradient that generates the predominantly retrograde
vesicle flux which further enhances the gradient. This flux in turn yields the observed inhomogeneous
steady-state distribution of Golgi enzymes, which compete with each other and with the SNAREs for
incorporation into transport vesicles. We show analytically that the steady state SNARE concentration
decays exponentially with the cisterna number. Numerical solutions of rate equations reproduce
the experimentally observed SNARE gradients, overlapping enzyme peaks in cis, medial and trans
and the reported change in vesicle nature across Golgi: Vesicles originating from younger cisternae
mostly contain Golgi enzymes and SNAREs enriched in these cisternae and extensively recycle through
the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER), while the other subpopulation of vesicles contains Golgi proteins
prevalent in older cisternae and hardly reaches the ER.
