The in vivo observation of the human retina at the cellular level is crucial to detect lesions before
irreversible visual loss occurs, to follow the time course of retinal diseases and to evaluate and
monitor the early effects of treatments. Despite the phenomenal advances in optical coherence
tomography (OCT) and adaptive optics systems, in vivo imaging of several retinal cells is still
elusive. Here we propose a radically different method compared to OCT, called transscleral optical
phase imaging (TOPI), which allows to image retinal cells with high contrast, high resolution,
and within an acquisition time suitable for clinical use. TOPI relies on high-angle oblique illumination
of the retina, combined with adaptive optics, to enhance the phase contrast of transparent cells.
We first present in-vivo images of retinal cells, from the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) to the
nerve and vascular layers of the retina, in eleven healthy volunteers without pupil dilation. The
morphology of the cells in vivo is then compared to that of images obtained with the same technique
applied on ex vivo human RPE and pig retinas. Finally, we demonstrate the ability of high resolution
phase microscopy to image pericytes and microglia around rat retinal capillaries. Our results
show the ability of TOPI to image and quantify retinal cells up to the RPE depth within a maximum time
of 9 seconds over a field of view of 4.4 x 4.4{\deg}, opening new avenue in the in vivo exploration of
the deepest layer of the retina in healthy and diseased eyes.
