High speed mid-wave infrared (MWIR) photodetectors have applications in the areas such as free
space optical communication and frequency comb spectroscopy. However, most of the research on
the MWIR photodetectors is focused on how to increase the quantum efficiency and reduce the dark
current, in order to improve the detectivity (D*), and the 3dB bandwidth performance of the corresponding
MWIR photodetectors is still not fully studied. In this work, we report and characterize a MWIR interband
cascade photodetector based on InAs/GaSb type-II superlattice with a 50% cutoff wavelength at
~5.3 um at 300 K. The 3 dB cutoff frequency is 2.4 GHz at 300 K, for a 40 {\mu}m circular diameter device
under -5 V applied bias. Limitations on the detector high speed performance are also discussed.High
