The translational-diffusion coefficient $D_T$ and the spin-rotation contribution to the $^1$H
NMR relaxation time $T_{1J}$ for methane (CH$_4$) are investigated using MD (molecular dynamics)
simulations, over a wide range of densities $\rho$ and temperatures $T$, spanning the liquid, supercritical,
and gas phases. The simulated $D_T$ agree well with measurements, without any adjustable parameters
in the interpretation of the simulations. A minimization technique is developed to compute the
angular-velocity for non-rigid spherical molecules, which is used to simulate the autocorrelation
function $G_{\!J}(t)$ for spin-rotation interactions. With increasing $D_T$ (i.e. decreasing
$\rho$), $G_{\!J}(t)$ shows increasing deviations from the single-exponential decay predicted
by the Langevin theory for hard spheres, and the deviations are quantified using inverse Laplace
transforms of $G_{\!J}(t)$. $T_{1J}$ is derived from $G_{\!J}(t)$ using the kinetic model "km"
for gases ($T_{1J}^{km}$), and the diffusion model "dm" for liquids ($T_{1J}^{dm}$). $T_{1J}^{km}$
shows better agreement with $T_1$ measurements at higher $D_T$, while $T_{1J}^{dm}$ shows better
agreement with $T_1$ measurements at lower $D_T$. $T_{1J}^{km}$ is shown to dominate over the MD
simulated $^1$H-$^1$H dipole-dipole relaxation $T_{1RT}$ at high $D_T$, while the opposite is
found at low $D_T$. At high $D_T$, the simulated spin-rotation correlation-time $\tau_J$ agrees
with the kinetic collision time $\tau_K$ for gases, from which a new relation $1/T_{1J}^{km} \propto
D_T$ is inferred, without any adjustable parameters.
