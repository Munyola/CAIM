Silicon is a promising candidate for negative electrodes due to its high theoretical specific capacity
(~3579 mAh g-1) and low lithiation potential (~0.40 V vs Li). However, its practical applications
in battery have been inhibited by the large volume change (~400%) induced by Li+-insertion into
Si lattices. Here, we attempt to resolve this issue at a fundamental level, and report for the first
time a novel liquid metal (LM)-mediated spontaneous repairing conductive-additive-free Si anode
for Li-ion battery. The fluidity of LM ensures the eternal contact between Si and the conducting-network
during its repeated electrochemical reactions. The as-prepared nano-composite of LM/Si leads
to superior performances as characterized by high capacity utilization (2300 mAh g-1 at 500 mA g-1),
long-term stability (968 mAh g-1 after 1500 charge-discharge cycles at 8 A g-1 with 81.3% retention),
high rate capability (360 mAh g-1 at 20 A g-1, equivalence of 55 C, or full charge/discharge in 65 seconds),
and, in particular, an extra-ordinarily high initial coulombic efficiency (95.92%), which is
not only the highest reported for Si to the best of our knowledge, but also higher than the mature graphitic
carbon anodes. The unique approach described in this work not only resolves the basic stress challenges
faced by the promising but often problematic alloy-type materials; in broader context it also provides
a universal inspiration to all electrode materials whose electric properties suffer from extreme
mechanic upheavals induced by the electrochemical strains during the cell reactions.
