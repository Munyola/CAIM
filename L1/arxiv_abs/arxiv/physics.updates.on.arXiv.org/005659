An explicit analytical solution considering interface bending resistance based on the Steigmann-Ogden
interface model is derived for a spherical nano-inhomogeneity (nanoscale void/inclusion) embedded
in an infinite matrix under general uniform far-field stress (including both tension and shear).
The Papkovich-Neuber (P-N) general solutions, which are expressed in terms of spherical harmonics,
are used to derive the analytical solution. A superposition technique for the Steigmann-Ogden
interface model is introduced to overcome the mathematical complexity in the Steigmann-Ogden
interface model, that is the nonlinearity of the constitutive relation brought by interface residual
stress. Numerical examples show that the stress fields considering the interface bending resistance
with the Steigmann-Ogden interface model, differ a lot from those considering only the interface
stretching resistance with the Gurtin-Murdoch interface model, when interface bending parameters
get closed to the characteristic line introduced in this study. In addition to size-dependency
phenomenon, it is also observed that some stress components are invariant to interface bending
stiffness parameters at a certain circle in the inclusion/matrix. A characteristic line for the
interface bending stiffness parameters is presented, near which the stress concentration phenomenon
becomes quite severe. The derived explicit analytical solution with the Steigmann-Ogden interface
model can be used as a benchmark for semi-analytical solutions and numerical solutions.
