Discotic liquid crystalline (DLC) charge transfer (CT) complexes combine visible light absorption
and rapid charge transfer characteristics within the CT complex, being favorable properties for
photovoltaic (PV) applications. We present a detailed study of the electronic and vibrational
properties of the prototypic 1:1 mixture of discotic 2,3,6,7,10,11-hexakishexyloxytriphenylene
(HAT6) and 2,4,7-trinitro-9-fluorenone (TNF). It is shown that intermolecular charge transfer
occurs in the groundstate of the complex: a charge delocalization of about 10-2 electron from the
HAT6 core to TNF is deduced from both Raman and our previous NMR measurements (Reference 32), implying
the presence of permanent dipoles at the donor-acceptor interface. A combined analysis of density
functional theory calculations, resonant Raman and UV-VIS absorption measurements indicate
that fast relaxation occurs in the UV region due to intramolecular vibronic coupling of HAT6 quinoidal
modes with lower lying electronic states. Relatively slower relaxation in the visible region CT-band
of the complex is also indicated, which likely involves motions of the TNF nitro groups. The fast
quinoidal relaxation process in the hot UV band of HAT6 relates to pseudo-Jahn-Teller interactions
in a single benzene unit, suggesting that the underlying vibronic coupling mechanism can be generic
for polyaromatic hydrocarbons. Both the presence of CT dipoles and relatively slow relaxation
processes in the CT band can be relevant concerning the design of DLC based organic PV systems.
