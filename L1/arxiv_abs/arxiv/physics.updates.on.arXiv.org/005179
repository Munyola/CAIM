We use particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations and simple analytic models to investigate the laser-plasma
interaction known as ponderomotive steepening. When normally incident laser light reflects at
the critical surface of a plasma, the resulting standing electromagnetic wave modifies the electron
density profile via the ponderomotive force, which creates peaks in the electron density separated
by approximately half of the laser wavelength. What is less well studied is how this charge imbalance
accelerates ions towards the electron density peaks, modifying the ion density profile of the plasma.
Idealized PIC simulations with an extended underdense plasma shelf are used to isolate the dynamics
of ion density peak growth for a 42 fs pulse from an 800 nm laser with an intensity of 10$^{18}$ W cm$^{-2}$.
These simulations exhibit sustained longitudinal electric fields of 200 GV m$^{-1}$, which produce
counter-steaming populations of ions reaching a few keV in energy. We compare these simulations
to theoretical models, and we explore how ion energy depends on factors such as the plasma density
and the laser wavelength, pulse duration, and intensity. We also provide relations for the strength
of longitudinal electric fields and an approximate timescale for the density peaks to develop.
These conclusions may be useful investigating the phenomenon of ponderomotive steepening as advances
in laser technology allow shorter and more intense pulses to be produced at various wavelengths.
We also discuss the parallels with other work studying the interference from two counter-propagating
laser pulses.
