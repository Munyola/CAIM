Diving induces large pressures during water entry, accompanied by the creation of cavity and water
splash ejected from the free water surface. To minimize impact forces, divers streamline their
shape at impact. Here, we investigate the impact forces and splash evolution of diving wedges as
a function of the wedge opening angle. A gradual transition from impactful to smooth entry is observed
as the wedge angle decreases. After submersion, diving wedges experience significantly smaller
drag forces (two-fold smaller) than immersed wedges. Our experimental findings compare favorably
with existing force models upon the introduction of empirically-based corrections. We experimentally
characterize the shapes of the cavity and splash created by the wedge and find that they are independent
of the entry velocity at short times, but that the splash exhibits distinct variations in shape at
later times. We propose a one-dimensional model of the splash that takes into account gravity, surface
tension and aerodynamics forces. The model shows, in conjunction with experimental data, that
the splash shape is dominated by the interplay between a destabilizing Venturi-suction force due
to air rushing between the splash and the water surface and a stabilizing force due to surface tension.
Taken together, these findings could direct future research aimed at understanding and combining
the mechanisms underlying all stages of water entry in application to engineering and bio-related
problems, including naval engineering, disease spreading or platform diving.
