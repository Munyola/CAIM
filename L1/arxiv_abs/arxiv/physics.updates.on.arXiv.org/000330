In this article we expand and develop the authors' recent proposed methodology for efficient stochastic
superparameterization (SP) algorithms for geophysical turbulence. Geophysical turbulence
is characterized by significant intermittent cascades of energy from the unresolved to the resolved
scales resulting in complex patterns of waves, jets, and vortices. Conventional SP simulates large
scale dynamics on a coarse grid in a physical domain, and couples these dynamics to high-resolution
simulations on periodic domains embedded in the coarse grid. Stochastic SP replaces the nonlinear,
deterministic eddy equations on periodic embedded domains by quasilinear stochastic approximations
on formally infinite embedded domains. The result is a seamless algorithm which never uses a small
scale grid and is far cheaper than conventional SP, but with significant success in difficult test
problems. Various design choices in the algorithm are investigated in detail here, including decoupling
the timescale of evolution on the embedded domains from the length of the time step used on the coarse
grid, and sensitivity to certain assumed properties of the eddies (e.g. the shape of the assumed
eddy energy spectrum). The different design choices are compared and contrasted on a stringent
test suite for quasigeostrophic turbulence involving two-layer dynamics on a beta-plane forced
by an imposed background shear. The algorithms developed are expected to be particularly useful
in providing accurate and efficient stochastic parameterizations for use in ensemble-based state
estimation and prediction.
