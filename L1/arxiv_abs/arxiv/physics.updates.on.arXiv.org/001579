Fundamental concepts of thermodynamics rely on abstract physical quantities such as energy, heat
and entropy, which play an important role in the process of interpreting thermal phenomena and statistical
mechanics. However, these quantities are not covered by human (visual) perception and thus, an
intuitive understanding often is lacking. Today immersive technologies like head-mounted displays
of the newest generation, especially HoloLens, allow for high quality augmented reality learning
experiences, which can overcome this perception gap and simultaneously avoid a split attention
effect. In a mixed reality (MR) scenario as presented in this paper---which we call a holo.lab---human
perception can be extended to the thermal regime by presenting false-color representations of
the temperature of objects as a virtual augmentation directly on the real object itself in real-time.
Direct feedback to experimental actions of the users in form of different representations allows
for immediate comparison to theoretical principles and predictions and therefore is supposed
to intensify the theory-experiment interactions and to increase the conceptual understanding.
We tested this technology for an experiment on thermal conduction of metals in the framework of undergraduate
laboratories. A pilot study with treatment and control groups (N = 59) showed a small positive effect
of MR on students' performance measured with a standardized concept test for thermodynamics, indicating
an improvement of the understanding of the underlying physical concepts.
