Similarity solutions are obtained for one dimensional, unsteady, adiabatic propagation of an
exponential shock wave in a perfect gas with heat conduction and radiation heat flux, in the presence
of azimuthal magnetic field. The shock wave is driven out by a piston moving with time according to
an exponential law. The equilibrium flow conditions are maintained. The heat conduction is expressed
in terms of Fourier's law and the radiation is considered to be of the diffusion type for an optically
thick grey gas model. The thermal conductivity and the absorption coefficient are assumed to vary
with temperature and density according to power law. The density and magnetic field ahead of the
shock front, are assumed to vary as an exponential law. The effects of the variation of the strength
of ambient magnetic field, heat transfer parameters, adiabatic exponent, ambient density variation
index on the shock strength, the distance between the piston and the shock front, and on the flow variables
are studied out in detail. The similarity solution exists only when the sum of shock radius and ambient
magnetic field exponent is equal to the half of the ambient density exponent. It is manifested that
the shock strength decreases by increasing the strength of ambient magnetic field but it is independent
from the heat transfer parameters. The total energy of the flow field behind the shock front is not
constant but varies as power of shock radius. The compressibility of the medium is increased in the
non-magnetic field. Also, the presence of the magnetic field have significant effects on the shock
wave.
