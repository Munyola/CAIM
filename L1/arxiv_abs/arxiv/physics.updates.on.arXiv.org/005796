Detecting anions in space has relied on a strong collaboration between theoretical and laboratory
analyses to measure rotational spectra and spectroscopic constants to high accuracy. The advent
of improved quantum chemical tools operating at higher accuracy and reduced computational cost
is a crucial solution for the fundamental characterization of astrophysically-relevant anions
and their detection in the interstellar medium and planetary atmospheres. In this context, we have
turned towards the quantum chemical analysis of the penta-atomic dicyanoamine anion NCNCN$^-$
(C$_2$N$_3^-$), a structurally bent and polar compound. We have performed high-level coupled
cluster theory quartic force field (QFF) computations of C$_2$N$_3^-$ satisfying both computational
cost and accuracy conditions. We provide for the first time accurate spectroscopic constants and
vibrational frequencies for this ion. In addition to exhibiting various Fermi resonances, C$_2$N$_3^-$
displays a bright $\nu$2 (2130.9 cm$^{-1}$) and a less intense $\nu$1 (2190.7 cm$^{-1}$) fundamental
vibrational frequency, making for strong markers for future infrared observations < 5$\mu$m.
We have also determined near-IR overtone and combination bands of the bright fundamentals for which
the 2$\nu$2 at 4312.1 cm$^{-1}$ (2.319 $\mu$m) is the best candidate. C$_2$N$_3^-$ could potentially
exist and be detected in nitrogen-rich environments of the ISM such as IRC +10216 and other carbon-rich
circumstellar envelopes, or in the atmosphere of Saturn's moon Titan, where advanced N-based reactions
may lead to its formation.
