By performing a critical analysis of the fundamental equations of linear-response (LR) formalism
in molecules, we explore the interplay between locality of the response density operator and numerical
convergence of LR-related quantities. We show that for frequencies below the first ionization
potential (IP) of the system, it is possible to express the response density by employing localized
states only. Above this threshold energy, such a locality property cannot be achieved. Such considerations
may be transposed in terms of the molecule's excited states. We show that not all the system's excitations
can be considered on equal footing. There is a discrete sector of excitations -- which may also extend
above IP -- that can be parametrized by observable, localized states, which can be computationally
expressed with high precision, provided an adequate level of completeness. We present indicators
that can help to quantify such potential observable properties of an excitation, that can be evaluated
in any discretization scheme. The remaining excitation modes belong to a continuum spectrum that,
on the contrary, is not directly associated to observable properties and can only be effectively
represented in a given computational setup. Such considerations are important not only for reproducibility
of the results among different computer codes employing diverse formalisms, but also in view of
providing a deeper understanding on the impact of models' approximations on the scientific outcomes
of the simulation.
