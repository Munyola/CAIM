Precipitable water vapor (PWV) is an important climate parameter indicative of available moisture
in the atmosphere; it is also an important greenhouse gas. Observations of precipitable water vapor
in sub-Sahel West Africa are almost non-existent. Several Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) sites
have been established across West Africa, and observations from four of them, namely, Ilorin (4.34o
E, 8.32o N), Cinzana (5.93o W, 13.28o N), Banizoumbou (2.67o E, 13.54o N) and Dakar (16.96o W, 14.39o
N) are being used in this study. Data spanning the period from 2004 to 2014 have been selected; they
include conventional humidity parameters, remotely sensed aerosol and precipitable water information
and numerical model outputs. Since in Africa, only conventional information on humidity parameters
is available, it is important to utilize the unique observations from the AERONET network to calibrate
empirical formulas frequently used to estimate precipitable water vapor from humidity measurements.
An empirical formula of the form PWV=aT_d+b where T_d is the surface dew point temperature, a and
b are constants, was fitted to the data and is proposed as applicable to the climatic condition of
the sub-Sahel. Moreover, we have also used the AERONET information to evaluate the capabilities
of well-established numerical weather prediction (NWP) models such as ERA Interim Reanalysis,
NCEP-DOE Reanalysis II and NCEP-CFSR, to estimate precipitable water vapor in the sub-Sahel West
Africa; it was found that the models tend to overestimate the amount of precipitable water at the
selected sites by about 25 %.
