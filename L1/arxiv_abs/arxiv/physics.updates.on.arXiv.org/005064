Light interaction with the turbulent ocean can be fully characterized with the help of the power
spectrum of the water's refractive index fluctuations, resulting from the combined effect of two
scalars, temperature and salinity concentration advected by the velocity field. The Nikishovs'
model [Fluid Mech. Res. 27, 8298 (2000)] frequently used in the analysis of light evolution through
the turbulent ocean channels is the linear combination of the temperature spectrum, the salinity
spectrum and their co-spectrum, each being described by an approximate expression developed by
Hill [J. Fluid Mech. 88, 541562 (1978)] in the first of his four suggested models. The forth of the
Hill's models provides much more precise power spectrum than the first one expressed via a non-linear
differential equation that does not have a closed-form solution. We develop an accurate analytic
approximation to the forth Hill's model valid for Prandtl numbers in the interval $[3,3000]$ and
use it for the development of a more precise oceanic power spectrum. To illustrate the advantage
of our model we include numerical examples relating to the spherical wave scintillation index evolving
in the underwater turbulent channels with different average temperatures, and, hence, different
Prandtl numbers for temperature and salinity. Since our model is valid for a large range of Prandtl
numbers it can be readily adjusted to oceanic waters with seasonal or extreme average temperature
and/or salinity or any other turbulent fluid with one or several advected quantities.
