The SFA (Strong-Field Approximation) is routinely cited as the standard analytical approximation
method for strong-field laser-induced processes. Fundamental errors can arise because this name
has been applied to multiple disparate approximations. These can be reduced to two categories.
Methods that begin with the dipole approximation are labeled SEFA (Strong Electric-Field Approximation),
since they are limited to effects of oscillatory electric fields. The other category is termed the
SPFA (Strong Propagating-Field Approximation), and is directly related to actual laser fields.
Numerical solution of the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation (TDSE) is an SEFA method. Oscillatory
electric fields and propagating fields are different electromagnetic phenomena, and similarity
in behavior fails as the frequency declines and/or intensity increases. Physical intuition based
on SEFA methods can be unreliable for laser fields. The SPFA has broad applicability because it connects
continuously into proper relativistic results at both high and low frequencies, and because effects
of a laser field differ from those of an oscillatory electric field of the same frequency and amplitude
even when the dipole approximation is nominally valid. Known correction terms to the SPFA provide,
in a single theoretical framework, the strong-field effects developed over many years by SEFA methods
of uncertain reliability for actual laser fields. Some proposed nondipole corrections to the SEFA
are shown to be unreliable for laser fields.
