Grate and co-workers at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory recently developed high information
content triazine-based sequence-defined polymers that are robust by not having hydrolyzable
bonds and can encode structure and functionality by having various side chains. Through molecular
dynamics (MD) simulations, the triazine polymers have been shown to form particular sequential
stacks, have stable backbone-backbone interactions through hydrogen bonding and $\pi$-$\pi$
interactions, and conserve their \emph{cis/trans} conformations throughout the simulation.
However, we do not know the effects of having different side chains and backbone structures on the
entire conformation and whether the \emph{cis} or \emph{trans} conformation is more stable for
the triazine polymers. For this reason, we investigate the role of non-covalent interactions for
different side chains and backbone structures on the conformation and assembly of triazine polymers
in MD simulations. Since there is a high energy barrier associated to the \emph{cis}-\emph{trans}
isomerization, we use replica exchange molecular dynamics (REMD) to sample various conformations
of triazine hexamers. To obtain rates and intermediate conformations, we use the recently developed
concurrent adaptive sampling (CAS) algorithm for dimer of triazine trimers. We found that the hydrogen
bonding ability of the backbone structure is critical for the triazine polymers to self-assemble
into nanorod-like structures, rather than that of the side chains, which can help researchers design
more robust materials.
