The plastic deformation processes that occur in a tensily deformed High Density Polyethylene specimen
were studied from full-field strain and strain rate measurements obtained by 3D DIC (Digital Image
Correlation).The tensile tests were performed every 10{\textdegree}C from room temperature
to 120{\textdegree}C . For temperatures below 60{\textdegree}C , it is shown that the strain localization
effect becomes less pronounced when the temperature increases. For temperatures higher than 60{\textdegree}C
, the material is found to exhibit double yielding behavior. By analyzing the DIC data in Lagrangian
representation, it was possible to quantitatively highlight the strain localization effect that
is specifically associated with the second yield. The second yield strain (E_{Y_2}) was measured
and appeared to be independent of temperature. For temperatures smaller than 60{\textdegree}C
, it was found that the threshold strain corresponding to (E_{Y_2}) also marks the onset of the deformation
process phase during which the volume strain strongly increases. Based on previous studies of our
research team and on literature we concluded that the critical strain (E_{Y_2}) corresponds to
the onset of the lamellar morphology destruction. At high strain levels, the neck stabilization
phase was shown to proceed according to a strain driven scheme characterized by threshold strains
that are temperature independent. The experimental values of the threshold strain marking the
onset of the stabilization phase are found to be in good agreement with those found using the Haward-Thackray
model.
