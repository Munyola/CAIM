Designing a thin film structure often begins with choosing a specific yet conventional film deposition
method. In other words, a film deposition system in which two deposition methods complementary
one another are physically yet practically hybridized should lead us to new ways of designing thin
film structures with structural complexity controlled at a level that has never been envisioned.
This premise inspired us to uniquely combine atomic layer deposition (ALD) and magnetron sputtering
(SPU) within a single deposition chamber; the combined film deposition system is referred to as
sputtering atomic layer augmented deposition (SALAD). SALAD allows us to take full advantages
of both ALD ensuring precise and accurate delivery of precursors and SPU offering versatility in
choosing a chemical element. A SALAD system was designed based on knowledge obtained by computational
fluid dynamics with the goal of conceiving a film deposition system that satisfied deposition conditions
distinctive for both ALD and SPU, and a prototype SALAD system was assembled by employing off-the-shelf
vacuum components. As a demonstration, the SALAD system was utilized to deposit a unique nanocomposite
made of a stack of aluminum oxide thin films by ALD and copper thin films by SPU (i.e., AlOx-Cu nanocomposite)
on a Si substrate. Spectroscopic reflectivity collected on the AlOx-Cu nanocomposite shows unique
dispersion features to which conventional effective medium theories used for describing optical
properties of composites made of a dielectric host that contains metallic inclusions do not seem
to simply apply.
