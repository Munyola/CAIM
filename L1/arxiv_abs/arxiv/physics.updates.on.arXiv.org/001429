We theoretically investigate the use of Rayleigh surface acoustic waves (SAWs) for refractive
index modulation in optical waveguides consisting of amophous dielectrics. Considering low-loss
Si$_3$N$_4$ waveguides with a standard core cross section of 4.4$\times$0.03~$\mu$m$^2$ size,
buried 8-$\mu$m deep in a SiO$_2$ cladding we compare surface acoustic wave generation in various
different geometries via a piezo-active, lead zirconate titanate film placed on top of the surface
and driven via an interdigitized transducer (IDT). Using numerical solutions of the acoustic and
optical wave equations, we determine the strain distribution of SAW modes under resonant excitation,
and the electric field distribution of the fundamental optical mode near the waveguide core. From
the overlap of the acoustic strain field with the optical mode field we calculate and maximize the
attainable amplitude of index modulation in the waveguide. For the example of a near-infrared wavelength
of 840~nm, a maximum relative refractive index modulation of 1.2x10$^{-3}$ was obtained for an
IDT period of 30~$\mu$m, a film thickness of 4~$\mu$m, and using an IDT voltage and modulation frequency
of 10~V and 90~MHz, respectively. This relative index change is about 300-times higher than in previous
work based on non-resonant proximity piezo-actuation, and the modulation frequency is about 200-times
higher. Exploiting the maximum relative index change of 1.2$\times$10$^{-3}$ in a Mach-Zehnder
modulator should allow full-contrast modulation in devices as short as 120~$\mu$m.
