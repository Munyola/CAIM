One of the highlights of 2012 in physics is related to two papers, published by the ATLAS and the CMS
Collaborations, that announced the discovery of at least one new particle in pp collisions at CERN
LHC. At least one of the properties of this new particle is found to be similar to that of the Higgs boson,
the last and most difficult to find building block from the Standard Model of particle physics. Physics
teachers are frequently approached by their media-educated students, who inquire about the properties
of the Higgs boson, but physics teachers are rarely trained to teach this elusive aspect of particle
physics in elementary, middle or junior high schools. In this paper I describe a card-game, that
can be considered as a hands-on and easily accessible tool that allows interested teachers, students
and also motivated lay-persons to play with the properties of the newly found Higgs-like particle.
This new particle was detected through its decays to directly observable, final state particles.
Many of these final state particles are represented in a deck of cards, that represent elementary
particles, originally invented to popularize the physics of quark matter in the so-called Quark
Matter Card Games. The Higgs decay properties can be utilized, playfully, in a Higgs boson search
card game. The rules of this game illustrate also the need for some luck, to complement knowledge
and memory, useful skills that this game also helps to develop. The paper is organized as a handout
or booklet, that directly describes how to play the Higgs boson on Your Own card game.
