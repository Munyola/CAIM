We define a general class of network formation models, Statistical Exponential Random Graph Models
(SERGMs), that nest standard exponential random graph models (ERGMs) as a special case. We analyze
conditions for practical and consistent estimation of the associated network formation parameters,
addressing two open issues in the estimation of exponential random graph models. First, there are
no previous general results on whether estimates of such a model's parameters based a single network
are consistent (i.e., become accurate as the number of nodes grows). Second, a recent literature
has shown that standard techniques of estimating ERGMs have exponentially slow mixing times for
many specifications in which case the software used for estimating these models will be unreliable.
SERGMs reformulate network formation as a distribution over the space of sufficient statistics
instead of the space of networks, greatly reducing the size of the space of estimation and making
estimation practical and easy. We identify general classes of models for which maximum likelihood
estimates are consistent and asymptotically normally distributed. We also develop a related,
but distinct, class of models that we call subgraph generation models (SUGMs) that are useful for
modeling sparse networks and whose parameter estimates are also consistent and asymptotically
normally distributed. We show how choice-based (strategic) network formation models can be written
as SERGMs and SUGMs, and illustrate the application of our models and techniques with network data
from villages in Karnataka, India.
