The diffusion of enzymes is of fundamental importance for many biochemical processes. Enhanced
or directed enzyme diffusion can alter the accessibility of substrates and the organization of
enzymes within cells. Several studies based on fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) report
enhanced diffusion of enzymes upon interaction with their substrate or inhibitor. In this context,
major importance is given to the enzyme fructose-bisphosphate aldolase, for which enhanced diffusion
has been reported even though the catalysed reaction is endothermic. Additionally, enhanced diffusion
of tracer particles surrounding the active aldolase enzymes has been reported. These studies suggest
that active enzymes can act as chemical motors that self-propel and give rise to enhanced diffusion.
However, fluorescence studies of enzymes can, despite several advantages, suffer from artefacts.
Here we show that the absolute diffusion coefficients of active enzyme solutions can be determined
with Pulsed Field Gradient Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (PFG-NMR). The advantage of PFG-NMR is that
the motion of the molecule of interest is directly observed in its native state without the need for
any labelling. Further, PFG-NMR is model-free and thus yields absolute diffusion constants. Our
PFG-NMR experiments of solutions containing active fructose bisphosphate aldolase from rabbit
muscle do not show any diffusion enhancement for the active enzymes nor the surrounding molecules.
Additionally, we do not observe any diffusion enhancement of aldolase in the presence of its inhibitor
pyrophosphate.
