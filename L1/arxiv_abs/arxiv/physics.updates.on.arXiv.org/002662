Recently, Weyl semimetals have been experimentally discovered in both inversion-symmetry-breaking
and time-reversal-symmetry-breaking crystals. The non-trivial topology in Weyl semimetals
can manifest itself with exotic phenomena which have been extensively investigated by photoemission
and transport measurements. Despite the numerous experimental efforts on Fermi arcs and chiral
anomaly, the existence of unconventional zeroth Landau levels, as a unique hallmark of Weyl fermions
which is highly related to chiral anomaly, remains elusive owing to the stringent experimental
requirements. Here, we report the magneto-optical study of Landau quantization in Weyl semimetal
NbAs. High magnetic fields drive the system towards the quantum limit which leads to the observation
of zeroth chiral Landau levels in two inequivalent Weyl nodes. As compared to other Landau levels,
the zeroth chiral Landau level exhibits a distinct linear dispersion in z momentum direction and
allows the optical transitions without the limitation of zero z momentum or square root of magnetic
field evolution. The magnetic field dependence of the zeroth Landau levels further verifies the
predicted particle-hole asymmetry of the Weyl cones. Meanwhile, the optical transitions from
the normal Landau levels exhibit the coexistence of multiple carriers including an unexpected
massive Dirac fermion, pointing to a more complex topological nature in inversion-symmetry-breaking
Weyl semimetals. Our results provide insights into the Landau quantization of Weyl fermions and
demonstrate an effective tool for studying complex topological systems.
