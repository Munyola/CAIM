Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is being increasingly adopted as a label-free and non-invasive
technique for biomedical applications such as cancer and ocular disease diagnosis. Diagnostic
information for these tissues is manifest in textural and geometric features of the OCT images which
are used by human expertise to interpret and triage. However, it suffers delays due to long process
of conventional diagnostic procedure and shortage of human expertise. Here, a custom deep learning
architecture, LightOCT, is proposed for classification of OCT images into diagnostically relevant
classes. LightOCT is a convolutional neural network with only 2 convolutional layers and a fully
connected layer, but it is shown to provide excellent training and test results for diverse OCT image
datasets. We show that LightOCT provides > 99% accuracy in classifying 44 normal and 44 cancerous
(invasive ductal carcinoma) breast tissues collected from 22 patients to perform the study. Also,
~99% accuracy in classifying public datasets of ocular OCT images as normal, age-related macular
degeneration and diabetic macular edema. Additionally, we show ~96% test accuracy for classifying
retinal images as belonging to choroidal neovascularization, diabetic macular edema, drusen
and normal samples on a large public dataset of more than 100,000 images. Through this, we show that
LightOCT can provide simultaneous significant diagnostic support for variety of OCT images with
sufficient training and very little hyper-parameter tuning.
