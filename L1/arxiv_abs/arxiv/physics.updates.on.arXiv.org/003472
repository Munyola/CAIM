Metasurfaces based on gap surface-plasmon resonators allow one to arbitrarily control the phase,
amplitude and polarization of reflected light with high efficiency. However, the performance
of densely-packed metasurfaces is reduced, often quite significantly, in comparison with simple
analytical predictions. We argue that this reduction is mainly because of the near-field coupling
between metasurface elements, which results in response from each element being different from
the one anticipated by design simulations, which are commonly conducted for each individual element
being placed in an artificial periodic arrangement. In order to study the influence of near-field
coupling, we fabricate meta-elements of varying sizes arranged in quasi-periodic arrays so that
the immediate environment of same size elements is different for those located in the middle and
at the border of the arrays. We study the near-field using a phase-resolved scattering-type scanning
near-field optical microscopy (s-SNOM) and conducting numerical simulations. By comparing the
near-field maps from elements of the same size but different placements we evaluate the near-field
coupling strength, which is found to be significant for large and densely packed elements. This
technique is quite generic and can be used practically for any metasurface type in order to precisely
measure the near-field response from each individual element and identify malfunctioning ones,
providing feedback to their design and fabrication, thereby allowing one to improve the efficiency
of the whole metasurface.
