Digital holographic microscopy is an emerging potentially low-cost alternative to conventional
light microscopy for micro-object imaging on earth, underwater and in space. Immediate access
to micron-scale objects however requires a well-balanced system design and sophisticated reconstruction
algorithms, that are commercially available, however not accessible cost-efficiently. Here,
we present an open-source implementation of a lens-less digital inline holographic microscope
platform, based on off-the-shelf optical, electronic and mechanical components, costing less
than $ 190. It employs a Blu-Ray semiconductor-laser-pickup or a light-emitting-diode, a pinhole,
a 3D-printed housing consisting of 3 parts and a single-board portable computer and camera with
an open-source implementation of the Fresnel-Kirchhoff routine. We demonstrate 1.55 {\mu}m spatial
resolution by laser-pickup and 3.91 {\mu}m by the light-emitting-diode source. The housing and
mechanical components are 3D printed. Both printer and reconstruction software source codes are
open. The light-weight microscope allows to image label-free micro-spheres of 6.5 {\mu}m diameter,
human red-blood-cells of about 8 {\mu}m diameter as well as fast-growing plant Nicotiana-tabacum-BY-2
suspension cells with 50 {\mu}m sizes. The imaging capability is validated by imaging-contrast
quantification involving a standardized test target. The presented 3D-printable portable open-source
platform represents a fully-open design, low-cost modular and versatile imaging-solution for
use in high- and low-resource areas of the world.
