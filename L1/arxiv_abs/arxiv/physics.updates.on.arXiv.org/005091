Parameter extension simulation (PES) as a mathematical method for simulating turbulent flows
has been proposed in the study. It is defined as a calculation of the turbulent flow for the desired
parameter values with the help of a reference solution. A typical PES calculation is composed of
three consecutive steps: Set up the asymptotic relationship between the desired solution and the
reference solution; Calculate the reference solution and the necessary asymptotic coefficients;
Extend the reference solution to the desired parameter values. A controlled eddy simulation (CES)
method has been developed to calculate the reference solution and the asymptotic coefficients.
The CES method is a special type of large eddy simulation (LES) method in which a weight coefficient
and an artificial force distribution are used to model part of the turbulent motions. The artificial
force distribution is modeled based on the eddy viscosity assumption. The reference weight coefficient
and the asymptotic coefficients can be determined through a weight coefficient convergence study.
The proposed PES/CES method has been used to simulate four types of turbulent flows. They are decaying
homogeneous and isotropic turbulence, smooth wall channel flows, rough wall channel flows, and
compressor blade cascade flows. The numerical results show that the 0-order PES solution (or the
reference CES solution) has a similar accuracy as a traditional LES solution, while its computational
cost is much lower. A higher order PES method has an even higher model accuracy.
