A celebrated and controversial hypothesis conjectures that some biological systems --parts,
aspects, or groups of them-- may extract important functional benefits from operating at the edge
of instability, halfway between order and disorder, i.e. in the vicinity of the critical point of
a phase transition. Criticality has been argued to provide biological systems with an optimal balance
between robustness against perturbations and flexibility to adapt to changing conditions, as
well as to confer on them optimal computational capabilities, huge dynamical repertoires, unparalleled
sensitivity to stimuli, etc. Criticality, with its concomitant scale invariance, can be conjectured
to emerge in living systems as the result of adaptive and evolutionary processes that, for reasons
to be fully elucidated, select for it as a template upon which higher layers of complexity can rest.
This hypothesis is very suggestive as it proposes that criticality could constitute a general and
common organizing strategy in biology stemming from the physics of phase transitions. However,
despite its thrilling implications, this is still in its embryonic state as a well-founded theory
and, as such, it has elicited some healthy skepticism. From the experimental side, the advent of
high-throughput technologies has created new prospects in the exploration of biological systems,
and empirical evidence in favor of criticality has proliferated, with examples ranging from endogenous
brain activity and gene-expression patterns, to flocks of birds and insect-colony foraging, to
name but a few...
