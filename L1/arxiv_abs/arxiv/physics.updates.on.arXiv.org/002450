We experimentally study the influence of wall roughness on bubble drag reduction in turbulent Taylor-Couette
flow, i.e.\ the flow between two concentric, independently rotating cylinders. We measure the
drag in the system for the cases with and without air, and add roughness by installing transverse
ribs on either one or both of the cylinders. For the smooth wall case (no ribs) and the case of ribs on
the inner cylinder only, we observe strong drag reduction up to $DR=33\%$ and $DR=23\%$, respectively,
for a void fraction of $\alpha=6\%$. However, with ribs mounted on both cylinders or on the outer
cylinder only, the drag reduction is weak, less than $DR=11\%$, and thus quite close to the trivial
effect of reduced effective density. Flow visualizations show that stable turbulent Taylor vortices
--- large scale vortical structures --- are induced in these two cases, i.e. the cases with ribs on
the outer cylinder. These strong secondary flows move the bubbles away from the boundary layer,
making the bubbles less effective than what had previously been observed for the smooth-wall case.
Measurements with counter-rotating smooth cylinders, a regime in which pronounced Taylor rolls
are also induced, confirm that it is really the Taylor vortices that weaken the bubble drag reduction
mechanism. Our findings show that, although bubble drag reduction can indeed be effective for smooth
walls, its effect can be spoiled by e.g.\ biofouling and omnipresent wall roughness, as the roughness
can induce strong secondary flows.
