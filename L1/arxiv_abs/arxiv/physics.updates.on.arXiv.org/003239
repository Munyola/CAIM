The thermalization of hot carriers and phonons gives direct insight into the scattering processes
that mediate electrical and thermal transport. Obtaining the scattering rates for both hot carriers
and phonons currently requires multiple measurements with incommensurate timescales. Here,
transient extreme-ultraviolet (XUV) spectroscopy on the silicon 2p core level at 100 eV is used
to measure hot carrier and phonon thermalization in Si(100) from tens of femtoseconds to 200 ps following
photoexcitation of the indirect transition to the {\Delta} valley at 800 nm. The ground state XUV
spectrum is first theoretically predicted using a combination of a single plasmon pole model and
the Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) with density functional theory (DFT). The excited state spectrum
is predicted by incorporating the electronic effects of photo-induced state-filling, broadening,
and band-gap renormalization into the ground state XUV spectrum. A time-dependent lattice deformation
and expansion is also required to describe the excited state spectrum. The kinetics of these structural
components match the kinetics of phonons excited from the electron-phonon and phonon-phonon scattering
processes following photoexcitation. Separating the contributions of electronic and structural
effects on the transient XUV spectra allows the carrier population, the population of phonons involved
in inter- and intra-valley electron-phonon scattering, and the population of phonons involved
in phonon-phonon scattering to be quantified as a function of delay time.
