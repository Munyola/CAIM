Streamers, thin, ionized plasma channels, form the early stages of lightning discharges. Here
we approach the study of extraterrestrial lightning by studying the formation and propagation
of streamer discharges in various nitrogen-methane and nitrogen-oxygen mixtures with levels
of nitrogen from 20% to 98.4%. We present the friction force and breakdown fields Ek in various N2:O2
(Earth-like) and N2:CH4 (Titan-like) mixtures. The strength of the friction force is larger in
N2:CH4 mixtures whereas the breakdown field in mixtures with methane is half as large as in mixtures
with oxygen. We use a 2.5 dimensional Monte Carlo particle-in-cell code with cylindrical symmetry
to simulate the development of electron avalanches from an initial electron-ion patch in ambient
electric fields between 1.5Ek and 3Ek. We compare the electron density, the electric field, the
front velocities as well as the occurrence of avalanche-to-streamer transition between mixtures
with methane and with oxygen. Whereas we observe the formation of streamers in oxygen in all considered
cases, we observe streamer inceptions in methane for small percentages of nitrogen or for large
electric fields only. For large percentages of nitrogen or for small fields, ionization is not efficient
enough to form a streamer channel within the length of the simulation domain. In oxygen, positive
and negative streamers move faster for small percentages of nitrogen. In mixtures with methane,
electron or streamer fronts move 10-100 times slower than in mixtures with oxygen; the higher the
percentage of methane, the faster the fronts move.
