The emergence of second-generation high temperature superconducting tapes has favored the development
of large-scale superconductor systems. The mathematical models capable of estimating electromagnetic
quantities in superconductors have evolved from simple analytical models to complex numerical
models. The available analytical models are limited to the analysis of single wires or infinite
arrays that, in general, do not represent real devices in real applications. The numerical models
based on finite element method using the H formulation of the Maxwells equations are useful for the
analysis of more medium-size systems, but their application in large-scale systems is problematic
due to the excessive computational cost in terms of memory and the computation time. Then it is necessary
to devise new strategies to reduce the computational cost. The homogenization and the multi-scale
methods have successfully simplified the description of the systems allowing the study of large-scale
systems. Also, efficient calculations have been achieved using the T-A formulation. In this manuscript,
we derived the adequate order of the elements used in the T-A formulation to avoid sporous oscillations
in the current density. More importantly, we propose a series of adaptations to the multi-scale
and homogenization methods so that they can be efficiently used in conjunction with the T-A formulation.
The computation time and the amount of memory are substantially reduced up to a point that it makes
possible to achieve real-time simulations for slow ramping cycles of practical importance.
