The Carrington storm (September 1/2, 1859) is one of the largest magnetic storms ever observed and
it has caused global auroral displays in low-latitude areas, together with a series of multiple
magnetic storms during August 28 and September 4, 1859. In this study, we revisit contemporary auroral
observation records to extract information on their elevation angle, color, and direction to investigate
this stormy interval in detail. We first examine their equatorward boundary of "auroral emission
with multiple colors" based on descriptions of elevation angle and color. We find that their locations
were 36.5 deg ILAT on August 28/29 and 32.7 deg ILAT on September 1/2, suggesting that trapped electrons
moved to, at least, L~1.55 and L~1.41, respectively. The equatorward boundary of "purely red emission"
was likely located at 30.8 deg ILAT on September 1/2. If "purely red emission" was a stable auroral
red arc, it would suggest that trapped protons moved to, at least, L~1.36. This reconstruction with
observed auroral emission regions provides conservative estimations of magnetic storm intensities.
We compare the auroral records with magnetic observations. We confirm that multiple magnetic storms
occurred during this stormy interval, and that the equatorward expansion of the auroral oval is
consistent with the timing of magnetic disturbances. It is possible that the August 28/29 interplanetary
coronal mass ejections (ICMEs) cleared out the interplanetary medium, making the ICMEs for the
Carrington storm on September 1/2 more geoeffective.
