A new section of databases and programs devoted to double crystallographic groups (point and space
groups) has been implemented in the Bilbao Crystallographic Server (this http URL). The double
crystallographic groups are required in the study of physical systems whose Hamiltonian includes
spin-dependent terms. In the symmetry analysis of such systems, instead of the irreducible representations
of the space groups, it is necessary to consider the single- and double-valued irreducible representations
of the double space groups. The new section includes databases of symmetry operations (DGENPOS)
and of irreducible representations of the double (point and space) groups (REPRESENTATIONS DPG
and REPRESENTATIONS DSG). The tool DCOMPATIBILITY RELATIONS provides compatibility relations
between the irreducible representations of double space groups at different k-vectors of the Brillouin
zone when there is a group-subgroup relation between the corresponding little groups. The program
DSITESYM implements the so-called site-symmetry approach, which establishes symmetry relations
between localized and extended crystal states, using representations of the double groups. As
an application of this approach, the program BANDREP calculates the band representations and the
elementary band representations induced from any Wyckoff position of any of the 230 double space
groups, giving information about the properties of these bands. Recently, the results of BANDREP
have been extensively applied in the description and the search of topological insulators.
