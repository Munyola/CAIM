The occurrence of metavolcanic rocks within the Paleozoic basement of the Alpi Apuane metamorphic
complex has been known since long time. Among them, some massive porphyritic tourmaline-bearing
rocks cropping out in the southern sector of the Alpi Apuane present some distinctive and peculiar
features, differing from the better known middle Ordovician metarhyolites of the Porfiroidi e
scisti porfirici Fm. The porphyritic tourmaline-bearing rocks belong to the recently proposed
Fornovolasco Metarhyolite Fm. They are granular to porphyritic, with phenocrysts of quartz (often
with magmatic embayment), pseudomorphosed feldspars, and mica (both biotite and muscovite),
in a groundmass formed by quartz, white mica, albite, and Kfeldspar. Tourmaline (schorl-dravite
in composition) is an abundant accessory mineral, in some cases forming cm-sized spots. The studied
rocks plot into the rhyolite field of the Total Alkali vs Silica classification diagram. They show
a peraluminous nature, having an Alumina Saturation Index ranging from 1.3 and 3.2. Their trace-element
signature is that typical of highly evolved orogenic magmas. Laser ablationICPMS UPb datings on
zircon suggest a Permian crystallization age (weighted average ages of the four samples ranging
from 292 and 271 Ma), thus relating these rocks to a post-Variscan magmatism. This new dating represents
the very first evidence of a Permian magmatism in the pre-Triassic basement of the Northern Apennines.
The potential relationships between Permian felsic magmatism and the ore genesis in the Alpi Apuane
metamorphic complex are also discussed.
