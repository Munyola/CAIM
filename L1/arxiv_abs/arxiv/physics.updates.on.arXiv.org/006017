This study aims to investigate the possible sources of non-axisymmetric disturbances and their
propagation mechanism in Taylor Couette flow (TCF) for wide gap problems using direct numerical
simulation with a radius ratio of 0.5 and Reynolds number (Re) ranging from 60 to 650. Here, attention
is focused on the viscous layer (VL) thickness in near-wall regions and its spatial distribution
along the axial direction to gain an insight into the origin and propagation of non-axisymmetric
disturbances. The results show that an axisymmetric Taylor-vortex flow occurs when Re is between
68 and 425. Above Re = 425, transition from axisymmetric to non-axisymmetric flow is observed up
to Re = 575 before the emergence of wavy-vortex flow. From the variation of VL thickness with Re, the
VL does not experience any significant changes in the flow separation region of the inner wall, as
well as jet impingement region of both the inner and outer walls. However, a sudden increase in VL
thickness in the flow separation region of the outer wall reveals possible source of non-axisymmetric
disturbances in the flow separation region of the outer wall. These disturbances develop into the
periodic secondary flow as the axisymmetric flow transforms into non-axisymmetric flow and this
leads to the emergence of azimuthal wave. The periodic secondary flow contributes to sudden increase
in the natural wavelength and rapid reduction in the strength of two counter-rotating Taylor vortices.
This in turn leads to a substantial reduction of torque in the transition flow vis-a-vis axisymmetric
Taylor-vortex flow.
