In a succession of research articles published over 65 years ago, Sir Alan Lloyd Hodgkin and Sir Andrew
Fielding Huxley discovered what now forms our contemporary understanding of excitation in nerve,
and how axons conduct the action potential. Hodgkin and Huxley demonstrated that the nerve action
potential is the result of a depolarizing event across a cell membrane. They established that when
this depolarization event is complete, an abrupt increase in voltage gets produced that propagates
longitudinally along the axon, accompanied by changes in axial conductance. In an elegant theoretical
framework, they rigorously described fundamental properties of the sodium (Na) and potassium
(K) conductances intrinsic to the action potential. Notwithstanding the elegance of Hodgkin and
Huxley's incisive and explicative series of discoveries, their model is relatively complex, relies
on no small number of stochastic factors, and has no analytical solution, solving for the membrane
action potential and the ionic currents requires integrations approximated using numerical methods.
In this article I present an analytical (i.e., closed-form) formalism of the nerve action potential
Vm and that of the accompanying cell membrane electric field Em. To conclude this article, I'll present
a quantitative description of Vm in terms of a single, nonlinear differential equation. This is
an original stand-alone article: it unifies, and brings into a clearer focus two preceding papers
concerned with the analytical description of the nerve action potential Vm and the accompanying
cell membrane electric field Em.
