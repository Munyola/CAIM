A suite of products has been developed and evaluated to assess hazards presented by convective storm
downbursts derived from the current generation of Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite
(GOES) (13-15). The existing suite of GOES downburst prediction products employs the GOES sounder
to calculate risk based on conceptual models of favorable environmental profiles for convective
downburst generation. A diagnostic nowcasting product, the Microburst Windspeed Potential Index
(MWPI), is designed to infer attributes of a favorable downburst environment: 1) the presence of
large convective available potential energy (CAPE), and 2) the presence of a surface-based or elevated
mixed layer with a steep temperature lapse rate and vertical relative humidity gradient. These
conditions foster intense convective downdrafts upon the interaction of sub-saturated air in
the elevated or sub-cloud mixed layer with the storm precipitation core. This paper provides an
updated assessment of the MWPI algorithm, presents recent case studies demonstrating effective
operational use of the MWPI product over the Atlantic coastal region, and presents validation results
for the United States Great Plains and Mid-Atlantic coastal region. In addition, an application
of the brightness temperature difference (BTD) between GOES imager water vapor (6.5{\mu}m) and
thermal infrared (11{\mu}m) channels that identifies regions where downbursts are likely to develop,
due to mid-tropospheric dry air entrainment, will be outlined.
