The Pulsed RF Heating (PRFH) is the well known effect in the development of high gradient accelerating
cavities. There is a lot of research dedicated to the tolerable strength of electromagnetic field
and the corresponding temperature rise leading to the surface degradation and cavity performance
violation. To provide high quality of electron bunches, RF gun cavities operate in electron sources
with high electric, and hence, magnetic RF fields. Being at the safe side with respect to cavity surface
degradation, related to the PRFH result for S band in essentially transient thermal deformations,
leading to the cavity frequency shift and quality factor change even within a few microseconds in
the RF pulse. Thermo-elastic deformations consist of slow heat propagation from the cavity surface
and fast elastic wave propagation from the very thin heated surface layer inside the cavity body
with different in five orders typical velocities. For simulations of PRFH effects for more or less
practical cavity design we can get results only in direct numerical simulations with certified
software like ANSYS. The critical issue for such direct simulations is to combine in a single model
the possibility of correct description for such qualitatively different process and to prove the
reasonable precision of simulations. This report describes the procedure for simulation of PRFH
related transient thermo-elastic deformations in S band cavities. The results of test simulations
are presented to show the relative precision of simulations.
