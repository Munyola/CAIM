The last two decades have witnessed an exponential growth and tremendous developments in wireless
technologies and systems, and their associated applications. In the recent years following 2006,
there has been a great surge in interest in the newly emerging plasmonics nanotechnology because
this new device technology provides tremendous synergy between electronic and photonic devices.
Electronics devices are down-scalable up to the nanoscale size but have limited processor speed
due to thermal and signal delay issues associated with electronic devices. On the other hand, photonic
devices have extremely high speed and high data carrying capacity but are limited in size to the diffraction
law such that the size of a photonic device should be equal to about half of its operational wavelength.
The size mismatch between electronic devices and photonic devices inhibits the advantageous interfacing
between these two device technologies and here plasmonics nanotechnology plays the important
role of interfacing these two technologies. Plasmonics technology provides high speed interconnections
with high data carrying capacity between nano-scale electronic devices opening a new field of research
which is on-chip high speed nano-networks [28]. It is this great advantage of plasmonics technology
that made it a very interesting technology for implementation for the design of a miniature real-time
biosensor. In our plasmonic biosensor design, we utilized a subset of plasmonics technology which
is surface plasmon wave generation in order to continuously monitor the concentration of a desired
analyte.
