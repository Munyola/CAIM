Online measurement of diameters and concentricities of optical fibre layers, and the coating layer
in particular, is one of the challenges in fibre manufacturing. Currently available instruments
can measure concentricity and diameter of layers offline, and are not suitable for precise monitoring
or control of the manufacturing process in real time. In this work, we use two laser beams, positioned
orthogonally to illuminate the fibre from two sides, and calculate deviations from the expected
geometry by analysing the scattering pattern. To measure the diffraction pattern we use two 8K linear
array detectors, with the scattered light incident directly on the sensors. Each detector is capturing
approximately 90 degree angular range directly behind the fibre. The two measurement channels
are positioned at different heights. The scattered pattern is modelled mathematically with finite-element
and Fourier-modal methods, with various diameter and concentricity deviations. The sensitivities
of the changes in the scattering pattern are identified in respect to these deviations. Since calculations
are computationally intensive, the sensitivities are pre-calculated in advance, and the real-time
measurement is based on pattern recognition. The symmetry of the pattern is used to differentiate
between diameter and concentricity variations. We performed online measurements with the prototype
instrument in production conditions, and show that this method is sensitive enough to measure deviations
of under 1 {\mu}m in diameter and concentricity of the coating layer.
