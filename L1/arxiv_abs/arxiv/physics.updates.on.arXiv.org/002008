According to what has become a standard history of quantum mechanics, in 1932 von Neumann persuaded
the physics community that hidden variables are impossible as a matter of principle, after which
leading proponents of the Copenhagen interpretation put the situation to good use by arguing that
the completeness of quantum mechanics was undeniable. This state of affairs lasted, so the story
continues, until Bell in 1966 exposed von Neumann's proof as obviously wrong. The realization that
von Neumann's proof was fallacious then rehabilitated hidden variables and made serious foundational
research possible again. It is often added in recent accounts that von Neumann's error had been spotted
almost immediately by Grete Hermann, but that her discovery was of no effect due to the dominant Copenhagen
Zeitgeist. We shall attempt to tell a story that is more historically accurate and less ideologically
charged. Most importantly, von Neumann never claimed to have shown the impossibility of hidden
variables tout court, but argued that hidden-variable theories must possess a structure that deviates
fundamentally from that of quantum mechanics. Both Hermann and Bell appear to have missed this point,
moreover, both raised unjustified technical objections to the proof. Von Neumann's argument was
basically that hidden-variables schemes must violate the "quantum principle" that physical quantities
are to be represented by operators in a Hilbert space. As a consequence, hidden-variables schemes,
though possible in principle, necessarily exhibit a certain kind of contextuality.
