In this paper we assessed changes in scaling properties of the river Danube level and flow data, associated
with building of Djerdap/Iron Gates hydrological power plants positioned on the border of Romania
and Serbia. We used detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA), wavelet transform spectral analysis
(WTS) and wavelet-based modulus maxima method (WTMM) to investigate time series of river levels
and river flows recorded at hydrological stations in the vicinity of dams and in the area of up to 480
km upstream from dams, and time series of simulated NOAA-CIRES 20th Century Global Reanalysis precipitation
records for the Djerdap/Iron Gates region. By comparing river dynamics during the periods before
and after construction of dams, we were able to register changes in scaling that are different for
recordings from upstream and from downstream (from dams) areas. We found that damming caused appearance
of human-made or enhancement of natural cycles in the small time scales region, which largely influenced
the change in temporal scaling in downstream recording stations. We additionally found disappearance
or decline in the amplitude of large-time-scale cycles as a result of damming, that changed the dynamics
of upstream data. The most prominent finding of our paper is a demonstration of a complete or partial
loss of annual cycles in the upstream stations' data that we found to extend as far as 220 km from dams.
We discussed probable sources of such found changes in scaling, aiming to provide explanations
that could be of use in future environmental assessments.
