Simulation is a powerful tool to study the behavior of physical, environmental, and social systems
under different conditions. Evacuation simulation can be used to estimate the required time for
people to exit a building or evacuate disaster exposed regions. While building evacuation simulation
has seen significant study, city evacuation simulation is less developed. For evacuation simulations
using Agent-Based Models, the characteristics of the underlying navigation algorithms are important
in the overall efficiency of the simulation. In some disasters, e.g. earthquakes, evacuation takes
place after the main event. This means evacuating and navigating in an environment with damaged
and collapsed buildings and bridges and obstructed roads and paths. Furthermore, possible aftershocks
or induced phenomena, such as landslide and liquefaction, can render a more dynamic situation for
evacuees where the physical environment changes through time. Evacuees, modeled as agents, require
a reliable algorithm for their navigation in these complex dynamic environments. A reliable navigation
algorithm should be capable of handling obstacles with different physical properties and performing
through dynamic environments. In this study, a framework is introduced to evaluate the relative
performance of agent navigation algorithms. The main indices of this framework are Convergence,
Optimality, Precision, and Efficiency (COPE). The COPE framework is applied on a set of robot navigation
algorithms (the Bug Family) to assess their suitability to be used as pedestrian navigation algorithms.
