Recent development in computer processing power leads to new paradigms of how problems in many-body
physics and especially polymer physics can be addressed. GPU parallel processors can be employed
to generate millions of independent configurations of polymeric molecules of heterogeneous sequence
in complex environments at a second, and concomitant free-energy landscapes estimated. Resulting
data bases that are complete in terms of polymer sequence and architecture are a powerful training
basis for multi-layer artificial neural networks, whose internal representations will potentially
lead to a new physical viewpoint in how sequence patterns are linked to effective polymer properties
and response to the environment. In our example, we consider the translocation time of a copolymer
through an amphiphilic bilayer membranes as a function of binary sequence of hydrophilic and hydrophobic
units. First we demonstrate that massively parallel Rosenbluth sampling for all possible sequences
of a polymer allows for meaningful dynamic interpretation in terms of the mean first escape times
through the membrane. Second we train a multi-layer perceptron, and show by a systematic reduction
of the training set to a narrow window of translocation times, that the neural network develops internal
representations of the physical rules mapping sequence to translocation times. In particular,
based on the narrow training set, the network predicts the correct order of magnitude of translocation
times in a window that is more than 8 orders of magnitude wider than the training window.
