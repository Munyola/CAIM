The gravity-driven spreading of one fluid in contact with another is of key importance to a range
of topics such as oil spills, flow in pipes, and gravity currents. A commonly employed model to describe
this phenomenon is the two-layer shallow-water equations, where the vertical averaging procedure
yields a vast simplification in comparison to the full balance equations. We present a comprehensive
study of two-layer spreading in the case where one layer is significantly deeper than the other.
Starting from the full two-layer shallow-water equations, we derive for the first time an effective
one-layer model that correctly captures the behaviour of shocks and contact discontinuities.
A consistent derivation of the shock velocity gives identical results to empirical models, and
to the shock velocity found theoretically with methods that are independent of the shallow-water
approach e.g. by von K\'arm\'an (1940) and Benjamin (1968). We further study one-dimensional lock-exchange
and derive expressions for the Froude number that are in good agreement with the widely employed
empirical expression by Benjamin. The good agreement for all cases considered suggests that the
breakdown of the shallow-water equations in vicinity of shocks is less severe than previously suggested.
Predictions from the one-layer model are found to be in excellent agreement with experiments, with
a mean relative deviation in the spreading radius of 4.5% for oil on water, 10.2% for evaporating
methane on water, and 4.2% for evaporating nitrogen on water.
