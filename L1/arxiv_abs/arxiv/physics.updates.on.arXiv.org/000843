Due to a higher capability in resolving white matter fiber crossings, Spherical Deconvolution
(SD) methods have become very popular in brain fiber-tracking applications. However, while some
of these estimation algorithms assume a central Gaussian distribution for the MRI noise, its real
distribution is known to be non-Gaussian and to depend on many factors such as the number of coils
and the methodology used to combine multichannel signals. Indeed, the two prevailing methods for
multichannel signal combination lead to noise patterns better described by Rician and noncentral
Chi distributions. Here we develop a Robust and Unbiased Model-BAsed Spherical Deconvolution
(RUMBA-SD) technique intended to deal with realistic MRI noise. The algorithm relies on a maximum
a posteriori formulation based on Rician and noncentral Chi likelihood models and includes a total
variation (TV) spatial regularization term. By means of a synthetic phantom contaminated with
noise mimicking patterns generated by data processing in multichannel scanners, the performance
of RUMBA-SD is compared to that of other well-established SD methods (i.e., CSD and dRL-SD). The
inclusion of proper likelihood models and TV regularization in RUMBA-SD leads to an increased ability
to resolve fiber crossings with smaller inter-fiber angles and an increased robustness to noise.
Finally, the proposed method is also validated in human brain data, producing the most stable fiber
reconstructions in front of differing noise types and diffusion schemes based on a small number
of gradient directions.
