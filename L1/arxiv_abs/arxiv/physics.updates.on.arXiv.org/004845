The interplay between charged particles and turbulent magnetic fields is crucial to understanding
how cosmic rays propagate through space. A key parameter which controls this interplay is the ratio
of the particle gyroradius to the correlation length of the magnetic turbulence. For the vast majority
of cosmic rays detected at the Earth, this parameter is small, and the particles are well confined
by the Galactic magnetic field. But for cosmic rays more energetic than about 30 EeV, this parameter
is large. These highest energy particles are not confined to the Milky Way and are presumed to be extragalactic
in origin. Identifying their sources requires understanding how they are deflected by the intergalactic
magnetic field, which appears to be weak, turbulent with an unknown correlation length, and possibly
spatially intermittent. This is particularly relevant given the recent detection by the Pierre
Auger Observatory of a significant dipole anisotropy in the arrival directions of cosmic rays of
energy above 8 EeV. Here we report measurements of energetic-particle propagation through a random
magnetic field in a laser-produced plasma. We characterize the diffusive transport of these particles
and recover experimentally pitch-angle scattering measurements and extrapolate to find their
mean free path and the associated diffusion coefficient, which show scaling-relations consistent
with theoretical studies. This experiment validates these theoretical tools for analyzing the
propagation of ultra-high energy cosmic rays through the intergalactic medium.
