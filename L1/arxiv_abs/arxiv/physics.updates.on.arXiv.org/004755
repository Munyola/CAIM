This paper numerically investigates the shear flow between double concentric spherical boundaries
rotating differentially, so-called spherical Couette flow, under unstable thermal stratification,
focusing on the boundary of the axisymmetric/non-axisymmetric transition in wide gap cases where
the inner radius is comparable to the clearance width. While the transition of SCF has been confirmed
experimentally in cases without thermal factor, insufficient knowledge on SCF subject to thermal
instability, related to geophysical problems especially in wide gap cases, has been accumulated
mainly based on numerical analysis; our motivation is to bridge the knowledge gap by a parameter
extension. We reconfirm that the transition under no thermal effect is initiated by a disturbance
visualised as a spiral pattern with n arms extending from the equatorial zone to the pole in each hemisphere,
at the critical Reynolds number, Recr, as previously reported. With increasing thermal factor,
the buoyancy effect assists the system rotation to trigger a transition towards non-axisymmetric
states, resulting in a relative decrease of Recr. This is in contrast with the result that the system
rotation apparently suppresses via Coriolis effect the transition to the thermally convective
states at low Reynolds numbers. The present study elucidates that the existence of the axisymmetric
state is restricted within a closed area in the extended parameter space, along the boundary of which
the spiral patterns observed experimentally in SCF continually connect to the classical spherical
Benard convective states.
