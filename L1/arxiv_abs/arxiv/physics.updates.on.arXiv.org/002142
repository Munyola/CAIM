In most of the cases the magnetooptic Kerr effect (MOKE) techniques rely solely on the effects linear
in magnetization ($\bm{M}$). Nevertheless, a higher-order term being proportional to $\bm{M}$$^2$
and called quadratic MOKE (QMOKE) can additionally contribute to experimental data. Handling
and understanding the underlying origin of QMOKE could be the key to utilize this effect for investigation
of antiferromagnetic materials in the future due to their vanishing first order MOKE contribution.
Also, better understanding of QMOKE and hence better understanding of magnetooptic (MO) effects
in general is very valuable, as the MO effect is very much employed in research of ferro- and ferrimagnetic
materials. Therefore, we present our QMOKE and longitudinal MOKE spectroscopy setup with a spectral
range of 0.8--5.5\,eV. The setup is based on light modulation through a photoelastic modulator
and detection of second-harmonic intensity by a lock-in amplifier. To measure the Kerr ellipticity
an achromatic compensator is used within the setup, whereas without it Kerr rotation is measured.
The separation of QMOKE spectra directly from the measured data is based on measurements with multiple
magnetization directions. So far the QMOKE separation algorithm is developed and tested for but
not limited to cubic (001) oriented samples. The QMOKE spectra yielded by our setup arise from two
quadratic MO parameters $G_s$ and $2G_{44}$, being elements of quadratic MO tensor $\bm{G}$, which
describe perturbation of the permittivity tensor in the second order in $\bm{M}$.
