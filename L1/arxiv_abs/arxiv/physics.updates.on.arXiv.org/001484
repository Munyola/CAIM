Efficient search acts as a strong selective force in biological systems ranging from cellular populations
to predator-prey systems. The search processes commonly involve finding a stationary or mobile
target within a heterogeneously structured environment where obstacles limit migration. An open
generic question is whether random or directionally biased motions or a combination of both provide
an optimal search efficiency and how that depends on the motility and density of targets and obstacles.
To address this question, we develop a simple model that involves a random walker searching for its
targets in a heterogeneous medium of bond percolation square lattice and used mean first passage
time (MFPT, $\langle T \rangle$) as an indication of average search time. Our analysis reveals a
dual effect of directional bias on the minimum value of $\langle T \rangle$. For a homogeneous medium,
directionality always decreases $\langle T \rangle$ and a pure directional migration (a ballistic
motion) serves as the optimized strategy; while for a heterogeneous environment, we find that the
optimized strategy involves a combination of directed and random migrations. The relative contribution
of these modes is determined by the density of obstacles and motility of targets. Existence of randomness
and motility of targets add to the efficiency of search. Our study reveals generic and simple rules
that govern search efficiency. Our findings might find application in a number of areas including
immunology, cell biology, and ecology.
