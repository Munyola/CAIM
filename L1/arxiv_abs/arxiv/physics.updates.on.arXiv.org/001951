Recent studies of the performance of radio-frequency (RF) copper structures operated at cryogenic
temperatures have shown a dramatic increase in the maximum surface electric field that may be reached.
We propose to utilize this development to enable a new generation of photoinjectors operated at
cryogenic temperatures that may attain, through enhancement of the launch field at the photocathode
by a factor of four, well over an order of magnitude increase in peak electron beam brightness. We
present detailed studies of the beam dynamics associated with such a system, concentrating on an
emittance-compensated S-band photoinjector that may directly substitute that of the LCLS X-ray
free-electron laser. We show in this case that the increase in brightness leads directly to a factor
of two reduction in gain length, with attendant increase in X-ray radiative efficiency. Extreme
low emittance scenarios obtained at low operating charge, appropriate for dramatically pushing
performance limits of ultrafast electron diffraction and microscopy experiments, are reviewed.
While much of the gain in brightness is due to increase of the emission current density via field enhancement,
further increases in brightness due to lowering of the intrinsic cathode emittance in cryogenic
operation are also enabled. The potential to probe fundamental brightness limits in these cold,
dense beam systems is examined. Issues in experimental implementation, including cavity optimization
for lowering cryogenic thermal dissipation, external coupling, and cryo-cooler system are discussed.
