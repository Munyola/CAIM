The Great Pyramid or Khufu's Pyramid was built on the Giza Plateau (Egypt) during the IVth dynasty
by the pharaoh Khufu (Cheops), who reigned from 2509 to 2483 BC. Despite being one of the oldest and
largest monuments on Earth, there is no consensus about how it was built. To better understand its
internal structure, we imaged the pyramid using muons, which are by-products of cosmic rays that
are only partially absorbed by stone. The resulting cosmic-ray muon radiography allows us to visualize
the known and potentially unknown voids in the pyramid in a non-invasive way. Here we report the discovery
of a large void (with a cross section similar to the Grand Gallery and a length of 30 m minimum) above
the Grand Gallery, which constitutes the first major inner structure found in the Great Pyramid
since the 19th century. This void, named ScanPyramids Big Void, was first observed with nuclear
emulsion films installed in the Queen's chamber (University of Nagoya), then confirmed with scintillator
hodoscopes set up in the same chamber (KEK) and re-confirmed with gas detectors outside of the pyramid
(CEA). This large void has therefore been detected with a high confidence by three different muon
detection technologies and three independent analyses. These results constitute a breakthrough
for the understanding of Khufu's Pyramid and its internal structure. While there is currently no
information about the role of this void, these findings show how modern particle physics can shed
new light on the world's archaeological heritage.
