The unsteady lift response of an airfoil in a sinusoidal gust can be modeled by two transfer functions:
the first-order Sears function and the second-order Atassi function, albeit leading to different
results under certain conditions. Previous studies have shown that the Sears function holds in
experiments, but recently Cordes et al. (2017) reported experimental data that corresponded to
the Atassi function rather than the Sears function. In order to clarify the observed discrepancy,
the specific differences between these models are isolated analytically in this study and are related
to physical gust parameters. Gusts with these parameters are then produced in wind-tunnel experiments
using an active-grid gust generator. Measurements of the unsteady gust loads on an airfoil in the
wind tunnel at Reynolds numbers ($Re_c$) of $2.0\times 10^5$ and $2.6\times 10^5$ and reduced frequencies
between 0.09 and 0.42 confirm that the decisive difference between the Sears and Atassi functions
lies in the character of the gust and not in the characteristics of the airfoil. The differences in
the gust-response data between Sears and Atassi gust conditions are shown to be significant only
at low reduced frequencies. These findings are supported by numerical simulations of the experimental
setup. Finally, the influence of boundary-layer turbulence on experimental convergence with
model predictions is investigated. These results serve to clarify the conditions under which the
Sears and Atassi functions can be applied, and they establish the validity of both in an experimental
context.
