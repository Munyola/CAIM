This study uses a 1D fluid dynamics arterial network model to predict pressure and flow dynamics
in healthy and hypoxic mice. Data for this study include blood flow and pressure measurements from
the main pulmonary artery of 7 healthy and 5 hypoxic mice. Representative arterial network dimensions
for the 21 largest pulmonary arterial vessels are extracted from micro-CT images from healthy and
hypoxic lungs. Each vessel is represented by its length and radius, and is assumed to taper longitudinally.
Fluid dynamic computations are done assuming that the flow is Newtonian, viscous, laminar, has
no swirl, and that the arterial walls are thin. The system of equations is closed by a constitutive
equation relating pressure and area, using either a linear model derived from stress-strain deformation
in the circumferential direction or a nonlinear model of empirical nature. For each dataset, an
inflow waveform is extracted from data, and nominal parameters related the outflow boundary conditions
were specified using mean values and timescales computed from the measured flow and pressure waveforms.
The model was calibrated for each mouse by estimating parameters using optimization that minimized
the least squares error between measured and computed pressure and flow waveforms from the main
pulmonary artery. Results show that for healthy animals, the nonlinear wall model is needed to predict
flow and pressure characteristics, while for the hypoxic animals both models predict the experimental
data well, possibly because vessels are significantly stiffer due to wall remodeling.
