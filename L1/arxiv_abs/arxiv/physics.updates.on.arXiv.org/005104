We present a numerical algorithm aimed at identifying ion diffusion regions (IDRs) in the geomagnetic
tail, and test its applicability. We use 5 criteria applied in three stages. (i) Correlated reversals
(within 90 s) of Vx and Bz (at least 2 nT about zero; GSM coordinates); (ii) Detection of Hall electric
and magnetic field signatures; and (iii) strong (>10 mV/m) electric fields. While no criterion
alone is necessary and sufficient, the approach does provide a robust, if conservative, list of
IDRs. We use data from the Magnetospheric Multiscale Mission (MMS) spacecraft during a 5-month
period (May 1 to September 30, 2017) of near-tail orbits during the declining phase of the solar cycle.
We find 148 events satisfying step 1, 37 satisfying steps 1 and 2, and 17 satisfying all three, of which
12 are confirmed as IDRs. All IDRs were within the X-range [-24, -15] RE mainly on the dusk sector and
the majority occurred during traversals of a tailward-moving X-line. 11 of 12 IDRs were on the dusk-side
despite approximately equal residence time in both the pre- and post-midnight sectors (56.5% dusk
vs 43.5% dawn). MMS could identify signatures of 4 quadrants of the Hall B-structure in 3 events and
3 quadrants in 7 of the remaining 12 confirmed IDRs identified. The events we report commonly display
Vx reversals greater than 400 km/s in magnitude, normal magnetic field reversals often >10 nT in
magnitude, maximum DC |E| which are often well in excess of the threshold for stage 3. Our results
are then compared with the set of IDRs identified by visual examination from Cluster in the years
2000-2005.
