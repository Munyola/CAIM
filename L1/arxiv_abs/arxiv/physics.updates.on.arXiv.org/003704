European Spallation Source (ESS) will deliver neutrons at high flux for use in diverse neutron scattering
techniques. The neutron source facility and the scientific instruments will be located in Lund,
and the Data Management and Software Centre (DMSC), in Copenhagen. A number of detector prototypes
are being developed at ESS together with its European in-kind partners, for example: SoNDe, Multi-Grid,
Multi-Blade and Gd-GEM. These are all position sensitive detectors but use different techniques
for the detection of neutrons. Except for digitization of electronics readout, all neutron data
is anticipated to be processed in software. This provides maximum flexibility and adaptability
and allows deep inspection of the raw data for commissioning which will reduce the risk of starting
up new detector technologies. But it also requires development of high performance software processing
pipelines and optimized and scalable processing algorithms. This report provides a description
of the ESS system architecture for the neutron data path. Special focus is on the interface between
the detectors and DMSC which is based on UDP over Ethernet links. The report also describes the software
architecture for detector data processing and the tools we have developed, which have proven very
useful for efficient early experimentation, and can be run on a single laptop. Processing requirements
for the SoNDe, Multi-Grid, Multi-Blade and Ge-GEM detectors are presented and compared to event
processing rates archived so far.
