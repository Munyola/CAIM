Objective: To establish the performance of several drive and measurement patterns in EIT imaging
of neural activity in peripheral nerve, which involves large impedance change in the nerve's anisotropic
length axis. Approach: Eight drive and measurement electrode patterns are compared using a finite
element (FE) four cylindrical shell model of a peripheral nerve and a 32 channel dual-ring nerve
cuff. The central layer of the FE model contains impedance changes representative of neural activity
of -0.3 in the length axis and -8.8 x 10-4 in the radial axis. Four of the electrode patterns generate
longitudinal drive current, which runs perpendicular to the anisotropic axis. Main results: Transverse
current patterns produce higher resolution than longitudinal patterns but are also more susceptible
to noise and errors, and exhibit poorer sensitivity to impedance changes in central sample locations.
Three of the four longitudinal current patterns considered can reconstruct fascicle level impedance
changes with up to 0.2 mV noise and error, which corresponds to between -5.5 and +0.18 dB of the normalised
signal standard deviation. Reducing the spacing between the two electrode rings in all longitudinal
current patterns reduced the signal to error ratio across all depth locations of the sample. Significance:
Electrode patterns which target the large impedance change in the anisotropic length axis can provide
improved robustness against noise and errors, which is a critical step towards real time EIT imaging
of neural activity in peripheral nerve.
