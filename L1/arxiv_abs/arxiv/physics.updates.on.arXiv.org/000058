A pilot study of exhaled volatile compounds and their correlation with blood glucose levels in eight
children with type 1 diabetes is reported. Five paired blood and breath samples were obtained from
each child over a 6 hour period. The blood glucose concentration ranged from 41.4 to 435.6 mg/dL.
Breath samples were collected in Tedlar bags and immediately evacuated through thermal desorption
tubes packed with Carbopack B and C. The VOCs were later recovered by thermal desorption and analysed
using gas chromatography mass spectrometry. The study identified 74 volatile compounds present
in at least 10% of the patient samples. Of these 74 volatiles 36 were found in all patient samples tested.
Further analysis of the 36 compounds found that none showed significant overall correlation with
blood glucose levels. Isoprene showed a weak negative correlation with blood glucose levels. Acetone
was found to have no correlation with blood glucose levels for the patients studied. Some patients
showed significant individual correlation between the relative peak areas of certain compounds
and blood glucose levels. However, there was no consistent pattern observed within these results
across all 8 patients. Additional breath samples were collected in Tedlar bags and analysed using
SIFTMS for 3 of the patients and a healthy control. The levels of 24 volatiles are reported and were
found to be generally consistent with previously reported SIFT-MS data. In agreement with the GCMS
data, no compounds exhibited a significant overall correlation with blood glucose level.
