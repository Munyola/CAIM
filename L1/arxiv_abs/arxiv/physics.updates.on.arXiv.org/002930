Unsegmented, large-volume liquid scintillator (LS) neutrino detectors have proven to be a key
technology for low-energy neutrino physics. The efficient rejection of radionuclide background
induced by cosmic muon interactions is of paramount importance for their success in high-precision
MeV neutrino measurements. We present a novel technique to reconstruct GeV particle tracks in LS,
whose main property, the resolution of topological features and changes in the differential energy
loss $\mathrm{d}E/\mathrm{d}x$, allows for improved rejection strategies. Different to common
track reconstruction approaches, our method does not rely on concrete track / topology hypotheses.
Instead, based on a reference point in space and time, the observed distribution of photon arrival
times at the photosensors and the detector's characteristics in terms of photon production, propagation
and detection (optical model), it reconstructs the voxelized distribution of optical photon emissions.
Techniques from three-dimensional data analysis can then be applied to extract parameters describing
the topology, e.g., the direction of a track. We performed a first performance evaluation of our
method using single muon events with up to $10\,\mathrm{GeV}$ from a Geant4 simulation of the LENA
detector. The current results indicate that our approach is competitive with existing reconstruction
methods -- although its full potential has not yet been exploited. We also remark on other detector
technologies in astroparticle physics as well as applications in medical imaging that could benefit
from the fundamental ideas of our method.
