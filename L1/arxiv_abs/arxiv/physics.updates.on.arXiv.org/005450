Turbulent flows in a thin layer can develop an inverse energy cascade leading to spectral condensation
of energy when the layer height is smaller than a certain threshold. These spectral condensates
take the form of large-scale vortices in physical space. Recently, evidence for bistability was
found in this system close to the critical height: depending on the initial conditions, the flow
is either in a condensate state with most of the energy in the two-dimensional (2-D) large-scale
modes, or in a three-dimensional (3-D) flow state with most of the energy in the small-scale modes.
This bistable regime is characterised by the statistical properties of random and rare transitions
between these two locally stable states. Here, we examine these statistical properties in thin-layer
turbulent flows, where the energy is injected by either stochastic or deterministic forcing. To
this end, by using a large number of direct numerical simulations (DNS), we measure the decay time
$\tau_d$ of the 2-D condensate to 3-D flow state and the build-up time $\tau_b$ of the 2-D condensate.
We show that both of these times $\tau_d,\tau_b$ follow an exponential distribution with mean values
increasing faster than exponentially as the layer height approaches the threshold. We further
show that the dynamics of large-scale kinetic energy may be modeled by a stochastic Langevin equation.
From time-series analysis of DNS data, we determine the effective potential that shows two minima
corresponding to the 2-D and 3-D states when the layer height is close to the threshold.
