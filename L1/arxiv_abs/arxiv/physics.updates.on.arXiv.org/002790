Solar flare X-ray spectra are typically dominated by thermal bremsstrahlung emission in the soft
X-ray ($\lesssim$10 keV) energy range; for hard X-ray energies ($\gtrsim$30 keV), emission is
typically non-thermal from beams of electrons. The low-energy extent of non-thermal emission
has only been loosely quantified. It has been difficult to obtain a lower limit for a possible non-thermal
cutoff energy due to the significantly dominant thermal emission. Here we use solar flare data from
the EUV Variability Experiment (EVE) on-board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) and X-ray data
from the Reuven Ramaty High Energy Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI) to calculate the Differential
Emission Measure (DEM). This improvement over the isothermal approximation and any single-instrument
DEM helps to resolve ambiguities in the range where thermal and non-thermal emission overlap, and
to provide constraints on the low-energy cutoff. In the model, thermal emission is from a DEM that
is parametrized as multiple gaussians in $Log(T)$. Non-thermal emission results from a photon
spectrum obtained using a thick-target emission model. Spectra for both instruments are fit simultaneously
in a self-consistent manner. Our results have been obtained using a sample of 52 large (GOES X- and
M-class) solar flares observed between February 2011 and February 2013. It turns out that it is often
possible to determine low-energy cutoffs early (in the first two minutes) during large flares.
Cutoff energies are typically low, less than 10 keV, with most values of the lower limits in the 5--7
keV range.
