For future human missions to Mars, it is important to study the surface radiation environment during
extreme and elevated conditions. In the long term, it is mainly Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCRs) modulated
by solar activity that contributes to the radiation on the surface of Mars, but intense solar energetic
particle (SEP) events may induce acute health effects. Such events may enhance the radiation level
significantly and should be detected as immediately as possible to prevent severe damage to humans
and equipment. However, the energetic particle environment on the Martian surface is significantly
different from that in deep space due to the influence of the Martian atmosphere. Depending on the
intensity and shape of the original solar particle spectra as well as particle types, the surface
spectra may induce entirely different radiation effects. In order to give immediate and accurate
alerts while avoiding unnecessary ones, it is important to model and well understand the atmospheric
effect on the incoming SEPs including both protons and helium ions. In this paper, we have developed
a generalized approach to quickly model the surface response of any given incoming proton/helium
ion spectra and have applied it to a set of historical large solar events thus providing insights
into the possible variety of surface radiation environments that may be induced during SEP events.
Based on the statistical study of more than 30 significant solar events, we have obtained an empirical
model for estimating the surface dose rate directly from the intensities of a power-law SEP spectra.
