Purpose - The purpose of this work is to determine dependence of the separative power of the Iguassu
gas centrifuge (GC) on the velocity of the rotor. Design/methodology/approach - The dependence
is determined by means of computer simulation of the gas flow in the GC and numerical solution of the
diffusion equation for the light component of the binary mixture of uranium isotopes. 2D axisymmetric
model with the sources/sinks of the mass, angular momentum and energy reproducing the scoops was
explored for the computer simulation. Parameters of the model correspond to the parameters of the
so-called Iguassu centrifuge. The separative power has been optimised in relation to the pressure
of the gas, temperature of the gas, the temperature drop along the rotor, power of the source of angularmomentum
and energy, feed flow and geometry of the lower baffle. Findings - In the result, the optimised separative
power depends only on the velocity, length and diameter of the rotor. The dependence on the velocity
is described by the power law function with the power law index 2.6 which demonstrate stronger dependence
on the velocity than it follows from experimental data. However, the separative power obtained
with limitation on the pressure growth with the velocity depends on the velocity on the power similar
to 2 which well agree with the experiments. Originality/value - For the first time, the optimised
separative power of the GCs have been calculated via numerical simulation of the gas flow and diffusion
of the binary mixture of isotope.
