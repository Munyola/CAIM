We conduct a multiparametric study of driven magnetic reconnection relevant to recent experiments
on colliding magnetized laser produced plasmas using particle-in-cell simulations. Varying
the background plasma density, plasma resistivity, and plasma bubble geometry, the 2D simulations
demonstrate a rich variety of reconnection behavior and show the coupling between magnetic reconnection
and the global hydrodynamical evolution of the system. We consider both the collision between two
radially expanding bubbles where reconnection is seeded by the pre-existing X-point, and the collision
between two flows in a quasi-1D geometry with initially anti-parallel fields where reconnection
must be initiated by the tearing instability. In both geometries, at a baseline case of low-collisionality
and low background density, the current sheet is strongly compressed to below scale of the ion-skin-depth
scale, and rapid, multi-plasmoid reconnection results. Increasing the plasma resistivity, we
observe a collisional slow-down of reconnection and stabilization of plasmoid instability for
Lundquist numbers less than approximately $S \sim 10^3$. Secondly, increasing the background
plasma density modifies the compressibility of the plasma and can also slow-down or even prevent
reconnection, even in completely collisionless regimes, by preventing the current sheet from
thinning down to the scale of the ion-skin depth. These results have implications for understanding
recent and future experiments, and signatures for these processes for proton-radiography diagnostics
of these experiments are discussed.
