We study the question about existence i.e. stability with respect to dissociation of the spin-quartet,
permutation- and reflection-symmetric ${}^4(-3)^+_g$ ($S_z=-3/2, M=-3$) state of the $(\alpha\alpha
e e e)$ Coulomb system: the ${\rm He}_2^+$ molecular ion, placed in a magnetic field $0 \le B \le 10000$
a.u. We assume that the $\alpha$-particles are infinitely massive (Born-Oppenheimer approximation
of zero order) and adopt the parallel configuration, when the molecular axis and the magnetic field
direction coincide, as the optimal configuration. The study of the stability is performed variationally
with a physically adequate trial function. To achieve this goal, we explore several Helium-contained
compounds in strong magnetic fields, in particular, we study the spin-quartet ground state of ${\rm
He}^-$ ion, and the ground (spin-triplet) state of the Helium atom, both for a magnetic field in $100
\leq B\leq 10000$ a.u. The main result is that the ${\rm He}_2^+$ molecular ion in the state ${}^4(-3)^+_g$
is stable towards all possible decay modes for magnetic fields $B \gtrsim 120$ a.u. and with the magnetic
field increase the ion becomes more tightly bound and compact with a cigar-type form of electronic
cloud. At $B=1000$ a.u., the dissociation energy of ${\rm He}_2^+$ into ${\rm He}^- + \alpha$ is
$\sim 701.8$ eV and the dissociation energy for the decay channel to ${\rm He} + \alpha + e $ is $\sim
729.1$ eV, latter both energies are in the energy window for one of the observed absorption features
of the isolated neutron star 1E1207.4-5209.
