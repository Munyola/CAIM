We study experimentally the dynamics and statistics of capillary waves forced by random steep gravity
waves mechanically generated in laboratory. Capillary waves are produced here by gravity waves
from nonlinear wave interactions. Using a spatio-temporal measurement of the free-surface, we
characterize statistically the random regimes of capillary waves in the spatial and temporal Fourier
spaces. For a significant wave steepness ($0.2-0.3$), power-law spectra are observed both in space
and time, defining a turbulent regime of capillary waves transferring energy from large scale to
small scale. Analysis of temporal fluctuations of spatial spectrum demonstrates that the capillary
power-law spectra result from the temporal averaging over intermittent and strong nonlinear events
transferring energy to small scale in a fast time scale, when capillary wave trains are generated
in a way similar to the parasitic capillary wave generation mechanism. The frequency and wavenumber
power-law exponents of wave spectrum are found to be in agreement with those of the weakly nonlinear
Wave Turbulence Theory. However, the energy flux is not constant through the scales and the wave
spectrum scaling with this flux is not in good agreement with Wave Turbulence Theory. These results
suggest that theoretical developments beyond the classic Wave Turbulence Theory are necessary
to describe the dynamics and statistics of capillary waves in natural environment. In particular,
in presence of broad scale viscous dissipation and strong nonlinearity, the role of non-local and
non-resonant interactions could be reconsidered.
