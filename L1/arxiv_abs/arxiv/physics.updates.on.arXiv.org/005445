We present a theoretical study on pattern formation occurring in miscible fluids reacting by a second-order
reaction $A + B \to S$ in a vertical Hele-Shaw cell under constant gravity. We have recently reported
that concentration-dependent diffusion of species coupled with a frontal neutralization reaction
can produce a multi-layer system where low density depleted zones could be embedded between the
denser layers. This leads to the excitation of chemoconvective modes spatially separated from
each other by a motionless fluid. In this paper, we show that the layers can interact via a diffusion
mechanism. Since diffusively-coupled instabilities initially have different wavelengths,
this causes a long-wave modulation of one pattern by another. We have developed a mathematical model
which includes a system of reaction-diffusion-convection equations. The linear stability of
a transient base state is studied by calculating the growth rate of the Lyapunov exponent for each
unstable layer. Numerical simulations supported by the phase portrait reconstruction and Fourier
spectra calculation have revealed that nonlinear dynamics consistently passes through (i) a perfect
spatially periodic system of chemoconvective cells; (ii) a quasi-periodic system of the same cells;
(iii) a disordered fingering structure. We show that in this system, the coordinate co-directed
to the reaction front paradoxically plays the role of time, time itself acts as a bifurcation parameter,
and a complete spatial analog of the Ruelle-Takens-Newhouse scenario of the chaos onset is observed.
