The explorations of the quantum-inspired symmetries in optical and photonic settings have witnessed
immense research interests both in the realms of fundamental physics as well as novel technological
pursuits in a wide range of subjects including optics, photonics, opto-electronics,condensed
matter physics and beyond. One of the principal emerging fields in this context is the so-called
parity-time symmetry, originally proposed in the studies pertaining to the quantum mechanics
and quantum field theory, recently ramified into diverse areas of physics and engineering, particularly
in optics due to the isomorphic correspondence between the paraxial wave equation and Schr\"odinger
equation in quantum mechanics. Ever since its inception in the late nineties, it has become one of
the most actively pursued multifaceted research topics and still continuing to accentuate in its
diversifying range of subjects, in particular to optics and photonics. This review paper attempts
to bring together the state of the art developments in the field of complex non-Hermitian optics
and photonics based on the idea of parity-time symmetry in various optical and photonic settings
along with elucidating key concepts and providing a future outlook. It can be expected that this
trendy field of interest can be indispensable in providing novel perspectives in maneuvering the
flow of light in diverse physical platforms and offer distinctive applications prospects in optical,
photonic, condensed matter and opto-electronic system configurations.
