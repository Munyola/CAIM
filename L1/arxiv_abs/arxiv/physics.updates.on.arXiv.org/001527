The metasurface concept has emerged as an advantageous reconfigurable antenna architecture for
beam forming and wavefront shaping, with applications that include satellite and terrestrial
communications, radar, imaging, and wireless power transfer. The metasurface antenna consists
of an array of metamaterial elements distributed over an electrically large structure, each subwavelength
in dimension and with subwavelength separation between elements. In the antenna configuration
we consider here, the metasurface is excited by the fields from an attached waveguide. Each metamaterial
element can be modeled as a polarizable dipole that couples the waveguide mode to radiation modes.
Distinct from the phased array and electronically scanned antenna (ESA) architectures, a dynamic
metasurface antenna does not require active phase shifters and amplifiers, but rather achieves
reconfigurability by shifting the resonance frequency of each individual metamaterial element.
Here we derive the basic properties of a one-dimensional waveguide-fed metasurface antenna in
the approximation that the metamaterial elements do not perturb the waveguide mode and are non-interacting.
We derive analytical approximations for the array factors of the 1D antenna, including the effective
polarizabilities needed for amplitude-only, phase-only, and binary constraints. Using full-wave
numerical simulations, we confirm the analysis, modeling waveguides with slots or complementary
metamaterial elements patterned into one of the surfaces.
