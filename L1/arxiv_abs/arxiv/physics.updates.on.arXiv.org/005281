We consider the formation of structured and massless particles with spin 1, by using the Yang-Mills
like stochastic equations system for the group symmetry $SU(2)\otimes U(1)$ without taking into
account the nonlinear term characterizing self-action. We prove that, in the first phase of relaxation,
as a result of multi-scale random fluctuations of quantum fields, massless particles with spin
1, further referred as \emph{hions}, are generated in the form of statistically stable quantized
structures, which are localized on 2$D$ topological manifolds. We also study the wave state and
the geometrical structure of the \emph{hion} when as a free particle and, accordingly, while it
interacts with a random environment becoming a quasi-particle with a finite lifetime. In the second
phase of relaxation, the vector boson makes spontaneous transitions to other massless and mass
states. The problem of entanglement of two \emph{hions} with opposite projections of the spins
$+1$ and $-1$ and the formation of a scalar zero-spin boson are also thoroughly studied. We analyze
the properties of the scalar field and show that it corresponds to the Bose-Einstein (BE) condensate.
The scalar boson decay problems, as well as a number of features characterizing the stability of
BE condensate, are also discussed. Then, we report on the structure of empty space-time in the context
of new properties of the quantum vacuum, implying on the existence of a natural quantum computer
with complicated logic, which manifests in the form of dark energy. The possibilities of space-time
engineering are also discussed.
