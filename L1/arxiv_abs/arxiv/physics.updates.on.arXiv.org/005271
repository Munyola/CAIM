The rings, spots and stripes found on some butterflies, Pachyrhynchus weevils, and many chameleons
are notable examples of natural organisms employing photonic crystals to produce colorful patterns.
Despite advances in nanotechnology, we still lack the ability to print arbitrary colors and shapes
in all three dimensions at this microscopic length scale. Commercial nanoscale 3D printers based
on two-photon polymerization are incapable of patterning photonic crystal structures with the
requisite ~300 nm lattice constant to achieve photonic stopbands/ bandgaps in the visible spectrum
and generate colors. Here, we introduce a means to produce 3D-printed photonic crystals with a 5x
reduction in lattice constants (periodicity as small as 280 nm), achieving sub-100-nm features
with a full range of colors. The reliability of this process enables us to engineer the bandstructures
of woodpile photonic crystals that match experiments, showing that observed colors can be attributed
to either slow light modes or stopbands. With these lattice structures as 3D color volumetric elements
(voxels), we printed 3D microscopic scale objects, including the first multi-color microscopic
model of the Eiffel Tower measuring only 39-microns tall with a color pixel size of 1.45 microns.
The technology to print 3D structures in color at the microscopic scale promises the direct patterning
and integration of spectrally selective devices, such as photonic crystal-based color filters,
onto free-form optical elements and curved surfaces.
