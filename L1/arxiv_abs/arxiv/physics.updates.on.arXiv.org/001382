The high-order harmonic generation (HHG), if phase matched, opens a unique way to produce coherent
ultrafast extreme-UV (XUV) or soft x-ray light sources. Here we describe a robust and tunable method
for scaling and narrowing the bandwidth of high-order harmonics in different transversal modes
based on femtosecond dynamic grating in a gas jet. This technique has potential of self-phase controlled
XUV generation by adjusting the intersect angle and the intensity ratio of interfering fundamental
beams. The limitations of using high intensity laser fundamental pulses in gas, such as non-negligible
the magnetic field which prevents recombination with parent and self-focusing of laser and plasma
creation in the generated harmonics beam path which prevents phase matching, can be solved by using
dynamic grating generated by the fundamental pulse and/or its harmonic with small intersect angle.
The grating pattern introduces a phase modulation in the dipole emission imprint such pattern in
the gas medium. As the spatial and temporal behaviors of the grating are closely connected in harmonic
generation, by shaping of the spatial profile of the interfering beams it is possible to create a
more complex tunable beating pattern as harmonic sources to transfer desired optical information
to XUV pulses. In this case, the phase mismatch can be completely compensate by tuning the gas pressure,
adjusting the intersect angle as well as intensity ratio of the interfering beams to produce a bright
XUV with desired transversal mode.
