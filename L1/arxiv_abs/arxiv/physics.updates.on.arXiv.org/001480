This paper examines some foundational aspects of the standard model of particle physics under the
modified symmetry group $SU(3)\times U(2)$. Careful attention is paid to the product group structure
and its implications for conserved charges of gauge bosons and matter fields. We posit that implementation
of the product group structure in a model Lagrangian calls for color-electroweak degrees of freedom
in the $(\mathbf{3},\mathbf{2})$ \emph{and} the $(\mathbf{3},\overline{\mathbf{2}})$ of
$SU(3)\times U(2)$ that possess integer electric charge. This leads to a modified Lagrangian kinetic
term for quarks that reproduces the strong and electroweak currents of the standard model if one
is willing to identify the pair $(\mathbf{3},\mathbf{2}),\,(\mathbf{3},\overline{\mathbf{2}})$
with a quark doublet in the standard model. The close resemblance between quark and lepton electroweak
doublets in this picture encourages us to propose a mechanism for a phase transition between quarks
and leptons that stems from the product structure of the symmetry group. Our hypothesis is that the
strong and electroweak bosons see each other as a source of decoherence. In effect, leptons are identified
with the color-trace of quark representations, and our modified Lagrangian for quarks reduces
to the usual lepton Lagrangian of the standard model. This mechanism allows possible extensions
of the standard model that don't require large multiplets of matter fields. In particular, we investigate
some promising cosmological implications of a model based on $U(4)\rightarrow U(3)\times U(2)$.
