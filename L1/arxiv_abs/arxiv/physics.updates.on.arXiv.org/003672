Geostatistical seismic inversion is commonly used to infer the spatial distribution of the subsurface
petro-elastic properties by perturbing the model parameter space through iterative stochastic
sequential simulations/co-simulations. The spatial uncertainty of the inferred petro-elastic
properties is represented with the updated a posteriori variance from an ensemble of the simulated
realizations. Within this setting, the large-scale geological (metaparameters) used to generate
the petro-elastic realizations, such as the spatial correlation model and the global a priori distribution
of the properties of interest, are assumed to be known and stationary for the entire inversion domain.
This assumption leads to underestimation of the uncertainty associated with the inverted models.
We propose a practical framework to quantify uncertainty of the large-scale geological parameters
in seismic inversion. The framework couples geostatistical seismic inversion with a stochastic
adaptive sampling and Bayesian inference of the metaparameters to provide a more accurate and realistic
prediction of uncertainty not restricted by heavy assumptions on large-scale geological parameters.
The proposed framework is illustrated with both synthetic and real case studies. The results show
the ability retrieve more reliable acoustic impedance models with a more adequate uncertainty
spread when compared with conventional geostatistical seismic inversion techniques. The proposed
approach separately account for geological uncertainty at large-scale (metaparameters) and
local scale (trace-by-trace inversion).
