The biomedical community asked CERN to investigate the possibility to transform the Low Energy
Ion Ring (LEIR) accelerator into a multidisciplinary, biomedical research facility (BioLEIR)
that could provide ample, high-quality beams of a range of light ions suitable for clinically oriented
fundamental research on cell cultures and for radiation instrumentation development. BioLEIR
would be operated when LEIR is not providing heavy ions for the CERN physics programme. The study
group was mandated to write a Feasibility Study Report, using high-level engineering estimates
based on previous experience, with the aim to: - collect the requirements for such a facility from
the biomedical community in close collaboration with the International Strategy Committee for
CERN Medical Applications; - determine a coherent set of beam parameters, based on the requirements;
- explore whether the beam requirements can be met throughout the facility, from the source to the
biomedical end-stations; - perform a feasibility study of the facility, taking into consideration
the overall CERN schedules and programmes; - favour simplicity and robustness of the facility design,
while minimizing the cost of maintenance and operation; - establish a high-level costing of material
and personnel needed for project implementation; - describe the preferred installation scenario;
- perform a high-level risk analysis for the project; - identify the areas of potential difficulty,
and the required R&D should the study go ahead and become a project.
