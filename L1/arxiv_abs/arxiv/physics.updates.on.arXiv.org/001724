Muon imaging is one of the most promising non-invasive techniques for density structure scanning,
specially for large objects reaching the kilometre scale. It has already interesting applications
in different fields like geophysics or nuclear safety and has been proposed for some others like
engineering or archaeology. One of the approaches of this technique is based on the well-known radiography
principle, by reconstructing the incident direction of the detected muons after crossing the studied
objects. In this case, muons detected after a previous forward scattering on the object surface
represent an irreducible background noise, leading to a bias on the measurement and consequently
on the reconstruction of the object mean density. Therefore, a prior characterization of this effect
represents valuable information to conveniently correct the obtained results. Although the muon
scattering process has been already theoretically described, a general study of this process has
been carried out based on Monte Carlo simulations, resulting in a versatile tool to evaluate this
effect for different object geometries and compositions. As an example, these simulations have
been used to evaluate the impact of forward scattered muons on two different applications of muon
imaging: archaeology and volcanology, revealing a significant impact on the latter case. The general
way in which all the tools used have been developed can allow to make equivalent studies in the future
for other muon imaging applications following the same procedure.
