In an incompressible flow, fluid density remains invariant along fluid element trajectories.
This implies that the spatial distribution of non-interacting noninertial particles in such flows
cannot develop density inhomogeneities beyond those that are already introduced in the initial
condition. However, in certain practical situations, density is measured or accumulated on (hyper-)
surfaces of dimensionality lower than the full dimensionality of the flow in which the particles
move. An example is the observation of particle distributions sedimented on the floor of the ocean.
In such cases, even if the initial distribution of noninertial particles is uniform within a finite
support in an incompressible flow, advection in the flow will give rise to inhomogeneities in the
observed density. In this paper we analytically derive, in the framework of an initially homogeneous
particle sheet sedimenting towards a bottom surface, the relationship between the geometry of
the flow and the emerging distribution. From a physical point of view, we identify the two processes
that generate inhomogeneities to be the stretching within the sheet, and the projection of the deformed
sheet onto the target surface. We point out that an extreme form of inhomogeneity, caustics, can
develop for sheets. We exemplify our geometrical results with simulations of particle advection
in a simple kinematic flow, study the dependence on various parameters involved, and illustrate
that the basic mechanisms work similarly if the initial (homogeneous) distribution occupies a
more general region of finite extension rather than a sheet.
