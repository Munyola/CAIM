We study the stability of multi-layer radial flows in porous media within the Hele-Shaw model. We
perform a linear stability analysis for radial flows consisting of an arbitrary number of fluid
layers with interfaces separating fluids of constant viscosity and with positive viscosity jump
at each interface in the direction of flow. Several different time-dependent injection strategies
are analyzed including the maximal injection rate that maintains a stable flow. We find numerically
that flows with more fluid layers can be stable with faster time-dependent injection rates than
comparable flows with fewer fluid layers. In particular, the injection rate for a stable flow increases
at a rate that is proportional to the number of interfaces to the two-thirds power for large times.
Additionally, we show that in any multi-layer radial Hele-Shaw flow, if all of the interfaces are
circular except for one perturbed interface then there exists a time-dependent injection rate
such that the circular interfaces remain circular as they propagate and the disturbance on the perturbed
interface decays. The motion of the interfaces within linear theory is also investigated numerically
for the case of constant injection rates. It is found that: (i) A disturbance of one interface can
be transferred to the other interface(s); (ii) The disturbances on the interfaces can develop either
in phase or out of phase from any arbitrary initial disturbance; and (iii) The dynamics of the flow
can change dramatically with the addition of more interfaces.
