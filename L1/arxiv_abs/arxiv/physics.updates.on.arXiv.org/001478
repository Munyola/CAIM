The effect of network chain distribution on the mechanical behavior of elastomers is one of the long-standing
problems in rubber mechanics. The classical theory of rubber elasticity is built upon the assumption
of entropic elasticity of networks whose constitutive strands are of uniform length. The kinetic
theories for vulcanization, computer simulations, and indirect experimental measurements all
indicate that the microstructure of vulcanizates is made of polymer strands with a random distribution
of length. The polydispersity in strand length is expected to control the mechanical strength of
rubber as the overloaded short strands break at small deformations and transfer the load to the longer
strands. The purpose of the contributions presented in this thesis is to present simple theories
of rubber mechanics that take into account the length distribution of strands and its effect on elasticity
and the onset of bulk failure in unfilled and filled elastomers. In unfilled system, the population
of short chains is identified as the culprits for damage initiation. Upon deformation of a polydisperse
network, shorter strands break at considerably smaller stretches compared to the longer ones.
The network alteration continues concurrent with increasing deformation and controls the onset
of mechanical failure. In the filled networks, the degradation in network mechanical behavior
is assumed to be controlled by the adhesive failure of the short strands adsorbed onto the filler
surface. The finite extensibility of the short adsorbed strands is a key determinant of mechanical
strength.
