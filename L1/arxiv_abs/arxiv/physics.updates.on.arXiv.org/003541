Since the concept of metamaterials (photonic metamaterials) were first suggested, the scaling
down of structural units acting as a meta-atoms or metamolecules has been a long-lasting issue.
According to the effective medium theory, which is foundational to the concept of metamaterials,
the structural sizes of meta-atoms or metamolecules should be much smaller than that of the working
wavelengths (<< 1/5 wavelength). At the relatively low frequency regimes (e.g., microwave and
terahertz (THz)), conventional monolithic lithography (e.g., photolithography) can readily
address the materialization of metamaterials. However, it is still challenging to fabricate optical
metamaterials (metamaterials working at optical frequencies such as visible and near infrared
(NIR) regimes) through such lithographic approaches. This has served as rationale for using self-assembly
for the realization of optical metamaterials. The self-assembly of metallic colloids can address
various critical issues associated with the materialization of optical metamaterials, such as
achieving metallic nanogaps, increasing true 3D structural complexities, and processing large-scale
and cost-effective materials, which is difficult to attain through monolithic lithography. Nevertheless,
this self-assembly of metallic colloids has barely been used and still remains an underutilized
method. In this work, we theoretically exploited the challenge of self- assembly technology for
the fabrication of optical metamaterials, together with its future research opportunities.
