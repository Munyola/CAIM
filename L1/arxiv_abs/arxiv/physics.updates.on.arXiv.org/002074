The interaction between electromagnetic waves and objects is strongly affected by the shape and
material composition of the latter. Artificially created materials, formed by a subwavelength
structuring of their unit cells, namely metamaterials, can exhibit peculiar responses to electromagnetic
radiation and provide additional powerful degrees of freedom to the scatterer design. In particular,
negative material susceptibilities give rise to strong resonant interactions with deeply subwavelength
particles. While the negative electrical permittivity of natural noble metals manifests itself
in localized plasmon resonant oscillations, negative magnetic permeability is virtually non-existent
in nature. Here the concept of artificial magnon resonance in subwavelength objects with effective
negative permeability, designed based on the metamaterial approach, is demonstrated. Strong
localized oscillations of the magnetic fields within an array of split ring resonators, forming
a sphere, hybridize in a collective mode of the structure. As a result, extremely high scattering
cross section, exceeding that of a steel sphere with the same radius by four orders of magnitude,
was demonstrated. Furthermore, the scattering cross section of subwavelength metamaterial-based
sphere was shown to be comparable to the low frequency (MHz) radar signature of a big military aircraft.
Super scatterers, based on tunable resonances within artificially created materials, can find
use in a broad range of electromagnetic applications, including wireless communications, radars,
RFID, internet of things hardware and many others.
