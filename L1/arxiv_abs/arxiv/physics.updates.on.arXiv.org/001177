A method of transmitting information in interstellar space at superluminal, or $> c$, speeds is
proposed. The information is encoded as phase modulation of an electromagnetic wave of constant
intensity, i.e. fluctuations in the rate of energy transport plays no role in the communication,
and no energy is transported at speed $>$ c. Of course, such a constant wave can ultimately last only
the duration of its enveloping wave packet. However, as a unique feature of this paper, we assume
the source is sufficiently steady to be capable of emitting wave packets, or pulses, of size much
larger than the separation between sender and receiver. Therefore, if a pre-existing and enduring
wave envelope already connects the two sides, the subluminal nature of the envelope's group velocity
will no longer slow down the communication, which is now limited by the speed at which information
encoded as phase modulation propagates through the plasma, i.e. the phase velocity $v_p > c$. The
method involves no sharp structure in either time or frequency. As a working example, we considered
two spaceships separated by 1 lt-s in the local hot bubble. Provided the bandwidth of the extra Fourier
modes generated by the phase modulation is much smaller than the carrier wave frequency, the radio
communication of a message, encoded as a specific alignment between the carrier wave phase and the
anomalous (modulated) phase, can take place at a speed in excess of light by a few parts in 10$^{11}$
at $\nu\approx 1$~GHz, and higher at smaller $\nu$.
