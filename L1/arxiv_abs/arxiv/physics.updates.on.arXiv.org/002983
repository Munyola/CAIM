Sarcoidosis is a rare, multi-systemic, inflammatory disease, primarily affecting the lungs.
High-resolution computed tomography (CT) scans are used to clinically characterize pulmonary
sarcoidosis. In the medical imaging field, there is growing recognition to switch from visual examination
of CT images to more rapid, objective assessments of the abnormalities. In this work, we explore
the usefulness of various objective measures of spatial heterogeneity---fractal dimension,
Moran's I, and Geary's C ---for distinguishing between abnormal sarcoidosis and normal lung parenchyma.
CT data for N=58 sarcoidosis subjects enrolled at National Jewish Health were obtained from the
GRADS study. CT data for N=101 control patients were obtained from the COPDGene study. Radiomic
measures were computed for each two-dimensional slice of a given scan, in the axial, coronal, and
sagittal planes. Functional regression was applied to identify lung regions where CT nodules tend
to proliferate. Moran's I, Geary's C and fractal dimension significantly differentiate between
subjects with and without sarcoidosis throughout the majority of the lung, with disease abnormalities
most apparent in the top axial, middle coronal, and outer sagittal regions. A trend appeared across
Scadding stages, with CT scans from patients with Scadding stages I and III appearing the healthiest,
and Scadding stage IV appearing the least healthy. The radiomic measures and techniques presented
herein successfully characterize CT images in sarcoidosis by objectively and efficiently approximating
what we know about the pathology of sarcoidosis.
