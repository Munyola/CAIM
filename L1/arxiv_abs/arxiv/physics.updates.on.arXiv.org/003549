Acoustic imaging methods often ignore multiple scattering. This may lead to false images in cases
where multiple scattering is strong. Marchenko imaging has recently been introduced as a data-driven
way to deal with internal multiple scattering. Promising results have been obtained with geophysical
and ultrasonic data. Given the increasing interest in non-reciprocal materials, both for acoustic
and electromagnetic applications, we propose to modify the Marchenko method for imaging of such
materials. We start by formulating a unified wave equation for non-reciprocal materials, exploiting
the similarity between acoustic and electromagnetic wave phenomena. This unified wave equation
forms the basis for deriving reciprocity theorems that interrelate wave fields in a non-reciprocal
medium and its adjoint. Next, we reformulate these theorems for downgoing and upgoing wave fields.
From these decomposed reciprocity theorems we derive representations of the Green's function
inside the non-reciprocal medium, in terms of the reflection response at the surface and focusing
functions inside the medium and its adjoint. These representations form the basis for deriving
a modified version of the Marchenko method for imaging of non-reciprocal media. We illustrate the
proposed method at the hand of the numerically modeled reflection response of a horizontally layered
medium. The appendices contain a detailed derivation of the unified wave equation for non-reciprocal
media and the decomposition of the reciprocity theorems.
