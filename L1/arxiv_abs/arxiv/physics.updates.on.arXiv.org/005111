The term 'quc' is shorthand here for a cosmological -- not a physical -- 'quantum-universe constituent'.
Although self-adjoint Hilbert-space angular-momentum and momentum operators unitarily generate
quc rotations and spatial displacements, no single-quc is a physical 'thing'. Photons, 3 generations
of fermions, plus massive vector and scalar bosons -- all physicist-deemed 'elementary' -- as well
as dark matter, galaxies and black holes, within an evolving universe are, we propose, each a temporary
'quc family' that aggregates 8 Noether-conserved quc attributes. No 'thing' is elementary. Here
proposed is a thing-devoid 'von-Neumann big bang' -- that established a huge but finite and permanent
set of speed-c chiral qucs, with 'masses' M h /2{\tau}c 2 , where M = 1, 2,... M max and {\tau} is 'universe
age'. ('Quc-mass', although not physically-meaningful, has the same dimensionality as any thing
's 'mass'.) Quc-aggregate (thing) creations and disappearances -- i.e., 'evolution' -- are symmetry-governed
by an 8-parameter 'centered-Lorentz' (CL) Lie group. CL's 6-parameter SL (2, c) Riemann-geometric
'exterior' of quc rotations and hyperbolic spatial displacements, has a conserved algebra of quc
angular-momentum together with quc momentum times {\tau}. A 2-parameter non-geometric CL-central
algebra comprises a pair of discrete coupled and conserved quc attributes -- electric charge and
'chirality'. Chirality, without any physics counterpart, renders CL a supersymmetry and provides
our present universe with nuclear forces -- 'strong interactions'.
