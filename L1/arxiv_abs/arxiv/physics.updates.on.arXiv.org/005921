In order to have a comprehensive view of the propagation and evolution of coronal mass ejections
(CMEs) from the Sun to deep interplanetary space beyond 1 au, we carry out a kinematic analysis of
7 CMEs in solar cycle 23. The events are required to have coordinated coronagraph observations,
interplanetary type II radio bursts, and multi-point in-situ measurements at the Earth and Ulysses.
A graduated cylindrical shell model, an analytical model without free parameters and a magnetohydrodynamic
model are used to derive CME kinematics near the Sun, to quantify the CME/shock propagation in the
Sun-Earth space, and to connect in-situ signatures at the Earth and Ulysses, respectively. We find
that each of the 7 CME-driven shocks experienced a major deceleration before reaching 1 au and thereafter
propagated with a gradual deceleration from the Earth to larger distances. The resulting CME/shock
propagation profile for each case is roughly consistent with all the data, which verifies the usefulness
of the simple analytical model for CME/shock propagation in the heliosphere. The statistical analysis
of CME kinematics indicates a tendency that the faster the CME, the larger the deceleration, and
the shorter the deceleration time period within 1 au. For several of these events, the associated
geomagnetic storms were mainly caused by the southward magnetic fields in the sheath region. In
particular, the interaction between a CME-driven shock and a preceding ejecta significantly enhanced
the preexisting southward magnetic fields and gave rise to a severe complex geomagnetic storm.
