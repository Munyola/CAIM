We report the experimental observation of dynamical behavior of flowing complex plasma past a spherical
obstacle. The experiment has been carried out in a $\Pi$-shaped DC glow discharge experimental
device using kaolin particles as the dust component in a background of Argon plasma. A stationary
dust cloud is formed by maintaining the pumping speed and gas flow rate. A spherical obstacle vertically
mounted on the cathode tray acts as an obstacle to the flow of dust particles. The controlled dust
flow is generated by reducing the mass flow of the neutrals through a mass flow controller. The flowing
dust particles are repelled by the electrostatic field of the negatively charged sphere and a microparticle
free region (dust void) is formed surrounding the obstacle. The far particles are attracted towards
the floating obstacle and reflected back when they have arrived at a minimum distance, causing a
ring shaped structure around the obstacle. We characterize the shape of this structure over a range
of dust flow speeds and obstacle biases. For a supersonic flow of dust fluid around a negatively biased
obstacle, a bow shock is formed on the upstream side of the sphere, while the generation of wave structures
is observed on the downstream side for a particular range of flow velocities. Reynolds numbers in
this case is estimated as $R_e \gtrsim 50$. This wave structure reminds of the beginning of the formation
of a Von-K\'arm\'an vortex street. A physical picture for the observed structure based on ion-drag,
neutral streaming and electric forces is discussed.
