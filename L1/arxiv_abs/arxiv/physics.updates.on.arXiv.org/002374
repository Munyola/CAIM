The mass of axion dark matter is only weakly bounded by cosmological observations, necessitating
a variety of detection techniques and experiments at many different mass ranges. Axions are expected
to couple to photons via the inverse Primakoff effect and cryogenic resonant cavities are often
proposed as a tool for detecting these photons. However, such structures are inherently narrowband
and the range of possible axion dark matter masses spans several orders of magnitude. On the other
hand broadband low-mass particle haloscopes have been proposed using inductive magnetometer
sensors coupled to SQUID amplifiers and requiring a solenoid magnet of gapped toroidal geometry.
In this work we propose an alternative approach, which uses a capacitive sensor in a conventional
solenoidal magnet with the magnetic field aligned in the laboratory z-axis, as implemented in standard
haloscope experiments. In the presence of a large DC magnetic field, the inverse Primakoff effect
causes a time varying electric field (or displacement current) in the z-direction to oscillate
at the axion Compton frequency. We propose non-resonant techniques to detect this electric field
by implementing capacitive sensors coupled to a low noise amplifier. We present the theoretical
foundation for this proposal, and the first experimental results. Preliminary results constrain
$g_{a\gamma\gamma} >\sim2.35\times10^{-12}$ $\text{GeV}^{-1}$ in the mass range of $2.08\times10^{-11}$
to $2.2\times10^{-11}$ eV, and demonstrate potential sensitivity to axion like dark matter with
masses in the range of $10^{-12}$ to $10^{-8}$ eV.
