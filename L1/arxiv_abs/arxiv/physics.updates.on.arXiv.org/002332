The project DRESDYN (DREsden Sodium facility for DYNamo and thermohydraulic studies) conducted
at Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf (HZDR) provides a new platform for a variety of liquid
sodium experiments devoted to problems of geo- and astrophysical magnetohydrodynamics. The most
ambitious experiment within this project is a precession driven dynamo experiment that currently
is under construction. It consists of a cylinder filled with liquid sodium that simultaneously
rotates around two axes. The experiment is motivated by the idea of a precession-driven flow as a
complementary energy source for the geodynamo or the ancient lunar dynamo. In the present study
we address numerical and experimental examinations in order to identify parameter regions where
the onset of magnetic field excitation will be most probable. Both approaches show that in the strongly
nonlinear regime the flow is essentially composed of the directly forced primary Kelvin mode and
higher modes in terms of standing inertial waves that arise from nonlinear self-interactions.
A peculiarity is the resonance-like emergence of an axisymmetric mode that represents a double
roll structure in the meridional plane, which, however, only occurs in a very limited range of the
precession ratio. This axisymmetric mode turns out to be beneficial for dynamo action, and kinematic
simulations of the magnetic field evolution induced by the time-averaged flow exhibit magnetic
field excitation at critical magnetic Reynolds numbers around ${\rm{Rm}}^{\rm{c}}\approx 430$,
which is well within the range of the planned liquid sodium experiment.
