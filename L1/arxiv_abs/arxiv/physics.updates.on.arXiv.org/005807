We present the realization of the topological valley-protected zero-order antisymmetric (A0)
or symmetric (S0) and zero-order shear-horizontal (SH0) Lamb waves at different domain walls based
on topologically distinct asymmetric double-sided pillared phononic crystals. The elastic periodic
structures have either the triangular or the honeycomb symmetry and give rise to a double-negative
branch in the dispersion curves. By artificially folding the doubly negative branch, a degenerate
Dirac cone is achieved. Different polarization-dependent propagation along the same primary
direction along the constituent branches are presented. Moreover, divergent polarization-dependent
phenomena along different primary directions along a given branch are also reported. By imposing
two large space-inversion symmetry (SIS) breaking perturbations the topological phase transition
is obtained. We show that the Berry curvature becomes strongly anisotropic when the wave vector
gets away from the valleys. Further, we demonstrate the unidirectional transport of A0, S0, and
SH0 Lamb waves at different domain walls in straight or Z-shape wave guides. In the large SIS breaking
case, we show negligible reflection at the zigzag outlet of the straight wave guide and occurrence
of weak inter-valley scattering at the bending corners of the Z-shape wave guide. For a larger strength
of SIS breaking, the edge states are gapped and strong reflection at the zigzag outlet and bending
corners is observed. The topological protection cannot be guaranteed any more in that case.
