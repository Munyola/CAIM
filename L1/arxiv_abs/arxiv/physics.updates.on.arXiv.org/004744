The purpose of this study is to present a new semi-automated methodology for three-dimensional
(3D) reconstruction of coronary arteries and their plaque morphology using Computed Tomography
Angiography (CTA) images. The methodology is summarized in seven stages: pre-processing of the
acquired CTA images, extraction of the vessel tree centerline, estimation of a weight function
for lumen, outer wall and calcified plaque, lumen segmentation, outer wall segmentation, plaque
detection, and finally 3D surfaces construction. The methodology was evaluated using both expert
manual annotations and estimations of a recently presented Intravascular Ultrasound (IVUS) reconstruction
method. As far as the manual annotation validation process is concerned, the mean value of the comparison
metrics for the 3D segmentation were 0.749 and 1.746 for the Dice coefficient and Hausdorff distance,
respectively. On the other hand, the correlation coefficients for the degree of stenosis 1, the
degree of stenosis 2, the plaque burden, the minimal lumen area and the minimal lumen diameter, when
comparing the derived from the proposed methodology 3D models with the IVUS reconstructed models,
were 0.79, 0.77, 0.75, 0.85, 0.81, respectively. The proposed methodology is an innovative approach
for reconstruction of coronary arteries, since it provides 3D models of the lumen, the outer wall
and the CP plaques, using the minimal user interaction. Its first implementation demonstrated
that it provides an accurate reconstruction of coronary arteries and thus, it may have a wide clinical
applicability
