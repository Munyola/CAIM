Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) and Particle Tracking Velocimetry (PTV) have been employed to
investigate the dynamics of finite-size spherical particles, slightly heavier than the carrier
fluid, in a horizontal turbulent square duct flow. Interface resolved Direct Numerical Simulations
(DNS) have also been performed with the Immersed Boundary Method (IBM) at the same experimental
conditions, bulk Reynolds number $Re_{2H}$ = 5600, duct height to particle size ratio $2H/d_p$
= 14.5, particle volume fraction $\Phi$ = 1% and particle to fluid density ratio $\rho_p/\rho_f$
= 1.0035. A good agreement has been observed between experiments and simulations in terms of the
overall pressure drop, concentration distribution and turbulent statistics of the two phases.
Additional experimental results considering two particle sizes, $2H/d_p$ = 14.5 and 9 and multiple
$\Phi$ = 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5% are reported at the same $Re_{2H}$. The pressure drop monotonically increases
with the volume fraction, almost linearly and nearly independently of the particle size for the
above parameters. However, despite the similar pressure drop, the microscopic picture, the fluid
velocity statistics, differs significantly with the particle size. This one-to-one comparison
between simulations and experiments extends the validity of interface resolved DNS in complex
turbulent multiphase flows and highlights the ability of experiments to investigate such flows
in considerable details, even in regions where the local volume fraction is relatively high.
