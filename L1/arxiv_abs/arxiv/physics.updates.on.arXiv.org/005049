The driven, cylindrical, free interface between two miscible, Stokes fluids with high viscosity
contrast have been shown to exhibit dispersive hydrodynamics. A hallmark feature of dispersive
hydrodynamic media is the dispersive resolution of wavebreaking that results in a dispersive shock
wave. In the context of the viscous fluid conduit system, the present work introduces a simple, practical
method to precisely control the location, time, and spatial profile of wavebreaking in dispersive
hydrodynamic systems with only boundary control. The method is based on tracking the dispersionless
characteristics backward from the desired wavebreaking profile to the boundary. In addition to
the generation of approximately step-like Riemann and box problems, the method is generalized
to other, approximately piecewise-linear dispersive hydrodynamic profiles including the triangle
wave and N-wave. A definition of dispersive hydrodynamic wavebreaking is used to obtain quantitative
agreement between the predicted location and time of wavebreaking, viscous fluid conduit experiment,
and direct numerical simulations for a range of flow conditions. Observed space-time characteristics
also agree with triangle and N-wave predictions. The characteristic boundary control method introduced
here enables the experimental investigation of a variety of wavebreaking profiles and is expected
to be useful in other dispersive hydrodynamic media. As an application of this approach, soliton
fission from a large, box-like disturbance is observed both experimentally and numerically, motivating
future analytical treatment.
