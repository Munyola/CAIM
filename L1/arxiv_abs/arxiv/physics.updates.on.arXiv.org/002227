Bacteria such as Escherichia coli move about in a series of runs and tumbles: while a run state (straight
motion) entails all the flagellar motors spinning in counterclockwise mode, a tumble is caused
by a shift in the state of one or more motors to clockwise spinning mode. In the presence of an attractant
gradient in the environment, runs in the favourable direction are extended, and this results in
a net drift of the organism in the direction of the gradient. The underlying signal transduction
mechanism produces directed motion through a bi-lobed response function which relates the clockwise
bias of the flagellar motor to temporal changes in the attractant concentration. The two lobes (positive
and negative) of the response function are separated by a time interval of $\sim 1$s, such that the
bacterium effectively compares the concentration at two different positions in space and responds
accordingly. We present here a novel path-integral method which allows us to address this problem
in the most general way possible, including multi-step CW-CCW transitions, directional persistence
and power-law waiting time distributions. The method allows us to calculate quantities such as
the effective diffusion coefficient and drift velocity, in a power series expansion in the attractant
gradient. Explicit results in the lowest order in the expansion are presented for specific models,
which, wherever applicable, agree with the known results. New results for gamma-distributed run
interval distributions are also presented.
