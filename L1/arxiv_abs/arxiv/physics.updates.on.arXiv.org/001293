Minimum energy paths for transitions such as atomic and/or spin rearrangements in thermalized
systems are the transition paths of largest statistical weight. Such paths are frequently calculated
using the nudged elastic band method, where an initial path is iteratively shifted to the nearest
minimum energy path. The computational effort can be large, especially when ab initio or electron
density functional calculations are used to evaluate the energy and atomic forces. Here, we show
how the number of such evaluations can be reduced by an order of magnitude using a Gaussian process
regression approach where an approximate energy surface is generated and refined in each iteration.
When the goal is to evaluate the transition rate within harmonic transition state theory, the evaluation
of the Hessian matrix at the initial and final state minima can be carried out beforehand and used
as input in the minimum energy path calculation, thereby improving stability and reducing the number
of iterations needed for convergence. A Gaussian process model also provides an uncertainty estimate
for the approximate energy surface, and this can be used to focus the calculations on the lesser-known
part of the path, thereby reducing the number of needed energy and force evaluations to a half in the
present calculations. The methodology is illustrated using the two-dimensional M\"uller-Brown
potential surface and performance assessed on an established benchmark involving 13 rearrangement
transitions of a heptamer island on a solid surface.
