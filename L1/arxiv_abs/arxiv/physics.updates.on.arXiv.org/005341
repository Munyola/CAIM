We apply the well-known generalized Lagrangian mean (GLM) theory and classical WKB wave dispersion
theory in combination with recent developments in stochastic geometric fluid mechanics to derive
a framework for estimating uncertainty for wave--current interaction (WCI) dynamics in ocean
science. The primary example is the closure of the GLM theory of the Euler--Boussinesq equations
for an incompressible, stratified, rotating flow. This example is relevant to the energizing and
mixing of the ocean thermocline due to the combination of Langmuir circulation, internal waves
and turbulent shear flows. More specifically, after a geometric mechanics reformulation of GLM
as a classical Hamiltonian field theory, we investigate data-driven and model-driven stochastic
closure strategies for modelling uncertainty in WCI. For the data-driven option, we introduce
a stochastic group velocity for transport of wave properties, relative to the frame of motion of
the Lagrangian mean flow velocity and a stochastic pressure contribution from the fluctuating
kinetic energy. This approach is complementary to recent work in SALT (Stochastic Advection by
Lie Transport) for estimating uncertainty in fluid dynamics using stochastic variational principles,
without making the GLM wave, mean flow decomposition. For the model-driven closure option, we introduce
a stochastic closure which is based on the familiar Gent--McWilliams (GM) transport scheme. In
fact, the variational approach introduces additional transport and force terms into the GM motion
equation for both the deterministic and stochastic cases.
