Large parallel gains in the development of both computational resources as well as sampling methods
have now made it possible to simulate dissociation events in ligand-protein complexes with all--atom
resolution. Such encouraging progress, together with the inherent spatiotemporal resolution
associated with molecular simulations, has left their use for investigating dissociation processes
brimming with potential, both in rational drug design, where it can be an invaluable tool for determining
the mechanistic driving forces behind dissociation rate constants, as well as in force-field development,
where it can provide a catalog of transient molecular structures on which to refine force-fields.
Although much progress has been made in making force-fields more accurate, reducing their error
for transient structures along a transition path could yet prove to be a critical development helping
to make kinetic predictions much more accurate. In what follows we will provide a state-of-the-art
compilation of the molecular dynamics (MD) methods used to investigate the kinetics and mechanisms
of ligand-protein dissociation processes. Due to the timescales of such processes being slower
than what is accessible using straightforward MD simulations, several ingenious schemes are being
devised at a rapid rate to overcome this obstacle. Here we provide an up-to-date compendium of such
methods and their achievements/shortcomings in extracting mechanistic insight into ligand-protein
dissociation. We conclude with a critical and provocative appraisal attempting to answer the title
of this review.
