In the constrained minimization method of Gidopoulos and Lathiotakis (J. Chem. Phys. 136, 224109),
the Hartree exchange and correlation Kohn-Sham potential of a finite $N$-electron system is replaced
by the electrostatic potential of an effective charge density that is everywhere positive and integrates
to a charge of $N-1$ electrons. The optimal effective charge density (electron repulsion density,
$\rho_{\rm rep}$) and the corresponding optimal effective potential (electron repulsion potential
$v_{\rm rep}$) are obtained by minimizing the electronic total energy in any density functional
approximation. The two constraints are sufficient to remove the self-interaction errors from
$v_{\rm rep}$, correcting its asymptotic behavior at large distances from the system. In the present
work, we describe, in complete detail, the constrained minimization method, including recent
refinements. We also assess its performance in removing the self-interaction errors for three
popular density functional approximations, namely LDA, PBE, and B3LYP, by comparing the obtained
ionization energies to their experimental values for an extended set of molecules. We show that
the results of the constrained minimizations are almost independent of the specific approximation
with average percentage errors 15%, 14%, 13% for the above DFAs respectively. These errors are substantially
smaller than the corresponding errors of the plain (unconstrained) Kohn-Sham calculations at
38%, 39%, and 27% respectively. Finally, we showed that this method correctly predicts negative
values for the HOMO energies of several anions.
