An analytical solution to the nonlinear differential equation describing the equation of motion
of a particle moving in an unforced physical system with linear damping, governed by a cubic potential
well, is presented in terms of the Jacobi elliptic functions. In the attractive region of the potential
the system becomes an anharmonic damped oscillator, however with asymmetric displacement. An
expression for the period of oscillation is derived, which for a nonlinear damped system is time
dependent, and in particular it contains a quartic root of an exponentially decaying term in the
denominator. Initially the period is longer as compared to that of a linear oscillator, however
gradually it decreases to that of a linear damped oscillator. Transforming the undamped nonlinear
differential equation into the differential equation describing orbital motion of planets, the
perihelion advance of Mercury can be estimated to 42.98 arcseconds/century, close to present day
observations of 43.1 arcseconds/century. Some familiarity with the Jacobi elliptic functions
is required, in particular with respect to the differential behavior of these functions, however,
they are standard functions of advanced mathematical computer algebra tools. The expression derived
for the solution to the nonlinear physical system, and in particular the expression for the period
of oscillation, is useful for an accurate evaluation of experiments in introductory and advanced
physics labs, but also of interest for specialists working with nonlinear phenomena governed by
the cubic potential well.
