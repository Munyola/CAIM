Whistler waves are intermittently present in the solar wind, while their origin and effects are
not entirely understood. We present a statistical analysis of magnetic field fluctuations in the
whistler frequency range (above 16 Hz) based on about 801,500 magnetic field spectra measured over
three years aboard ARTEMIS spacecraft in the pristine solar wind. About 13,700 spectra (30 hours
in total) with intense magnetic field fluctuations satisfy the interpretation in terms of quasi-parallel
whistler waves. We provide estimates of the whistler wave occurrence probability, amplitudes,
frequencies and bandwidths. The occurrence probability of whistler waves is shown to strongly
depend on the electron temperature anisotropy. The whistler waves amplitudes are in the range from
about 0.01 to 0.1 nT and typically below 0.02 of the background magnetic field. The frequencies of
the whistler waves are shown to be below an upper bound that is dependent on $\beta_{e}$. The correlations
established between the whistler wave properties and local macroscopic plasma parameters suggest
that the observed whistler waves can be generated in local plasmas by the whistler heat flux instability.
The whistler wave amplitudes are typically small, which questions the hypothesis that quasi-parallel
whistler waves are capable to regulate the electron heat flux in the solar wind. We show that the observed
whistler waves have sufficiently wide bandwidths and small amplitudes, so that effects of the whistler
waves on electrons can be addressed in the frame of the quasi-linear theory.
