The work in this paper is motivated by the increasing use of steel cased wells in geoscience problems,
including monitoring applications such as carbon capture and storage and hydraulic fracturing.
Several authors have demonstrated that the presence of steel cased wells can be beneficial for detecting
signal due to targets at depth. Furthermore, there is increased interest in the use of electrical
methods for detecting flaws or breaks from a surface-based casing integrity integrity experiment.
The large contrasts in physical properties and disparate length scales introduced by a steel-cased
well have long presented a significant computational challenge, however, advances such as cylindrical
meshing strategies make modeling the fine-scale details of the casing feasible. Thus, the opportunity
to delve into the physics in such settings has opened up. In this paper, we investigate three aspects
of DC resistivity in settings with steel-cased wells: (1) the feasibility of using a surface-based
DC resistivity survey for diagnosing impairments along a well in a casing integrity experiment,
(2) survey design considerations for exciting a conductive or resistive target at depth, and (3)
the potential of approximating the fine-scale structure of a steel cased well with a coarse-scale
representation to reduce computational load. To promote insight into the physics, we present results
by plotting the currents, charges, and electric fields in each of the scenarios examined. All of
the examples shown in this paper are built on open-source software and are available as Jupyter notebooks.
