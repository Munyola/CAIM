The recent emergence and success of electroencephalography (EEG) in low-cost portable devices,
has opened the door to a new generation of applications processing a small number of EEG channels
for health monitoring and brain-computer interfacing. These recordings are, however, contaminated
by many sources of noise degrading the signals of interest, thus compromising the interpretation
of the underlying brain state. In this work, we propose a new data-driven algorithm to effectively
remove ocular and muscular artifacts from single-channel EEG: the surrogate-based artifact removal
(SuBAR). Methods: By means of the time-frequency analysis of surrogate data, our approach is able
to identify and filter automatically ocular and muscular artifacts embedded in single-channel
EEG. Results: In a comparative study using artificially contami- nated EEG signals, the efficacy
of the algorithm in terms of noise removal and signal distortion was superior to other traditionally-employed
single-channel EEG denoising techniques: wavelet thresholding and the canonical correlation
analysis combined with an advanced version of the empirical mode decomposition. Even in the presence
of mild and severe artifacts, our artifact removal method provides a relative error 4 to 5 times lower
than traditional techniques. Significance: In view of these results, the SuBAR method is a promising
solution for mobile environments, such as ambulatory healthcare systems, sleep stage scoring
or anesthesia monitoring, where very few EEG channels or even a single channel is available.
