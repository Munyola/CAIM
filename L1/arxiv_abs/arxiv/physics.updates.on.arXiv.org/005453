Measuring graph clustering quality remains an open problem. To address it, we introduce quality
measures based on comparisons of intra- and inter-cluster densities, an accompanying statistical
test of the significance of their differences and a step-by-step routine for clustering quality
assessment. Our null hypothesis does not rely on any generative model for the graph, unlike modularity
which uses the configuration model as a null model. Our measures are shown to meet the axioms of a good
clustering quality function, unlike the very commonly used modularity measure. They also have
an intuitive graph-theoretic interpretation, a formal statistical interpretation and can be
easily tested for significance. Our work is centered on the idea that well clustered graphs will
display a significantly larger intra-cluster density than inter-cluster density. We develop
tests to validate the existence of such a cluster structure. We empirically explore the behavior
of our measures under a number of stress test scenarios and compare their behavior to the commonly
used modularity and conductance measures. Empirical stress test results confirm that our measures
compare very favorably to the established ones. In particular, they are shown to be more responsive
to graph structure and less sensitive to sample size and breakdowns during numerical implementation
and less sensitive to uncertainty in connectivity. These features are especially important in
the context of larger data sets or when the data may contain errors in the connectivity patterns.
