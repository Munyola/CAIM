Built around the SMARDDA modules for magnetic field-line tracing [IEEE Tr. Plasma Sc. 42 (2014)
1932], the SMITER code package (SMARDDA for ITER) is a new graphical user interface (GUI) framework
for power deposition mapping on tokamak plasma-facing components (PFC) in the full 3-D CAD geometry
of the machine, taking as input a user-defined specification for parallel heat flux in the scrape-off
layer (SOL) and a description of the equilibrium magnetic flux. The software package provides CAD
model import and integration with the ITER Integrated Modelling and Analysis Suite (IMAS), parametric
CAD components catalogue and modelling, CAD de-featuring for PFC surface extraction, meshing,
visualization (using an integrated ParaView module), Python scripting and batch processing,
storage in hierarchical data files, with several simulation cases in one study running in parallel
and using message passing interface (MPI) for code speed-up. An integrated ParaView module can
combine CAD geometry, magnetic field equilibrium, meshes and results for detailed setup analysis
and a module is under development for full finite element computation of surface temperatures resulting
from the power deposition patterns on 3-D PFCs. The code package has been developed for ITER, but
can be deployed for similar modelling of any tokamak. This paper presents and discusses key features
of this field-line tracing environment, demonstrates benchmarking against existing field-line
tracing code and provides specific examples of power deposition mapping in ITER for different plasma
configurations.
