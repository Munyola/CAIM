In nature adaptive coloration has been effectively utilized for concealment and signaling. Various
biological mechanisms have evolved that can tune the reflectivity for visible and ultraviolet
light. These examples inspire many artificial systems for mimicking adaptive coloration to match
the visual appearance to their surroundings. Thermal camouflage, however, has been an outstanding
challenge which requires an ability to control of the emitted thermal radiation from the surface.
Here we report a new class of active thermal surfaces capable of efficient real-time electrical-control
of thermal emission over the full infrared (IR) spectrum without changing the temperature of the
surface. Our approach relies on electro-modulation of IR absorptivity and emissivity of multilayer
graphene via reversible intercalation of nonvolatile ionic liquids. The demonstrated devices
are light (30 g/m2), thin (<50 um) and ultra-flexible which can conformably coat their environment.
In addition, combining active thermal surfaces with a feedback mechanism, we demonstrate realization
of an adaptive thermal camouflage system which can reconfigure its thermal appearance and blend
itself with the thermal background in a few seconds. Furthermore, we show that these devices can
disguise hot objects as cold and cold ones as hot in a thermal imaging system. We anticipate that,
the electrical control of thermal radiation will impact on a variety of new technologies ranging
from adaptive IR optics to heat management for outer space applications.
