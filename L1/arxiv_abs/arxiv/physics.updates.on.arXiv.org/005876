We perform direct numerical simulations of rotating turbulent Waleffe flow, the flow between two
parallel plates with a sinusoidal streamwise shear driving force, to study the formation of large-scale
structures and the mechanisms for momentum transport. We simulate different cyclonic and anti-cyclonic
rotations in the range of dimensionless rotation numbers (inverse Rossby numbers) $R_\Omega$
$\in$ $[-0.16, 2.21]$, and fix the Reynolds number to $Re=3.16\times 10^3$, large enough such that
the shear transport is almost entirely due to Reynolds stresses and viscous transport is negligible.
We find an optimum rotation in anti-cyclonic regime at $R_\Omega=0.63$, where a given streamwise
momentum transport in the wall-normal direction is achieved with minimum mean energy of the streamwise
flow. We link this optimal transport to the strength of large scale structures, as was done in plane
Couette by Brauckmann \& Eckhardt (J. Fluid Mech., 815, 2017). Furthermore, we explore the large-scale
structures and their behaviour under spanwise rotation, and find disorganized large structures
at $R_\Omega =0$ but highly organized structures in the anti-cyclonic regime, similar to the rolls
in rotating plane Couette and turbulent Taylor Couette flow. We compare the large scale structures
of plane Couette flow and Waleffe flow, and observe that the streamwise vorticity is localized inside
the cores of the rolls. We show that the rolls take energy from the mean flow at long time-scales, and
relate these structures to eigenvalues of the streamfunction.
