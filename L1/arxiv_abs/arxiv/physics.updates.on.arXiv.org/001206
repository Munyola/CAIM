It is commonly assumed in neuronal coding that repeated presentations of a stimulus to a coding neuron
elicit similar responses. One common way to assess similarity are spike train distances. These
can be divided into spike-resolved, such as the Victor-Purpura and the van Rossum distance, and
time-resolved, e.g. the ISI-, the SPIKE- and the RI-SPIKE-distance. We use independent steady-rate
Poisson processes as surrogates for spike trains with fixed rate and no timing information to address
two basic questions: How does the sensitivity of the different spike train distances to temporal
coding depend on the rates of the two processes and how do the distances deal with very low rates? Spike-resolved
distances always contain rate information even for parameters indicating time coding. This is
an issue for reasonably high rates but beneficial for very low rates. In contrast, the operational
range for detecting time coding of time-resolved distances is superior at normal rates, but these
measures produce artefacts at very low rates. The RI-SPIKE-distance is the only measure that is
sensitive to timing information only. While our results on rate-dependent expectation values
for the spike-resolved distances agree with Chicharro et al. (2011), we here go one step further
and specifically investigate applicability for very low rates. The most appropriate measure depends
on the rates of the data being analysed. Accordingly, we summarize our results in one table that allows
an easy selection of the preferred measure for any kind of data.
