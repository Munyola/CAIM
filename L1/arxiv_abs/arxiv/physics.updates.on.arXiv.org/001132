In this paper, we present an overview of concepts and data concerning inverse cascades of excitation
towards scales larger than the forcing scale in a variety of contexts, from two-dimensional fluids
and wave turbulence, to geophysical flows in the presence of rotation and stratification. We briefly
discuss the role of anisotropy in the occurrence and properties of such cascades. We then show that
the cascade of some invariant, for example the total energy, may be transferred through nonlinear
interactions to both the small scales and the large scales, with in each case a constant flux. This
is in contrast to the classical picture, and we illustrate such a dual cascade in the context of atmospheric
and oceanic observations, direct numerical simulations and modeling. We also show that this dual
cascade of total energy can in fact be decomposed in some cases into separate cascades of the kinetic
and potential energies, provided the Froude and Rossby numbers are small enough. In all cases, the
potential energy flux remains small, of the order of 10% or less relative to the kinetic energy flux.
Finally, we demonstrate that, in the small-scale inertial range, approximate equipartition between
potential and kinetic modes is obtained, leading to an energy ratio close to one, with strong departure
at large scales due to the dominant kinetic energy inverse cascade and piling-up at the lowest spatial
frequency, and at small scales due to unbalanced dissipation processes, even though the Prandtl
number is equal to one.
