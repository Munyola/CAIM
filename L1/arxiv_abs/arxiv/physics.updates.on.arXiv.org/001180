In this work, the static stability of plates with fixed trailing edges in axial airflow is studied
using the framework of Possio integral equation. First, we introduce a new derivation of a Possio
integral equation that relates the pressure jump along thin plates to their downwash based on the
linearization of the governing equations of an ideal compressible fluid. The steady state solution
to the Possio equation is used to account for the aerodynamic forces in the steady state plate governing
equation resulting in a singular differential-integral equation which is transformed to an integral
equation. Next, we verify the solvability of the integral equation based on the Fredholm alternative
for compact operators in Banach spaces and the contraction mapping theorem. Then, we derive explicit
formulas for the characteristic equations of free-clamped and free-pinned plates. The minimum
solutions to the characteristic equations are the divergence speeds which indicate when static
instabilities start to occur. We show analytically that free-pinned plates are statically unstable.
After that, we move to derive analytically flow speed intervals that correspond to static stability
regions for free-clamped plates. We also resort to numerical computations to obtain an explicit
formula for the divergence speed of free-clamped plates. Finally, we apply the obtained results
on piezoelectric plates and we show that free-clamped piezoelectric plates are statically more
stable than conventional free-clamped plates due to the piezoelectric coupling.
