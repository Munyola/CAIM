We present a systematic study of the effects of structural disorder on LN photonic crystal slab cavities
employing a three-dimensional Bloch mode expansion technique. We compute the optical density
of states (DOS), quality factors and effective mode volumes of the cavity modes and compare with
the modes of a corresponding disordered photonic crystal waveguide. We find that new resonances
induced by disorder do not appear in the spectral region of the LN cavity resonances and indeed the
disordered DOS enhancement is largest for the disordered waveguide system with the same length.
We also show that the cavity quality factors and effective mode volumes saturate at a specific cavity
length and become bounded by the corresponding values of the Anderson modes appearing in the disordered
waveguide. Finally, we show that the field confinement in the LN cavities is mainly determined by
Anderson localization as long as the confinement region is far enough from the cavity mirrors and
if the effective mode localization length is much smaller than the cavity length. Consequently,
we point out the clear failure of using models based on the cavity boundaries and a single slow-light
Bloch modes to describe cavity modes with large N, as is common practise for effective Fabry-P\'erot
resonators. These results are fundamentally interesting for applications in slow-light photonic
crystal lasers and cavity-QED, and provide new insights into the role of the boundary condition
(e.g., open versus mirrors) on a finite-size slow-light waveguide.
