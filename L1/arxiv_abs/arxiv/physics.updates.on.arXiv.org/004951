We study two variants of the modified Watts threshold model with a noise (with nonconformity, in
the terminology of social psychology) on a complete graph. Within the first version, a noise is introduced
via so-called independence, whereas in the second version anticonformity plays the role of a noise,
which destroys the order. The modified Watts threshold model, studied here, is homogeneous and
posses an up-down symmetry, which makes it similar to other binary opinion models with a single-flip
dynamics, such as the majority-vote and the q-voter models. Because within the majority-vote model
with independence only continuous phase transitions are observed, whereas within the q-voter
model with independence also discontinuous phase transitions are possible, we ask the question
about the factor, which could be responsible for discontinuity of the order parameter. We investigate
the model via the mean-field approach, which gives the exact result in the case of a complete graph,
as well as via Monte Carlo simulations. Additionally, we provide a heuristic reasoning, which explains
observed phenomena. We show that indeed, if the threshold r = 0.5, which corresponds to the majority-vote
model, an order-disorder transition is continuous. Moreover, results obtained for both versions
of the model (one with independence and the second one with anticonformity) give the same results,
only rescaled by the factor of 2. However, for r > 0.5 the jump of the order parameter and the hysteresis
is observed for the model with independence, and both versions of the model give qualitatively different
results.
