The transport and deposition of heavy particles over complex surface topography by turbulent fluid
flow is an important problem in a number of disciplines, including sediment and snow transport,
ecology and plant pathology, aeolian processes, and geomorphology. This article presents a framework
to simulate the transport and deposition of heavy particles over complex surfaces using the large
eddy simulation (LES) technique. An immersed boundary LES code is coupled with an Eulerian particle
code that solves the advection-diffusion equation for the resolved particle concentration field.
The mass conservation equation for the particle phase is discretized in a finite volume framework
using a Cartesian cut cell method that reshapes finite volume cells intersected by the immersed
boundary surface and conserves mass accurately. The proposed numerical model is compared with
data from wind tunnel experiments of heavy particle deposition over topography and is found to have
good agreement with observed deposition patterns. An LES case study of snow deposition over idealized
topography leads to several new insights. Particle inertia leads to relative velocities between
the particles and fluid in regions of mean flow acceleration, thereby enhancing deposition on the
windward side of obstacles and suppressing deposition on the leeward side. In addition, it is found
that the mean components of particle inertia are a factor of 6 or more larger than the turbulent components,
indicating that the enhancement/suppression of deposition by topography can be modeled in terms
of mean flow quantities.
