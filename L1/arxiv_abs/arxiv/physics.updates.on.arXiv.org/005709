Past severe earthquakes, such as Bam earthquake of 2003 and Tabas earthquake of 1978, have demonstrated
that many cities in Iran are prone to be struck by near-fault earthquakes. Such earthquakes are impulsive
in nature, and therefore, they are more destructive than the ordinary ground shaking. In the fourth
edition of Iranian seismic code (Standard No. 2800), some changes, including a modification factor
for the elastic acceleration response spectrum (EARS) have been recently recommended to reflect
the effects of such probable near-fault earthquakes for the designing procedure. In this study,
a numbers of 2D RC moment resisting frames (MRFs), from four to twelve story buildings, are designed
linearly based on Iranian National Building Code (INBC) and Standard No. 2800 as well. Subsequently,
their nonlinear models are reproduced for conducting nonlinear dynamic time history (NDTH) analysis.
For this purpose, twenty impulsive ground motions are selected and scaled to be compatible with
the design basis earthquake (DBE) spectrum of the abovementioned code. It is concluded that the
seismic performance of the analyzed structures are not satisfactory at all; no buildings are successful
to satisfy the life safety (LS) performance level posed by guidelines such as ASCE41-06 or ASCE41-13.
Moreover, it is worth mentioning that even collapse prevention (CP) limit states are not also met
in some cases. Therefore, the recently added modifications in the Standard No. 2800 may be inadequate
to incorporate the near-fault earthquakes' effects.
