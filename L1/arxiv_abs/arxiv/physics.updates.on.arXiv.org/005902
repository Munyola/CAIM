We develop a $ P $-multigrid solver to simulate locally preconditioned unsteady compressible Navier-Stokes
equations at low Mach numbers with implicit high-order methods. Specifically, the high-order
flux reconstruction/correction procedure via reconstruction (FR/CPR) method is employed for
spatial discretization and the high-order time integration is conducted by means of the explicit
first stage, singly diagonally implicit Runge-Kutta (ESDIRK) method. Local preconditioning
is used to alleviate the stiffness of the compressible Navier-Stokes equations at low Mach numbers
and is only conducted in pseudo transient continuation to ensure the high-order accuracy of ESDIRK
methods. We employ the element Jacobi smoother to update the solutions at different $ P $-levels
in the $ P $-multigrid solver. High-order spatiotemporal accuracy of the new solver for low-Mach-number
flow simulation is verified with the isentropic vortex propagation when the Mach (Ma) number of
the free stream is 0.005. The impact of the hierarchy of polynomial degrees on the convergence speed
of the $ P $-multigrid method is studied via several numerical experiments, including two dimensional
(2D) inviscid and viscous flows over a NACA0012 airfoil at $\text{Ma} = 0.001$, and a three dimensional
(3D) inviscid flow over a sphere at $\text{Ma} = 0.001$. The $ P $-multigrid solver is then applied
to coarse resolution simulation of the transitional flows over an SD7003 wing at $ 8^\circ $ angle
of attack when the Reynolds number is 60000 and the Mach number is 0.1 or 0.01.
