Ice crystals settling through a turbulent cloud are rotated by turbulent velocity gradients. In
the same way, turbulence affects the orientation of aggregates of organic matter settling in the
ocean. In fact most solid particles encountered in Nature are not spherical, and their orientation
affects their settling speed, as well as collision rates between particles. Therefore it is important
to understand the distribution of orientations of non-spherical particles settling in turbulence.
Here we study the angular dynamics of small prolate spheroids settling in homogeneous isotropic
turbulence. We consider a limit of the problem where the fluid torque due to convective inertia dominates,
so that rods settle essentially horizontally. Turbulence causes the orientation of the settling
particles to fluctuate, and we calculate their orientation distribution for prolate spheroids
with arbitrary aspect ratios for large settling number Sv (a dimensionless measure of the settling
speed), assuming small Stokes number St (a dimensionless measure of particle inertia). This overdamped
theory predicts that the orientation distribution is very narrow at large Sv, with a variance proportional
to ${\rm Sv}^{-4}$. By considering the role of particle inertia, we analyse the limitations of the
overdamped theory, and determine its range of applicability. Our predictions are in excellent
agreement with numerical simulations of simplified models of turbulent flows. Finally we contrast
our results with those of an alternative theory predicting that the orientation variance scales
as ${\rm Sv}^{-2}$ at large Sv.
