With a brief letter to Nature in 1972, Robert May triggered a worldwide research program in theoretical
ecology and complex systems that continues to this day. Building on powerful mathematical results
about large random matrices, he argued that systems with sufficiently large numbers of interacting
components are generically unstable. In the ecological context, May's thesis directly contradicted
the longstanding ecological intuition that diversity promotes stability. In economics and finance,
May's work helped to consolidate growing concerns about the fragility of an increasingly interconnected
global marketplace. In this Letter, we draw on recent theoretical progress in random matrix theory
and statistical physics to fundamentally extend and reinterpret May's theorem. We confirm that
a wide range of ecological models become unstable at the point predicted by May, even when the models
do not strictly follow his assumptions. Surprisingly, increasing the interaction strength or
diversity beyond the May threshold results in a reorganization of the ecosystem -- through extinction
of a fixed fraction of species -- into a new stable state whose properties are well described by purely
random interactions. This self-organized state remains stable for arbitrarily large ecosystem
and suggests a new interpretation of May's original conclusions: when interacting complex systems
with many components become sufficiently large, they will generically undergo a transition to
a "typical" self-organized, stable state.
