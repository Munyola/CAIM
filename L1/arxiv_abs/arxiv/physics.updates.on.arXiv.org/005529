We investigate a new class of LRS Bianchi type-II cosmological models by revisiting in the paper
of Mishra {\it et al} (2013) by considering a new deceleration parameter (DP) depending on the time
in string cosmology for the modified gravity theory suggested by S$\acute{a}$ez \& Ballester (1986).
We have considered the energy-momentum tensor proposed by Leteliar (1983) for bulk viscous and
perfect fluid under some assumptions. To make our models consistent with recent astronomical observations,
we have used scale factor (Sharma {\it et al} 2018; Garg {\it et al} 2019) $ a(t)=\exp{[\frac{1}{\beta}\sqrt{2
\beta t + k}]}$, where $\beta $ and $k$ are positive constants and it provides a time-varying DP. By
using the recent constraints ($H_{0}=73.8$, and $q_{0} = -0.54$) from SN Ia data in combination
with BAO and CMB observations (Giostri {\it et al}, arXiv:1203.3213v2[astro-ph.CO]), we affirm
$\beta = 0.0062$ and $k = 0.000016$. For these constraints, we have substantiated a new class of cosmological
transit models for which the expansion takes place from early decelerated phase to the current accelerated
phase. Also, we have studied some physical, kinematic and geometric behavior of the models, and
have found them consistent with observations and well established theoretical results . We have
also compared our present results with those of Mishra {\it et al} (2013) and observed that the results
in this paper are much better, stable under perturbation and in good agreement with cosmological
reflections.
