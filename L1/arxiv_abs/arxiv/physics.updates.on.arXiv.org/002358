We consider the Barab\'{a}si-Albert scale-free network (SFN) composed of inhibitory bursting
Hindmarsh-Rose neurons. This inhibitory neuronal population has adaptive dynamic synaptic strengths
governed by the inhibitory spike-timing-dependent plasticity (iSTDP). In previous works without
iSTDP, burst synchronization (BS) was found to appear in a range of noise intensities for fixed synaptic
inhibition strengths. Here, we investigate the effect of iSTDP on BS by varying the noise intensity.
We employ an anti-Hebbian time window for the iSTDP update rule, in contrast to the Hebbian time window
for the excitatory STDP. A Matthew effect in inhibitory synaptic plasticity is thus found to occur;
good BS (with higher bursting measure) gets better via long-term depression (LTD), while bad BS
(with lower bursting measure) gets worse via long-term potentiation (LTP). This kind of Matthew
effect is in contrast to that in excitatory synaptic plasticity where good (bad) synchronization
gets better (worse) via LTP (LTD). Furthermore, emergences of LTD and LTP of synaptic inhibition
strengths are intensively investigated via a microscopic method based on the distributions of
time delays between the pre- and the post-synaptic burst onset times. Finally, in the presence of
iSTDP we investigate the effects of network architecture on BS by varying the symmetric attachment
degree $l^*$ and the asymmetry parameter $\Delta l$ in the SFN, and Matthew effects in inhibitory
synaptic plasticity are also found to occur by varying $l^*$ and $\Delta l$.
