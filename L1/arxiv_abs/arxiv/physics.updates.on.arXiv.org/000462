CMOS pixel sensors (CPS) represent a novel technological approach to building charged particle
detectors. CMOS processes allow to integrate a sensing volume and readout electronics in a single
silicon die allowing to build sensors with a small pixel pitch ($\sim 20 \mu m$) and low material budget
($\sim 0.2-0.3\% X_0$) per layer. These characteristics make CPS an attractive option for vertexing
and tracking systems of high energy physics experiments. Moreover, thanks to the mass production
industrial CMOS processes used for the manufacturing of CPS the fabrication construction cost
can be significantly reduced in comparison to more standard semiconductor technologies. However,
the attainable performance level of the CPS in terms of radiation hardness and readout speed is mostly
determined by the fabrication parameters of the CMOS processes available on the market rather than
by the CPS intrinsic potential. The permanent evolution of commercial CMOS processes towards smaller
feature sizes and high resistivity epitaxial layers leads to the better radiation hardness and
allows the implementation of accelerated readout circuits. The TowerJazz $0.18 \mu m$ CMOS process
being one of the most relevant examples recently became of interest for several future detector
projects. The most imminent of these project is an upgrade of the Inner Tracking System (ITS) of the
ALICE detector at LHC. It will be followed by the Micro-Vertex Detector (MVD) of the CBM experiment
at FAIR. Other experiments like ILD consider CPS as one of the viable options for flavour tagging
and tracking sub-systems.
