An efficient implicit kinetic scheme is developed to solve the stationary phonon Boltzmann transport
equation (BTE) based on the non-gray model including the phonon dispersion and polarization. Due
to the wide range of the dispersed phonon mean free paths, the phonon transport under the non-gray
model is essentially multiscale, and has to be solved differently and appropriately for varied
phonon frequencies and branches. The proposed implicit kinetic scheme is composed of a microscopic
iteration and a macroscopic iteration. The microscopic iteration is capable of automatically
adapting with varied phonon mean free path of each phonon frequency and branch through solving the
phonon BTE. The energy transfer of all phonons is gathered together by the microscopic iteration
to evaluate the heat flux. The temperature field is predicted through a macroscopic heat transfer
equation according to the heat flux, and the equilibrium state in the phonon BTE is also updated.
The combination of the phonon BTE solver and the macroscopic equation makes the present method very
efficient in a wide length scale. Three numerical tests, including the cross-plane, in-plane and
nano-porous heat transfer in silicon, validate that the present scheme can handle with the phonon
dispersion and polarization correctly and predict the multiscale heat transfer phenomena efficiently
in a wide range. The present method could be tens of times faster than the typical implicit DOM and
keeps the same amount of the memory requirements as the Fourier solver for multiscale heat transfer
problem.
