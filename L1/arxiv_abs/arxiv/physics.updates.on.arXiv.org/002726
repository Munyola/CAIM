Particles are accelerated to very high, non-thermal energies in solar and space plasma environments.
While energy spectra of accelerated electrons often exhibit a power law, it remains unclear how
electrons are accelerated to high energies and what processes determine the power-law index $\delta$.
Here, we review previous observations of the power-law index $\delta$ in a variety of different
plasma environments with a particular focus on sub-relativistic electrons. It appears that in
regions more closely related to magnetic reconnection (such as the `above-the-looptop' solar
hard X-ray source and the plasma sheet in Earth's magnetotail), the spectra are typically soft ($\delta
\gtrsim$ 4). This is in contrast to the typically hard spectra ($\delta \lesssim$ 4) that are observed
in coincidence with shocks. The difference implies that shocks are more efficient in producing
a larger non-thermal fraction of electron energies when compared to magnetic reconnection. A caveat
is that during active times in Earth's magnetotail, $\delta$ values seem spatially uniform in the
plasma sheet, while power-law distributions still exist even in quiet times. The role of magnetotail
reconnection in the electron power-law formation could therefore be confounded with these background
conditions. Because different regions have been studied with different instrumentations and
methodologies, we point out a need for more systematic and coordinated studies of power-law distributions
for a better understanding of possible scaling laws in particle acceleration as well as their universality.
