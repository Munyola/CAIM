The angle-dependent scattering effect of aerosols in the atmosphere can be used to infer their compositions,
which in turn is important to understand their impacts of human health and Earth climate. The aerosol
phase function, which characterizes the angular signature of scattering, has been continuously
monitored from ground-based and space-borne observations. However, the range of scattering angles
these instruments can sample is very limited. There is a dearth of research on the remote sensing
of aerosol angular scattering effect at a city scale that analyzes diurnal variability and includes
a wide range of scattering angles. Here, we quantify the aerosol angular scattering effect using
measurements from a mountain-top remote sensing instrument: the California Laboratory for Atmospheric
Remote Sensing Fourier Transform Spectrometer (CLARS-FTS). CLARS-FTS is located on top of the
Mt. Wilson (1.67km above sea level) overlooking the Los Angeles (LA) megacity and receives reflected
sunlight from targeted surface reflection points. The observational geometries of CLARS-FTS
provide a wide range of scattering angles, from about 20 degrees (forward) to about 140 degrees (backward).
The O2 ratio, which is the ratio of retrieved O2 Slant Column Density (SCD) to geometric O2 SCD, quantifies
the aerosol transmission with a value of 1.0 represent aerosol-free and with a value closer to 0.0
represents stronger aerosol loadings. The aerosol transmission quantified by the O2 ratio from
CLARS measurements provides an effective indicator of the aerosol scattering effect.
