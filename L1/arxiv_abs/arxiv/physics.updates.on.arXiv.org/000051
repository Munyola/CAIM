Pulsating flows with a \emph{total reverse flow} phase are ubiquitous in physiological systems
in normal and pathological conditions. Irregularity of hemodynamic parameters in such flows is
correlated with the appearance and development of several arterial pathologies. We study the relations
between flow waveform parameters and the wall shear stress (WSS) related quantities such as mean,
root-mean-square, gradient of WSS and the oscillating shear index. The phase-averaged velocity
profiles measured by the digital particle image velocimetry are used to estimate WSS utilizing
the Womersley pulsating flow model. In addition to the Reynolds and Womersley numbers, another
dimensionless parameter, pulsating index (PI) which is the ratio of forward flow rate to the reverse
flow rate is required. PI is essential for the complete description of the flow patterns with the
total flow reversal. We demonstrate significant effects on the WSS quantities due to the pulsating
frequency and PI. Furthermore, the particle residence time (PRT), measured using the three-dimensional
particle tracking velocimetry, shows significant correlation with WSS related quantities. For
example, shorter residence time correlates strongly with the high pulsatility index. Correlations
of other quantities are qualitatively similar though weaker, suggesting cross-coupling effects.
It is proposed that PRT, estimated in-vivo from the trajectories of magnetic or contrast tracers,
can provide an alternative diagnostics of wall shear stress parameters.
