In this paper, we develop an analytic physics-based model to describe current conduction in ultra-thin
black phosphorus (BP) field-effect transistors (FETs). The model extends the concept of virtual
source charge calculation to capture the effect of both hole and electron charges for ambipolar
transport characteristics. The model comprehends the in-plane band-structure anisotropy in
BP, as well as the asymmetry in electron and hole current conduction characteristics. The model
also includes the effect of Schottky-type source/drain contact resistances, which are voltage-dependent
and can significantly limit current conduction in the on-state in BP FETs. Model parameters are
extracted using measured data of back-gated BP transistors with gate lengths of 1000 nm and 300 nm
with BP thickness of 7.3 nm and 8.1 nm, and for the temperature range of 180 K to 298 K. Compared to previous
BP models that are validated only for room-temperature and near-equilibrium bias conditions (low
drain-source voltage), we demonstrate excellent agreement between the data and model over a broad
range of bias and temperature values. The model is also validated against numerical TCAD data of
top-gated BP transistors with a channel length of 300 nm. The model is implemented in Verilog-A and
the capability of the model to handle both dc and transient circuit simulations is demonstrated
using SPECTRE. The model not only provides a physical insight into technology-device interaction
in BP transistors, but can also be used to design and optimize BP-based circuits using a standard
hierarchical circuit simulator.
