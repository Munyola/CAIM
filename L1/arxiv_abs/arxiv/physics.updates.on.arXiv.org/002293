A next-generation, high-flux DD neutron generator has been designed, commissioned, and characterized,
and is now operational in a new facility at the University of California Berkeley. The generator,
originally designed for 40Ar/39Ar dating of geological materials, has since served numerous additional
applications, including medical isotope production studies, with others planned for the near
future. In this work, we present an overview of the High Flux Neutron Generator (HFNG) which includes
a variety of simulations, analytical models, and experimental validation of results. Extensive
analysis was performed in order to characterize the neutron yield, flux, and energy distribution
at specific locations where samples may be loaded for irradiation. A notable design feature of the
HFNG is the possibility for sample irradiation internal to the cathode, just 8 mm away from the neutron
production site, thus maximizing the neutron flux (n/cm2/s). The generator's maximum neutron
flux at this irradiation position is 2.58e7 n/cm2/s +/- 5% (approximately 3e8 n/s total yield) as
measured via activation of small natural indium foils. However, future development is aimed at
achieving an order of magnitude increase in flux. Additionally, the deuterium ion beam optics were
optimized by simulations for various extraction configurations in order to achieve a uniform neutron
flux distribution and an acceptable heat load. Finally, experiments were performed in order to
benchmark the modeling and characterization of the HFNG.
