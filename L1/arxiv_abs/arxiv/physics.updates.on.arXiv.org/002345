We study the force generation by a set of parallel actin filaments growing against an elastic membrane.
The elastic membrane tries to stay flat and any deformation from this flat state, either caused by
thermal fluctuations or due to protrusive polymerization force exerted by the filaments, costs
energy. We study two lattice models to describe the membrane dynamics. In one case, the energy cost
is assumed to be proportional to the absolute magnitude of the height gradient (gradient model)
and in the other case it is proportional to the square of the height gradient (Gaussian model). For
the gradient model we find that the membrane velocity is a non-monotonic function of the elastic
constant $\mu$, and reaches a peak at $\mu=\mu^\ast$. For $\mu < \mu^\ast$ the system fails to reach
a steady state and the membrane energy keeps increasing with time. For the Gaussian model, the system
always reaches a steady state and the membrane velocity decreases monotonically with the elastic
constant $\nu$ for all nonzero values of $\nu$. Multiple filaments give rise to protrusions at different
regions of the membrane and the elasticity of the membrane induces an effective attraction between
the two protrusions in the Gaussian model which causes the protrusions to merge and a single wide
protrusion is present in the system. In both the models, the relative time-scale between the membrane
and filament dynamics plays an important role in deciding whether the shape of elasticity-velocity
curve is concave or convex. Our numerical simulations agree reasonably well with our analytical
calculations.
