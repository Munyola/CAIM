In this paper, we present an experimental investigation of the turbulent saturation of the flow
driven by parametric resonance of inertial waves in a rotating fluid. In our set-up, a half-meter
wide ellipsoid filled with water is brought to solid body rotation, and then undergoes sustained
harmonic modulation of its rotation rate. This triggers the exponential growth of a pair of inertial
waves via a mechanism called the libration-driven elliptical instability. Once the saturation
of this instability is reached, we observe a turbulent state for which energy is \textcolor{RED}{injected
into} the resonant inertial waves only. Depending on the amplitude of the rotation rate modulation,
two different saturation states are observed. At large forcing amplitudes, the saturation flow
\textcolor{RED}{mainly consists of} a steady, geostrophic anticyclone. Its amplitude vanishes
as the forcing amplitude is decreased while remaining above the threshold of the elliptical instability.
Below this secondary transition, the saturation flow is a superposition of inertial waves which
are in weakly non-linear resonant interaction, a state that could asymptotically lead to inertial
wave turbulence. In addition to being a first experimental observation of a wave-dominated saturation
in unstable rotating flows, the present study is also an experimental confirmation of the model
of Le Reun et al, PRL (2017) who introduced the possibility of these two turbulent regimes. The transition
between these two regimes and \textcolor{RED}{their} relevance to geophysical applications
are finally discussed.
