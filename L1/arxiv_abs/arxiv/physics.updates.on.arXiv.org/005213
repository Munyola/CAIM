Infant mortality, by which we understand the postnatal stage during which mortality is declining,
is a manifestation and embodiment of congenital abnormalities. Severe defects will translate
into death occurring shortly after birth whereas slighter anomalies may contribute to death much
later, possibly only in adult age. While for many species birth defects would be nearly impossible
to identify, infant mortality provides a convenient global assessment. In the present paper we
examine a broad range of species from mammals to fish to gastropods to insects. One of the objectives
of our comparative analysis is to test a conjecture suggested by reliability engineering according
to which the frequency of defects tends to increase together with the complexity of organisms. For
that purpose, we set up experiments specially designed to measure infant mortality. In particular,
we two species commonly used as model species in biological laboratories, namely the zebrafish
Danio rerio and the rotifer Brachionus plicatilis. For the second, whose number of cells is about
hundred times smaller than for the first, we find as expected that the screening effect of the infant
phase is of much smaller amplitude. Our analysis also raises a number of challenging questions for
which further investigation is necessary. For instance, why is the infant death rate of beetles
and mollusks falling off exponentially rather than as a power law as observed for most other species?
A possible research agenda is discussed in the conclusion of the paper.
