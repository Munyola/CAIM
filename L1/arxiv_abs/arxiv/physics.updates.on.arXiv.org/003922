We present geometric-phase microscopy allowing a multipurpose quantitative phase imaging in
which the ground-truth phase is restored by quantifying the phase retardance. The method uses broadband
spatially incoherent light that is polarization sensitively controlled through the geometric
(Pancharatnam-Berry) phase. The assessed retardance possibly originates either in dynamic or
geometric phase and measurements are customized for quantitative mapping of isotropic and birefringent
samples or multi-functional geometric-phase elements. The phase restoration is based on the self-interference
of polarization distinguished waves carrying sample information and providing pure reference
phase, while passing through an inherently stable common-path setup. The experimental configuration
allows an instantaneous (single-shot) phase restoration with guaranteed subnanometer precision
and excellent ground-truth accuracy (well below 5 nm). The optical performance is demonstrated
in advanced yet routinely feasible noninvasive biophotonic imaging executed in the automated
manner and predestined for supervised machine learning. The experiments demonstrate measurement
of cell dry mass density, cell classification based on the morphological parameters and visualization
of dynamic dry mass changes. The multipurpose use of the method was demonstrated by restoring variations
in the dynamic phase originating from the electrically induced birefringence of liquid crystals
and by mapping the geometric phase of a space-variant polarization directed lens.
