Wall-bounded flows play an important role in numerous common applications, and have been intensively
studied for over a century. However, the dynamics and structure of the logarithmic and outer regions
remain controversial to this date, and understanding their mechanics is essential for the development
of effective control strategies and for the construction of a complete theory of wall-bounded flows.
Recently, the use of time-resolved direct numerical simulations of turbulent flows at high Reynolds
numbers has proved useful to study the physics of wall-bounded turbulence, but a proper analysis
of the logarithmic and outer layers requires simulations at high Reynolds numbers in large domains,
making the storage of complete time series impractical. In this paper a novel low-storage method
for time-resolved simulations is presented. This approach reduces the cost of storing time-resolved
data by retaining only the required large and intermediate scales, taking care to keep all the variables
needed to fully reconstruct the flow at the level of instantaneous filtered fields and second-order
statistics. This new methodology is efficiently implemented as a new high-resolution hybrid CUDA-MPI
code, which exploits the advantages of GPU co-processors on distributed memory systems, and allows
running for physically meaningful times. The resulting temporally-resolved database of channel
flow at up to $Re_\tau=5300$, in large boxes for long times, is briefly introduced. The code is available
