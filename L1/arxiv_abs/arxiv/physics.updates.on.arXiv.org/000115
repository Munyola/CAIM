A method for estimating return values from ensembles of forecasts at advanced lead times is presented.
Return values of significant wave height in the North-East Atlantic, the Norwegian Sea and the North
Sea are computed from archived +240-h forecasts of the ECMWF ensemble prediction system (EPS) from
1999 to 2009. We make three assumptions: First, each forecast is representative of a six-hour interval
and collectively the data set is then comparable to a time period of 226 years. Second, the model climate
matches the observed distribution, which we confirm by comparing with buoy data. Third, the ensemble
members are sufficiently uncorrelated to be considered independent realizations of the model
climate. We find anomaly correlations of 0.20, but peak events (>P97) are entirely uncorrelated.
By comparing return values from individual members with return values of subsamples of the data
set we also find that the estimates follow the same distribution and appear unaffected by correlations
in the ensemble. The annual mean and variance over the 11-year archived period exhibit no significant
departures from stationarity compared with a recent reforecast, i.e., there is no spurious trend
due to model upgrades. EPS yields significantly higher return values than ERA-40 and ERA-Interim
and is in good agreement with the high-resolution hindcast NORA10, except in the lee of unresolved
islands where EPS overestimates and in enclosed seas where it is biased low. Confidence intervals
are half the width of those found for ERA-Interim due to the magnitude of the data set.
