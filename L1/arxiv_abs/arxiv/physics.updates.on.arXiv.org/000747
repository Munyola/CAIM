Optical manipulation in the vicinity of optical micro- and nanofibres has shown potential across
several fields in recent years, including microparticle control, and cold atom probing and trapping.
To date, most work has focussed on propagation of the fundamental mode through the fibre. However,
along the maximum mode intensity axis, higher order modes have a longer evanescent field extension
and larger field amplitude at the fibre waist compared to the fundamental mode, opening up new possibilities
for optical manipulation and particle trapping. In this work, we demonstrate a microfibre/optical
tweezers compact system for trapping and propelling dielectric particles based on the excitation
of the first group of higher order modes at the fibre waist. Single polystyrene particles were trapped
and propelled in the evanescent fields of higher order and fundamental modes near the surface of
microfibres. Speed enhancement of particle propulsion was observed for the higher order modes
compared to the fundamental mode for particles ranging from 1 {\mu}m to 5 {\mu}m in diameter. The
optical propelling velocity of a single, 3 {\mu}m polystyrene particle was found to be 8 times faster
under the higher order evanescent field than the fundamental mode field for a waist power of 25 mW.
Experimental data and dynamic interactions between the evanescent field of these two different
fibre modes and the particles are supported by theoretical calculations. This work can be extended
to trapping and manipulation of laser-cooled atoms for quantum networks.
