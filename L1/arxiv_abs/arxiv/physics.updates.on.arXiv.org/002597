A stochastic model for intermittent fluctuations in the scrape-off layer of magnetically confined
plasmas has been constructed based on a super-position of uncorrelated pulses arriving according
to a Poisson process. In the most common applications of the model, the pulse amplitudes are assumed
exponentially distributed, supported by conditional averaging of large-amplitude fluctuations
in experimental measurement data. This basic assumption has two potential limitations. First,
statistical analysis of measurement data using conditional averaging only reveals the tail of
the amplitude distribution to be exponentially distributed. Second, exponentially distributed
amplitudes leads to a positive definite signal which cannot capture fluctuations in for example
electric potential and radial velocity. Assuming pulse amplitudes which are not positive definite
often make finding a closed form for the probability density function difficult, even if the characteristic
function remains relatively simple. Thus estimating model parameters requires an approach based
on the characteristic function, not the probability density function. In this contribution, the
effect of changing the amplitude distribution on the moments, probability density function and
characteristic function of the process is investigated and a parameter estimation method using
the empirical distribution function is presented and tested on synthetically generated data.
This proves valuable for describing intermittent fluctuations in the boundary region of magnetized
plasmas.
