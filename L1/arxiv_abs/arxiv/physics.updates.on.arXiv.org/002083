A self-replicator is usually understood to be an object of definite form that promotes the conversion
of materials in its environment into a nearly identical copy of itself. The challenge of engineering
novel, micro- or nano-scale self-replicators has attracted keen interest in recent years, both
because exponential amplification is an attractive method for generating high yields of specific
products, and also because self-reproducing entities have the potential to be optimized or adapted
through rounds of iterative selection. Substantial steps forward have been achieved both in the
engineering of particular self-replicating molecules, and also in characterizing the physical
basis for possible mechanisms of self-replication. At present, however, there is need for a theoretical
treatment of what physical conditions are most conducive to the emergence of novel self-replicating
structures from a reservoir of building blocks on a desired time-scale. Here we report progress
in addressing this need. By analyzing the dynamics of a generic class of heterogeneous particle
mixtures whose reaction rates emerge from basic physical interactions, we demonstrate that the
spontaneous discovery of self-replication is controlled by relatively generic features of the
chemical space, namely: the dispersion in the distribution of reaction timescales and bound-state
energies. Based on this analysis, we provide quantitative criteria that may aid experimentalists
in designing a system capable of producing self-replicators, and in estimating the likely timescale
for exponential growth to start.
