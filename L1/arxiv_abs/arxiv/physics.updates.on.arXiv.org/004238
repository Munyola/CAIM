Ballooning instabilities are widely believed to be a possible triggering mechanism for the onset
of substorm and current disruption initiation in the near-Earth magnetotail. Yet the stability
of the kinetic ballooning mode (KBM) in a global and realistic magnetotail configuration has not
been well examined. In this paper, the growth rate of the KBM is calculated from analytical theory
for the two-dimensional Voigt equilibrium within the framework of kinetic magnetohydrodynamic
(MHD) model. The growth rate of the KBM is found to be strongly dependent on the field line stiffening
factor $S$, which depends on the trapped electron dynamics, the finite ion gyroradius, and the magnetic
drift motion of charged particles. Furthermore, calculations show that the KBM is unstable in a
finite intermediate range of equatorial $\beta_{eq}$ values and the growth rate dependence on
$\beta_{eq}$ is enhanced for larger $\rho_i$. The KBM stability is further analyzed in a broad range
of $k_y$ for different values of ion Larmor radius $\rho_i$ and gradient ratio $\eta_j \equiv d\ln(T_j)/d\ln(n_j)$,
where $T_j$ is the particle temperature and $n_j$ is the particle density. The KBM is found to be unstable
for sufficiently high values of $k_y$, where the growth rate first increases to a maximum value and
then decreases due to kinetic effects. The $k_y$ at the maximum growth rate decreases exponentially
with $\rho_i$. The current sheet thinning is found to enhance the KBM growth rate and the unstable
$\beta_{eq}$ regime in the near-Earth magnetotail.
