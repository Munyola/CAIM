We explore one-point and two-point statistics of the Navier-Stokes-alpha-beta regularization
model at moderate Reynolds number in homogeneous isotropic turbulence. The results are compared
to the limit cases of the Navier-Stokes-alpha model and the Navier-Stokes-alpha-beta model without
subgrid-scale stress, as well as with high resolution direct numerical simulation. After reviewing
spectra of different energy norms of the Navier-Stokes-alpha-beta model, the Navier-Stokes-alpha
model, and Navier-Stokes-alpha-beta model without subrid-scale stress, we present probability
density functions and normalized probability density functions of the filtered and unfiltered
velocity increments along with longitudinal velocity structure functions of the regularization
models and direct numerical simulation results. We highlight differences in the statistical properties
of the unfiltered and filtered velocity fields entering the governing equations of the Navier-Stokes-alpha
and Navier-Stokes-alpha-beta models and discuss the usability of both velocity fields for realistic
flow predictions. The influence of the modified viscous term in the Navier-Stokes-alpha-beta
model is studied through comparison to the case where the underlying subgrid-scale stress tensor
is neglected. The filtered velocity field is found to have physically more viable probability density
functions and structure functions for the approximation of direct numerical simulation results,
whereas the unfiltered velocity field is found to have flatness factors close to direct numerical
simulation results.
