SABRE (Signal Amplification By Reversible Exchange) is a technique for enhancement of NMR (Nuclear
Magnetic Resonance) signals, which utilizes parahydrogen (pH2, the H2 molecule in its nuclear
spin state) as a source of non-thermal spin order. In SABRE experiments, pH2 binds to an organometallic
complex with a to-be-polarized substrate; subsequently, spin order transfer takes place and the
substrate acquires non-thermal spin polarization resulting in strong NMR signal enhancement.
In this work we argue that the spin order of H2 in SABRE experiments performed at high magnetic fields
is not necessarily the singlet order but rather anti-phase polarization, $S_{1z}S_{2z}$. Although
SABRE exploits pH2, i.e., the starting spin order of H2 is supposed to be the singlet order, in solution
S-T0 conversion becomes efficient once pH2 binds to a complex. Such a variation of the spin order,
which becomes $S_{1z}S_{2z}$, has an important consequence: NMR methods used for transferring
SABRE polarization need to be modified. Here we demonstrate that methods proposed for the initial
singlet order may not work for the S_1z S_2z order; however, a simple modification makes them efficient
again. A theoretical treatment of the problem under consideration is proposed; these considerations
are supported by high-field SABRE experiments. Hence, for efficient use of SABRE one should note
that polarization formation is a complex multi-stage process: careful optimization of this process
may not only deal with chemical aspects but also with the spin dynamics, including the spin dynamics
of H2.
