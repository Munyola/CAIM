During the initial phase of microwave (MW) power launch inside a MW discharge ion source (MDIS),
plasma and the electric fields are evolved with time together in the plasma volume. The spatio-temporal
evolution pattern in the cavity of a MDIS is reported here, highlighting the role of these electric
fields on power coupling processes. Evolution of electric field and so power coupling processes
are calculated using Finite Element Method (FEM). Unlike PIC/MCC or hybrid fluid, here FEM model
uses time dependent Poisson solver through drift-diffusion approach. In presence of plasma gradient
in the volume ambipolar electric field is generated which interacts with the MW electric field to
form resultant total electric field which continuously vary during this evolution period. It is
observed that main power coupling mechanism is electron cyclotron resonance (ECR) method, however
with the evolution of plasma, the mode shifts from ECR to off-ECR type heating with time. Off-ECR
heating in the form of upper-hybrid resonance (UHR) method, electro-static (ES) ion acoustic wave
heating method are important heating mechanisms during the over-dense plasma condition, when
density is above critical density for launched MW frequency, 2.45 GHz. An indirect verification
of simulated temporal evolution of hot electron temperature and plasma density with the experiment,
is done under similar configuration and operating environment. The experimental results are found
to be agreed reasonably well with the simulation in the low power range.
