For fused silica irradiated by 100-fs, 795-nm laser pulses with fluence approaching the damage
threshold, the transient transmission spectroscopy based on the wavelength-degenerate pump-probe
technique can clearly present two dynamic processes corresponding to the instantaneous effects
of laser optical field and the delayed effects of excited electron dynamics, respectively. Significantly,
from the point of view of energy, the instantaneous process contributed by third-order nonlinear
optical polarization responses (in particular the optical Kerr effect) is reversible, which comes
from the cycle-averaged effects of virtual optical-field ionization (VOFI) proportional to the
instantaneous fields and corresponding to the virtual population observed in current attosecond
detections; whereas, the delayed process related to the effects of free-electron plasma generated
by actual strong-field ionization including initial real optical-field ionization (ROFI) and
subsequent impact ionization (II) is irreversible, which appears to be responsible for energy
dissipation of laser fields and optical breakdown of fused silica. In short, the femtosecond wavelength-degenerate
pump-probe spectroscopy can provide a direct and simple way for the comprehensive detections of
VOFI, ROFI, and II simultaneously in strong-field ionization of fused silica, and thus give insights
into the dominated ionization mechanism for ultrafast laser-induced damage of fused silica, which
has not been completely covered by the previous femtosecond and attosecond strong-field spectroscopies.
