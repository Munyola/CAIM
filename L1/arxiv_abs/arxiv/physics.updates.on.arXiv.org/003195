Modern global bathymetry maps are created from sparse ship echo-sounding data, while the vast uncharted
regions are reconstructed from satellite altimetry via an indirect technique, known as altimetric
bathymetry, that uses gravity anomaly correlations. Ship surveys are highly time consuming and
expensive; the only way to achieve a globally uniform resolution bathymetry map within reasonable
time and cost is via satellite altimetry. Despite the availability of spatially uniform and dense
altimetry data, its usefulness has remained limited because of various shortcomings of the altimetric
bathymetry technique. Here we propose an alternative approach that successfully reconstructs
ocean bathymetry from the free surface velocity and elevation data obtained via satellite altimetry.
Our reconstruction methodology is based on the principles of open-channel hydraulics, according
to which a sub-critical flow over a seamount creates a free surface dip. Recognizing that this dip
contains the signature of the bottom topography, we have developed a simple inversion technique
that reconstructs the topography accurately. Using this procedure we have reconstructed the Mediterranean
and the Red sea bathymetries of $1/12$ degree resolution with respectively $91$% and $89$% accuracy.
Both resolution and accuracy of the reconstructed bathymetry can be further improved if the free
surface data is captured at a higher resolution. We expect that our reconstruction technique, in
conjunction with ship echo-sounding, will be able to provide a high resolution and accurate global
bathymetry map in near future.
