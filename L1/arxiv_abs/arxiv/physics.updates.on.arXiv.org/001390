We develop a model for the strahl population in the solar wind -- a narrow, low-density and high-energy
electron beam centered on the magnetic field direction. Our model is based on the solution of the
electron drift-kinetic equation at heliospheric distances where the plasma density, temperature,
and the magnetic field strength decline as power-laws of the distance along a magnetic flux tube.
Our solution for the strahl depends on a number of parameters that, in the absence of the analytic
solution for the full electron velocity distribution function (eVDF), cannot be derived from the
theory. We however demonstrate that these parameters can be efficiently found from matching our
solution with observations of the eVDF made by the Wind satellite's SWE strahl detector. The model
is successful at predicting the angular width (FWHM) of the strahl for the Wind data at 1 AU, in particular
by predicting how this width scales with particle energy and background density. We find the strahl
distribution is largely determined by the local temperature Knudsen number $\gamma \sim |T dT/dx|/n$,
which parametrizes solar wind collisionality. We compute averaged strahl distributions for typical
Knudsen numbers observed in the solar wind, and fit our model to these data. The model can be matched
quite closely to the eVDFs at 1 AU, however, it then overestimates the strahl amplitude at larger
heliocentric distances. This indicates that our model may be improved through the inclusion of
additional physics, possibly through the introduction of "anomalous diffusion" of the strahl
electrons.
