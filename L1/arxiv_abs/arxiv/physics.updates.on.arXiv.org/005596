The large-scale focusing inversion of gravity and magnetic potential field data using $L_1$-norm
regularization is considered. The use of the randomized singular value decomposition methodology
facilitates tackling the computational challenge that arises in the solution of these large-scale
inverse problems. As such the powerful randomized singular value decomposition is used for the
numerical solution of all linear systems required in the algorithm. A comprehensive comparison
of the developed methodology for the inversion of magnetic and gravity data is presented. These
results indicate that there is generally an important difference between the gravity and magnetic
inversion problems. Specifically, the randomized singular value decomposition is dependent
on the generation of a rank $q$ approximation to the underlying model matrix, and the results demonstrate
that $q$ needs to be larger, for equivalent problem sizes, for the magnetic problem as compared to
the gravity problem. Without a relatively large $q$ the dominant singular values of the magnetic
model matrix are not well-approximated. The comparison also shows how the use of the power iteration
embedded within the randomized algorithm is used to improve the quality of the resulting dominant
subspace approximation, especially in magnetic inversion, yielding acceptable approximations
for smaller choices of $q$. The price to pay is the trade-off between approximation accuracy and
computational cost. The algorithm is applied for the inversion of magnetic data obtained over a
portion of the Wuskwatim Lake region in Manitoba, Canada
