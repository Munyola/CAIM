The narrow ribbon of enhanced energetic neutral atom flux observed by the Interstellar Boundary
Explorer (IBEX) spacecraft has prompted numerous ideas to explain its structure and properties.
One of these ideas is the "neutral solar wind" scenario, which identifies the source particles as
pickup protons in the local interstellar medium originating in solar wind charge-exchange interactions.
This scenario has been thought to require unrealistically weak pitch-angle scattering of the pickup
protons to explain the narrow structure. Recently, Schwadron & McComas (2013) suggested that
this structure could result from a spatial retention of the pickup protons, rather than from a restricted
pitch-angle distribution. Here, we present a physically motivated, quantitative mechanism to
produce such a spatial configuration. This mechanism is based on the "dominant turbulence" assumption,
which can be applied where the production of new pickup protons is slow, and has been used to successfully
explain the level of turbulent heating observed in the outer solar wind. This formalism predicts
a pickup isotropization process which adds or subtracts energy from the ambient turbulent fluctuations,
depending on the initial pitch angle of the pickup protons. We show that a simple model of this process
can yield a ribbon structure in qualitative agreement with the observations. The results of this
simple model are not yet quantitatively satisfactory, but we suggest several improvements which
may reduce the quantitative discrepancy.
