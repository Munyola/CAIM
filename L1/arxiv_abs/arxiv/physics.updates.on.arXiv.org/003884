Mode-division-multiplexing (MDM) is attractive as a means to increase the link capacity of a single
wavelength for optical interconnects via the use of multiple mode-channels in multimode bus waveguide.In
order to route the data in MDM systems, waveguide bends are typically needed.In particular, ultra-sharp
bends are desirable for reducing the chip area occupied by high-density photonic intergrated circuits
(PICs). In this work, we propose and demonstrate a novel meta-surfaced waveguide structure on silicon,
which enables ultral-sharp multimode waveguide bends to have low loss and low crosstalk among different
mode-channels.An ultra-sharp S-bend with a bending radius of R=10{\mu}m is realized for an MDM
optical interconnect with three mode-channels. The numerical simulation shows that the proposed
ultal-sharp meta-surfaced multimode waveguide bend (MMWB) has low excess losses (0.2~0.5dB)
and low inter-mode crosstalk (<-30dB) over a broad wavelength-band(>100nm) for all the three mode-channels.
This is verified by experimental results, which show that the fabricated S-bends have excess losses
of 0.5~0.8dB and inter-mode crosstalk of <-20 dB over a wavelength of >60 nm. The experimental results
were partially limited by the measurement setup, particularly the on-chip mode (de)multiplexers
which had inter-mode crosstalk of about -20dB. The proposed MMWB can be extended for the transmission
of more than three mode-channels.Our work paves the way to use meta-surfaced silicon photonic waveguide
structures for on-chip multimode optical interconnect.
