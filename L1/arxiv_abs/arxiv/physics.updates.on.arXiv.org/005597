This paper discusses the generalised least-action principle introduced by Brenier (J. Am. Math.
Soc, 1989), from the perspective of turbulence modelling. In essence, Brenier's least-action
principle extends to a probabilistic setting Arnold's geometric interpretation of ideal fluid
mechanics, whereby strong solutions to the Euler equations are deduced from minimising an action
over Lagrangian maps. While Arnold's framework relies on the deterministic concept of Lagrangian
flow, Brenier's least-action principle describes solutions to the Euler equations in terms of
non-deterministic "generalised flows", namely probability measures over sets of Lagrangian
trajectories. Generalised flows seem naturally fit to describe turbulent Lagrangian trajectories
in terms of stochastic processes, an approach that originates from Richardson's seminal work on
turbulent dispersion. In particular, they seem suited to address cases when the concept of Lagrangian
flow breaks down, due to Lagrangian trajectories becoming spontaneously stochastic. The purpose
of the present paper is therefore to give a physical perspective on Brenier's principle, and provide
a qualitative description of the hydrodynamical features of generalised flows. Using Monte-Carlo
techniques, we analyse the statistical features of three classes of two-dimensional generalised
flows, ranging from solid rotation and cellular flows to to freely decaying two-dimensional turbulence.
Our results suggest that generalised variational formulations, if carefully used, may provide
new tools to coarse-grain multi-scale hydrodynamics.
