Image symmetrization is an effective strategy to correct symmetry distortion in experimental
data for which symmetry is essential in the subsequent analysis. In the process, a coordinate transform,
the symmetrization transform, is required to undo the distortion. The transform may be determined
by image registration (i.e. alignment) with symmetry constraints imposed in the registration
target and in the iterative parameter tuning, which we call symmetry-guided registration. An example
use case of image symmetrization is found in electronic band structure mapping by multidimensional
photoemission spectroscopy, which employs a 3D time-of-flight detector to measure electrons
sorted into the momentum ($k_x$, $k_y$) and energy ($E$) coordinates. In reality, imperfect instrument
design, sample geometry and experimental settings cause distortion of the photoelectron trajectories
and, therefore, the symmetry in the measured band structure, which hinders the full understanding
and use of the volumetric datasets. We demonstrate that symmetry-guided registration can correct
the symmetry distortion in the momentum-resolved photoemission patterns. Using proposed symmetry
metrics, we show quantitatively that the iterative approach to symmetrization outperforms its
non-iterative counterpart in the restored symmetry of the outcome while preserving the average
shape of the photoemission pattern. Our approach is generalizable to distortion corrections in
different types of symmetries and should also find applications in other experimental methods
that produce images with similar features.
