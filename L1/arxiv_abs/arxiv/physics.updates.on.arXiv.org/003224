Pumping fluids without an aid of an external power source are desirable in a number of applications
ranging from a cooling of microelectronic circuits to Micro Total Analysis Systems (micro-TAS).
Although, several microfluidic pumps exist, yet passive micropumps demonstrate better energy
efficiency while providing a better control over a pumping rate and its operation. The fluid pumping
rate and their easy maneuverability are critical in some applications; therefore, in the current
work, we have developed a leaf-mimicking micropump that demonstrated ~6 fold increase in a volumetric
pumping rate as compared to the micropumps having a single capillary fluid delivery system. We have
discussed a simple, scalable, yet inexpensive method to design and fabricate these leaf mimicking
micopump. The microstructure of the micropumps were characterised through scanning electron
microscopy and its pumping performance (volumetric pumping rate and pressure head sustainence)
were assessed experimentally. The working principle of the proposed micropump is attributed to
its structural elements; where branched-shaped microchannels deliver the fluid acting like veins
of leaves while the connected microporous support resembles mesophyll cells matrix that instantaneously
transfers the delivered fluid by a capillary action to multiple pores mimicking the stomata for
evaporation. Such design of micropumps will enable an efficient delivery of the desired volume
of a fluid to any 2D/3D micro/nanofluidic devices used in an engineering and biological applications.
