The conflict between pro-self and pro-social behaviour is at the core of many key problems of our
time, as, for example, the reduction of air pollution and the redistribution of scarce resources.
For the well-being of our societies, it is thus crucial to find mechanisms to promote pro-social
choices over egoistic ones. Particularly important, because cheap and easy to implement, are those
mechanisms that can change people's behaviour without forbidding any options or significantly
changing their economic incentives, the so-called 'nudges'. Previous research has found that
moral nudges (e.g., making social norms salient) can promote pro-social behaviour. However, little
is known about whether their effect persists over time and spills across context. This question
is key in light of research showing that prosocial actions are often followed by selfish actions,
thus suggesting that some moral manipulations may backfire. Here we present a class of simple moral
nudges that have a great positive impact on pro-sociality. In Studies 1-4 (total N = 1,400), we use
economic games to demonstrate that asking subjects to self-report 'what they think is the morally
right thing to do' does not only increase pro-sociality in the choice immediately after, but also
in subsequent choices, and even when the social context changes. In Study 5, we explore whether moral
nudges promote charity donations to humanitarian organisations in a large (N=1,800) crowdfunding
campaign. We find that, in this context, moral nudges increase donations by about 44 percent.
