The central approximation made in classical molecular dynamics simulation of materials is the
interatomic potential used to calculate the forces on the atoms. Great effort and ingenuity is required
to construct viable functional forms and find accurate parameterizations for potentials using
traditional approaches. Machine-learning has emerged as an effective alternative approach to
developing accurate and robust interatomic potentials. Starting with a very general model form,
the potential is learned directly from a database of electronic structure calculations and therefore
can be viewed as a multiscale link between quantum and classical atomistic simulations. Risk of
inaccurate extrapolation exists outside the narrow range of time- and length-scales where the
two methods can be directly compared. In this work, we use the Spectral Neighbor Analysis Potential
(SNAP) and show how a fit can be produced with minimal interpolation errors which is also robust in
extrapolating beyond training. To demonstrate the method, we have developed a new tungsten-beryllium
potential suitable for the full range of binary compositions. Subsequently, large-scale molecular
dynamics simulations were performed of high energy Be atom implantation onto the (001) surface
of solid tungsten. The new machine learned W-Be potential generates a population of implantation
structures consistent with quantum calculations of defect formation energies. A very shallow
(< 2nm) average Be implantation depth is predicted which may explain ITER diverter degradation
in the presence of beryllium.
