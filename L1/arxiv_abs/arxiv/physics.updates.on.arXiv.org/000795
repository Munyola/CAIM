Certain sequences of peptoid polymers (synthetic analogs of peptides) assemble into bilayer nanosheets
via a nonequilibrium assembly pathway of adsorption, compression, and collapse at an air-water
interface. As with other large-scale dynamic processes in biology and materials science, understanding
the details of this supramolecular assembly process requires a modeling approach that captures
behavior on a wide range of length and time scales, from those on which individual sidechains fluctuate
to those on which assemblies of polymers evolve. Here we demonstrate that a new coarse-grained modeling
approach is accurate and computationally efficient enough to do so. Our approach uses only a minimal
number of coarse-grained sites, but retains independently fluctuating orientational degrees
of freedom for each site. These orientational degrees of freedom allow us to accurately parameterize
both bonded and nonbonded interactions, and to generate all-atom configurations with sufficient
accuracy to perform atomic scattering calculations and to interface with all-atom simulations.
We have used this approach to reproduce all available experimental X-ray scattering spectra (for
stacked nanosheets, and for peptoids adsorbed at air-water interfaces and in solution), in order
to resolve the microscopic, real-space structures responsible for these Fourier-space features.
By interfacing with all-atom simulations, we have also laid the foundations for future multiscale
simulations of sequence-specific polymers that communicate in both directions across scales.
