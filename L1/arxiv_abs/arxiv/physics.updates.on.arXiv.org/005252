We study deep water ocean wind-driven waves in strait, with wind directed orthogonally to the shore,
through exact Hasselmann equation. Despite of "dissipative" shores - we do not include any reflection
from the coast lines - we show that the wave turbulence evolution can be split in time into two different
regimes. During the first wave propagate along the wind, and the wind-driven sea can be described
by the self-similar solution of the Hasselmann equation like in the open sea. The second regime starts
later in time, after significant enough wave energy accumulation at the down-wind boundary. Since
this moment the ensemble of waves propagating against the wind starts its formation. Also, the waves,
propagation along the strait start to appear. The wave system eventually reaches asymptotic stationary
state in time, consisting of two co-existing states: the first, self-similar wave ensemble, propagating
with the wind, and the second, quasi-monochromatic waves, propagating almost orthogonal to the
wind direction and tending to slant against the wind at the angle of 15 degrees closer to the wave turbulence
origination shore line. These "secondary waves" appear only due to intensive nonlinear wave interaction.
The total wave energy exceeds its "expected value" approximately by the factor of two, with respect
to estimated in the absence of the shores. It is expected that in the reflective shores presence this
amplification will grow essentially. We propose to call this laser-like Nonlinear Ocean Waves
Amplification mechanism by the acronym NOWA.
