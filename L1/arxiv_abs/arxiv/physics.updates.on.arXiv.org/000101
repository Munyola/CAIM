We report on conditional statistics of turbulent entrainment in a temporal plane jet at Re=5000
along enstrophy isosurfaces. The data is obtained by direct numerical simulation and the statistics
span 24 orders of magnitude in the enstrophy threshold, ranging from essentially irrotational
fluid outside the jet to the turbulent core region at the jet centre. We use two independent estimators
for the local entrainment velocity v_n based on the enstrophy budget and develop a theoretical model
that describes the expected behaviour inside the viscous superlayer. The model is in reasonably
good agreement with the data and predicts that viscous transport has magnitude 2v_n and viscous
dissipation -v_n. Although v_n is similar in magnitude to the Kolmogorov velocity u_\eta, its value
is not independent of the threshold. Contrarily, the product between v_n and surface area S of the
viscous superlayer, the entrainment flux, is independent of threshold implying that the local
transport velocity and surface area adjust concertedly to the imposed global rate at the fringes
of the turbulent layer. We divide the flow into a (i) viscous superlayer in which the transmission
of enstrophy is dominated by viscous effects; (ii) a turbulent core region which is dominated by
inertial production, viscous transport and dissipation; and (iii) an intermediate region that
connects the two. The average distance between the core region and the viscous superlayer is about
10 Kolmogorov length scales, indicating that intense turbulent flow regions and viscosity-dominated
regions are in close proximity.
