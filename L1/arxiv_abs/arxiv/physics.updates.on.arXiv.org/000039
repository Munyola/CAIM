The Tunguska explosion occurred in the morning of June 30, 1908, in Central Siberia, some 800 km NNW
from Lake Baikal. It devastated the forested area of 2150 sq. km, flattening and scorching some 30
million trees. Before this, a luminous body flew overhead in the cloudless sky. The air waves from
the explosion were recorded as far as in London. The object that flew that morning over Siberia is
usually designated the "Tunguska meteorite" or - more cautiously - the "Tunguska space body" (TSB).
Certainly, this body was dangerous: the taiga was leveled over an area twice as large as New York City.
The whole number of Tunguska hypotheses reaches a hundred, or so. But few of them have been built according
to the standards of science and with due consideration of empirical data. There is also a serious
methodological problem that is, as a rule, overlooked: the need to take into consideration all empirical
data and to reconstruct the Tunguska event before building any models of it. Such a reconstruction
is essential - since the consequences of this event are many and varied. The main Tunguska traces
may be grouped and listed as follows: (a) material traces; (b) instrumental traces; (c) informational
traces. To be sure that a proposed theory is correct, the scientist must check it against all the three
types of Tunguska evidence. Having reconstructed the Tunguska event with due attention to all the
evidence, we have to conclude that it could not have been an asteroid or a comet core. There seems to
exist in space another type of dangerous space objects, whose nature still remains unknown.
