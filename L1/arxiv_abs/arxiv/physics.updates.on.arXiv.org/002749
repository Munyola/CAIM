Nobel Laureate von experimentally discovered travelling wave vibration of the basilar membrane
(BM) in the cochlear, which first reveals the motion law of the crucial structure of human phonoreception
mechanism. However, with the further development of research, many scientists have discovered
that the travelling wave vibration unable to explain many experimental observations and the low-frequency
hearing of the cochlear. Because the cochlear is very small and complex, vibration data of the whole
BM are not yet available from existing experiments, and low-frequency vibration data are absent
from von and other experiments. To address this question, this work technically adopts the transformation
tensor mapping relation to establish a theoretical analytical model of the Spiral cochlear based
on the theory of physics and biology, combined with medical and modern light source imaging experimental
data. In addition, a numerical model of a real human ear is also established. By performing numerous
calculations, the results reproduce the known travelling wave vibration of BM. Meanwhile, an exciting
finding that revealing a new standing wave vibration mode at low frequencies is obtained. More importantly,
this newly discovered model intrinsically explain many experimental observations that cannot
be explained by travelling wave theory, which solves a long standing various queries to travelling
wave vibration among researchers. These results not only complement low-frequency vibration
data that are inaccessible through experiments but also reveal a new hearing mechanism.
