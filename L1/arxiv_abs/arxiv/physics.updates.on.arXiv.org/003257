The desire for higher sensitivity has driven ground-based cosmic microwave background (CMB) experiments
to employ ever larger focal planes, which in turn require larger reimaging optics. Practical limits
to the maximum size of these optics motivates the development of quasi-optically-coupled (lenslet-coupled),
multi-chroic detectors. These detectors can be sensitive across a broader bandwidth compared
to waveguide-coupled detectors. However, the increase in bandwidth comes at a cost: the lenses
(up to $\sim$700 mm diameter) and lenslets ($\sim$5 mm diameter, hemispherical lenses on the focal
plane) used in these systems are made from high-refractive-index materials (such as silicon or
amorphous aluminum oxide) that reflect nearly a third of the incident radiation. In order to maximize
the faint CMB signal that reaches the detectors, the lenses and lenslets must be coated with an anti-reflective
(AR) material. The AR coating must maximize radiation transmission in scientifically interesting
bands and be cryogenically stable. Such a coating was developed for the third generation camera,
SPT-3G, of the South Pole Telescope (SPT) experiment, but the materials and techniques used in the
development are general to AR coatings for mm-wave optics. The three-layer polytetrafluoroethylene-based
AR coating is broadband, inexpensive, and can be manufactured with simple tools. The coating is
field tested; AR coated focal plane elements were deployed in the 2016-2017 austral summer and AR
coated reimaging optics were deployed in 2017-2018.
