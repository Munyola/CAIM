The multi-component quantum theory of atoms in molecules (MC-QTAIM) analysis is done on methane,
ethylene, acetylene and benzene as selected basic hydrocarbons. This is the first report on applying
the MC-QTAIM analysis on polyatomic species. In order to perform the MC-QTAIM analysis, at first
step the nuclear-electronic orbital method at Hartree-Fock level (NEO-HF) is used as a non-Born-Oppenheimer
(nBO) ab initio computational procedure assuming both electrons and protons as quantum waves while
carbon nuclei as point charges in these systems. The ab initio calculations proceed substituting
all the protons of each species first with deuterons and then tritons. At the next step, the derived
nBO wavefunctions are used for the "atoms in molecules" (AIM) analysis. The results of topological
analysis and integration of atomic properties demonstrate that the MC-QTAIM is capable of deciphering
the underlying AIM structure of all the considered species. Also, the results of the analysis for
each isotopic composition are distinct and the fingerprint of the mass difference of hydrogen isotopes
is clearly seen in both topological and AIM analyses. This isotopic distinction is quite unique
in the MC-QTAIM and not recovered by the orthodox QTAIM that treats nuclei as clamped particles.
The results of the analysis also demonstrate that each quantum nucleus that forms an atomic basin
resides within its own basin. The confinement of quantum nuclei within a single basin is used to simplify
the basic equations of the MC-QTAIM paving the way for future theoretical studies.
