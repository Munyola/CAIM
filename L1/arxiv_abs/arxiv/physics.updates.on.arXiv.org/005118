X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) depth profiling using monoatomic Ar+ ion etching sources
is a common technique that allows for the probing of the vertical compositional profiles of a wide
range of materials. In polymer-based organic photovoltaic devices, it is commonly used to study
compositional variations across the interfaces of the organic active layer with charge extraction
layers or electrodes, as well as the vertical phase separation within the bulk-heterojunction
active layer. It is generally considered that the damage induced by the etching of organic layers
is limited to the very top surface, such that the XPS signal (acquired from the top ~10 nm of the layer)
remains largely unaffected, allowing for a reliable measurement of the sample composition throughout
the depth profile. Herein, we investigate a range of conjugated polymers and quantify the depth
of the damage induced by monoatomic etching for Ar+ ion energies ranging from 0.5 keV to 4 keV using
argon gas cluster ion beam depth profiling. The results demonstrate that even when etching with
the lowest available monoatomic ion energy for as little as 3 s, the damaged polymer material extends
deeper into the bulk than the XPS probing depth. We show that the damaged material distorts the compositional
information obtained by XPS, resulting in erroneous depth profiles. Furthermore, we propose that
only gas cluster ion beam etching sources should be used for depth profiling of organic conjugated
polymers, as those induce significantly less damage and maintain the compositional information
throughout the entire profile.
