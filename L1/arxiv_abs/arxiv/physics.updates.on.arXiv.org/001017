Optical response of silicon (SiV) and nitrogen (NV) vacancy diamond color centers coupled to silver
and gold nanorod dimers was numerically inspected. Optimization of the coupled emitter - nanorod
dimer configurations was performed to attain the highest possible fluorescence enhancement by
enhancing the excitation and emission of color centers simultaneously through plasmonic antenna
resonances. To minimize losses conditional optimization was realized by setting a criterion regarding
the minimum quantum efficiency of the coupled system (cQE). Restricted symmetric and allowed asymmetric
antenna designs were also inspected to prove the potential advantages of asymmetric configurations
tuneability. Among all inspected systems the highest 2.59*10^8 fluorescence enhancement with
46.08% cQE was achieved in case of NV color center coupled to asymmetric silver nanoantenna dimer.
This is 3.17-times larger than the enhancement in corresponding symmetric configuration, which
has larger 68.52% cQE. In case of SiV color center the highest 1.04*10^8 fluorescence enhancement
with 37.83% cQE was achieved via asymmetric silver nanoantenna dimer. This is 1.06-times larger
than the enhancement in the corresponding symmetric configuration, which has larger 57.46% cQE.
The highest fluorescence enhancement achieved by gold nanorods is 4.75*10^4 with 21.8% cQE, which
was shown in case of SiV color center coupled to asymmetric dimer. The attained enhancement is 8.48-
(92.42-) times larger than the fluorescence enhancement achievable via symmetric (asymmetric)
gold nanorod dimer coupled to SiV (NV) color center.
