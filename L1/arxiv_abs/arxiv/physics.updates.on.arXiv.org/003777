A sensitive high resolution spectrometer for trace gas detection of species whose transitions
have severe spectral overlap with abundant concomitant species by sub-Doppler (sD) noise-immune
cavity-enhanced optical heterodyne molecular spectrometry (NICE-OHMS) is presented. The setup
is based on a NICE-OHMS instrumentation utilizing balanced detection that provides shot-noise
limited Doppler-broadened (Db) detection. An additional layer of modulation is added to reduce
the influence of narrow etalons and improve the sensitivity for sD detection. By dithering synchronously
the positions of the two cavity mirrors, the effect of residual etalons between one of the cavity
mirrors and another surface in the system could be reduced without affecting the frequencies of
the cavity mode. This reduced the drifts in the system, allowing for an Allan deviation of the absorption
coefficient of $2.2 \times 10^{-13}$ $\text{cm}^{-1}$ for an integration time of 60 s, which, for
the targeted $\text{C}_{2}\text{H}_{2}$ transition at 6518.4858 $\text{cm}^{-1}$, corresponds
to a $3\sigma$ detection sensitivity of 130 ppt. Sub-Doppler trace gas detection is demonstrated
by measuring ppb levels of $\text{C}_{2}\text{H}_{2}$ in the exhaled breath of smokers. A procedure
was worked out for simultaneous detection of $\text{CO}_{2}$, based on the Db response. It is shown
that despite significant spectral interference from $\text{CO}_{2}$, which precludes Db detection
of $\text{C}_{2}\text{H}_{2}$ in breath, acetylene could be detected in breath from smokers with
good spectral resolution by the use of sD NICE-OHMS.
