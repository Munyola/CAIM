We extend the impulse theory for unsteady aerodynamics, from its classic global form to finite-domain
formulation then to minimum-domain form, and from incompressible to compressible flows. For incompressible
flow, the minimum-domain impulse theory raises the finding of Li and Lu (J. Fluid Mech., 712: 598-613,
2012) to a theorem: The entire force with discrete wake is completely determined by only the time
rate of impulse of those vortical structures still connecting to the body, along with the Lamb-vector
integral thereof that captures the contribution of all the rest disconnected vortical structures.
For compressible flow, we find that the global form in terms of the curl of momentum, obtained by Huang
(Unsteady Vortical Aerodynamics. Shanghai Jiaotong Univ. Press, 1994), can be generalized to
having arbitrary finite domain, but the formula is cumbersome and in general the curl of momentum
no longer has discrete structure and hence no minimum-domain theory exists. Nevertheless, as the
measure of transverse process only, the unsteady field of vorticity may still have discrete wake.
This leads to a minimum-domain compressible vorticity-moment theory in terms of density-weighted
vorticity (but it is beyond the classic concept of impulse). These new findings and applications
have been confirmed by our numerical experiments. The results not only open an avenue to combine
the theory with computation-experiment in wide applications, but also reveals a physical truth
that it is no longer necessary to account for all wake vortical structures in computing the force
and moment.
