The dressing of bare massless quarks is described with a spatial theory based on the self-consistent
solution of the QCD field equations. After quantization these equations are expressed in terms
of quark and gluon creation and annihilation operators and admit a surprisingly elegant exact (operator)
solution which eliminates any multi-quark admixtures in the state vector. Hence, this theory is
uniquely and exclusively suited to describe the dressing of single bare quarks. After factorizing
out the operators, a finite set of coupled non-linear differential equations results for the reduced
c-number quark and gluon fields. These yield three distinct solitonlike solutions, corresponding
to the three observed quark generations. Physically each solution represents a quark absolutely
confined by the gluon potentials it generates. The radii of the three generations are given by (2.0428...,
1 , 1)/E, while the binding energies are linked to the SU(3) structure constants and given by E - (32/9,
16/9, 1)E, where E sets the energy scale of the system. To stabilize the system general relativity
is required, putting E in the Planck domain. After the introduction of a vacuum term characterized
by the cosmological constant the dressed quark mass can be expressed in terms of the gravitational
and cosmological constant, nevertheless lying in the MeV range. After the inclusion of the other
gauge interactions this theory might well serve as a theoretical laboratory for quantitative tests
of the unification of general relativity and QFT in a constrained Planck scale environment.
