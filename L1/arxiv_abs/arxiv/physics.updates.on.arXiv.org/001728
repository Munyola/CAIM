The approximate nature of radiative transfer equation (RTE) leads to a bunch of considerations
on the effect of "dependent scattering" in random media, especially particulate media composed
of discrete scatterers, in the last a few decades, which usually indicates those deviations RTE
(combined with ISA) lead to from experimental and exact numerical results due to electromagnetic
wave interference. Here we theoretically and numerically demonstrate the effect of dependent
scattering on absorption in disordered media consisting of highly scattering scatterers. By making
comparison between the independent scattering approximation-radiative transfer equation (ISA-RTE)
and the full-wave coupled dipole method (CDM), we find that deviations between the two methods increase
as scatterer density in the media increases. The discrepancy also grows with optical thickness.
To quantitatively take dependent scattering effect into account, we develop a theoretical model
using quasi-crystalline approximation (QCA) to derive dependent-scattering corrected radiative
properties, based on the path-integral diagrammatic technique in multiple scattering theory.
The model results in a more reasonable agreement with numerical simulations. The present work has
profound implications for the coherent scattering physics in random media with absorption, correctly
modeling light absorptance in random media and interpreting the experimental observations in
various applications for random media such as solar energy concentration, micro/nanofluids,
structural color generation, etc.
