Recently it was shown that the centrifugal instability may be important in the dynamics of astrophysical
jets undergoing reconfinement by external pressure. However, these studies were limited to the
case of unmagnetised flows. Here we explore the role of the magnetic field within both the Newtonian
and relativistic frameworks. Since the jet problem is rather complicated, we focus instead on the
simpler problem of cylindrical rotation and axial magnetic field, which shares significant similarity
with the jet problem, and consider only axisymmetric perturbations. The studied equilibrium configurations
involve a cylindrical interface and they are stable to non-magnetic centrifugal and magneto-rotational
instabilities everywhere except this interface. We use a heuristic approach to derive the local
stability criterion for the interface in the magnetic case and numerical simulations to verify
the role of the magnetic field. The theory and simulations agree quite well for Newtonian models
but indicate a potential discrepancy for the relativistic models in the limit of high Lorentz factor
of the rotational motion at the interface. In general, the magnetic field sets a critical wavelength
below which the centrifugal modes are stabilised. We discuss the implication of our findings for
the astrophysical jets, which suggest that the centrifugal instability develops only in jets with
relatively low magnetisation. Namely, the magnetic pressure has to be below the thermal one and
for the relativistic case the jets have to be kinetic-energy dominated.
