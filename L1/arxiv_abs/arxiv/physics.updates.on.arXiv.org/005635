Solar ionizing factors are responsible for modulation of interstellar neutral gas and its derivative
populations inside the heliosphere. We provide an overview of the current state of knowledge about
them for heliospheric particles inside the termination shock. We discuss charge exchange with
solar wind particles, photoionization, and electron impact ionization for hydrogen, oxygen,
neon, and helium from 1985 to 2018 both in the ecliptic plane and in the polar regions. We discuss ionization
rates as a function of time, distance to the Sun, and latitude. We compare the total ionization rates
among the species within a consistent and homogeneous system of calculation of the ionization rates.
The highest total ionization rates at 1 au in the ecliptic plane are for hydrogen and oxygen, and the
lowest are for helium. In the polar regions, the strongest ionization losses are for oxygen, regardless
of the solar activity. Photoionization is the dominant ionization reaction for helium and neon,
and a reaction of high significance for oxygen. Charge exchange with solar wind particles is the
dominant ionization reaction for hydrogen and the second important ionization reaction for oxygen.
Electron impact ionization is an important ionization reaction for Ne and He, with the contribution
to the total ionization rates stronger within 1 au and smaller outside. The total ionization rates
for He and Ne vary in time with the solar activity, whereas the total ionization rates for H and O follow
the cyclic solar wind variations out of the ecliptic plane and aperiodic variations in the ecliptic
plane.
