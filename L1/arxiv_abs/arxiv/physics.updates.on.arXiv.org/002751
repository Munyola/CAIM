We review techniques for simulating fully quantum nonadiabatic dynamics using the frozen-width
moving Gaussian basis functions to represent the nuclear wavefunction. A choice of these basis
functions is primarily motivated by the idea of the on-the-fly dynamics that will involve electronic
structure calculations done locally in the vicinity of each Gaussian center and thus avoiding the
"curse of dimensionality" appearing in large systems. For quantum dynamics involving multiple
electronic states there are several aspects that need to be addressed. First, the choice of the electronic
state representation is one of most defining in terms of formulation of resulting equations of motion.
We will discuss pros and cons of the standard adiabatic and diabatic representations as well as the
relatively new moving crude adiabatic representation. Second, if the number of electronic states
can be fixed throughout the dynamics, the situation is different for the number of Gaussians needed
for an accurate expansion of the total wavefunction. The latter increases its complexity along
the course of the dynamics and a protocol extending the number of Gaussians is needed. We will consider
two common approaches for the extension: 1) spawning and 2) cloning. Third, equations of motion
for individual Gaussians can be chosen in different ways, implications for the energy conservation
related to these ways will be discussed. Finally, to extend the success of moving basis approaches
to quantum dynamics of open systems we will consider the Non-stochastic Open System Schr\"odinger
Equation (NOSSE).
