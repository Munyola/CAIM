The recent advent of advanced microfabrication capabilities of microfluidic devices has driven
attention towards the behavior of particles in inertial flows within microchannels for applications
related to the separation and concentration of bio-particles. The phenomena of inertial focusing
has been demonstrated to be a robust technique in such applications, where the flow of particles
in a curvilinear geometry has proven to be particularly advantageous, not only because the geometry
can reduce the foot-print of a lab-on-chip device, but also because the coupling of secondary Dean
flows to inertial forces allows for exquisite particle manipulations. However, the ability to
design a curvilinear channel for a specific application is often based on empirical results, as
theoretical models to date typically do not include the effects of a finite sized particle within
the flow. Here we present a complete numerical model that directly simulates a particle within a
confide curvilinear flow and using this model we investigate the three dimensional focusing behavior
of inertial particles as well as the applicability of the point particle assumptions previous researchers
have proposed. Finally, we propose a new model that takes into account the full physics, but relies
on a perturbation expansion of the lateral forces, where the perturbation parameter is the curvature
ratio of the channel. This simple model can be used to predict the behavior of particles in complex
channel geometries where the curvature may not be constant.
