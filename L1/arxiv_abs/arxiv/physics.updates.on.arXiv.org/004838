Hydrogen is considered a promising environmentally friendly energy carrier for replacing traditional
fossil fuels. In this context, photoelectrochemical (PEC) cells effectively convert solar energy
directly to H2 fuel by water photoelectrolysis, thereby monolitically combining the functions
of both light harvesting and electrolysis. In such devices, photocathodes and photoanodes carry
out hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), respectively. Here,
we focus on photocathodes for HER, traditionally based on metal oxides, III-V group and II-VI group
semiconductors, Si and copper-based chalcogenides as photoactive material. Recently, carbon-based
materials have emerged as reliable alternatives to the aforementioned materials. Here, we provide
a perspective on carbon-based photocathodes, critically analysing recent research progresses
and outlining the major guidelines for the development of efficient and stable photocathode architectures.
In particular, we discuss the functional role of charge-selective and protective layers, which
enhance both the efficiency and the durability of the photocathodes. We afford an in-depth evaluation
of the state-of-the-art fabrication of photocathodes through scalable, high-troughput, cost-effective
methods. The most critical issues regarding the recently developed light-trapping nanostructured
architectures are also addressed. Finally, we analyse the key challenges on future research directions
in terms of the potential performance and manufacturability of photocathodes.
