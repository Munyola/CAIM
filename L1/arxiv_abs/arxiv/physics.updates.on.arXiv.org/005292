Many sophisticated computer models have been developed to understand the behaviour of particle
accelerators. Even these complex models often do not describe the measured data. Interactions
of the beam with external fields, other particles in the same beam and the beam walls all present modelling
challenges. These can be challenging to model correctly even with modern supercomputers. This
paper describes OPAL (Object Oriented Parallel Accelerator Library), a parallel open source tool
for charged-particle optics in linear accelerators and rings, including 3D space charge. OPAL
is built from the ground up as a parallel application exemplifying the fact that high performance
computing is the third leg of science, complementing theory and experiment. Using the MAD language
with extensions, OPAL can run on a laptop as well as on the largest high performance computing systems.
The OPAL framework makes it easy to add new features in the form of new C++ classes, enabling the modelling
of many physics processes and field types. OPAL comes in two flavours: OPAL-cycl: tracks particles
with 3D space charge including neighbouring turns in cyclotrons and FFAs with time as the independent
variable. OPAL-t: models beam lines, linacs, rf-photo injectors and complete XFELs excluding
the undulator. The code is managed through the git distributed version control system. A suite of
unit tests have been developed for various parts of OPAL, validating each part of the code independently.
System tests validate the overall integration of different elements.
