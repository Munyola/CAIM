The absorption-ablation-excitation mechanism in laser-cluster interactions is investigated
by measuring Rayleigh scattering of aerosol clusters along with atomic emission from phase-selective
laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (PS-LIBS). As the excitation laser intensity is increased
beyond 0.16GW/cm2, the scattering cross-section of TiO_2 clusters begins to decrease, concurrent
with the onset of atomic emission of Ti, indicating a scattering-to-ablation transition and the
formation of nanoplasmas. To better clarify the process, time-resolved measurements of scattering
signals are examined for different excitation laser intensities. For increasing laser intensities,
the cross-sections of clusters decrease during a single pulse, evincing the shorter ablation delay
time and larger ratios of ablation clusters. Assessment of the electron energy distribution during
the ablation process is conducted by non-dimensionalizing the Fokker-Planck equation, with analogous
Strouhal Sl_E, Peclet Pe_E, and Damkohler Da_E numbers defined to characterize the laser-induced
aerothermochemical environment. For conditions of Sl_E>>1, Pe_E>>1, and Da_E<<1,
the electrons are excited to the conduction band by two-photon absorption, then relax to bottom
of the conduction band by collisional electron energy loss to the lattice, and finally serve as the
energy transfer media between laser field and lattice. The relation between delay time and excitation
intensity is well predicted by this simplified model with quasi-steady assumption.
