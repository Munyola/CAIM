The isotropic Maxwell-Boltzmann (M-B) velocity distribution is the accepted standard for a gas
at thermal equilibrium, with the Doppler width considered to deliver a very precise measurement
of the temperature. Nevertheless, the physical nature of the surface, and the atom-surface interaction,
in its long-range (van der Waals type) regime as well as in its short-range regime leading to adsorption/desorption
mechanisms, are far from the ideal situation describing the foundation of gas kinetics. Through
the development of vapor spectroscopy at an interface, a high sensitivity to atoms flying nearly
parallel to the gas interface is obtained, and deviations to M-B distribution could have observable
effects, even affecting the ultimate limits to resolution. We report here on the development of
an experiment involving a dedicated set-up of spatially-separated pump-probe experiment in a
narrow cell. A first series of investigation could not evidence a deviation for Cs atom velocities
at a nearly grazing incidence (typically 1.5 -5{\deg}). We discuss various technical improvements
to increase the sensitivity to atoms flying parallel to the surface, along with specific spectroscopic
information that may be collected. Alternately, the comparison of standard selective reflection
spectroscopy with simultaneous volume spectroscopy may be a source of complementary information.
At last, we discuss how the Boltzmann energy distribution, among molecular or atomic levels, may
become sensitive to specific thermal exchanges at the surface, in an equilibrium situation.
