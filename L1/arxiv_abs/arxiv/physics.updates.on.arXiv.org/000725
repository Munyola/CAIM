Amplification of signal intensity is essential for initiating physical processes, diagnostics,
sensing, communications, and scientific measurement. During traditional amplification, the
signal is amplified by multiplying the signal carriers through an active gain process using an external
power source. However, for repetitive waveforms, sufficient energy for amplification often resides
in the signal itself. In such cases, the unneeded external power is wasted, and the signal is additionally
degraded by noise and distortions that accompany active gain processes. We show noiseless, intensity
amplification of repetitive optical pulse waveforms with a gain from 2 to ~20 without using active
gain, by recycling energy already stored in the input repetitive signal. This "green" method uses
dispersion-induced self-imaging (Talbot) effects to precisely re-distribute the original signal
energy into fewer replica waveforms. This approach simply requires a suitable manipulation of
the input signal's phase profile along the temporal and spectral domains. In addition, we show experimentally
how our passive amplifier performs a real-time average of the wave train to reduce noise fluctuation
present on the input pulse train, as well as enhances the extinction ratio of pulses to stand above
the noise floor by approximately the passive gain factor. Finally, our technique is applicable
to repetitive waveforms in any spectral region or wave system, including acoustic, mechanical,
and quantum probability waveforms, for which active amplification methods are challenging to
implement or nonexistent.
