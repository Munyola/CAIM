Electro-optic modulators transform electronic signals into the optical domain and are critical
components in modern telecommunication networks, RF photonics, and emerging applications in
quantum photonics and beam steering. All these applications require integrated and voltage-efficient
modulator solutions with compact formfactors that are seamlessly integratable with Silicon photonics
platforms and feature near-CMOS material processing synergies. However, existing integrated
modulators are challenged to meet these requirements. Conversely, emerging electro-optic materials
heterogeneously integrated with Si photonics open a new avenue for device engineering. Indium
tin oxide (ITO) is one such compelling material for heterogeneous integration in Si exhibiting
formidable electro-optic effect characterized by unity order index at telecommunication frequencies.
Here we overcome these limitations and demonstrate a monolithically integrated ITO electro- optic
modulator based on a Mach Zehnder interferometer (MZI) featuring a high-performance half-wave
voltage and active device length product, VpL = 0.52 V-mm. We show, how that the unity-strong index
change enables a 30 micrometer-short pi-phase shifter operating ITO in the index-dominated region
away from the epsilon-bear-zero ENZ point. This device experimentally confirms electrical phase
shifting in ITO enabling its use in multifaceted applications including dense on-chip communication
networks, nonlinearity for activation functions in photonic neural networks, and phased array
applications for LiDAR.
