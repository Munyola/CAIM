A theoretical model based on the method of super transition arrays (STA) is used to compute the emissivities,
opacities and average ionization states of carbon (C) and polystyrene (CH) plasmas in the warm-dense
matter regime in which the coupling constant varies between 0.02 to 2.0. The accuracy of results
of STA calculations is assessed by benchmarking against the available experimental data and results
obtained using other theoretical methods, assuming that a state of local thermodynamic equilibrium
exists in the plasma. In the case of a carbon plasma, the STA method yields spectral features that
are in reasonably-good agreement with Dirac-Fock and Hartree-Fock-Slater theories; in the case
of CH, we find that STA-derived opacities are very similar to those derived using quantum-molecular-dynamics
density-functional theory and Hartree-Fock method down to plasma temperature of about 20 eV. Our
calculations also compare favorably with available experimental measurements of Gamboa {\it
et al} [High Energy Density Phys. {\bf 11}, 75 (2014)] of the plasma temperature and average ionization
state behind a blast wave in a pure carbon foam. Although the STA-computed average-ionization charge
state in the rarefaction region appears to be lower than the experimental data, it is within the experimental
uncertainty and the discrepancy is nevertheless consistent with results reported using an atomic
kinetic model. In addition, we further predict the temperature dependence of average ionization
states of CH plasma in the same temperature range as for the carbon plasma.
