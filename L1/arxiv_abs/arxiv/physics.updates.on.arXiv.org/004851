Hybrid organic-inorganic halide perovskite solar cells have emerged as leading candidates for
third-generation photovoltaic technology. Despite the rapid improvement in power conversion
efficiency (PCE) for perovskite solar cells in recent years, the low-frequency carrier kinetics
that underlie practical roadblocks such as hysteresis and degradation remain relatively poorly
understood. In an effort to bridge this knowledge gap, we perform here correlated low-frequency
noise (LFN) and impedance spectroscopy (IS) characterization that elucidates carrier kinetics
in operating perovskite solar cells. Specifically, we focus on planar cell geometries with a SnO2
electron transport layer and two different hole transport layers, namely, poly(triarylamine)
(PTAA) and Spiro-OMeTAD. PTAA and Sprio-OMeTAD cells with moderate PCEs of 5 to 12 percent possess
a Lorentzian feature at 200 Hz in LFN measurements that corresponds to a crossover from electrode
to dielectric polarization. In comparison, Spiro-OMeTAD cells with high PCEs (15 percent) show
four orders of magnitude lower LFN amplitude and are accompanied by a cyclostationary process.
Through a systematic study of more than a dozen solar cells, we establish a correlation with noise
amplitude, power conversion efficiency, and fill factor. Overall, this work establishes correlated
LFN and IS as an effective methodology for quantifying low frequency carrier kinetics in perovskite
solar cells, thereby providing new physical insights that can rationally guide ongoing efforts
to improve device performance, reproducibility, and stability.
