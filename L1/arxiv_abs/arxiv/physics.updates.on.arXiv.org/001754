We introduce in this study an algorithm for the imaging of faults and of slip fields on those faults.
The physics of this problem are modeled using the equations of linear elasticity. We define a regularized
functional to be minimized for building the image. We prove that the minimum of that functional converges
to the unique solution of the related fault inverse problem. Due to inherent uncertainties in measurements,
rather than seeking a deterministic solution to the fault inverse problem, we consider a Bayesian
approach. In this approach the geometry of the fault is assumed to be planar, it can thus be modeled
by a three dimensional random variable whose probability density has to be determined knowing surface
measurements. The standard deviation of the slip (or any moment of the slip) is computed in a separate
step where the geometry of the fault is fixed (for example, the most likely geometry or the mean geometry).
The advantage of such an approach is that we obtain a way of quantifying uncertainties as part of our
final answer. On the downside, this Bayesian approach leads to a very large computation since the
slip is unknown. To contend with the size of this computation we developed an algorithm for the numerical
solution to the stochastic minimization problem which can be easily implemented on a parallel multi-core
platform and we discuss techniques aimed at saving on computational time. After showing how this
algorithm performs on simulated data, we apply it to measured data. The data was recorded during
a slow slip event in Guerrero, Mexico.
