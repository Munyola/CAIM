Egypt faced heavy rainfall starting from 26th October 2016 which caused flooding in Upper Egypt
and Red Sea Coast especially the city of Ras Gharib. In this work, Weather Research and Forecasting
(WRF) model was used with one domain of 10-km resolution for three days starting from 26th October
2016 to simulate this severe rainy event in terms of precipitation, temperature, pressure and wind
speed. In order to use the WRF model several schemes should be configured, one of them is the microphysics
scheme. Microphysics is the process by which moisture is removed from the air, based on other thermodynamic
and kinematic fields represented within the numerical models. Sensitivity of ten microphysics
schemes were tested (Kessler, Lin, WRF single moment 3 and 5 class, Eta (Ferrier), WRF single Scheme
6 Class, Goddard, Thompson, Milbrandt-Yau Double Moment and Morrison double moment). The output
temperature and precipitation from the model were compared to the satellite data obtained from
Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission
(TRMM), respectively. Our analysis showed that the model has the capability to simulate the rainy
event spatially and produce the cloud pattern. Three coastal areas were chosen for this study, the
city of Ras Gharib, Wadi Elgemal National park, and Elba National park. The results showed that the
model generally tends to overestimate the precipitation for all the ten schemes and underestimated
temperature compared to TRMM and MODIS data respectively
