Rational large Reynolds number matched asymptotic analyses of three-dimensional magneto-hydrodynamic
dynamo states are concerned. The dynamos, here assumed to be predominantly driven by a unidirectional
shear, are fully nonlinear and can be sustained without any linear instability of the base flow.
Two classes of dynamos are found. The first class of dynamos is emerged out of a nice combination of
the purely hydrodynamic vortex/wave interaction theory by Hall & Smith (1991) and the resonant
absorption theories for Alfv\'en waves, developed in the solar physics community. Similar to the
hydrodynamic theory, the mechanism of the dynamos can be explained by the successive interaction
of the roll, streak, and wave fields, which are now defined both for hydrodynamic and magnetic fields.
The derivation of this `vortex/Alfv\'en wave interaction' state is rather straightforward as
the scalings for both of the hydrodynamic and magnetic fields are identical. However, it turns out
that the leading order magnetic field cannot be supported without a small external magnetic field.
Without the leading order magnetic field at first glance dynamos are not possible. Nevertheless,
the second class of `self-sustained shear driven dynamo theory' shows the magnetic generation
of slightly smaller size in the absence of any external field. Despite the small size of the magnetic
field it causes the novel feedback mechanism to the velocity field through the absorption, where
the magnetic wave becomes more strongly amplified than the hydrodynamic counterpart.
