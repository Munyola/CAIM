The strong correlation of elementary particles or quasi-particles like electrons, phonons, and
excitons may give rise to macroscopic quantum states with exotic functionalities such as superconductivity,
Bose-Einstein condensation, Mott insulator, and electron-hole liquid. However, the macroscopic
quantum states usually only exist at cryogenic temperatures, and this has significantly limited
their prospect for practical applications and fundamental research. Here we demonstrate the formation
of macroscopic state of strongly correlated excitons at room temperature in monolayer MoS2. Excitons
typically behave like non- interacting free gas, but the strongly correlated state are liquid-like,
i.e., electron-hole liquid (EHL) with degenerate electrons and holes bound by collective interactions.
The EHL formation in MoS2 is evidenced by a first order transition in photoluminescence (PL) and
is consistent with the previous experimental observation of EHL. It is also supported by our theoretical
calculation based on well-established EHL models. The room-temperature EHL may provide a model
system to open up unprecedented opportunities for the fundamental studies of many-interacting
quantum physics. Additionally, the EHL features super- broadband emission (> 175 meV), high luminescence
yield, super-long charge lifetime (two orders of magnitude longer than excitons), and an ultimate
density of excited charges (4.0x1013 cm-2). It may enable the development of novel photonic devices,
such as extremely high-power and super-broadband lasers or LEDs.
