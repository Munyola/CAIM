Excited state hydrogen transfer (ESHT) is responsible to various photochemical processes of aromatics
including photoprotection of nuclear basis. Its mechanism is explained by the internal conversion
from aromatic $\pi$$\pi$* to $\pi$$\sigma$* states via conical intersection. It means that the
electron is transferred to a diffuse Rydberg like $\sigma$* orbital apart from the proton migration.
This picture means the electron and the proton are not move together and its dynamics are different
in principle. Here, we have applied the picosecond time-resolved near infrared (NIR) and infrared
(IR) spectroscopies to the phenol--(NH 3) 5 cluster, the bench mark system of ESHT, and monitored
the electron transfer and proton motion independently. The electron transfer monitored by the
NIR transition rises within 3 ps while the overall H transfer detected by the IR absorption of NH vibration
appears with the lifetime of $\approx$20 ps. It clearly proves that the electron motion and proton
migration are decoupled. Such the difference of the time-evolutions between the NIR absorption
and the IR transition has not been detected in the cluster with three ammonia molecules. We will report
full of our observation together with theoretical calculations of potential energy surfaces of
$\pi$$\pi$* and $\pi$$\sigma$* states, and will discuss the ESHT mechanism and its cluster size-dependence
between n = 3 and 5. It is suggested that the presence and absence of a barrier in the proton transfer
coordinate cause the different dynamics. 2
