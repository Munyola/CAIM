In order to resolve the cosmological constant problem, the fundamental notion, reference frame
is re-examined quantum mechanically. By using a quantum non-linear sigma (Q-NLSM) model, a theory
of quantum spacetime reference frame (QSRF) is proposed. The underlying mathematical structure
is a new geometry endowed with intrinsic 2nd central moment (variance) or even higher moments of
its coordinates, which generalizes the classical Riemannian geometry based on only 1st moment
(mean) of its coordinates. The 2nd central moment of the coordinates directly modifies the quadratic
form distance which is the foundation of the Riemannian geometry. At semi-classical level, the
2nd central moment introduces a flow which continuously deforms the Riemannian geometry driven
by its classical Ricci curvature, which is known as the Ricci flow. A generalized equivalence principle
of quantum version is also proposed to interpret the new geometry endowed with at least 2nd moment.
As a consequence, the spacetime is stabilized against quantum fluctuation, and the cosmological
constant problem is resolved within the framework. With an isotropic positive curvature initial
condition, the long-time solution of the Ricci flow exists, the accelerating expansion universe
at cosmic scale is an observable effect of the spacetime deformation of the normalized Ricci flow.
A deceleration parameter -0.67 consistent with measurement is obtained by using the reduced volume
method introduced by Perelman. Effective theory of gravity within the framework is also discussed.
