Focusing on factors that cause relative sea-level (RSL) rise to differ from the global mean, we evaluate
RSL trajectories for North Carolina, United States, in the context of tide gauge and geological
sea-level proxy records spanning the last $\mathord{\sim}$11,000 years. RSL rise was fastest
($\mathord{\sim}$7 mm/yr) during the early Holocene and decreased over time. During the Common
Era before the 19th century, RSL rise ($\mathord{\sim}$0.7 to 1.1 mm/yr) was driven primarily by
glacio-isostatic adjustment, dampened by tectonic uplift along the Cape Fear Arch. Ocean/atmosphere
dynamics caused centennial variability of up to $\mathord{\sim}$0.6 mm/yr around the long-term
rate. It is extremely likely (probability $P = 0.95$) that 20th century RSL rise at Sand Point, NC,
(2.8 $\pm$ 0.5 mm/yr) was faster than during any other century in $\geq2,900$ years. Projections
based on a fusion of process models, statistical models, expert elicitation and expert assessment
indicate that RSL at Wilmington, NC, is very likely ($P = 0.90$) to rise by 42--132 cm between 2000
and 2100 under the high-emissions RCP 8.5 pathway. Under all emission pathways, 21st century RSL
rise is very likely ($P > 0.90$) to be faster than during the 20th century. Because sea level responds
slowly to climate forcing, RSL rise in North Carolina to 2050 varies by <6 cm between pathways.
Due to RSL rise, under RCP 8.5, the current `1-in-100 year' flood is expected at Wilmington in $\mathord{\sim}$30
of the 50 years between 2050-2100.
