Deformable elastic bodies in viscous and viscoelastic media constitute a large portion of synthetic
and biological complex fluids. Here, we present a parallelized 3D-simulation methodology which
fully resolves the momentum balance in the solid and fluid domains. An immersed boundary algorithm
is exploited known as the immersed finite element method (IFEM) which accurately determines the
internal forces in the solid domain. The scheme utilized has the advantages of requiring no costly
re-meshing, handling finite Reynold's number, as well as incorporating non-linear viscoelasticity
in the fluid domain. Our algorithm is designed for computationally efficient simulation of multi-particle
suspensions with mixed structure types. The internal force calculation in the solid domain in IFEM
is coupled with a finite volume based incompressible fluid solver, both of which are massively parallelized
for distributed memory architecture. We performed extensive case studies to ensure the fidelity
of our algorithm. Namely, a series of single particle simulations for capsules, red blood cells,
and elastic solid deformable particles were conducted in viscous and viscoelastic media. All of
our results are in excellent quantitative agreement with the corresponding reported data in the
literature which are based on different simulation platforms. Furthermore, we assess the accuracy
of multi-particle simulation of blood suspensions (red blood cells in the plasma). Finally, we
present the results of a novel simulation of multiple solid deformable objects in a viscoelastic
medium.
