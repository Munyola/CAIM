In this and a companion paper we outline a general framework for the thermodynamic description of
open chemical reaction networks, with special regard to metabolic networks regulating cellular
physiology and biochemical functions. We first introduce closed networks "in a box", whose thermodynamics
is subjected to strict physical constraints: the mass-action law, elementarity of processes,
and detailed balance. We further digress on the role of solvents and on the seemingly unacknowledged
property of network independence of free energy landscapes. We then open the system by assuming
that the concentrations of certain substrate species (the chemostats) are fixed, whether because
promptly regulated by the environment via contact with reservoirs, or because nearly constant
in a time window. As a result, the system is driven out of equilibrium. A rich algebraic and topological
structure ensues in the network of internal species: Emergent irreversible cycles are associated
to nonvanishing affinities, whose symmetries are dictated by the breakage of conservation laws.
These central results are resumed in the relation $a + b = s^Y$ between the number of fundamental affinities
$a$, that of broken conservation laws $b$ and the number of chemostats $s^Y$. We decompose the steady
state entropy production rate in terms of fundamental fluxes and affinities in the spirit of Schnakenberg's
theory of network thermodynamics, paving the way for the forthcoming treatment of the linear regime,
of efficiency and tight coupling, of free energy transduction and of thermodynamic constraints
for network reconstruction.
