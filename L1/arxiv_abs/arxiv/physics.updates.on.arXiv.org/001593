Singularities, i.e. places of discontinuities of parameters are extremely general objects appearing
in electromagnetic waves and thus are the key to understanding fundamental wave processes. These
structures commonly occur in purely coherent, highly directional waves, such as laser beams, determining
additional spatial or "`topological"' properties of the wave fields independently of their propagational
dynamics. For instance, topologies of wave fronts, called phase singularities, add orbital degrees
of freedom to electromagnetic waves. These singularities are common to all types of scalar waves
described only by their intensity and phase distributions. As the electromagnetic wave is a vector
wave, its topological properties generally depend on all field components leading to complex field
patterns in space and time. These patterns may contain singular points of undefined instantaneous
orientation of the vector field, i.e. the instantaneous field (IF) singularities. In zero-order
paraxial approximation of purely transverse electromagnetic waves, some instantaneous field
distributions may carry apparent topological monopoles, when the originally source-free wave
exhibits spatial structure associated with the 2D "virtual" sources of electromagnetic fields.
Here we present systematic description of topological singularities in both electric and magnetic
field of the electromagnetic waves in a paraxial approximation. We also consider the important
types of paraxial electromagnetic waves with complex transverse field structures containing
instantaneous field singularities.
