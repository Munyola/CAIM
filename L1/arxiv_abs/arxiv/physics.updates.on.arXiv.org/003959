We theoretically model a dissipative system which exhibits self-defocussing nonlinearity and
numerically study the dynamics of optical dissipative solitons (DSs) whose evolution is governed
by a complex Ginzburg-Landau equation (GLE). We show that the formation of DSs is not restricted
in the domain exhibiting positive nonlinearity. Stable DSs are excited even in the regime where
the nonlinearity is negative. Based on the numeric sign of dispersion and nonlinear coefficient,
we classify the operational regime into four discrete domains and study the formation of DSs in those
regimes. We design a realistic waveguide that exhibits strong frequency dependent nonlinearity
which changes its sign across a certain frequency called zero-nonlinearity point (ZNP). We adopt
a variational technique to theoretically study the overall dynamics of DSs under various perturbations
by choosing Pereira-Stenflo type soliton as our ansatz since it is the natural solution of the unperturbed
GLE. An extensive numerical study reveals that the ZNP plays a dominant role on the pulse dynamics
and depending on its relative location with respect to input frequency, it can either suppress or
enhance Raman induced frequency down-shifting. This is further supported by the variational method
which quantitatively determines the location of the Raman frequency as a function of the ZNP. The
dispersive radiation generated due to third-order dispersion changes drastically with the location
of the ZNP. We analytically derive a phase matching equation that predicts the location of radiation
frequency in presence of the ZNP.
