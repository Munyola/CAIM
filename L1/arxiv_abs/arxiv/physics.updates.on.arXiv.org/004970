In this paper, we extend the unified gas-kinetic wave-particle (UGKWP) method to the multiscale
photon transport. In this method, the photon free streaming and scattering processes are treated
in an un-splitting way. The duality descriptions, namely the simulation particle and distribution
function, are utilized to describe the photon. By accurately recovering the governing equations
of the unified gas-kinetic scheme (UGKS), the UGKWP preserves the multiscale dynamics of photon
transport from optically thin to optically thick regime. In the optically thin regime, the UGKWP
becomes a Monte Carlo type particle tracking method, while in the optically thick regime, the UGKWP
becomes a diffusion equation solver. The local photon dynamics of the UGKWP, as well as the proportion
of wave-described and particle-described photons are automatically adapted according to the
numerical resolution and transport regime. Compared to the $S_n$ -type UGKS, the UGKWP requires
less memory cost and does not suffer ray effect. Compared to the implicit Monte Carlo (IMC) method,
the statistical noise of UGKWP is greatly reduced and computational efficiency is significantly
improved in the optically thick regime. Several numerical examples covering all transport regimes
from the optically thin to optically thick are computed to validate the accuracy and efficiency
of the UGKWP method. In comparison to the $S_n$ -type UGKS and IMC method, the UGKWP method may have
several-order-of-magnitude reduction in computational cost and memory requirement in solving
some multsicale transport problems.
