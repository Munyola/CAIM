[Taken from the "README" in the book] My goal with this book is to provide some kind of bridge for mathematics
between the high-school-level and college-level for physics students. From my perspective, our
job as physicists is to observe and understand the universe around us. Unfortunately our universe
happens to be pretty complicated, at least from a mathematical point-of-view. However, a lot of
the underlying physics | the underlying set of rules surrounding how things move and behave | is usually
not too complicated. Sure, when we couple things together, everything turns disgusting, and we
need to turn to really powerful computers or simulators to get a lot accomplished. But the basic rules
are not that bad. My hope is to provide enough of a conceptual framework for you to learn to $read$ math
as I saw a lot of other physicists do when I started my undergraduate career. I plan to cover some of
the topics that tend to trip up a lot of physics students, although I could not cover these exhaustively.
When I found that I should have covered more, but could not due to finite time constraints, I left a
reference to other work that I think you may find helpful. However, unlike a lot of works, my focus
is to help modify your thinking of how math is used, rather than just pummel you with algorithms for
you to memorize without giving you the proper context for such algorithms. Whenever you find my explanations
long-winded, feel free to proceed through faster. If you get stuck, you are always free to go back
and see what I might have referenced before.
