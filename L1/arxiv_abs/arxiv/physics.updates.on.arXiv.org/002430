As two most prevalent microscopic mechanisms of strategy spreading, frequency-dependent Moran
process and pairwise comparison process are widely used to model population traits' evolution
in evolutionary game dynamics. For several specific fitness or imitation mappings, these two microscopic
processes can lead to identical evolutionary outcomes under weak selection. But, does this equivalent
relation hold for any forms of fitness and imitation mappings? In this paper, we propose two generalized
mappings that fitness (imitation probability) is an any non-negative function of payoff (payoff
difference) and selection intensity, and investigate whether these unifying mappings can lead
to equivalent evolutionary outcomes in stochastic game dynamics. By calculating the fixation
probabilities and fixation times under weak selection, we find that the generalized mappings unify
these two quantities by a constant factor under mild conditions. With this constant factor, the
effects of different fitness and imitation probability functions on evolutionary outcomes just
make the selection intensity or payoff matrix change a scale, which recovers the previous results
as special cases. Thus, irrespective of the scaling factor, any two fitness or imitation probability
functions are equivalent under weak selection. Particularly, the choice of fitness and imitation
probability mappings significantly determines the direction of one-third law and risk dominance
by the scaling factor. This work may thus enrich the knowledge of stochastic evolutionary game dynamics.
