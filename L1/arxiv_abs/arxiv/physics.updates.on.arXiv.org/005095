The paper presents a hybrid bubble hologram processing approach for measuring the size and 3D distribution
of bubbles over a wide range of size and shape. The proposed method consists of five major steps, including
image enhancement, digital reconstruction, small bubble segmentation, large bubble/cluster
segmentation, and post-processing. Two different segmentation approaches are proposed to extract
the size and the location of bubbles in different size ranges from the 3D reconstructed optical field.
Specifically, a small bubble is segmented based on the presence of the prominent intensity minimum
in its longitudinal intensity profile, and its depth is determined by the location of the minimum.
In contrast, a large bubble/cluster is segmented using a modified watershed segmentation algorithm
and its depth is measured through a wavelet-based focus metric. Our processing approach also determines
the inclination angle of a large bubble with respect to the hologram recording plane based on the
depth variation along its edge on the plane. The accuracy of our processing approach on the measurements
of bubble size, location and inclination is assessed using the synthetic bubble holograms and a
3D printed physical target. The holographic measurement technique is further implemented to capture
the fluctuation of instantaneous gas leakage rate from a ventilated supercavity generated in a
water tunnel experiment. Overall, our paper introduces a low cost, compact and high-resolution
bubble measurement technique that can be used for characterizing low void fraction bubbly flow
in a broad range of applications.
