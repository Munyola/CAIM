Purpose: This study demonstrates a proof of concept of a method for simultaneous anatomical imaging
and real-time (SMART) passive device tracking for MR-guided interventions. Methods: Phase Correlation
template matching was combined with a fast undersampled radial multi-echo acquisition using the
white marker phenomenon after the first echo. In this way, the first echo provides anatomical contrast,
whereas the other echoes provide white marker contrast to allow accurate device localization using
fast simulations and template matching. This approach was tested on tracking of five 0.5 mm steel
markers in an agarose phantom and on insertion of an MRI-compatible 20 Gauge titanium needle in ex
vivo porcine tissue. The locations of the steel markers were quantitatively compared to the marker
locations as found on a CT scan of the same phantom. Results: The average pairwise error between the
MRI and CT locations was 0.30 mm for tracking of stationary steel spheres and 0.29 mm during motion.
Qualitative evaluation of the tracking of needle insertions showed that tracked positions were
stable throughout needle insertion and retraction. Conclusions: The proposed SMART tracking
method provided accurate passive tracking of devices at high framerates, inclusion of real-time
anatomical scanning, and the capability of automatic slice positioning. Furthermore, the method
does not require specialized hardware and could therefore be applied to track any rigid metal device
that causes appreciable magnetic field distortions.
