Using a series of increasingly refined wavefunction methods able to tackle electronic excited
states, namely ADC(2), CC2, CCSD, CCSDR(3) and CC3, we investigate the interplay between geometries
and 0-0 energies. We show that, due to a strong and nearly systematic error cancelation between the
vertical transition and geometrical reorganization energies, CC2 and CCSD structures can be used
to obtain chemically-accurate 0-0 energies, though the underlying geometries are rather far from
the reference ones and would deliver significant errors for many chemical and physical properties.
This indicates that obtaining 0-0 energies matching experiment does not demonstrate the quality
of the geometrical parameters. In contrast, accurate computation of vertical excitation energies
is mandatory in order to reach chemical accuracy. By determining CC3 total energies on CCSD structures,
we model a large set of compounds (including radicals) and electronic transitions (including singlet-triplet
excitations) and successfully reach chemical accuracy in a near systematic way. Indeed, for this
particular set, our protocol delivers a mean absolute error as small as $0.032$ eV, chemical accuracy
(error smaller than $1$ kcal.mol$^{-1}$ or $0.043$ eV) being obtained in 80\%\ of the cases. In only
three cases the error exceeds $0.15$ eV which is of the order of the typical error provided by TD-DFT
or second-order wavefunction methods for this particular property. The present composite protocol
is therefore very effective despite the fact that the geometries may not be considered as very accurate.
