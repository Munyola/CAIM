In this work, a novel synthetic iteration scheme (SIS) is developed for the LBE to find solutions
to Kramer's problem accurately and efficiently: the velocity distribution function is first solved
by the conventional iterative scheme, then it is modified such that in each iteration i) the flow
velocity is guided by an ordinary differential equation that is asymptotic-preserving at the Navier-Stokes
limit and ii) the shear stress is equal to the average shear stress. Based on the Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook
model, the SIS is assessed to be efficient and accurate. Then we investigate the Kramer's problem
for gases interacting through the inverse power-law, shielded Coulomb, and Lennard-Jones potentials,
subject to diffuse-specular and Cercignani-Lampis gas-surface boundary conditions. When the
tangential momentum accommodation coefficient (TMAC) is not larger than one, the Knudsen layer
function is strongly affected by the potential, where its value and width increase with the effective
viscosity index of gas molecules. Moreover, the Knudsen layer function exhibits similarities
among different values of TMAC when the intermolecular potential is fixed. For Cercignani-Lampis
boundary condition with TMAC larger than one, both the viscous slip coefficient and Knudsen layer
function are affected by the intermolecular potential, especially when the "backward" scattering
limit is approached. With the asymptotic theory by Jiang and Luo for the singular behavior of the
velocity gradient in the vicinity of the solid surface, we find that the whole Knudsen layer function
can be well fitted by power series.
