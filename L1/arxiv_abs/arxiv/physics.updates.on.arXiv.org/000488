We introduce numerical algorithms for initializing multidimensional simulations of stellar
explosions with 1D stellar evolution models. The initial mapping from 1D profiles onto multidimensional
grids can generate severe numerical artifacts, one of the most severe of which is the violation of
conservation laws for physical quantities. We introduce a numerical scheme for mapping 1D spherically-symmetric
data onto multidimensional meshes so that these physical quantities are conserved. We verify our
scheme by porting a realistic 1D Lagrangian stellar profile to the new multidimensional Eulerian
hydro code CASTRO. Our results show that all important features in the profiles are reproduced on
the new grid and that conservation laws are enforced at all resolutions after mapping. We also introduce
a numerical scheme for initializing multidimensional supernova simulations with realistic perturbations
predicted by 1D stellar evolution models. Instead of seeding 3D stellar profiles with random perturbations,
we imprint them with velocity perturbations that reproduce the Kolmogorov energy spectrum expected
for highly turbulent convective regions in stars. Our models return Kolmogorov energy spectra
and vortex structures like those in turbulent flows before the modes become nonlinear. Finally,
we describe approaches to determining the resolution for simulations required to capture fluid
instabilities and nuclear burning. Our algorithms are applicable to multidimensional simulations
besides stellar explosions that range from astrophysics to cosmology.
