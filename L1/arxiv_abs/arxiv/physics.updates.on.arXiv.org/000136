Mitochondrial adenine nucleotide (AdN) content is regulated through the Ca2+-activated, electroneutral
ATP-Mg/Pi carrier (APC). The APC is a protein in the mitochondrial carrier super family that localizes
to the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM). It is known to modulate a number of processes that depend
on mitochondrial AdN content, such as gluconeogenesis, protein synthesis, and citrulline synthesis.
Despite this critical role, a kinetic model of the underlying mechanism has not been developed and
validated. Here, a biophysical model of the APC is developed that is thermodynamically balanced
and accurately reproduces a number of reported data sets from isolated rat liver and rat kidney mitochondria.
The model is based on an ordered bi-bi mechanism for hetero-exchange of ATP and Pi and also includes
homo-exchanges of ATP and Pi to explain both the initial rate and time course data on ATP and Pi transport
via the APC. The model invokes seven kinetic parameters regarding the APC mechanism and three parameters
related to matrix pH regulation by external Pi. These parameters are estimated based on nineteen
independent data curves; the estimated parameters are validated using six additional data curves.
The model takes into account the effects of pH, Mg2+ and Ca2+ on ATP and Pi transport via the APC and
supports the conclusion that the pH gradient across the IMM serves as the primary driving force for
AdN uptake or efflux. Moreover, computer simulations demonstrate that extra-matrix Ca2+ modulates
the turnover rate of the APC and not the binding affinity of ATP, as previously suggested.
