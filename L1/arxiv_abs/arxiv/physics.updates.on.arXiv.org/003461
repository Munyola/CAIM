The Penning-trap electronic-detection technique that offers the precision and sensitivity requested
in mass spectrometry for fundamental studies in nuclear and particle physics has not been proven
yet to be universal. This has motivated the construction of a Penning-trap facility aiming at the
implementation of a novel detection method, consisting in measuring motional frequencies of singly-charged
trapped ions in strong magnetic fields, through the fluorescence photons from the 4s$^2$S$_{1/2}\rightarrow
$4p$^2$P$_{1/2}$ atomic transition in $^{40}$Ca$^+$. The key element of this facility is an open-ring
Penning trap, built and fully characterized, which is coupled upstream to a preparation Penning
trap similar to those built at Radioactive Ion Beam facilities. Motional frequency measurements
of trapped ions stored in the open-ring trap have been carried out by applying external dipolar and
quadrupolar fields in resonance with the ions' eigenmotions, in combination with time-of-flight
identification. The infrastructure to observe the fluorescence photons from $^{40}$Ca$^+$,
comprising the twelve laser beams needed in 7~Tesla, and a two-meters long system to register the
image in a high-sensitive CCD sensor, has also been successfully tested by observing optically
the trapped $^{40}$Ca$^+$ ions. This demonstrates the capabilities of this facility for the proposed
laser-based mass-spectrometry technique, and introduces it as a unique platform to perform laser-spectroscopy
experiments with implications in different fields of physics.
