The size or energy of diverse structures or phenomena in geoscience appears to follow power-law
distributions. A rigorous statistical analysis of such observations is tricky, though. Observables
can span several orders of magnitude, but the range for which the power law may be valid is typically
truncated, usually because the smallest events are too tiny to be detected and the largest ones are
limited by the system size. We revisit several examples of proposed power-law distributions dealing
with potentially damaging natural phenomena. Adequate fits of the distributions of sizes are especially
important in these cases, given that they may be used to assess long-term hazard. After reviewing
the theoretical background for power-law distributions, we improve an objective statistical
fitting method and apply it to diverse data sets. The method is described in full detail and it is easy
to implement. Our analysis elucidates the range of validity of the power-law fit and the corresponding
exponent, and whether a power-law tail is improved by a truncated log-normal. We confirm that impact
fireballs and Californian earthquakes show untruncated power-law behavior, whereas global earthquakes
follow a double power law. Tropical cyclones and rain precipitation over space and time show a truncated
power-law regime. Karst sinkholes and wildfires, in contrast, are better described by truncated
log-normals, although wildfires also may show power-law regimes. Our conclusions only apply to
the analyzed data sets, but show the potential of applying this robust statistical technique in
the future.
