Theoretical and experimental investigations of water vapor interaction with porous materials
are carried out both at the macro level and at the micro level. At the macro level, the influence of
the arrangement structure of individual pores on the processes of water vapor interaction with
porous material as a continuous medium is studied. At the micro level, it is very interesting to investigate
the dependence of the characteristics of the water vapor interaction with porous media on the geometry
and dimensions of the individual pore. In this paper, a study was carried out by means of mathematical
modelling of the processes of water vapor interaction with suffering pore of the cylindrical type.
The calculations were performed using a model of a hybrid type combining a molecular-dynamic and
a macro-diffusion approach for describing water vapor interaction with an individual pore. The
processes of evolution to the state of thermodynamic equilibrium of macroscopic characteristics
of the system such as temperature, density, and pressure, depending on external conditions with
respect to pore, were explored. The dependence of the evolution parameters on the distribution
of the diffusion coefficient in the pore, obtained as a result of molecular dynamics modelling,
is examined. The relevance of these studies is due to the fact that all methods and programs used for
the modelling of the moisture and heat conductivity are based on the use of transport equations in
a porous material as a continuous medium with known values of the transport coefficients, which
are usually obtained experimentally.
