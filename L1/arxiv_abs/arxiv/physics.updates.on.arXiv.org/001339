We study the influence of clustering, more specifically triangles, on cascading failures in interdependent
networks or systems, in which we model the dependence between comprising systems using a dependence
graph. First, we propose a new model that captures how the presence of triangles in the dependence
graph alters the manner in which failures transmit from affected systems to others. Unlike existing
models, the new model allows us to approximate the failure propagation dynamics using a multi-type
branching process, even with triangles. Second, making use of the model, we provide a simple condition
that indicates how increasing clustering will affect the likelihood that a random failure triggers
an epidemic of failures, which we call the probability of cascading failures (PoCF). In particular,
our condition reveals an intriguing observation that the influence of clustering on PoCF depends
on the vulnerability of comprising systems to an increasing number of failed neighboring systems
and the current PoCF, starting with different types of failed systems. Furthermore, our finding
suggests that, as the degree distribution becomes more concentrated, clustering will have greater
impact on the PoCF and tend to impede an outbreak of failures. Finally, our numerical studies hint
that clustering indeed hampers cascading failures under both (truncated) power law and Poisson
degree distributions. However, for the reason explained above, the PoCF experiences much greater
effects of clustering under Poisson degree distributions in comparison to power law degree distributions.
