In this paper droplet evaporative crystallization of salicylic acid (SA) and acetylsalicylic
acid (ASA) crystals on different surfaces, such as glass, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), and paraffin
was studied. The obtained crystals were analyzed using powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) technique.
In order to better understand the effect of the surface on evaporative crystallization, crystals
deposited on glass were scraped off. Moreover, evaporative crystallization of a large volume of
solution was performed. As we found, paraffin which is non-polar surface promotes formation of
crystals morphologically similar to those obtained via bulk evaporative crystallization. On
the other hand, when crystallization is carried out on the polar surfaces (glass and PVA), there
is a significant orientation effect. This phenomenon is manifested by the reduction of the number
of peaks in PXRD spectrum recorded for deposited on the surface crystals. Noteworthy, reduction
of PXRD signals is not observed for powder samples obtained after scraping crystals off the glass.
In order to explain the mechanism of carboxylic crystals growth on the polar surfaces, quantum-chemical
computations were performed. It has been found that crystal faces of the strongest orientation
effect can be characterized by the highest surface densities of intermolecular interactions energy
(IIE). In case of SA and ASA crystals formed on the polar surfaces the most dominant faces are characterized
by the highest adhesive and cohesive properties. This suggests that the selection rules of the orientation
effect comes directly from surface IIE densities.
