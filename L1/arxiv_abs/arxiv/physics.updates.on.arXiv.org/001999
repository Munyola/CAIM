We analyzed 44 passes of the MAVEN spacecraft through the magnetosphere, arranged by the angle between
electric field vector and the projection of spacecraft position radius vector in the YZ plane in
MSE coordinate system (${\theta}$ E ). All passes were divided into 3 angular sectors near 0{\deg},
90{\deg} and 180{\deg} ${\theta}$ E angles in order to estimate the role of IMF direction in plasma
and magnetic properties of dayside Martian magnetosphere. The time interval chosen was from January
17 through February 4, 2016 when MAVEN was crossing the dayside magnetosphere at SZA ~ 70{\deg}.
Magnetosphere as the region with prevailing energetic planetary ions is always found between the
magnetosheath and the ionosphere. 3 angular sectors of dayside interaction region in MSE coordinate
system with different orientation of the solar wind electric field vector E = -1/c V x B showed that
for each sector one can find specific profiles of the magnetosheath, the magnetic barrier and the
magnetosphere. Plume ions originate in the northern MSE sector where motion electric field is directed
from the planet. This electric field ejects magnetospheric ions leading to dilution of magnetospheric
heavy ions population, and this effect is seen in some magnetospheric profiles. Magnetic barrier
forms in front of the magnetosphere, and relative magnetic field magnitudes in these two domains
vary. The average height of the boundary with ionosphere is ~530 km and the average height of the magnetopause
is ~730 km. We discuss the implications of the observed magnetosphere structure to the planetary
ions loss mechanism.
