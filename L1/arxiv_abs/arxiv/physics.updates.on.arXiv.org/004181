Compared to physical systems that exhibit limited and mostly predetermined responses to external
inputs, biological organisms show an enormous diversity of traits and an ability to evolve. Particular
responses to different environmental conditions are developed by organisms to adapt to varying
environments. We study how such responses evolve by considering them as a mapping from environmental
cues to phenotypic traits, modeled by a network with hidden units. An optimized mapping represents
a strategy of adaptation that best helps organisms to survive and reproduce. Depending on the accuracy
of environmental cues and the strength of natural selection, we find different adaptation strategies
characterized by the shape of phenotype distributions. In particular, three previously studied
strategies emerge as special limits of our model: when environmental cues are accurate, organisms
rely on the cue to express the favorable phenotype in each environmental condition ("tracking strategy"),
when cues are noisy, organisms either express a same phenotype in all environments ("unvarying
strategy") or, remarkably, use the uninformative cue as a source of randomness to diversify into
subpopulations of different phenotypes ("bet-hedging strategy"). The capacity of exploring
diverse responses and evolving different strategies is associated with having a high-dimensional
internal representation of the environment. Our model reveals a unifying picture of biological
adaptation and provides a framework for understanding how the relations between organisms and
the environment are shaped by the evolutionary process.
