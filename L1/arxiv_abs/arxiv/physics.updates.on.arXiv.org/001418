Laser induced plasmas have found numerous applications including plasma-assisted combustion,
combustion diagnostics, laser induced breakdown spectroscopy, light detection and ranging techniques
(LIDAR), microwave guiding, reconfigurable plasma antennae etc. Multiphoton ionization (MPI)
is a fundamental first step in high-energy laser-matter interaction and is important for understanding
of the mechanism of plasma formation. With the discovery of MPI more than 50 years ago, there were
numerous attempts to determine basic physical constants of this process in the direct experiments,
namely photoionization rates and cross-sections of the MPI, however, no reliable data is available
until today and spread in the literature values often reaches 2-3 orders of magnitude. This is due
to inability to conduct absolute measurements of plasma electron numbers generated by MPI which
leads to uncertainties and, sometimes, contradictions between the MPI cross-section values utilized
by different researchers across the field. Here we report first direct measurement of absolute
plasma electron numbers generated at MPI of air and subsequently we precisely determine ionization
rate and cross-section of eight-photon ionization of oxygen molecule by 800 nm photons ${\sigma}_8=(3.32{\pm}0.3)*10^{-130}
W^{-8}m^{16}s^{-1}$. Method is based on the absolute measurement of electron number created by
MPI using elastic scattering of microwaves off the plasma volume in Rayleigh regime and establishes
a general approach to directly measure and tabulate basic constants of the MPI process for various
gases and photon energies.
