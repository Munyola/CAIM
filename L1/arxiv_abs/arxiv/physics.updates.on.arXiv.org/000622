Quantum theory's irreducible empirical core is a probability calculus. While it presupposes the
events to which (and on the basis of which) it serves to assign probabilities, and therefore cannot
account for their occurrence, it has to be consistent with it. It must make it possible to identify
a system of observables that have measurement-independent values, and this not merely for all practical
purposes. What makes this possible is the incompleteness of the spatiotemporal differentiation
of the physical world: the existence of a real-valued spatiotemporal background is an unrealistic
idealization. This is shown by applying a novel interpretive principle to interfering alternatives
involving distinctions between regions of space. Applying the same interpretive principle to
alternatives involving distinctions between things makes it safe to claim that the macroworld
comes into being through a progressive differentiation of a single, intrinsically undifferentiated
entity. By entering into reflexive spatial relations, this entity gives rise to (i) what looks like
a multiplicity of relata if the reflexive quality of the relations is not taken into account, and
(ii) what looks like a substantial expanse if the spatial quality of the relations is reified. The
necessary distinction between two domains (classical and quantum, or macro and micro) and their
mutual dependence is best understood as a distinction between the manifested world and its manifestation.
Instead of being constituent parts of the manifested world, subatomic particles, atoms, and molecules
are instrumental in its manifestation.
