The use of computer simulations techniques is an advantageous tool in order to evaluate and select
the most appropriated site for radionuclides confinement. Modelling different scenarios allow
to take decisions about which is the most safety place for the final repository. In this work, a bidimensional
numerical simulation model for the analysis of dispersion of contaminants trough a saturated porous
media using finite element method (FEM), was applied to study the transport of radioisotopes in
a temporary nuclear repository localized in the Vadose Zone at Pe\~na Blanca, M\'exico. The 2D model
used consider the Darcy's law for calculating the velocity field, which is the input data for in a
second computation to solve the mass transport equation. Taking into account radionuclides decay
the transport of long lived U-series daughters such as ${}^{238}\!\text{U}$, ${}^{234}\!\text{U}$,
and ${}^{230}\!\text{Th}$ is evaluated. The model was validated using experimental data reported
in the literature obtaining good agreement between the numerical results and the available experimental
data. The simulations show preferential routes that the contaminant plume follows over time. The
radionuclide flow is highly irregular and it is influenced by failures in the area and its interactions
in the fluid-solid matrix. The resulting radionuclide concentration distribution is as expected.
The most important result of this work is the development of a validated model to describe the migration
of radionuclides in saturated porous media with some fractures.
