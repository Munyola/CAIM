This living paper reviews the present High Performance Computing (HPC) capabilities of the Tinker-HP
molecular modeling package. We focus here on the reference, double precision, massively parallel
molecular dynamics engine present in Tinker-HP and dedicated to perform large scale simulations.
We show how it can be adapted to recent Intel Central Processing Unit (CPU) petascale architectures.
First, we discuss the new set of Intel Advanced Vector Extensions 512 (Intel AVX-512) instructions
present in recent Intel processors (e.g., the Intel Xeon Scalable and Intel Xeon Phi 2nd generation
processors) allowing for larger vectorization enhancements. These instructions constitute
the central source of potential computational gains when using the latest processors, justifying
important vectorization efforts for developers. We then briefly review the organization of the
Tinker-HP code and identify the computational hotspots which require Intel AVX-512 optimization
and we propose a general and optimal strategy to vectorize those particular parts of the code. We
intended to present our optimization strategy in a pedagogical way so it could benefit to other researchers
and students interested in gaining performances in their own software. Finally we present the performance
enhancements obtained compared to the unoptimized code both sequentially and at the scaling limit
in parallel for classical non-polarizable (CHARMM) and polarizable force fields (AMOEBA). This
paper never ceases to be updated as we accumulate new data on the associated Github repository between
new versions of this living paper.
