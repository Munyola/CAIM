On-line data assimilation techniques such as ensemble Kalman filters and particle filters lose
accuracy dramatically when presented with an unlikely observation. Such an observation may be
caused by an unusually large measurement error or reflect a rare fluctuation in the dynamics of the
system. Over a long enough span of time it becomes likely that one or several of these events will occur.
Often they are signatures of the most interesting features of the underlying system and their prediction
becomes the primary focus of the data assimilation procedure. The Kuroshio or Black Current that
runs along the eastern coast of Japan is an example of such a system. It undergoes infrequent but dramatic
changes of state between a small meander during which the current remains close to the coast of Japan,
and a large meander during which it bulges away from the coast. Because of the important role that
the Kuroshio plays in distributing heat and salinity in the surrounding region, prediction of these
transitions is of acute interest. Here we focus on a regime in which both the stochastic forcing on
the system and the observational noise are small. In this setting large deviation theory can be used
to understand why standard filtering methods fail and guide the design of the more effective data
assimilation techniques. Motivated by our analysis we propose several data assimilation strategies
capable of efficiently handling rare events such as the transitions of the Kuroshio. These techniques
are tested on a model of the Kuroshio and shown to perform much better than standard filtering methods.
