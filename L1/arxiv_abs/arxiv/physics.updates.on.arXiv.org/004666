An extended aperture has the potential to greatly improve ultrasound imaging performance. This
work extends the effective aperture size by coherently compounding the received radio frequency
data from multiple transducers. A framework is developed in which an ultrasound imaging system
consisting of $N$ synchronized matrix arrays, each with partly shared field of view, take turns
to transmit plane waves. Only one individual transducer transmits at each time while all $N$ transducers
simultaneously receive. The subwavelength localization accuracy required to combine information
from multiple transducers is achieved without the use of any external tracking device. The method
developed in this study is based on the study of the backscattered echoes received by the same transducer
and resulting from a targeted scatterer point in the medium insonated by the multiple ultrasound
probes of the system. The current transducer locations along with the speed of sound in the medium
are deduced by optimizing the cross-correlation between these echoes. The method is demonstrated
experimentally in 2-D using ultrasound point and anechoic lesion phantoms and a first demonstration
of a free-hand experiment is also shown. Results demonstrate that the coherent multi-transducer
imaging has the potential to improve ultrasound image quality, improving resolution and target
detectability. Lateral resolution, contrast and contrast-to-noise ratio improved from 0.67
mm, -6.708 dB and 0.702, respectively, when using a single probe, to 0.18 mm, -7.251 dB and 0.721 in
the coherent multi-transducer imaging case.
