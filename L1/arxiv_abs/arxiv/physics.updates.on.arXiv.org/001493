Filming chemical reactions or atoms in motion is one of the greatest scientific dreams yet to be accomplished
which requires sub-atomic spatiotemporal resolution. Newly emerging X-ray free electron lasers
and laser-based attoscience centers are the most likely candidates to succeed first thanks to their
angstrom-level radiation. To provide the necessary temporal resolution, these facilities must
be able to synchronize numerous mode-locked lasers with ultra-high precision across kilometer-distances.
Here, we report a synchronous mode-locked laser network incorporating two remote slave lasers
at different central wavelengths and repetition rates over 4.7-km distance. The network exhibits
a record-low timing drift of 0.6 fs RMS below 1 Hz over 40 h reaching the 20$^{th}$ decimal uncertainty
in ~8000-s averaging time. Short-term stability measurements show an out-of-loop timing jitter
of only 1.3 fs RMS integrated from 1 Hz to 1 MHz. We also present a comprehensive noise analysis of the
network considering both quantum noise and technical noise sources. For the first time in literature,
we reveal the standard quantum limit for the timing jitter acquired by optical pulses when traveling
in fiber links. Our comprehensive feedback loop analysis reveals nine technical noise sources
out of which the slave lasers inherent jitter dominates with 1.26 fs RMS. This suggests that timing
precision of the network is not limited by our synchronization scheme and could be improved even
further by developing lower noise mode-locked lasers.
