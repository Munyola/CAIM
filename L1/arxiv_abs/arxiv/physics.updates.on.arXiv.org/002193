The large-scale structures in the ocean and the atmosphere are in geostrophic balance, and a conduit
must be found to channel the energy to the small scales where it can be dissipated. In turbulence this
takes the form of an energy cascade, whereas one possible mechanism in a balanced flow at large scales
is through the formation of fronts, a common occurrence in geophysical dynamics. We show in this
paper that an iconic configuration in laboratory and numerical experiments for the study of turbulence,
that of the Taylor-Green or von K\'arm\'an swirling flow, can be suitably adapted to the case of fluids
with large aspect ratios, leading to the creation of an imposed large-scale vertical shear. To this
effect we use direct numerical simulations of the Boussinesq equations without net rotation and
with no small-scale modeling, and with this idealized Taylor-Green set-up. Various grid spacings
are used, up to $2048^2\times 256$ spatial points. The grids are always isotropic, with box aspect
ratios of either $1:4$ or $1:8$. We find that when shear and stratification are comparable, the imposed
shear layer resulting from the forcing leads to the formation of multiple fronts and filaments which
destabilize and further evolve into a turbulent flow in the bulk, with a sizable amount of dissipation
and mixing, and with a cycle of front creation, instability, and development of turbulence. The
results depend on the vertical length scales for shear and for stratification, with stronger large-scale
gradients being generated when the two length scales are comparable.
