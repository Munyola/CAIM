The so-called "minimum uncertainty" or mu-wavelet approach has been shown to be very effective.
Prior work has shown that using special algorithms based on a mu-wavelet decomposition of a seismic
signal allows for arrival detection of various waves on a single-component seismogram with good
precision. However, the question of interpretation of the type of wave arriving has not been addressed.
The problem lies in the fact that the algorithm detects more than two arrivals even on seismograms
with little noise, the peaks corresponding to P and S wave arrivals on the indicator function are
not always the strongest, and the peak corresponding to the P wave arrival is not always the first
peak detected. We propose to use a signal/noise relationship function in a running window as a weight
coefficient of the indicator function obtained using the mu-wavelet transformation, which allows
to isolate specifically those arrivals which correspond to significant changes in the signal amplitude.
To interpret wave arrivals on linear registration systems (well observation systems for monitoring
hydrolic fracturing, ultrasound investigations on models and samples of geological material),
an algorithm was also developed to isolate arrivals that best correspond to arrivals on all registration
points that have observation systems. As a result, we propose an algorithm that allows to automatically
isolate arrivals of S and P waves on "frac" event recordings of a well observation system, and provides
agreement with manual detection that doesn't exceed four discretes.
