In the present article, we introduce the relativistic Cholesky-decomposed density (CDD) matrix
second-order M{\o}ller-Plesset perturbation theory (MP2) energies. The working equations are
formulated in terms of the usual intermediates of MP2 when employing the resolution-of-the-identity
approximation (RI) for two-electron integrals. Those intermediates are obtained by substituting
the occupied and virtual quaternion pseudo-density matrices of our previously proposed two-component
atomic orbital-based MP2 (J. Chem. Phys. 145, 014107 (2016)) by the corresponding pivoted quaternion
Cholesky factors. While working within the Kramers-restricted formalism, we obtain a formal spin-orbit
overhead of 16 and 28 for the Coulomb and exchange contribution to the 2C MP2 correlation energy,
respectively, compared to a non-relativistic (NR) spin-free CDD-MP2 implementation. This compact
quaternion formulation could also be easily explored in any other algorithm to compute the 2C MP2
energy. The quaternion Cholesky factors become sparse for large molecules and, with a block-wise
screening, block sparse-matrix multiplication algorithm, we observed an effective quadratic
scaling of the total wall time for heavy-element containing linear molecules with increasing system
size. The total run time for both 1C and 2C calculations was dominated by the contraction to the exchange
energy. We have also investigated a bulky Te-containing supramolecular complex. For such bulky,
three-dimensionally extended molecules the present screening scheme has a much larger prefactor
and is less effective.
