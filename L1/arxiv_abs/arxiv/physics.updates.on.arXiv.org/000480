With the increasing complexity of external beam therapy, so-called "end-to-end" tests are intended
to cover all steps from therapy planning to follow-up to fulfill the high demands on quality assurance.
As magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) gains growing importance in the treatment process and established
phantoms (such as the Alderson head) cannot be used for those tests, novel multimodality phantoms
have to be developed. Here, we present a feasibility study for such a customizable multimodality
head phantom. We used a set of patient CT images as the basis for the anthropomorphic head shape. The
recipient - consisting of an epoxy resin - was produced using rapid prototyping (3D printing). The
phantom recipient includes a nasal air cavity, two soft tissues volumes and cranial bone. Additionally
a spherical tumor volume was positioned in the center. The volumes were filled with dipotassium
phosphate-based cranial bone surrogate, agarose gel, and distilled water. The tumor volume was
filled with normoxic dosimetric gel. The entire workflow of radiation therapy including a clinical
proton irradiation could be successfully applied to the phantom. CT measurements revealed Hounsfield
units agreeing with reference values for all surrogates. The MRI contrasts corresponded to the
expectations on the phantom materials except for the bone surrogate providing an undesirably high
signal intensity. The dose verification by T2-weighted read out of the polymerization gel dosimeter
could successfully show a correct plan delivery in terms of particle range.
