Cross-laminated timber (CLT) is a prefabricated solid engineered wood product made of at least
three orthogonally bonded layers of solid-sawn lumber that are laminated by gluing longitudinal
and transverse layers with structural adhesives to form a solid panel. Previous studies have shown
that the CLT buildings can perform well in seismic loading and are recognized as the essential role
of connector performance in structural design, modelling, and analysis of CLT buildings. When
CLT is composed of high-grade/high-density layers for the outer lamellas and low-grade/low-density
for the core of the panels, the CLT panels are herein designated as hybrid CLT panels as opposed to
conventional CLT panels that are built using one lumber type for both outer and core lamellas. This
paper presents results of a testing program developed to estimate the cyclic performance of CLT
connectors applied on hybrid CLT layups. Two connectors are selected, which can be used in wall-to-floor
connections. These are readily available in the North American market. Characterization of the
performance of connectors is done in two perpendicular directions under a modified CUREE cyclic
loading protocol. Depending on the mode of failure, in some cases, testing results indicate that
when the nails or screws penetrate the low-grade/low-density core lumber, a statistically significant
difference is obtained between hybrid and conventional layups. However, in other cases, due to
damage in the face layer or in the connection, force-displacement results for conventional and
hybrid CLT layups were not statistically significant.
