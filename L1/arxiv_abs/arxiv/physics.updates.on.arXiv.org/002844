Holm (ASR, 2018) claims that Scafetta (ASR 57, 2121-2135, 2016) is "irreproducible" because I would
have left "undocumented" the values of two parameters (a reduced-rank index p and a regularization
term) that he claimed to be requested in the Magnitude Squared Coherence Canonical Correlation
Analysis (MSC-CCA). Yet, my analysis did not require such two parameters. In fact: 1) using the MSC-CCA
reduced-rank option neither changes the result nor was needed since Scafetta (2016) statistically
evaluated the significance of the coherence spectral peaks; 2) the analysis algorithm neither
contains nor needed the regularization term. Herein, I show that Holm could not replicate Scafetta
(2016) because he used different analysis algorithms. In fact, although Holm claimed to be using
MSC-CCA, for his figures 2-4 he used a MatLab code labeled "gcs_cca_1D.m" (see paragraph 2 of his
Section 3), which Holm also modified, that implements a different methodology known as the Generalized
Coherence Spectrum using the Canonical Correlation Analysis (GCS-CCA). This code is herein demonstrated
to be unreliable under specific statistical circumstances such as those required to replicate
Scafetta (2016). On the contrary, the MSC-CCA method is stable and reliable. Moreover, Holm could
not replicate my result also in his figure 5 because there he used the basic Welch MSC algorithm by
erroneously equating it to MSC-CCA. Herein I clarify step-by-step how to proceed with the correct
analysis, and I fully confirm the 95% significance of my results. I add data and codes to easily replicate
my results.
