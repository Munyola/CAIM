The interaction of water with $\alpha$-alumina (i.e. $\alpha$-Al$_{2}$O$_{3}$ surfaces is important
in a variety of applications and a useful model for the interaction of water with environmentally
abundant aluminosilicate phases. Despite its significance, studies of water interaction with
$\alpha$-Al$_{2}$O$_{3}$ surfaces other than the $(0001)$ are extremely limited. Here we characterize
the interaction of water (D$_{2}$O) with a well defined $\alpha$-Al$_{2}$O$_{3}$$(1\bar{1}02)$
surface in UHV both experimentally, using temperature programmed desorption and surface-specific
vibrational spectroscopy, and theoretically, using periodic-slab density functional theory
calculations. This combined approach makes it possible to demonstrate that water adsorption occurs
only at a single well defined surface site (the so-called 1-4 configuration) and that at this site
the barrier between the molecularly and dissociatively adsorbed forms is very low: 0.06 eV. A subset
of OD stretch vibrations are parallel to this dissociation coordinate, and thus would be expected
to be shifted to low frequencies relative to an uncoupled harmonic oscillator. To quantify this
effect we solve the vibrational Schr\"odinger equation along the dissociation coordinate and
find fundamental frequencies red-shifted by more than 1,500 cm$^{\text{-1}}$. Within the context
of this model, at moderate temperatures, we further find that some fraction of surface deuterons
are likely delocalized: dissociatively and molecularly absorbed states are no longer distinguishable.
