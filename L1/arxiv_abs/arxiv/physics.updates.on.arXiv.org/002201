Null collapse is an implosive process whereby MHD waves focus their energy in the vicinity of a null
point, forming a current sheet and initiating magnetic reconnection. We consider, for the first
time, the case of collapsing 3D magnetic null points in nonlinear, resistive MHD using numerical
simulation, exploring key physical aspects of the system as well as performing a detailed parameter
study. We find that within a particular plane containing the 3D null, the plasma and current density
enhancements resulting from the collapse are quantitatively and qualitatively as per the 2D case
in both the linear and nonlinear collapse regimes. However, the scaling with resistivity of the
3D reconnection rate - which is a global quantity - is found to be less favourable when the magnetic
null point is more rotationally symmetric, due to the action of increased magnetic back-pressure.
Furthermore, we find that with increasing ambient plasma pressure the collapse can be throttled,
as is the case for 2D nulls. We discuss this pressure-limiting in the context of fast reconnection
in the solar atmosphere and suggest mechanisms by which it may be overcome. We also discuss the implications
of the results in the context of null collapse as a trigger mechanism of Oscillatory Reconnection,
a time-dependent reconnection mechanism, and also within the wider subject of wave-null point
interactions. We conclude that, in general, increasingly rotationally-asymmetric nulls will
be more favourable in terms of magnetic energy release via null collapse than their more symmetric
counterparts.
