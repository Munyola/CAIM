The functions of RNA pseudoknots (PKs), which are minimal tertiary structural motifs and an integral
part of several ribozymes and ribonucleoprotein complexes, are determined by their structure,
stability and dynamics. Therefore, it is important to elucidate the general principles governing
their thermodynamics/folding mechanisms. Here, we combine experiments and simulations to examine
the folding/unfolding pathways of the VPK pseudoknot, a variant of the Mouse Mammary Tumor Virus
(MMTV) PK involved in ribosomal frameshifting. Fluorescent nucleotide analogs (2-aminopurine
and pyrrolocytidine) placed at different stem/loop positions in the PK, and laser temperature-jump
approaches serve as local probes allowing us to monitor the order of assembly of VPK with two helices
with different intrinsic stabilities. The experiments and molecular simulations show that at
50 mM KCl the dominant folding pathway populates only the more stable partially folded hairpin.
As the salt concentration is increased a parallel folding pathway emerges, involving the less stable
hairpin structure as an alternate intermediate. Notably, the flux between the pathways is modulated
by the ionic strength. The findings support the principle that the order of PK structure formation
is determined by the relative stabilities of the hairpins, which can be altered by sequence variations
or salt concentrations. Our study not only unambiguously demonstrates that PK folds by parallel
pathways, but also establishes that quantitative description of RNA self-assembly requires a
synergistic combination of experiments and simulations.
