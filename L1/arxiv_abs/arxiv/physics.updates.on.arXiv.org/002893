For several years, attempts have been made to interface Geant4 and other software packages with
the aim of simulating the complete response of a gaseous particle detector. The present paper illustrates
different possibilities to interface Geant4 with two such packages, Garfield++ and Degrad. The
basic idea is to use the Geant4 physics parameterization feature and to implement a Garfield++ or
Degrad based detector simulation as an external model. With the Geant4/Degrad interface, detailed
simulations of the X-ray interaction in gaseous detectors, including shell absorption by photoelectric
effect, subsequent Auger shake-off, and fluorescence emission, become possible. The Geant4/Garfield++
interface can be used for photons and charged particles of all kinetic energies. Depending on the
particular physics case, either the Geant4 PAI model, the Heed PAI model or both Geant4 and Heed are
responsible for primary ionization and the production of the conduction electrons. For the case
in which the Geant4 PAI model is used in conjunction with the Heed PAI model, a more detailed analysis
is performed. Parameters, such as the lower production cut of the PAI model and the lowest electron
energy limit of the physics list have to be set correctly. The paper demonstrates how to determine
these parameters with the help of the W value and Fano factor of the gas mixture. The simulation results
of this Geant4/Heed PAI model interface are then verified against the results obtained with the
standalone software packages.
