We present a novel approach and a theoretical framework for generating high order exceptional points
of degeneracy (EPD) in photonic structures based on periodic coupled resonators optical waveguides
(CROWs). Such EPDs involve the coalescence of Floquet-Bloch eigenwaves in CROWs, without the presence
of gain and loss, which is in contrast to the requirement of Parity-Time (PT) symmetry to develop
exceptional points based on gain and loss balance. The EPDs arise here by introducing symmetry breaking
in a conventional chain of coupled resonators through coupling the chain of resonators to an adjacent
uniform optical waveguide, which leads to unique modal characteristics that cannot be realized
in conventional CROWs. Such remarkable characteristics include high quality factors (Q-factor)
and strong field enhancement, even without any mirrors at the two ends of a cavity. We show for the
first time the capability of CROWs to exhibit EPDs of various order; including the degenerate band
edge (DBE) and the stationary inflection point (SIP). The proposed CROW of finite length shows enhanced
quality factor when operating near the DBE, and the Q-factor exhibits an anomalous scaling with
the CROW's length. We develop the theory of EPDs in such unconventional CROW using coupled-wave
equations, and we derive an analytical expression for the dispersion relation. The proposed unconventional
CROW concepts have various potential applications including Q-switching, nonlinear devices,
lasers, and extremely sensitive sensors.
