Materials science is undergoing profound changes due to advances in characterization instrumentation
that have resulted in an explosion of data in terms of volume, velocity, variety and complexity.
Harnessing these data for scientific research requires an evolution of the associated computing
and data infrastructure, bridging scientific instrumentation with super- and cloud- computing.
Here, we describe Universal Spectroscopy and Imaging Data (USID), a data model capable of representing
data from most common instruments, modalities, dimensionalities, and sizes. We pair this schema
with the hierarchical data file format (HDF5) to maximize compatibility, exchangeability, traceability,
and reproducibility. We discuss a family of community-driven, open-source, and free python software
packages for storing, processing and visualizing data. The first is pyUSID which provides the tools
to read and write USID HDF5 files in addition to a scalable framework for parallelizing data analysis.
The second is Pycroscopy, which provides algorithms for scientific analysis of nanoscale imaging
and spectroscopy modalities and is built on top of pyUSID and USID. The instrument-agnostic nature
of USID facilitates the development of analysis code independent of instrumentation and task in
Pycroscopy which in turn can bring scientific communities together and break down barriers in the
age of open-science. The interested reader is encouraged to be a part of this ongoing community-driven
effort to collectively accelerate materials research and discovery through the realms of big data.
