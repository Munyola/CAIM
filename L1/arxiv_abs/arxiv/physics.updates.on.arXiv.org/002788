We develop a new statistically driven method for analyzing the modeling of geophysical flows. Many
models have been advocated by different modelers for such flows incorporating different modeling
assumptions. Limited and sparse observational data on the modeled phenomena usually does not permit
a clean discrimination among models for fitness of purpose, and, heuristic choices are usually
made, especially for critical predictions of behavior that has not been experienced. We advocate
here a methodology for characterizing models and the modeling assumptions they represent using
a statistical approach over the full range of applicability of the models. Such a characterization
may then be used to decide the appropriateness of a model for use, and, perhaps as needed compositions
of models for better predictive power. We present our method by comparing three different models
arising from different rheology assumptions, and the data show unambiguously the performance
of the models across a wide range of possible flow regimes. This comparison is facilitated by the
recent development of the new release of our TITAN2D mass flow code that allows choice of multiple
rheologies The analysis of latent variables in the models is particularly illustrative of the impact
of modeling assumptions. Knowledge of which assumptions dominate, and, by how much, is illustrated
in two different case studies: a small scale inclined plane with a flat runway, and the large scale
topography on the SW slope of Volc\'{a}n de Colima (MX).
