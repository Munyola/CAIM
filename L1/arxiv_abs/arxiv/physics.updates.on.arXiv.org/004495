We took benefit from Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) in the force spectroscopy mode to describe the
time evolution-over 24h-of the surface nanotopography and mechanical properties of the strain
Staphylococcus aureus 27217 from bacterial adhesion to the first stage of biofilm genesis. In addition,
Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) experiments allowed
identifying two types of self-adhering subpopulations (the so-called 'bald' and 'hairy' cells)
and revealed changes in their relative populations with the bacterial culture age and the protocol
of preparation. We indeed observed a dramatic evanescing of the 'hairy' subpopulation for samples
that underwent centrifugation and resuspension processes. When examined by AFM, the 'hairy' cell
surface resembled to a herringbone structure characterized by upper structural units with lateral
dimensions of ~70 nm and a high Young's modulus value (~ 2.3 MPa), a mean depth of the trough between
them of ~15nm and a resulting roughness of ~5nm. By contrast, the 'bald' cells appeared much softer
(~ 0.35 MPa) with a roughness one order of magnitude lower. We observed too the gradual detachment
of the herringbone patterns from the 'hairy' bacterial envelope of cell harvested from a 16h old
culture and their progressive accumulation between the bacteria in the form of globular clusters.
The secretion of a soft extracellular polymeric substance was also identified that, in addition
to the globular clusters, may contribute to the initiation of the biofilm spatial organization.
