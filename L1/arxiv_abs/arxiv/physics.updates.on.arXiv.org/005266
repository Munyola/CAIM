Transitions between different conformational states are ubiquitous in proteins, being involved
in signaling, catalysis and other fundamental activities in cells. However, modeling those processes
is extremely difficult, due to the need of efficiently exploring a vast conformational space in
order to seek for the actual transition path for systems whose complexity is already high in the steady
states. Here we report a strategy that simplifies this task attacking the complexity on several
sides. We first apply a minimalist coarse-grained model to Calmodulin, based on an empirical force
field with a partial structural bias, to explore the transition paths between the apo-closed state
and the Ca-bound open state of the protein. We then select representative structures along the trajectory
based on a structural clustering algorithm and build a cleaned-up trajectory with them. We finally
compare this trajectory with that produced by the online tool MinActionPath, by minimizing the
action integral using a harmonic network model, and with that obtained by the PROMPT morphing method,
based on an optimal mass transportation-type approach including physical constraints. The comparison
is performed both on the structural and energetic level, using the coarse-grained and the atomistic
force fields upon reconstruction. Our analysis indicates that this method returns trajectories
capable of exploring intermediate states with physical meaning, retaining a very low computational
cost, which can allow systematic and extensive exploration of the multi-stable proteins transition
pathways.
