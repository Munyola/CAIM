High-quality flat optical elements require efficient light deflection to large angles and over
a wide wavelength spectrum. Although phase gradient metasurfaces achieve this by continuously
adding phase shifts in the range of 0 to 2{\pi} to the electric field with subwavelength-sized scatterers,
their performance is limited by the spatial resolution of phase modulation at the interface. Here,
we introduce a new class of metasurfaces based on a general formulation, where the phase shifts cover
less than the full 0-2{\pi} range, offering significant advantages. More specifically, this approach
allows the realization of metasurfaces with more compact and less mutually-interacting scatterers,
thus more precise phase modulation, and advances the performance limits of metasurfaces to domains
significantly beyond those of the full coverage phase gradient approach. Applying this concept
to both plasmonic and dielectric surfaces, we demonstrate large phase gradients resulting in high-numerical-aperture
immersion metalenses (NA=1.4) with near diffraction-limited resolution (~0.32{\lambda}) at
visible wavelengths. Our concept enables added functionalities such as a broadband performance
and wavelength de-multiplexing on a single layer, surpassing the theoretical cross-polarization
transmission efficiency limit for single-layer plasmonic metasurfaces, and yields 67% efficiency
for dielectric metasurfaces. This work paves the way toward realizing high-resolution flat optical
elements and efficient plasmonic metadevices.
