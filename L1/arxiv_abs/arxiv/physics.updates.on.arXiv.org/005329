Purpose: Cell size is a fundamental characteristic of all tissues, and changes in cell size in cancer
reflect tumor status and response to treatments, such as apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. Unfortunately,
cell size can only be obtained by pathologic evaluation of the tumor in the current standard of care.
Previous imaging approaches can be implemented on only animal MRI scanners or require relatively
long acquisition times that are undesirable for clinical imaging. There is a need to develop cell
size imaging for clinics. Experimental Design: We propose a new method, IMPULSED (Imaging Microstructural
Parameters Using Limited Spectrally Edited Diffusion) that can characterize mean cell sizes in
solid tumors. We report the use of combined sequences with different gradient waveforms on human
MRI and analytical equations that link DWI signals of real gradient waveforms and specific microstructural
parameters such as cell size. We also describe comprehensive validations using computer simulations,
cell experiments in vitro, and animal experiments in vivo and finally demonstrate applications
in pre-operative breast cancer patients. Results: With fast acquisitions (~ 7 mins), IMPULSED
can provide high-resolution (1.3 mm in-plane) mapping of mean cell size of human tumors in vivo on
currently-available 3T MRI scanners. All validations suggest IMPULSED provide accurate and reliable
measurements of mean cell size. Conclusion: The proposed IMPULSED method can assess cell size variations
in the tumor of breast cancer patients, which may have the potential to assess early response to neoadjuvant
therapy.
