When a vortex refracts surface waves, the momentum flux carried by the waves changes direction and
the waves induce a reaction force on the vortex. We study experimentally the resulting vortex distortion.
Incoming surface gravity waves impinge on a steady vortex of velocity $U_0$ driven magneto-hydrodynamically
at the bottom of a fluid layer. The waves induce a shift of the vortex center in the direction transverse
to wave propagation, together with a decrease in surface vorticity. We interpret these two phenomena
in the framework introduced by Craik and Leibovich (1976): we identify the dimensionless Stokes
drift $S=U_s/U_0$ as the relevant control parameter, $U_s$ being the Stokes drift velocity of the
waves. We propose a simple vortex line model which indicates that the shift of the vortex center originates
from a balance between vorticity advection by the Stokes drift and self-advection of the vortex.
The decrease in surface vorticity is interpreted as a consequence of vorticity expulsion by the
fast Stokes drift, which confines it at depth. This purely hydrodynamic process is analogous to
the magnetohydrodynamic expulsion of magnetic field by a rapidly moving conductor through the
electromagnetic skin effect. We study vorticity expulsion in the limit of fast Stokes drift and
deduce that the surface vorticity decreases as $1/S$, a prediction which is compatible with the
experimental data. Such wave-induced vortex distortions have important consequences for the
nonlinear regime of wave refraction: the refraction angle rapidly decreases with wave intensity.
