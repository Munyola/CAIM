To date, the simulation of organ deformations for applications like therapy planning or image-guided
interventions is calculated by solving the elastodynamics equations. While efficient solvers
have been proposed for fast simulations, methods that are both real-time and accurate are still
an open challenge. An ideal, interactive solver would be able to provide physically and numerically
accurate results at high frame rate, which requires efficient force computation and time integration.
Towards this goal, we explore in this paper for the first time the use of neural networks to directly
learn the underlying biomechanics. Given a 3D mesh of a soft tissue segmented from medical images,
we train a neural network to predict vertex-wise accelerations for a large time step based on the
current state of the system. The model is trained using the deformation of a bar under torsion, and
evaluated on different motions, geometries, and hyperelastic material models. For predictions
of ten times the original time step we observed a mean error of 0.017mm $\pm$ 0.014 (0.032) at a mesh
size of 50mm x 50mm x 100mm. Predictions at 20dt yield an error of 2.10mm $\pm$ 1.73 (4.37) and by further
increasing the prediction time step the maximum error rises to 38.3mm due to an artificial stiffening.
In all experiments our proposed method stayed stable, while the reference solver fails to converge.
Our experiments suggest that it is possible to directly learn the mechanical simulation and open
further investigations for the direct application of machine learning to speed-up biophysics
solvers.
