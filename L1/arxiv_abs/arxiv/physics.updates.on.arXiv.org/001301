Presented here are observations that demonstrate how the deformation of millimetric cavitation
bubbles by a uniform pressure gradient quenches single collapse luminescence. Our innovative
measurement system captures a broad luminescence spectrum (wavelength range 300-900 nm) from
the individual collapses of laser-induced bubbles in water. By varying the bubble size, driving
pressure and the perceived gravity level aboard parabolic flights, we probed the limit from aspherical
to highly spherical bubble collapses. Luminescence was detected for bubbles of maximum radii within
the previously uncovered range $R_{0}$ =1.5-6 mm for laser-induced bubbles. The relative luminescence
energy was found to rapidly decrease as a function of bubble asymmetry quantified by the anisotropy
parameter $\zeta$, which is the dimensionless equivalent of the Kelvin impulse. As established
previously, $\zeta$ also dictates the characteristic parameters of bubble-driven microjets.
The threshold of $\zeta$ beyond which no luminescence is observed in our experiment closely coincides
with the threshold where the microjets visibly pierce the bubble and drive a vapor-jet during the
rebound. The individual fitted blackbody temperatures range between $T_{\rm lum}$=7000 and 11500
K but do not show any clear trend as a function of $\zeta$. Time-resolved measurements using a high-speed
photodetector disclose multiple luminescence events at each bubble collapse. The averaged full
width at half maximum of the pulse is found to scale with $R_{0}$ and to range between 10-20 ns.
