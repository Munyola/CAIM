Encouraged by recent studies on the performance of tidal turbine arrays, we extend the classical
momentum actuator disc theory to include the free surface effects and allow the vertical arrangement
of turbines. Most existing literatures concern one dimensional arrays with single turbine in the
vertical direction, while the arrays in this work are two dimensional (with turbines in both the
vertical and lateral directions) and also partially block the channel which width is far larger
than height. The vertical mixing of array scale flow is assumed to take place much faster than lateral
one. This assumption has been verified by numerical simulations. Fixing the total turbine area
and utilized width, the comparison between two-dimensional and traditional one-dimensional
arrays is investigated. The results suggest that the two dimensional arrangements of smaller turbines
are preferred to one dimensional arrays from both the power coefficient and efficiency perspectives.
When channel dynamics are considered, the power increase would be partly offset according to the
parameters of the channel but the optimal arrangement is unchangeable. Furthermore, we consider
how to arrange finite number of turbines in a channel. It is shown that an optimal distribution of
turbines in two directions is found. Finally, the scenario of arranging turbines in infinite flow,
which is the limiting condition of small blockages, is analysed. A new maximum power coefficient
0.869 occurs when $Fr=0.2$, greatly increasing the peak power compared with existing results.
