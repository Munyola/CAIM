A quantum description of a chemical reaction requires the knowledge of an accurate potential energy
surface. For typical reactive systems of three atoms or more, such potential energy surfaces are
constructed by computing the potential energy at thousands of points in the configuration space
and fitting the computed points by an analytical function or a neural network. Computing and fitting
the potential energy points is a very laborious and time-consuming task. Here, we demonstrate that
accurate potential energy surfaces for quantum reactive scattering calculations can be obtained
with a very small number of potential energy points and without analytical fits. We show that accurate
results for the reaction probabilities in a wide range of energies can be obtained with only 30 ab
initio points for the three-dimensional H + H$_2$ $\rightarrow$ H$_2$ + H reaction and 290 ab inito
points for the six-dimensional OH + H$_2$ $\rightarrow$ H$_2$O + H reaction. To obtain these results,
we represent the scattering observables and the potential surfaces by Gaussian Processes, which
are trained by the results of rigorous quantum scattering calculations and optimized by means of
Bayesian optimization producing and trying hundreds of surfaces. In this approach, the construction
of the surfaces is completely automated. This work demonstrates that a combination of machine learning
with quantum dynamics calculations allows one to ask new questions, such as: What is the least number
of {\it ab initio} points sufficient to describe quantum dynamics of polyatomic systems with desired
accuracy?
