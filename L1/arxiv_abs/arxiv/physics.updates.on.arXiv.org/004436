Key to collective cell migration is the ability for cells to rearrange their position with respect
to their neighbors. One factor identified by experiments to affect cell rearrangement is the number
density of cells in the monolayer. This experimental observation contrasts with recent theoretical
models, which suggest that changes in cellular rearrangements result from cell forces rather than
number density. The theory demonstrated that rearrangements and forces are related through cell
shape, with cells having more elongated shapes and greater perimeters more easily sliding past
their neighbors within the cell layer. Though it is thought that cell perimeter is affected primarily
by adhesion and cortical tension at cell's periphery, experimental testing of this hypothesis
has produced conflicting results. Here we studied collective migration in an epithelial monolayer
by measuring cell forces, perimeters, and motion, and found all three to decrease with either increased
density or inhibition of cell contraction. In contrast to previous understanding, the data suggest
that cell shape and rearrangements are driven neither by density nor by forces at the cell periphery
but rather by tractions at the cell-substrate interface. This observation is confirmed by an experiment
that shows increasing tractions reverses the effect of density on cell shape and rearrangements.
These findings reconcile observations of experiments and theory and establish cell-substrate
traction, rather than cell-cell force, as a dominant physical factor controlling shape and motion
in collective cell migration.
