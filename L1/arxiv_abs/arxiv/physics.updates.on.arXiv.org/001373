Numerous molecular systems, including solutions, proteins, and composite materials, can be modeled
using mixed-resolution representations, of which the quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics
(QM/MM) approach has become the most widely used. However, the QM/MM approach often faces a number
of challenges, including the slow sampling of the large configuration space for the MM part, the
high cost of repetitive QM computations for changing coordinates of atoms in the MM surroundings,
and a difficulty in providing a simple, qualitative interpretation of numerical results in terms
of the influence of the molecular environment upon the active QM region. In this paper, we address
these issues by combining QM/MM modeling with the methodology of "bottom-up" coarse-graining
(CG) to provide the theoretical basis for a systematic quantum-mechanical/coarse-grained molecular
mechanics (QM/CG-MM) mixed resolution approach. A derivation of the method is presented based
on a combination of statistical mechanics and quantum mechanics, leading to an equation for the
effective Hamiltonian of the QM part, a central concept in the QM/CG-MM theory. A detailed analysis
of different contributions to the effective Hamiltonian from electrostatic, induction, dispersion
and exchange interactions between the QM part and the surroundings is provided, serving as a foundation
for a potential hierarchy of QM/CG-MM methods varying in their accuracy and computational cost.
A relationship of the QM/CG-MM methodology to other mixed resolution approaches is also discussed.
