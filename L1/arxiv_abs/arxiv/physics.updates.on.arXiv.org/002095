The first purpose of this short but striking paper is to revisit Elasticity (EL) and Electromagnetism
(EM) by comparing the structure of these two theories and examining with details their well known
couplings, in particular piezoelectricity and photoelasticity. Despite the strange Helmholtz
and Mach-Lippmann analogies existing between them, no classical technique may provide a common
setting. However, unexpected arguments discovered independently by the brothers E. and F. Cosserat
in 1909 for EL and by H. Weyl in 1918 for EM are leading to construct a new differential sequence called
Spencer sequence in the framework of the formal theory of Lie pseudogroups and to introduce it for
the conformal group of space-time with 15 parameters. Then, all the previous explicit couplings
can be deduced abstractly and one must just go to a laboratory in order to know about the coupling constants
on which they are depending, like in the Hooke or Minkowski constitutive relations existing respectively
in EL or EM separately. We finally provide a new combined experimental and theoretical proof of the
fact that any 1-form with value in the second order jets (elations) of the conformal group of space-time
can be uniquely decomposed into the direct sum of the Ricci tensor R and the electromagnetic field
F. This result questions the mathematical foundations of both General Relativity (GR) and Gauge
Theory (GT). In particular, the Einstein operator (6 terms) must be thus replaced by the formal adjoint
of the Ricci operator (4 terms only) in the study of gravitational waves.
