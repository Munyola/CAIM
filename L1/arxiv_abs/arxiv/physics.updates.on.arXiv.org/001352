Over the last years, machine learning tools have been successfully applied to a wealth of problems
in high-energy physics. A typical example is the classification of physics objects. Supervised
machine learning methods allow for significant improvements in classification problems by taking
into account observable correlations and by learning the optimal selection from examples, e.g.
from Monte Carlo simulations. Even more promising is the usage of deep learning techniques. Methods
like deep convolutional networks might be able to catch features from low-level parameters that
are not exploited by default cut-based methods. These ideas could be particularly beneficial for
measurements in heavy-ion collisions, because of the very large multiplicities. Indeed, machine
learning methods potentially perform much better in systems with a large number of degrees of freedom
compared to cut-based methods. Moreover, many key heavy-ion observables are most interesting
at low transverse momentum where the underlying event is dominant and the signal-to-noise ratio
is quite low. In this work, recent developments of machine- and deep learning applications in heavy-ion
collisions with ALICE will be presented, with focus on a deep learning-based b-jet tagging approach
and the measurement of low-mass dielectrons. While the b-jet tagger is based on a mixture of shallow
fully-connected and deep convolutional networks, the low-mass dielectron measurement uses gradient
boosting and shallow neural networks. Both methods are very promising compared to default cut-based
methods.
