I present estimates to justify previously proposed Dipole Dynamical Model (DDM) of Ball Lightning
(BL). The movement and energy supplying to the dipole BL are due to the atmospheric electric field.
Crucial for the detailed analysis of BL is using the new relation of balance of the force of atmospheric
electric field and forces within BL dipole as the first necessary condition for the existance of
BL as an integer. This model is unique because, unlike existing static models, fundamental condition
for the existence of Ball Lightning is its forward motion. The virial theorem limiting BL power does
not apply to BL which is not closed system like the Sun or Galaxy systems and is strongly dependent
part of the infinitely extended in time and space large system. Stability of BL is due to the fundamental
role of thermodynamic non-equilibrium, ionization, recombination and translational movement
with energy loss by radiation and also excess volumetric positive charge. Polarization degree
of BL plasma is characterized by polarizability factor {\gamma}. An example is presented of calculating
the stability of option BL. There is also a possible connection of stability BL with statistical
distributions of the atmospheric electric field in time and space. Destruction of BL can also occur
due to arising kinematical instability at its accelerating (or decelerating) movement. Maximal
energy density in BL DDM does not exceed the value Espec<(10(8) - 10(9)) J/m(3). Resulting indefinitely
long BL lifetime is also discussed.
