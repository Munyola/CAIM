This paper describes the design and simulation of a proof-of-concept quasi-integrable octupole
lattice at the University of Maryland Electron Ring (UMER). This experiment tests the feasibility
of nonlinear integrable optics, a novel technique that is expected to mitigate resonant beam loss
and enable low-loss high-intensity beam transport in rings. Integrable lattices with large amplitude-dependent
tune spreads, created by nonlinear focusing elements, are proposed to damp beam response to resonant
driving perturbations while maintaining large dynamic aperture [Danilov and Nagaitsev PRSTAB
2010]. At UMER, a lattice with a single octupole insert is designed to test the predictions of this
theory. The planned experiment employs a low-current high-emittance beam with low space charge
tune shift (~0.005) to probe the dynamics of a lattice with large externally-induced tune spread.
Design studies show that a lattice composed of a 25-cm octupole insert and existing UMER optics can
induce a tune spread of \sim 0.13. Stable transport is observed in PIC simulation for many turns at
space charge tune spread 0.008. A maximum spread of dnu = 0.11 (RMS 0.015) is observed for modest octupole
strength (peak 50 T/m^3). A simplified model of the system explores beam sensitivity to steering
and focusing errors. Results suggest that control of orbit distortion to <0.2 mm within the insert
region is essential. However, we see only weak dependence on deviations of lattice phase advance
(<=0.1 rad.) from the invariant-conserving condition.
