Resonant properties of composite structures consisting of several identical resonant diffractive
structures (e.g. multilayer thin-film structures or guided-mode resonance gratings) separated
by phase-shift layers are investigated theoretically. Using the scattering matrix formalism,
we analytically demonstrate that, at properly chosen thicknesses of the phase-shift layers, the
composite structures comprising two or four resonant diffractive structures with a Lorentzian
transmittance profile optically implement the Butterworth filters of the order two or three, respectively,
and enable achieving flat-top transmission spectra with steep slopes and low sidebands. In addition,
we show that the composite structures consisting of three or four second-order Butterworth filters
can accurately approximate the fourth- or fifth-order Butterworth filters, respectively. The
presented theoretical results are confirmed by rigorous numerical simulations of composite structures
consisting of the so-called W-structures (simple three-layer resonant structures comprising
a high-index core layer and two low-index cladding layers in a high-index dielectric environment).
The simulation results confirm the formation of flat-top transmittance peaks, the shape of which
fully agrees with the derived theoretical description. Moreover, we demonstrate an exceptionally
simple mechanism of controlling the transmittance peak width, which consists in changing the thicknesses
of the cladding layers of the initial W-structure and enables generating flat-top transmission
peaks with a significantly subnanometer size.
