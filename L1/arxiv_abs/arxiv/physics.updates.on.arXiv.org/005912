Vibrational branching ratios in the B$^2\Sigma^+$ -- X$^2\Sigma^+$ and A$^2\Pi$ -- X$^2\Sigma^+$
optical-cycling transitions of BaH molecules are investigated using measurements and {\it ab
initio} calculations. The experimental values are determined using fluorescence and absorption
detection. The observed branching ratios have a very sensitive dependence on the difference in
the equilibrium bond length between the excited and ground state, $\Delta r_e$: a 1 pm (.5\%) displacement
can have a 25\% effect on the branching ratios but only a 1\% effect on the lifetime. The measurements
are combined with theoretical calculations to reveal a preference for a particular set of published
spectroscopic values for the B$^2\Sigma^+$ state ($\Delta r_e^{B-X}$ = +5.733 pm), while a larger
bond-length difference ($\Delta r_e^{B-X} = 6.3-6.7$ pm) would match the branching-ratio data
even better. By contrast, the observed branching ratio for the A$^2\Pi_{3/2}$ -- X$^2\Sigma^+$
transition is in excellent agreement with both the {\it ab initio} result and the spectroscopically
measured bond lengths. This shows that care must be taken when estimating branching ratios for molecular
laser cooling candidates, as small errors in bond-length measurements can have outsize effects
on the suitability for laser cooling. Additionally, our calculations agree more closely with experimental
values of the B$^2\Sigma^+$ state lifetime and spin-rotation constant, and revise the predicted
lifetime of the H$^2\Delta$ state to 9.5 $\mu$s.
