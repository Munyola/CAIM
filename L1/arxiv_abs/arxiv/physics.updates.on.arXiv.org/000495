The spring-mass system studied in undergraduate physics laboratories may exhibit complex dynamics
due to the simultaneous action of gravitational and elastic forces in addition to air friction.
In the first part of this paper, we describe a laboratory experiment aimed at beginner students which
also gives those with a more advanced background an opportunity to explore more complex aspects
of the motions involved. If students are not given predefined apparatus but are allowed instead
to design their own set-up for the experiment, they may also learn something about the thought processes
and experimental procedures used in physics. In the second part of this paper, we present a systematic
study of the parametric behavior of the system because teachers have to master its dynamics. The
non-linear interaction between the vertical and the pendular oscillations in a vertical spring-mass
system depends on the ratio between the frequencies of the two motions and on the motion's excitation.
Systematic experimental investigations, coupled with relevant simulations, highlight the many
aspects of physics involved in the partition of energy transfer between the two modes. The different
motion waveforms obtained by sweeping through the resonance curve and by applying small and strong
excitations are presented and analyzed. The influence of the unavoidable spurious motions is investigated.
An analogy between the parametric interaction in a spring--mass system and that found during frequency
conversion in non-linear optical crystals is discussed.
