The inner-shell correlation contributions to the total atomization energies (TAEs) of the W4-17
computational thermochemistry benchmark have been determined at the CCSD(T) level near the basis
set limit using several families of core correlation basis sets, such as aug-cc-pCVnZ (n=3-6),
aug-cc-pwCVnZ (n=3-5), and nZaPa-CV (n=3-5). The three families of basis sets agree very well with
each other (0.01 kcal/mol RMS) when extrapolating from the two largest available basis sets: however,
there are considerable differences in convergence behavior for the smaller basis sets. nZaPa-CV
is superior for the core-core term and awCVnZ for the core-valence term. While the aug-cc-pwCV(T+d)Z
basis set of Yockel and Wilson is superior to aug-cc-pwCVTZ, further extension of this family proved
unproductive. The best compromise between accuracy and computational cost, in the context of high-accuracy
computational thermochemistry methods such as W4 theory, is CCSD(T)/awCV{T,Q}Z, where the {T,Q}
notation stands for extrapolation from the awCVTZ and awCVQZ basis set pair. For lower-cost calculations,
a previously proposed combination of CCSD-F12b/cc-pCVTZ-F12 and CCSD(T)/pwCVTZ(no f) appears
to 'give the best bang for the buck'. While core-valence correlation accounts for the lion's share
of the inner shell contribution in first-row molecules, for second-row molecules core-core contributions
may become important, particularly in systems like P4 and S4 with multiple adjacent second-row
atoms. The average absolute core-core/core-valence ratio is 0.08 for the first-row species in
W4-17, but 0.47 for the second-row subset.
