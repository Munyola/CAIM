Recent Magnetosphere Multiscale (MMS) observations found 238 high energy (> 40 keV) electron "leaking"
events in the the magnetosheath [Cohen et al., 2017]. While several sources have been proposed,
the dominant mechanism or origin of these particles is not well understood. We have analyzed MMS
locations during these these events and found that most of these electron leaking events were observed
close to the southern high-altitude cusp and associated boundaries, so these events may have a high-latitude
source. Here we present a new case study of observations of a MMS encounter of southern magnetospheric
cusp boundaries. In the magnetosheath side of the southern cusp, MMS observes both parallel streaming
energetic ions, as well as a population with 90 degree pitch angles. Subsequently, MMS detects plasma
flows and magnetic field rotation consistent with magnetic reconnection (operating above and
dawn-ward of the MMS spacecraft), finally entering a depressed magnetic field region with nearly
stagnant flow. The depressed field region is occupied by high-fluxes of trapped high-energy electrons
and protons, which resemble the Cluster observations of cusp diamagnetic cavities at the northern
hemisphere [Nykyri et al., 2011a]. However, the local magnetic field geometry during the prevailing
IMF orientation is not favorable for magnetic reconnection to directly create a cavity in this location.
We show that the plasma flows that were observed prior to cavity observation satisfy the onset condition
for the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability for 50 percent of all available k-vector directions.
