A megathrust subduction earthquake (Mw7.8) struck the coast of Ecuador on April 16th, 2016 at 23h58
UTC. This earthquake is one of the best-recorded megathrust events up to date. Besides the mainshock,
two large aftershocks have been recorded on May 18th, 2016, at 7h57 (Mw 6.7) and 16h46 (Mw6.9). These
data make a significant contribution for understanding the attenuation of ground motions in Ecuador.
Peak ground accelerations and spectral accelerations are compared with four ground-motion prediction
equations developed for interface earthquakes, the global Abrahamson et al. (2016) model, the
Japanese equations Zhao et al. (2006) and Ghofrani and Atkinson (2014), and one Chilean equation
Montalva et al. (2016). The four tested GMPEs are providing rather close predictions for the mainshock
at distances up to 200km. However, our results show that high-frequency attenuation is greater
for backarc sites, thus Zetal2016 and Metal2016, which are not taking into account this difference,
are not considered further. Residual analyses show that G&A14 and Aetal2016 are well predicting
the attenuation of ground motions for the mainshock. Comparisons of aftershock observations with
Aetal2016 predictions indicate that the GMPE provide reasonable fit to the attenuation rates observed.
The event terms of the Mw6.7 and Mw6.9 events are positive but within the expected scatter from worldwide
similar earthquakes. The intra-event standard deviations are higher than the intraevent variability
of the model, which is partly related to the poorly constrained VS30 proxys.
