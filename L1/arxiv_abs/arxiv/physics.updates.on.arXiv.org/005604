It is widely believed that water and complex organic molecules (COMs) first form in the ice mantle
of dust grains and are subsequently returned into the gas due to grain heating by intense radiation
of protostars. Previous research on the desorption of molecules from the ice mantle assumed that
grains are at rest, which is contrary to the fact that grains are suprathermally rotating as a result
of their interaction with an anisotropic radiation or gas flow. Toward an era of precision astrochemistry,
the effect of grain rotation on surface chemistry must be quantified. In this paper, we study the
effect of suprathermal rotation of dust grains spun-up by radiative torques on the desorption of
molecules from icy grain mantles around protostars. We show that centrifugal potential energy
due to grain rotation reduces the potential barrier of molecules and significantly enhances their
desorption rate. We term this mechanism {\it rotational-thermal} or {\it ro-thermal} desorption.
We apply the ro-thermal mechanism for studying the desorption of molecules from icy grains which
are simultaneously heated to high temperatures and spun-up to suprathermal rotation by an intense
radiation of protostars. We find that ro-thermal desorption is much more efficient than thermal
desorption for molecules with high binding energy such as water and COMs. Our results have important
implications for understanding the origin of COMs detected in star-forming regions and call for
attention to the effect of suprathermal rotation of icy grains to use molecules as a tracer of physical
conditions of star-forming regions.
