Solar proton events (SPEs) cause large-scale ionization in the middle atmosphere leading to ozone
loss and changes in the energy budget of the middle atmosphere. The accurate implementation of SPEs
and other particle ionization sources in climate models is necessary to understand the role of energetic
particle precipitation (EPP) in climate variability. We use riometer observations from 16 riometer
stations and the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model with added D region ion chemistry (WACCM-D)
to study the spatial and temporal extent of cosmic noise absorption (CNA) during 62 solar proton
events from 2000 to 2005. We also present a correction method for the non-linear response of observed
CNA during intense absorption events. We find that WACCM-D can reproduce the observed CNA well with
some need for future improvement and testing of the used EPP forcing. The average absolute difference
between the model and the observations is found to be less than 0.5 dB poleward of about $66^\circ$
geomagnetic latitude, and increasing with decreasing latitude to about 1 dB equatorward of about
$66^\circ$ geomagnetic latitude. The differences are largest during twilight conditions where
the modeled changes in CNA are more abrupt compared to observations. An overestimation of about
$1^\circ$ to $3^\circ$ geomagnetic latitude in the extent of the CNA is observed due to the fixed
proton cutoff latitude in the model. An unexplained underestimation of CNA by the model during sunlit
conditions is observed at stations within the polar cap during 18 of the studied events.
