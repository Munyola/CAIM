Rock-scissors-paper game, as the simplest model of intransitive relation between competing agents,
is a frequently quoted model to explain the stable diversity of competitors in the race of surviving.
When increasing the number of competitors we may face a novel situation because beside the mentioned
unidirectional predator-prey-like dominance a balanced or peer relation can emerge between some
competitors. By utilizing this possibility in the present work we generalize a four-state predator-prey
type model where we establish two groups of species labeled by even and odd numbers. In particular,
we introduce different invasion probabilities between and within these groups, which results
in a tunable intensity of bidirectional invasion among peer species. Our study reveals an exceptional
richness of pattern formations where five quantitatively different phases are observed by varying
solely the strength of the mentioned inner invasion. The related transition points can be identified
with the help of appropriate order parameters based on the spatial autocorrelation decay, on the
fraction of empty sites, and on the variance of the species density. Furthermore, the application
of diverse, alliance-specific inner invasion rates for different groups may result in the extinction
of the pair of species where this inner invasion is moderate. These observations highlight that
beyond the well-known and intensively studied cyclic dominance there is an additional source of
complexity of pattern formation that has not been explored earlier.
