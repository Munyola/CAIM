FIFA World Cup is one of the most watched sporting event in the world and its popularity continue to
increase. While currently 32 teams participate in this event, starting with 2026 the number of participants
will increase to 48. As a result, FIFA proposed a major format change, the groups of 4 teams will be
replaced by groups of 3 teams, with the first two teams to qualify to the second round. In this paper,
we discuss the possibility of matches with limited importance (called non-competitive) for final
group standing for both 4-team and 3-team groups and we introduce our definitions of collusion and
dead rubber games. Next, we discuss scenarios in both 4-team and 3-team group formats that lead to
such matches. Finally, we make an analysis of all group stage matches from last six World Cup editions
(1998 to 2018), and we predict the most likely number of collusions and dead rubber games for the new
format of the World Cup. During our analysis we consider a variation of the proposed 3-group format
in which the order of matches for each group is predetermined. Our analysis show that this variation
has the potential of reducing significantly the number of both collusion and dead rubber matches
thus becoming an interesting option to be considered for adoption by FIFA. In conclusion, we recommend
FIFA to implement a predefined order of group matches prior to the drawing. The seeded team should
play the first match with the team that is second best (according to the drawing time FIFA Coca-Cola
rankings), as well as the second match from the group.
