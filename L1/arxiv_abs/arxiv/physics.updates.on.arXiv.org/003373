Most social network sites allow users to reshare a piece of information posted by a user. As time progresses,
the cascade of reshares grows, eventually saturating after a certain time period. While previous
studies have focused heavily on one aspect of the cascade phenomenon, specifically predicting
when the cascade would go viral, in this paper, we take a more holistic approach by analyzing the occurrence
of two events within the cascade lifecycle - the period of maximum growth in terms of surge in reshares
and the period where the cascade starts declining in adoption. We address the challenges in identifying
these periods and then proceed to make a comparative analysis of these periods from the perspective
of network topology. We study the effect of several node-centric structural measures on the reshare
responses using Granger causality which helps us quantify the significance of the network measures
and understand the extent to which the network topology impacts the growth dynamics. This evaluation
is performed on a dataset of 7407 cascades extracted from the Weibo social network. Using our causality
framework, we found that an entropy measure based on nodal degree causally affects the occurrence
of these events in 93.95% of cascades. Surprisingly, this outperformed clustering coefficient
and PageRank which we hypothesized would be more indicative of the growth dynamics based on earlier
studies. We also extend the Granger-causality Vector Autoregression (VAR) model to forecast the
times at which the events occur in the cascade lifecycle.
