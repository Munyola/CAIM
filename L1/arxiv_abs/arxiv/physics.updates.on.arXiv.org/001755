How to increase the power per turbine is crucial for the development of tidal energy as this decides
the performance and economics of turbines in the tidal array. In this work we combine the two-scale
partial array model and one-dimensional channel model to investigate the effects of blockage,
arrangement and channel-dynamics on tidal turbines. The power per turbine is deduced as the product
of two parameters, the power coefficient measuring the power acquired from instantaneous flow
and the environment coefficient showing the response of the channel to added drag. The results suggest
that channel-dynamics would decrease the predicted power and the optimal induction factor. The
model also shows that when we increase the number of turbines in a row, the power per turbine may monotonously
increase, decrease or get the maxima at certain global blockages. These different results depend
on two characteristic parameters of channels, $\alpha$ and $\lambda_D$. Furthermore, we find
that besides density (blockage), the arrangement should also be considered if we want to obtain
an efficient array. Appropriate arrangements can enhance the performance of turbines in tidal
channels although the beneficial effects would be partly offset by reduced velocities. The arrangement
also changes the optimal global blockage where power gets the maximum value. As the increase rate
of the power per turbine from arrays across the whole width to optimal partial arrays diminishes
with the increase of the blockage, the optimal global blockage would also decrease.
