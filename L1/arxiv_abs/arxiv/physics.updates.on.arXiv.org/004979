The accuracy and stability of implicit CFD codes is frequently impaired by the decoupling between
variables, which can ultimately lead to numerical divergence. Coupled solvers, which solve all
the governing equations simultaneously, have the potential to fix this problem. In this work, we
report the implementation of coupled-solvers for transient and steady-state electrically-driven
flow simulations in the finite-volumes framework. The numerical method, developed in OpenFOAM,
is generic for Newtonian and viscoelastic fluids, and is formulated for the Poisson-Nernst-Planck
and Poisson-Boltzmann models. The resulting coupled systems of equations are solved efficiently
with PETSc library. The performance of the coupled solvers is assessed in two test cases: induced-charge
electroosmosis of a Newtonian fluid around a cylinder; electroosmotic flow of a PTT viscoelastic
fluid in a contraction/expansion microchannel. The coupled solvers are more accurate in transient
simulations and also allow the use of larger time-steps without numerical divergence. For steady-state
simulations, the coupled solvers converge in less iterations than segregated solvers. Although
coupled solvers are much slower in a per time-step basis, the overall speedup factor obtained in
this study reached a maximum value of ~100, where the highest factors have been obtained with semi-coupled
solvers, which drop some coupling terms between equations. While further research is needed to
improve the efficiency of the matrix solving stage, coupled solvers are already superior to segregated
solvers in a number of cases.
