Turbulence remains an unsolved multidisciplinary science problem. As one of the most well-known
examples in turbulent flows, knowledge of the logarithmic mean velocity profile (MVP), so called
the log law of the wall, plays an important role everywhere turbulent flow meets the solid wall, such
as fluids in any kind of channels, skin friction of all types of transportations, the atmospheric
wind on a planetary ground, and the oceanic current on the seabed. However, the mechanism of how this
log-law MVP is formed under the multiscale nature of turbulent shears remains one of the greatest
interests of turbulence puzzles. To untangle the multiscale coupling of turbulent shear stresses,
we explore for a known fundamental tool in physics. Here we present how to reproduce the log-law MVP
with the even harmonic modes of fixed-end standing waves. We find that when these harmonic waves
of same magnitude are considered as the multiscale turbulent shear stresses, the wave envelope
of their superposition simulates the mean shear stress profile of the wall-bounded flow. It implies
that the log-law MVP is not expectedly related to the turbulent scales in the inertial subrange associated
with the Kolmogorov energy cascade, revealing the dissipative nature of all scales involved. The
MVP with reduced harmonic modes also shows promising connection to the understanding of flow transition
to turbulence. The finding here suggests the simple harmonic waves as good agents to help unravel
the complex turbulent dynamics in wall-bounded flow.
