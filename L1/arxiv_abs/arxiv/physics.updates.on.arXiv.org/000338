In planning for the Phase II upgrades of CMS and ATLAS major considerations are: 1)being able to deal
with degradation of tracking and calorimetry up to the radiation doses to be expected with an integrated
luminosity of 3000 $fb^{-1}$ and 2)maintaining physics performance at a pileup level of ~140. Here
I report on work started within the context of the CMS Forward Calorimetry Task Force and continuing
in an expanded CERN RD52 R$&$D program integrating timing (i.e. measuring the time-of-arrival
of physics objects) as a potential tool for pileup mitigation and ideas for Forward Calorimetry.
For the past 4 years our group has focused on precision timing at the level of 10-20 picoseconds in
an environment with rates of $~10^6-10^7$ Hz/$cm^2 $ as is appropriate for the future running of
the LHC (HL-LHC era). A time resolution of 10-20 picoseconds is one of the few clear criteria for pileup
mitigation at the LHC, since the interaction time of a bunch crossing has an rms of 170 picosec. While
work on charged particle timing in other contexts (i.e. ALICE R$&$D) is starting to approach
this precision, there have been essentially no technologies that can sustain performance at these
rates. I will present results on a tracker we developed within the DOE Advanced Detector R$&$D
program which is now meeting these requirements. I will also review some results from Calorimeter
Projects developed within our group (PHENIX EMCAL and ATLAS ZDC) which achieved calorimeter timing
precision< 100 picoseconds.
