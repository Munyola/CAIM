The Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook (BGK) model as well as its extensions (ellipsoidal statistical BGK,
Shakhov BGK, unified BGK) are used in particle-based fluid dynamics and compared with the Direct
Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method. To this end, different methods are investigated that allow
efficient sampling of the Shakhov and the unified target distribution functions. As a consequence,
particle simulations based on the Shakhov BGK and the unified BGK model are possible in an efficient
way. Furthermore, different energy conservation schemes are tested for the BGK models. It is shown
that the choice of the energy conservation scheme has a major impact on the quality of the results
for each model. The models are verified with a Couette flow problem at different Knudsen numbers
and wall velocities. Furthermore, the models are compared with DSMC results of a hypersonic flow
around a 70$^\circ$ blunted cone. It is shown that the unified BGK model is able to reproduce rarefied
gas phenomena. Furthermore, it is shown that the difference in the reproduction of shock structure
is not significant between the ellipsoidal statistical BGK and Shakhov BGK model for the flow around
a 70$^\circ$ blunted cone and significantly depends on the energy conservation method. The choice
of the energy conservation method is especially crucial for the Shakhov model whereas the ellipsoidal
statistical BGK model is much more robust concerning the energy conservation scheme. Additionally,
a computational time study is done to show the efficiency of BGK-based simulations for low Knudsen
number flows compared with DSMC.
