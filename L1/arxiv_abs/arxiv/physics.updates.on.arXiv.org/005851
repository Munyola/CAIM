Irreproducibility is a serious issue in thin film organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices, as smallest
local inhomogeneities can change the entire behaviour of identically built devices without showing
obvious failure. Inhomogeneities can occur at various steps of device preparation and appear in
all layers with different length scales and impact. The hole-transport interlayer (HTL) in OPV
devices blocks unwanted electron diffusion to the anode and corrects energetic mismatch between
oxide electrode and organic semiconductor. Most commonly used is commercial ink based on poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)
poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT PSS) colloidal particles. However, exactly these are suspected
to cause microscopic inhomogeneities, causing known irreproducibility of device characteristics.
Considering PEDOT:PSS acidity-caused electrode corrosion, it is questionable how much impact
colloids have on device homogeneity. In this report, we give proof that a colloidal HTL does not necessarily
cause device inhomogeneity and decreased efficiency, by comparing OPV devices with different
HTLs, namely from commercial PEDOT:PSS ink and from MoO3, obtained from two liquid precursors,
leading to quasi-continuous or colloidal layers. With a combination of X-ray diffraction, atomic
force and Kelvin probe microscopy, photoelectron and ambient air photoemission spectroscopy,
we discuss the layers properties from nano- to macroscale and demonstrate their impact upon implementation
into OPV devices, via spatially-resolved characterization.
