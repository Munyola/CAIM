Inhibiting ice accumulation on surfaces is an energy-intensive task and is of significant importance
in nature and technology where it has found applications in windshields, automobiles, aviation,
renewable energy generation, and infrastructure. Existing methods rely on on-site electrical
heat generation, chemicals, or mechanical removal, with drawbacks ranging from financial costs
to disruptive technical interventions and environmental incompatibility. Here we focus on applications
where surface transparency is desirable and propose metasurfaces with embedded plasmonically
enhanced light absorption heating, using ultra-thin hybrid metal-dielectric coatings, as a passive,
viable approach for de-icing and anti-icing, in which the sole heat source is renewable solar energy.
The balancing of transparency and absorption is achieved with rationally nano-engineered coatings
consisting of gold nanoparticle inclusions in a dielectric (titanium dioxide), concentrating
broadband absorbed solar energy into a small volume. This causes a > 10 {\deg}C temperature increase
with respect to ambient at the air-solid interface, where ice is most likely to form, delaying freezing,
reducing ice adhesion, when it occurs, to negligible levels (de-icing) and inhibiting frost formation
(anti-icing). Our results illustrate an effective unexplored pathway towards environmentally
compatible, solar-energy-driven icephobicity, enabled by respectively tailored plasmonic
metasurfaces, with the ability to design the balance of transparency and light absorption.
