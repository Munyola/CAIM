Correlation between tides and seismicity has puzzled geophysicists for more than one century.
Many studies have tested the hypothesis that lunisolar tides trigger earthquakes. Most of them
have been focused on regional data in geographical areas around Japan, Sumatra, Chile, Nepal, central
Europe and United States. On the West Coast of South America, where failure orientation (mainly
meridional) may favor the effects of tides on tectonic stresses, no in-depth regional studies are
yet performed. In this work, we report the results of the first systematic exploration of the correlation
between tides and seismic activity in northwestern areas of South America with a special focus in
Colombia. We analyse a large set of 167,000 events between 1993 and 2016, most of them in the Bucaramanga
and Cauca seismic nests. We implement a novel approach for the calculation of the tidal phases that
considers astronomical factors. Despite previous negative results, attributable to lower statistics
and an improper definition of the tidal phases, we find hints of a correlation anomaly between the
diurnal and monthly phase with the occurrence of intermediate depth events. Our results seem to
agree with earlier studies of moonquakes that demonstrated a correlation between deep events and
the monthly component of earth tides. This work opens the road for an in-depth and more geographically
broad analysis of tides and seismicity in South America. For that purpose, we introduce the tQuakes
public information system that allows to explore tides-seismicity correlation using custom datasets.
