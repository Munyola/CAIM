The surface texture of materials plays a critical role in wettability, lubrication, turbulence
and transport phenomena. In order to design surfaces for these fluid applications, it is desirable
to characterise non-smooth and porous materials by their ability to exchange mass and momentum
with flowing fluids. Whereas the physics underlying tangential (slip) velocity at a fluid-solid
interface is well understood, the treatment and importance of normal (transpiration) velocity
and normal stress is unclear. We show that, when slip velocity varies at an interface above the texture,
a non-zero transpiration velocity arises from mass conservation. The ability of a given surface
texture to accommodate for normal velocity of this kind is quantified by a transpiration length.
We further demonstrate that normal momentum transfer gives rise to resistance coefficients. For
a porous material, they measure how normal fluid stress outside the porous medium is partitioned
between the interstitial flow and the solid skeleton. The introduced measures of slip, transpiration
and resistance can be determined for any anisotropic non-smooth surface by solving five Stokes
problems. Moreover, these measures appear as constant coefficients in effective interface conditions.
We validate and demonstrate the physical significance of the effective conditions on two canonical
problems -- a lid-driven cavity and a turbulent channel flow, both with non-smooth bottom surfaces.
Our formulation provides a systematic approach for detailed characterisation and design of surfaces.
