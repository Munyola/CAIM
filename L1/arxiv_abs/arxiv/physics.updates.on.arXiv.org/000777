We report a benchmark theoretical investigation of both adiabatic and vertical electron affinities
of five DNA and RNA nucleobases: adenine, guanine, cytosine, thymine and uracil using state-of-the-art
equation of motion coupled cluster (EOMCC) method. We have calculated the vertical electron affinity
values of first five electron attached states of the DNA and RNA nucleobases and only the first electron
attached state is found to be energetically accessible in gas phase. An analysis of the natural orbitals
shows that the first electron attached states of uracil and thymine are valence-bound type and undergo
significant structural changes on attachment of excess electron, which is reflected in the deviation
of the adiabatic electron affinity from the vertical one. On the other hand, the first electron attached
state of cytosine, adenine and guanine are dipole-bound type and their structure remain unaffected
on attachment of an extra electron, which results in small deviation of adiabatic electron affinity
from that of the vertical one. Vertical and adiabatic electron affinity values of all the DNA and
RNA nucleobases are negative implying that the first electron attached state are not stable, but
rather resonance states. Previously, reported theoretical studies had shown scattered results
for electron affinities of DNA and RNA bases, with large deviations from experimental values. Our
EOMCC computed values are in very good agreement with experimental values and can be used as a reliable
benchmark for calibrating new theoretical methods.
