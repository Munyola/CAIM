Lasers differ from other light sources in that they are coherent, and their coherence makes them
indispensable to both fundamental research and practical application. In optomechanical cavities,
phonon and photon lasing is facilitated by the ability of photons and phonons to interact intensively
and excite one another coherently. The lasing linewidths of both phonons and photons are critical
for practical application. However, thus far, these linewidths have not been explored in detail
in cavity optomechanical systems. This study investigates the underlying dynamics of lasing in
optomechanical cavities and experimentally demonstrates simultaneous photon and phonon lasing
with narrow linewidths in a silicon optomechanical crystal cavity. We find that the linewidths
can be accounted for by two distinct physical mechanisms in two regimes, namely the normal regime
and the reversed regime, where the intrinsic optical decay rate is either larger or smaller than
the intrinsic mechanical decay rate. In the normal regime, an ultra-narrow spectral linewidth
of 5.4 kHz for phonon lasing at 6.22 GHz can be achieved regardless of the linewidth of the pump light,
while these results are counterintuitively unattainable for photon lasing in the reversed regime.
These results pave the way towards harnessing the coherence of both photons and phonons in silicon
photonic devices and reshaping their spectra, potentially opening up new technologies in sensing,
metrology, spectroscopy, and signal processing, as well as in applications requiring sources
that offer an ultra-high degree of coherence.
