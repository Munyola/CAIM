The photoelectron spectroscopy beamline at National Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory (NSRL)
is equipped with a spherical grating monochromator with the included angle of 174 deg. Three gratings
with line density of 200, 700 and 1200 lines/mm are used to cover the energy region from 60 eV to 1000
eV. After several years operation, the spectral resolution and flux throughput were deteriorated,
realignment is necessary to improve the performance. First, the wavelength scanning mechanism,
the optical components position and the exit slit guide direction are aligned according to the design
value. Second, the gratings are checked by Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM). And then the gas absorption
spectrum is measured to optimize the focusing condition of the monochromator. The spectral resolving
power is recovered to the designed value of 1000@244eV. The flux at the end station for the 200 lines/mm
grating is about 10^10 photons/sec/200mA, which is in accordance with the design. The photon flux
for the 700 lines/mm grating is about 5 X 10^8 photons/sec/200mA, which is lower than expected. This
poor flux throughput may be caused by carbon contamination on the optical components. The 1200 lines/mm
grating has roughness much higher than expected so the diffraction efficiency is too low to detect
any signal. A new grating would be ordered. After the alignment, the beamline has significant performance
improvements in both the resolving power and the flux throughput for 200 and 700 lines/mm gratings
and is provided to users.
