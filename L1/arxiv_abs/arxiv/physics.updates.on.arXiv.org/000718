We present a practical semiclassical method for computing the electron spin dynamics of a radical
in which the electron spin is hyperfine coupled to a large number of nuclear spins. This can be used
to calculate the singlet and triplet survival probabilities and quantum yields of radical recombination
reactions in the presence of magnetic fields. Our method differs from the early semiclassical theory
of Schulten and Wolynes [J. Chem. Phys. 68, 3292 (1978)] in allowing each individual nuclear spin
to precess around the electron spin, rather than assuming that the hyperfine coupling-weighted
sum of nuclear spin vectors is fixed in space. The downside of removing this assumption is that one
can no longer obtain a simple closed-form expression for the electron spin correlation tensor:
our method requires a numerical calculation. However, the computational effort increases only
linearly with the number of nuclear spins, rather than exponentially as in an exact quantum mechanical
calculation. The method is therefore applicable to arbitrarily large radicals. Moreover, it approaches
quantitative agreement with quantum mechanics as the number of nuclear spins increases and the
environment of the electron spin becomes more complex, owing to the rapid quantum decoherence in
complex systems. Unlike the Schulten-Wolynes theory, the present semiclassical theory predicts
the correct long-time behaviour of the electron spin correlation tensor, and it therefore correctly
captures the low magnetic field effect in the singlet yield of a radical recombination reaction
with a slow recombination rate.
