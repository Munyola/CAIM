In this work we have used micromagnetic simulations to report four ways to build traps for magnetic
skyrmions. Magnetic defects have been modeled as local variations in the material parameters,
such as the exchange stiffness, saturation magnetization, magnetocrystalline anisotropy and
Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya constant. We observe both pinning (potential well) and scattering (potential
barrier) traps when tuning either a local increase or a local reduction for each one of these magnetic
properties. It is found that the skyrmion-defect aspect ratio is a crucial parameter to build traps
for skyrmions. In particular, the efficiency of the trap is compromised if the defect size is smaller
than the skyrmion size, because they interact weakly. On the other hand, if the defect size is larger
than the skyrmion diameter, the skyrmion-defect interaction becomes evident. Thus, the strength
of the skyrmion-defect interaction can be tuned by the modification of the magnetic properties
within a region with suitable size. Furthermore, the basic physics behind the mechanisms for pinning
and for scattering is discussed. In particular, we discover that skyrmions move towards the magnetic
region which tends to maximize its diameter, it enables the magnetic system to minimize its energy.
Thus, we are able to explain why skyrmions are either attracted or repelled by a region with modified
magnetic properties. Results here presented are of utmost significance for the development and
realization of future spintronic devices, in which skyrmions will work as information carriers.
