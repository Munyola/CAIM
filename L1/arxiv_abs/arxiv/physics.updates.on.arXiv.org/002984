Ultracold paramagnetic and polar diatomic molecules are among the promising systems for quantum
simulation of lattice-spin models. Unfortunately, their experimental observation is still challenging.
Based on our recent \textit{ab-initio} calculations, we analyze the feasibility of all-optical
schemes for the formation of ultracold $^{87}$Rb$^{84}$Sr bosonic molecules. First, we have studied
the formation by photoassociation followed by spontaneous emission. The photoassociation rates
to levels belonging to electronic states converging to the $^{87}$Rb$(5s\,^2S)$+$^{84}$Sr($5s5p\,^3P_{0,1,2}$)
asymptotes are particularly small close to the asymptote. The creation of molecules would be more
interesting by using deeply levels that preferentially relaxes to the $v''=0$ level of the ground
state. On the other hands, the photoassociation rates to levels belonging to electronic states
converging to the Rb$(5p\,^2P_{1/2,3/2})$+Sr($5s^2\,^1S$) asymptotes have high value close
to the asymptote. The relaxation from the levels close to the asymptotes creates weakly-bound molecules
in mosty only one vibrational level. Second, stimulated Raman adiabatic passage (STIRAP) achieved
in a tight optical trap efficiently creates weakly-bound ground-state molecules in a well-defined
level, thus providing an alternative to magnetic Feshbach resonances to implement several schemes
for an adiabatic population transfer toward the lowest ground-state level of RbSr. Finally, we
have studied STIRAP process for transferring the weakly-bound molecules into the $v''=0$ level
of the RbSr ground state.
