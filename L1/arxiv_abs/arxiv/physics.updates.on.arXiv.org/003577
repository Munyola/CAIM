In real-world systems, phase transitions often materialize abruptly, making it difficult to design
appropriate controls that help uncover underlying processes. Some agent-based computational
models display transformations similar to phase transitions. For such cases, it is possible to
elicit detailed underlying processes that can be subsequently tested for applicability in real-world
systems. In a genetic algorithm, we investigate how a modest difference in the concentration of
correct and incorrect knowledge leads to radically different outcomes obtained through learning
efforts by a group of agents. We show that a difference in concentration of correct and incorrect
knowledge triggers virtuous and vicious cycles that impact the emergent outcome. When virtuous
cycles are in operation, delaying the onset of equilibrium attains superior outcomes. For the vicious
cycles, reaching equilibrium quickly attains superior outcomes. Our approach helps uncover simple
mechanisms by which Nature works, jettisoning the yoke of unrealistic assumptions endemic in mathematics-based
approaches. Our explanatory model helps direct research to investigate concentrations of inputs
that obtains outcomes on the favourable side of phase transitions. For example, by tracking change
in concentration of relevant parameters, scientists may look for reasons why cells cease to reproduce
fit cells in organs. This can help design rejuvenation of organs. Further, in the world of physics,
our model may inform in situations where the dominant Ising model falls short.
