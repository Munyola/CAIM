This is the final report of a three-paper series on the K-shell photoabsorption and photoionization
of trace elements, namely F, Na, P, Cl, K, Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Co, Cu and Zn. K lines and edges from such
elements are observed in the X-ray spectra of supernova remnants, galaxy clusters and accreting
black holes and neutron stars, their diagnostic potential being limited by poor atomic data. We
are completing the previously reported radiative datasets with new photoabsorption and photoionization
cross sections for isoelectronic sequences with electron number $19\leq N\leq 26$. We are also
giving attention to the access, integrity and usability of the whole resulting atomic database.
Target representations are obtained with the atomic structure code AUTOSTRUCTURE. Where possible,
cross sections for ground-configuration states are computed with the Breit--Pauli $R$-matrix
method (BPRM) in either intermediate or $LS$ coupling including damping (radiative and Auger)
effects; otherwise and more generally, they are generated in the isolated-resonance approximation
with AUTOSTRUCTURE. Cross sections were computed with BPRM only for the K ($N=19$) and Ca ($N=20$)
isoelectronic sequences, the latter in $LS$ coupling. For the rest of the sequences ($21\leq N \leq
26$), AUTOSTRUCTURE was run in $LS$-coupling mode taking into account damping effects. Comparisons
between these two methods for K-like Zn XII and Ca-like Zn XI show that, to ensure reasonable accuracy,
the $LS$ calculations must be performed taking into account the non-fine-structure relativistic
corrections.
