The enterprise of trying to explain different social and economic phenomena using concepts and
ideas drawn from physics has a long history. Statistical mechanics, in particular, has been often
seen as most likely to provide the means to achieve this, because it provides a lucid and concrete
framework for describing the collective behavior of systems comprising large numbers of interacting
entities. Several physicists have, in recent years, attempted to use such tools to throw light on
the mechanisms underlying a plethora of socio-economic phenomena. These endeavors have led them
to develop a community identity - with their academic enterprise being dubbed as "econophysics"
by some. However, the emergence of this field has also exposed several academic fault-lines. Social
scientists often regard physics-inspired models, such as those involving spins coupled to each
other, as over-simplifications of empirical phenomena. At the same time, while models of rational
agents who strategically make choices based on complete information so as to maximize their utility
are commonly used in economics, many physicists consider them to be caricatures of reality. We show
here that while these contrasting approaches may seem irreconcilable there are in fact many parallels
and analogies between them. In addition, we suggest that a new formulation of statistical mechanics
may be necessary to permit a complete mapping of the game-theoretic formalism to a statistical physics
framework. This may indeed turn out to be the most significant contribution of econophysics.
