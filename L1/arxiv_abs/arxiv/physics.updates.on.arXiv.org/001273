The Taylor-Melcher (TM) model is the standard model for describing the dynamics of poorly conducting
leaky dielectric fluids under an electric field. The TM model treats the fluid as an Ohmic conductor,
without modeling ion dynamics. On the other hand, electrodiffusion models, which have been successful
in describing electrokinetic phenomena, incorporates ionic concentration dynamics. Mathematical
reconciliation of the electrodiffusion picture and the TM model has been a major issue for electrohydrodynamic
theory. Here, we derive the TM model from an electrodiffusion model in which we explicitly model
the electrochemistry of ion dissociation. We introduce salt dissociation reaction terms in the
bulk electrodiffusion equation and take the limit in which the salt dissociation is weak; the assumption
of weak dissociation corresponds to the fact that the TM model describes poor conductors. Together
with the assumption that the Debye length is small, we derive the TM model with or without the surface
charge convection term depending upon the scaling of relevant dimensionless parameters. An important
quantity that emerges is the Galvani potential (GP), the jump in voltage across the liquid-liquid
interface; the GP arises as a natural consequence of the interfacial boundary conditions for the
ionic concentrations, and may be absent under certain parametric conditions. When the GP is absent,
we recover the TM model. In the presence of a non-zero GP our model predicts that the liquid droplet
will drift under an electric field, the velocity of which is computed explicitly to leading order.
