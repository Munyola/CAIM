Representing a target quantum state by a compact, efficient variational wave-function is an important
approach to the quantum many-body problem. In this approach, the main challenges include the design
of a suitable variational ansatz and optimization of its parameters. In this work, we address both
of these challenges. First, we define the variational class of Computational Graph States (CGS)
which gives a uniform framework for describing all computable variational ansatz. Secondly, we
develop a novel optimization scheme, supervised wave-function optimization (SWO), which systematically
improves the optimized wave-function by drawing on ideas from supervised learning. While SWO can
be used independently of CGS, utilizing them together provides a flexible framework for the rapid
design, prototyping and optimization of variational wave-functions. We demonstrate CGS and SWO
by optimizing for the ground state wave-function of 1D and 2D Heisenberg models on nine different
variational architectures including architectures not previously used to represent quantum
many-body wave-functions and find they are energetically competitive to other approaches. One
interesting application of this architectural exploration is that we show that fully convolution
neural network wave-functions can be optimized for one system size and, using identical parameters,
produce accurate energies for a range of system sizes. We expect these methods to increase the rate
of discovery of novel variational ansatz and bring further insights to the quantum many body problem.
