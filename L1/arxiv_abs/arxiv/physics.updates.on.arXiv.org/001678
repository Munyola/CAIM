When plotted in linear transformations of the Michaelis-Menten equation, ion uptake in plants
has been shown to be multiphasic, i.e. to be represented by a series of straight lines separated by
discontinuous transitions (Nissen 1971, 1974, 1991, 1996). Reanalysis of data for other transport,
binding and enzyme systems has also given such kinetics (Nissen and Mart\'in-Nieto 1998). Recently,
such profiles have been found for a variety of biological as well as non-biological processes and
phenomena, including activation of ion channels, binding, pH, folding/unfolding, effects of
various interactions and chain length (Nissen 2015a,b, Nissen 2016a-d). These biological and
nonbiological processes have little in common beyond the ions involved. Here I show that the multiphasic
property seen in so many systems is present in the fundamental physical properties of the ion themselves.
The characteristics of multiphasic profiles have now also been found in profiles for activities
of ions in simple inorganic solutions, indicating that they are somehow causing the multiphasic
profiles in more complex systems. A set of extensive and precise data (Lee et al. 2002) for the activities
of the biologically very important ions Na+, K+ and Cl- (in NaCl and KCl) at four different temperatures
(15, 25, 35 and 45oC) will be reanalyzed in the present paper. The activities of NaBr and KBr will be
plotted in a forthcoming paper. Extensive data for these and other ion activities Wilczek-Vera
et al. (2004) can also be precisely represented by multiphasic profiles (in preparation).
