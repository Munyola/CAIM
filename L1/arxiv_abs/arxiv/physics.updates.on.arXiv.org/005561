In this study, a linear stability analysis is performed for different Weakly Compressible Smooth
Particle Hydrodynamics (WCSPH) methods on a 1D periodic domain describing an incompressible base
flow. The perturbation equation can be vectorized and written as an ordinary differential equation
where the coefficients are circulant matrices. The diagonalization of the system is equivalent
to apply a spatial discrete Fourier transform. This leads to stability conditions expressed by
the discrete Fourier transform of the first and second derivatives of the kernel. Although spurious
modes are highlighted, no tensile nor pairing instabilities are found in the present study, suggesting
that the perturbations of the stresses are always damped if the base flow is incompressible. The
perturbations equation is solved in the Laplace domain, allowing to derive an analytical solution
of the transient state. Also, it is demonstrated analytically that a positive background pressure
combined with the uncorrected gradient operator leads to a reordering of the particle lattice.
It is also shown that above a critical value, the background pressure leads to instabilities. Finally,
the dispersion curves for inviscid and viscous flows are plotted for different WCSPH methods and
compared to the continuum solution. It is observed that a background pressure equal to $\rho c^2$
gives the best fidelity to predict the propagation of a sound wave. When viscosity effects are taken
into account, the damping of pressure fluctuations show the best agreement with the continuum for
$p_{back} \sim \rho c^2/2$.
