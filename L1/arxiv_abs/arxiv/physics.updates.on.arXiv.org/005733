The study of the acceleration of particles is an essential element of research in the heliospheric
science. Here, we discuss the predisposition to the particle acceleration around coronal mass
ejections (CMEs)-driven shocks with corrugated wave-like features. We adopt these attributes
on shocks formed from disturbances due to the bimodal solar wind, CME deflection, irregular CME
expansion, and the ubiquitous fluctuations in the solar corona. In order to understand the role
of a wavy shock in particle acceleration, we define three initial smooth shock morphologies each
one associated with a fast CME. Using polar Gaussian profiles we model these shocks in the low corona.
We establish the corrugated appearance on smooth shock by using combinations of wave-like functions
that represent the disturbances from medium and CME piston. For both shock types, smooth and corrugated,
we calculate the shock normal angles between the shock normal and the radial upstream coronal magnetic
field in order to classify the quasi-parallel and quasi-perpendicular regions. We consider that
corrugated shocks are predisposed to different process of particle acceleration due to irregular
distributions of shock normal angles around of the shock. We suggest that disturbances due to CME
irregular expansion may be a decisive factor in origin of particle acceleration. Finally, we regard
that accepting these features on shocks may be the start point for investigating some questions
in the sheath and shock, like downstream-jets, instabilities, shock thermalization, shock stability,
and injection particle process.
