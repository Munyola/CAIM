Beyond the dielectric continuum description initiated by Marcus theory, the nowadays standard
theoretical approach to study electron transfer (ET) reactions in solution or at interfaces is
to use classical force field or ab initio Molecular Dynamics simulations. We propose here an alternative
method based on liquid-state theory, namely molecular density functional theory, which is numerically
much more efficient than simulations while still retaining the molecular nature of the solvent.
We begin by reformulating molecular ET theory in a density functional language and show how to compute
the various observables characterizing ET reactions from an ensemble of density functional minimizations.
In particular, we define in that formulation the relevant order parameter of the reaction, the so-called
vertical energy gap, and determine the Marcus free energy curves of both reactant and product states
along that coordinate. Important thermodynamic quantities such as the reaction free energy and
the reorganization free energies follow. We assess the validity of the method by studying the model
Cl$^0\rightarrow$ Cl$^+$ and Cl$^0\rightarrow$ Cl$^-$ ET reactions in bulk water for which molecular
dynamics results are available. The anionic case is found to violate the standard Marcus theory.
Finally, we take advantage of the computational efficiency of the method to study the influence
of confinement on the ET, by investigating the evolution of the reorganization free energy of the
Cl$^0\rightarrow$ Cl$^+$ reaction when the atom approaches an atomistically resolved wall.
