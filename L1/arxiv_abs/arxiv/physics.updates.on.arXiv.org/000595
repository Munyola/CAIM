We describe a setup to study ultrafast dynamics in gas-phase molecules using time-resolved photoelectron
and photoion spectroscopy. The vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) probe pulses are generated via strong
field high-order harmonic generation from infrared femtosecond laser pulses. The band pass characteristic
in transmission of thin indium (In) metal foil is exploited to isolate the $9^{\text{th}}$ harmonic
of the 800 nm fundamental (H9, 14 eV, 89 nm) from all other high harmonics. The $9^{\text{th}}$ harmonic
is obtained with high conversion efficiencies and has sufficient photon energy to access the complete
set of valence electron levels in most molecules. The setup also allows for direct comparison of
VUV single-photon probe with 800 nm multi-photon probe without influencing the delay of excitation
and probe pulse or the beam geometry. We use a magnetic bottle spectrometer with high collection
efficiency for electrons, serving at the same time as a time of flight spectrometer for ions. Characterization
measurements on Xe reveal the spectral width of H9 to be $190\pm60$ meV and a photon flux of $\sim1\cdot10^{7}$
photons/pulse after spectral filtering. As a first application, we investigate the S$_1$ excitation
of perylene using time-resolved ion spectra obtained with multi-photon probing and time-resolved
electron spectra from VUV single-photon probing. The time resolution extracted from cross-correlation
measurements is $65\pm10$ fs for both probing schemes and the pulse duration of H9 is found to be $35\pm8$
fs.
