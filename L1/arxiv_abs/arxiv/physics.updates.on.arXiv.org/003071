Falls and their related injuries pose a significant risk to human health. One of the most common falls,
the forward fall, frequently occurs among adults and the elderly. In this study, we propose using
a human body model, developed using the MAthematical DYnamic MOdel (MADYMO) software, in place
of human subjects, to investigate forward fall-related injuries. The MADYMO human body model is
capable of simulating items that cannot be assessed on human subjects, such as human kinematics,
human dynamics, and the possibility of injuries. In order to achieve our goal, a set of experiments
was conducted to measure the impact force during a worst-case forward fall scenario (the outstretched
hand position) for two short fall heights. Similar to the experimental design used on the human subjects,
we generated a MADYMO human model. After performing the simulations, the results of the experiment
on the human subjects and the MADYMO simulation model were compared. We demonstrated a significant
correlation between the MADYMO simulation and the human subject experiments with respect to the
magnitude and timing of the impact forces. Consequently, we validated the MADYMO human body model
as a means to accurately assess forward fall-related injuries. Additionally, we compared the predicted
results of a mathematical model with the MADYMO human body model. The MADYMO model is reliable and
can demonstrate an accurate impact time. Therefore, we conclude that the MADYMO human model can
be utilized as a reliable model to investigate forward fall-related injuries from a typical standing
position.
