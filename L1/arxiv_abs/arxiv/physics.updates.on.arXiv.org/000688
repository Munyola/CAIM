We investigate the shock-induced turbulent mixing between a light and heavy gas, where a Richtmyer-Meshkov
instability (RMI) is initiated by a $\Ma = 1.5$ shock wave. The prescribed initial conditions define
a deterministic multimode interface perturbation between the gases, which can be imposed exactly
for different simulation codes and resolutions to allow for quantitative comparison. Well-resolved
large-eddy simulations are performed using two different and independently developed numerical
methods with the objective of assessing turbulence structures, prediction uncertainties and
convergence behaviour. The two numerical methods differ fundamentally with respect to the employed
subgrid-scale regularisation, each representing state-of-the-art approaches to RMI. Unlike
previous studies the focus of the present investigation is to quantify uncertainties introduced
by the numerical method, as there is strong evidence that subgrid-scale regularisation and truncation
errors may have a significant effect on the linear and non-linear stages of the RMI evolution. Fourier
diagnostics reveal that the larger energy containing scales converge rapidly with increasing
mesh resolution and thus are in excellent agreement for the two numerical methods. Spectra of gradient
dependent quantities, such as enstrophy and scalar dissipation rate, show stronger dependencies
on the small-scale flow field structures in consequence of truncation error effects, which for
one numerical method are dominantly dissipative and for the other dominantly dispersive.
