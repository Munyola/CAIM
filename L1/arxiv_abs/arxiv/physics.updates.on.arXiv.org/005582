We present combined spin model and first principles electronic structure calculations to study
the weak ferromagnetism in bulk Mn$_3$Z (Z=Sn, Ge, Ga) compounds. The spin model parameters were
determined from a spin-cluster expansion technique based on the relativistic disordered local
moment formalism implemented in the screened Korringa--Kohn--Rostoker method. We describe the
magnetic ground state of the system within a three-sublattice model and investigate the formation
of the weak ferromagnetic states in terms of the relevant model parameters. First, we give a group-theoretical
argument how the point-group symmetry of the lattice leads to the formation of weak ferromagnetic
states. Then we study the ground states of the classical spin model and derive analytical expressions
for the weak ferromagnetic distortions by recovering the main results of the group-theoretical
analysis. As a third approach we obtain the weak ferromagnetic ground states from self-consistent
density functional calculations and compare our results with previous first principles calculations
and with available experimental data. In particular, we demonstrate that the orbital moments follow
a decomposition predicted by group theory. For a deeper understanding of the formation of weak ferromagnetism
we selectively trace the effect of the spin-orbit coupling at the Mn and Z sites. In addition, for
the case of Mn$_3$Ga, we gain information on the role of the induced moment of Ga from constrained
local density functional calculations.
