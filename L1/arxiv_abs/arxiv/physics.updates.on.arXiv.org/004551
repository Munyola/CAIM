Conventional fracture-characterization methods assume the presence of a single set of aligned,
vertical cracks in the subsurface. We relax this assumption and demonstrate the feasibility of
seismic characterization of multiple fracture sets. Our technique relies on recent numerical
findings, indicating that multiple, differently oriented, possibly intersecting planar cracks
embedded in an otherwise isotropic host rock result in a nearly orthorhombic (or orthotropic) effective
medium. Here, the governing parameters of crack-induced orthotropy are estimated from 3D, wide-azimuth,
multicomponent seismic reflection data acquired over the tight-gas Rulison Field in Colorado,
USA. We translate strong azimuthal variations of the normal-moveout velocities into interval
crack densities, fracture orientations, type of fluid infill, and velocities of the P- and S-waves
in an unfractured rock. Our inversion procedure identifies a set of cracks aligned in approximately
WNW-ESE direction in the western part of the study area and multiple, likely intersecting fractures
in its eastern part. We validate both our underlying theoretical model and the obtained estimates
by two independent measurements: (i) the estimated fluid-infill parameter indicates dry cracks
as expected for the gas-producing sandstones at Rulison; and (ii) the obtained crack orientations
are supported by measurements in a well. As a by-product of fracture characterization, we build
an anisotropic velocity model of the Rulison reservoir that, we believe, is the first orthorhombic
velocity field constructed from surface seismic data.
