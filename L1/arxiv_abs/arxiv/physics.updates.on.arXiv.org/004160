The high luminosity upgrade of the CERN Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC) will result in a pile-up of
around 200 proton-proton collisions per bunch crossing. In order to reduce the impact of pile-up
on physics analyses the ATLAS and CMS experiments are planning to use the timing of the reconstructed
objects within one event. The primary proton-proton collisions have an RMS spread of $\approx$170
ps within one bunch crossing, and a time resolution of around 30 ps is required for pile-up mitigation.
This performance requires dedicated detectors for the timing of minimum ionising particles. The
timing detectors will be subjected, for the goal integrated luminosity of 3000 fb$^{-1}$, to radiation
levels corresponding to a 1-MeV neutrons fluence ($\Phi_{eq}$) of about $10^{14}$ or $10^{15}$
cm$^{-2}$ for the barrel and end-cap detector regions, respectively. In this paper, deep diffused
Avalanche Photo Diodes (APDs) are examined as candidate timing detectors for HL-LHC applications.
Devices with an active area of $8 \times 8$ mm$^2$ are characterised using a pulsed infrared laser
and, in some cases, a high energy muon beam. The timing performance as well as the uniformity of response
are examined. The effects of radiation damage on current, signal amplitude, noise, and timing of
the APDs are evaluated using detectors with an active area of $2 \times 2$ mm$^2$. These detectors
were irradiated with neutrons up to $\Phi_{eq} = 10^{15}$ cm$^{-2}$. Their timing performance
was characterised using a pulsed infrared laser.
