We investigate ambient fluid entrainment and near-field flow characteristics of a free surface
plunging jet for five Reynolds numbers ranging from 3000 to 10000 using time-resolved stereo particle
image velocimetry (SPIV). We present time-averaged velocities, RMS velocity fluctuations, mean
entrainment and unsteady flow features and compare them with previous studies on free jets. We find
that plunging jets have a smaller potential core length, and earlier decay of the mean centerline
velocity. The peak RMS velocity fluctuations occur at a location significantly upstream compared
to the free jets reported in the literature. Near-field ambient fluid entrainment of plunging jets
is measured for the first time and is found to be considerably higher than free jets in the low Reynolds
number range. For the plunging jet case at Re = 3000, faster jet decay, higher levels of turbulent
intensity in the near-field, and augmented mass entrainment result from strong primary vortices
that give the turbulent/non-turbulent interface (TNTI) its convoluted shape which facilitates
both bulk entrapment of ambient fluid and small scale nibbling because of larger surface area. These
primary vortices occur right below the free surface and disintegrate into secondary structures
at axial locations that are upstream compared to those of free jets. At higher Reynolds numbers,
primary vortices are smaller in size, weak in swirling strength, and disintegrate prematurely,
resulting in suppressed mixing and reduced entrainment efficiency.
