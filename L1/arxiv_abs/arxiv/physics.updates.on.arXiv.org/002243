A set of 23 observations of coronal jet events that occurred in coronal bright points has been analyzed.
The focus was on the temporal evolution of the mean brightness before and during coronal jet events.
In the absolute majority of the cases either single or recurrent coronal jets were preceded by slight
precursor disturbances observed in the mean intensity curves. The key conclusion is that we were
able to detect quasi-periodical oscillations with characteristic periods from sub-minute up
to 3-4 min values in the bright point brightness which precede the jets. Our basic claim is that along
with the conventionally accepted scenario of bright point evolution through new magnetic flux
emergence and its reconnection with the initial structure of the bright point and the coronal hole,
certain MHD oscillatory and wave-like motions can be excited and these can take an important place
in the observed dynamics. These quasi-oscillatory phenomena might play the role of links between
different epochs of the coronal jet ignition and evolution. They can be an indication of the MHD wave
excitation processes due to the system entropy variations, density variations or shear flows.
It is very likely a sharp outflow velocity transverse gradients at the edges between the open and
closed field line regions. We suppose that magnetic reconnections can be the source of MHD waves
due to impulsive generation or rapid temperature variations, and shear flow driven nonmodel MHD
wave evolution (self-heating and/or overreflection mechanisms).
