Game theory is widely used as a behavioral model for strategic interactions in biology and social
science. It is common practice to assume that players quickly converge to an equilibrium, e.g. a
Nash equilibrium, but there is an increasing body of research that suggests that under behaviorally
plausible learning algorithms there are many situations where convergence fails. To better understand
this we use the concept of best reply dynamics, in which each player myopically responds with the
best reply to the opponent's last move. The best reply dynamics converges to attractors that can
be fixed points (corresponding to pure strategy Nash equilibria) or cycles. We study generic two
player games with random payoffs that we take as null models for real-world scenarios involving
strategic interactions. We consider six different learning algorithms and show that the frequency
with which convergence to equilibrium fails is strongly correlated to that predicted by best reply
dynamics. We then use combinatorial methods to analyze the structure of the games. We find that cycles
- and so non-convergence - increase with the number of moves $N$ and become dominant for $N>10$. Non-convergence
is enhanced if the game is competitive, in the sense that the payoffs of the two players are anti-correlated,
and damped when the game is cooperative, in the sense that the payoffs are positively correlated.
Our results indicate that as games become more complicated and more competitive equilibrium ceases
to be a good behavioral model, and one must explicitly model the dynamics of learning.
