Catastrophic events, though rare, do occur and when they occur, they have devastating effects.
It is, therefore, of utmost importance to understand the complexity of the underlying dynamics
and signatures of catastrophic events, such as market crashes. For deeper understanding, we choose
the US and Japanese markets from 1985 onward, and study the evolution of the cross-correlation structures
of stock return matrices and their eigenspectra over different short time-intervals or "epochs".
A slight non-linear distortion is applied to the correlation matrix computed for any epoch, leading
to the emerging spectrum of eigenvalues. The statistical properties of the emerging spectrum display:
(i) the shape of the emerging spectrum reflects the market instability, (ii) the smallest eigenvalue
may be able to statistically distinguish the nature of a market turbulence or crisis -- internal
instability or external shock, and (iii) the time-lagged smallest eigenvalue has a statistically
significant correlation with the mean market cross-correlation. The smallest eigenvalue seems
to indicate that the financial market has become more turbulent in a similar way as the mean does.
Yet we show features of the smallest eigenvalue of the emerging spectrum that distinguish different
types of market instabilities related to internal or external causes. Based on the paradigmatic
character of financial time series for other complex systems, the capacity of the emerging spectrum
to understand the nature of instability may be a new feature, which can be broadly applied.
