Due to its corrugated hexagonal lattice structure, Black phosphorus (BP) has unique anisotropic
physical properties, which provides an additional freedom for designing devices. Many body interactions,
including interactions with phonon, is crucial for heat dissipation and charge carrier mobility
in device. However, the rich properties of the coherent acoustic phonon, including anisotropy,
propagation and generation were not fully interrogated. In this paper, the polarization-resolved
transient absorption microscopy was conducted on BP flakes to study the dynamics of photoexcited
charge carriers and coherent acoustic phonon. Polarization-resolved transient absorption images
and traces were recorded and showed anisotropic and thickness-dependent charge carriers decay
dynamics. The damping of the coherent acoustic phonon oscillation was found to be anisotropic,
which was attributed to the polarization-dependent absorption length of the probe pulse. From
the analysis of initial oscillation amplitude and phase of coherent acoustic phonon oscillation,
we proposed that the direct deformation potential mechanism dominated the generation of coherent
acoustic phonons in our experiment. Besides, we obtained the sound velocity of the coherent acoustic
phonon from the oscillation frequency and the acoustic echo, respectively, which agreed well with
each other. These findings provide significant insights into the rich acoustic phonon properties
of BP, and promise important application for BP in polarization-sensitive optical and optoelectronic
devices.
