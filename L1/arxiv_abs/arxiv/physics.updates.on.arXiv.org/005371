High obliquity planets represent potentially extreme limits of terrestrial climate, as they exhibit
large seasonality, a reversed annual-mean pole-to-equator gradient of stellar heating, and novel
cryospheres. A suite of 3-D global climate model simulations with a dynamic ocean is performed with
Earthlike atmospheres for low and high obliquity planets with various stellar fluxes, CO2 concentrations,
and initial conditions to explore the propensity for high obliquity climates approaching the outer
edge of the Habitable Zone to undergo global glaciation. We also simulate planets with thick CO2
or H2 atmospheres, such as those expected to develop near or beyond the outer edge of the Habitable
Zone. We show that high obliquity planets are hotter than their low obliquity counterparts due to
ice-albedo feedbacks for cold climates, and water vapor in warm climates. We suggest that the water
vapor greenhouse trapping is greater on high obliquity bodies due to the different dynamical regimes
that occur between the two states. While equatorial ice-belts are stable at high obliquity in some
climate regimes, it is harder to achieve global glaciation than for a low obliquity planet. Temperate
polar conditions can be present at high obliquity at forcings for which low obliquity planets would
be in a hard snowball state. We suggest the conditions on high obliquity planets are likely to be more
favorable for a robust biosphere to develop approaching the outer edge of the HZ. However, the influence
of obliquity diminishes for dense atmospheres, in agreement with calculations from 1-D Energy
Balance Models.
