Pulse-tube based dilution refrigerators are massively employed in low temperature physics. They
allow to reduce the running costs and to be operated with unprecedented easiness. However, the main
drawback of this technology is the mechanical vibrations induced by the pulse-tube cryocooler.
These perturbations can cause extra-noises drastically affecting the detector performance.
In this paper, we propose a solution to mitigate the impact of these vibrations by mounting the detectors
in an elastic-pendulum based suspended tower. Based on vibration modeling and experimental tests,
we show that the vibration levels are attenuated by up to two orders of magnitude at most frequencies,
especially above $\sim20$ Hz, for both vertical and radial directions. Thanks to this passive isolation
solution, vibration levels, both along vertical and radial directions, below 1 $\mu\textrm{g/}\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$
in the frequency range [1-1000] Hz are obtained. This provides a convenient environment to test
the ultimate performance of low temperature detectors. As a result, we report an improvement by
one to two orders of magnitude on the noise levels of massive cryogenic bolometers, leading to thermal
energy resolutions improved by a factor 5 to 40. Finally, we conclude that the energy resolution
of our cryogenic bolometers are no longer limited from any residual vibrations, hence allowing
the perspective of further improving our bolometer performance in the context of low-mass dark
matter searches and neutrino physics applications.
