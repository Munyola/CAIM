This paper presents an analytic solution for the sound generated by an unsteady gust interacting
with a semi-infinite flat plate with a serrated leading edge in a background steady uniform flow.
Viscous and non-linear effects are neglected. The Wiener-Hopf method is used in conjunction with
a non-orthogonal coordinate transformation and separation of variables to permit analytical
progress. The solution is obtained in terms of a modal expansion in the spanwise coordinate, however
for low- and mid-range incident frequencies only the zeroth order mode is seen to contribute to the
far-field acoustics, therefore the far-field noise can be quickly evaluated. The solution gives
insight into the potential mechanisms behind the reduction of noise for plates with serrated leading
edges compared to those with straight edges, and predicts a logarithmic dependence between the
tip-to-root serration height and the decrease of far-field noise. The two mechanisms behind the
noise reduction are proposed to be an increased destructive interference in the far field, and a
redistribution of acoustic energy from low cuton modes to higher cutoff modes as the tip-to-root
serration height is increased. The analytic results show good agreement in comparison with experimental
measurements. The results are then compared against numerical predictions for the sound generated
by a spanwise invariant line vortex interacting with a flat plate with serrated leading edge. Good
agreement is also seen between the analytical and numerical results as frequency and tip-to-root
ratio are varied.
