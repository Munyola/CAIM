We study bandstructure properties of periodic optical systems composed of lossy and intrinsically
dispersive materials. To this end, we develop an analytical framework based on adjoint modes of
a lossy periodic electromagnetic system and show how the problem of linearly dependent eigenmodes
in the presence of material dispersion can be overcome. We then formulate expressions for the bandstructure
derivative $(\partial \omega) / (\partial \mathbf{k})$ (complex group velocity) and the local
and total density of transverse optical states. Our exact expressions hold for 3D periodic arrays
of materials with arbitrary dispersion properties and in general need to be evaluated numerically.
They can be generalized to systems with two, one or no directions of periodicity provided the fields
are localized along non-periodic directions. Possible applications are photonic crystals, metamaterials,
metasurfaces composed of highly dispersive materials such as metals or lossless photonic crystals,
metamaterials or metasurfaces strongly coupled to resonant perturbations such as quantum dots
or excitons in 2D materials. For illustration purposes, we analytically evaluate our expressions
for some simple systems consisting of lossless dielectrics with one sharp Lorentzian material
resonance. Finally, we show how the perturbation of a periodic system with a sharp resonance modifies
the bandstructure. By combining several Lorentz poles, this provides an avenue to perturbatively
treat quite general material loss bands in photonic crystals.
