Understanding human mobility from a microscopic point of view may represent a fundamental breakthrough
for the development of a statistical physics for cognitive systems and it can shed light on the applicability
of macroscopic statistical laws for social systems. Even if the complexity of individual behaviors
prevents a true microscopic approach, the introduction of mesoscopic models allows the study of
the dynamical properties for the non-stationary states of the considered system. We propose to
compute various entropy measures of the individual mobility patterns obtained from GPS data that
record the movements of private vehicles in the Florence district, in order to point out new features
of human mobility related to the use of time and space and to define the dynamical properties of a stochastic
model that could generate similar patterns. Moreover, we can relate the predictability properties
of human mobility to the distribution of time passed between two successive trips. Our analysis
suggests the existence of a hierarchical structure in the mobility patterns which divides the performed
activities into three different categories, according to the time cost, with different information
contents. We show that a Markov process defined by using the individual mobility network is not able
to reproduce this hierarchy, which seems the consequence of different strategies in the activity
choice. Our results could contribute to the development of governance policies for a sustainable
mobility in modern cities.
