We analyze the primitive variables of fluid flow and scalar fields through fast Fourier transform
(FFT) in the near and far wake of an elliptic cylinder. Numerical simulation of flow and scalar fields
behind an elliptic cylinder of axis ratio 0.4 at a Reynolds number of 130 is performed. The semi-major
axis of the elliptic cylinder is kept perpendicular to the incoming flow, where the fluid flow is
two-dimensional and the Prandtl number is 0.71. The scalar is injected into the flow field by means
of heating the cylinder continuously. The simulation is run for a long time to show that the secondary
vortex street is a time-dependent phenomenon. Three distinguishable flow and scalar regions are
observed in the wake of the cylinder. This study reveals the presence of low-frequency structures
besides the primary shedding structures in linear, transition and saturation regions of temporal
wake development. We show that the spectral source of the primary frequency is the saturated state
of the temporal wake development, while its physical source is the periodic arrangement of structures
of primitive variables, which inhibits the transmutation of their wavelength. On the other hand,
the secondary low frequency is embedded in the transitional developing stage of the wake and its
physical source is the chaotic behaviour of the transition process, which aids in the transmutation
of the wavelength of the structures. Our spectral analysis also reveals that the scalar is predominately
carried by the streamwise velocity and the pressure throughout the wake.
