In a continuum setting, the energy-momentum tensor embodies the relations between conservation
of energy, conservation of linear momentum, and conservation of angular momentum. The well-defined
total energy and the well-defined total momentum in a thermodynamically closed system with complete
equations of motion are used to construct the total energy-momentum tensor for a stationary simple
linear material with both magnetic and dielectric properties illuminated by a quasimonochromatic
pulse of light through a gradient-index antireflection coating. The perplexing issues surrounding
the Abraham and Minkowski momentums are bypassed by working entirely with conservation principles,
the total energy, and the total momentum. We derive electromagnetic continuity equations and equations
of motion for the macroscopic fields based on the material four-divergence of the traceless, symmetric
total energy-momentum tensor. We identify contradictions between the macroscopic Maxwell equations
and the continuum form of the conservation principles. We resolve the contradictions, which are
the actual fundamental issues underlying the Abraham-Minkowski controversy, by constructing
a unified version of continuum electrodynamics that is based on establishing consistency between
the three-dimensional Maxwell equations for macroscopic fields, the electromagnetic continuity
equations, the four-divergence of the total energy-momentum tensor, and a four-dimensional tensor
formulation of electrodynamics for macroscopic fields in a simple linear medium.
