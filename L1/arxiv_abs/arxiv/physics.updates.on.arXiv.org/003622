Astronomical evolution mechanism of small size polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) was analyzed
using the first principles quantum-chemical calculation. Starting model molecule was benzene
(C6H6), which would be transformed to (C5H5) due to carbon void created by interstellar high speed
proton attack. In a protoplanetary disk around a young star, molecules would be illuminated by high
energy photon and ionized to be cationic-(C5H5). Calculation shows that from neutral to tri-cation,
molecule keeps original configuration. At a step of sixth cation, there occurs surprising creation
of cyclic-C3H2, which is the smallest PAH. Astronomical cyclic-C3H2 had been identified by radio
astronomy. Deep photoionization of cyclic-C3H2 brings successive molecular change. Neutral
and mono-cation keep cyclic configuration. At a step of di-cation, molecule was transformed to
aliphatic chain-C3H2. Finally, chain-C3H2 was decomposed to pure carbon chain-C3 and two hydrogen
atoms. Calculated infrared spectrum of those molecules was applied to observed spectrum of Herbig
Ae young stars. Observed infrared spectrum could be partially explained by small molecules. Meanwhile,
excellent coincidence was obtained by applying a larger molecules as like (C23H12)2+ or (C12H8)2+.
Infrared observation is suitable for larger molecules and radio astronomy for smaller asymmetric
molecules. It should be noted that these molecules could be identified in a natural way introducing
two astronomical phenomena, that is, void-induced molecular deformation and deep photoionization.
