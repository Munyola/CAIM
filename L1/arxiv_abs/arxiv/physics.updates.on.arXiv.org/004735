We investigated the intersectional nature of race/racism and gender/sexism in broad scale inequities
in physics student learning using a critical quantitative intersectionality. To provide transparency
and create a nuanced picture of learning, we problematized the measurement of equity by using two
competing operationalizations of equity: Equity of Individuality and Equality of Learning. These
two models led to conflicting conclusions. The analyses used hierarchical linear models to examine
student's conceptual learning as measured by gains in scores on research-based assessments administered
as pretests and posttests. The data came from the Learning About STEM Student Outcomes' (LASSO)
national database and included data from 13,857 students in 187 first-semester college physics
courses. Findings showed differences in student gains across gender and race. Large gender differences
existed for White and Hispanic students but not for Asian, Black, and Pacific Islander students.
The models predicted larger gains for students in collaborative learning than in lecture-based
courses. The Equity of Individuality operationalization indicated that collaborative instruction
improved equity because all groups learned more with collaborative learning. The Equality of Learning
operationalization indicated that collaborative instruction did not improve equity because
differences between groups were unaffected. We discuss the implications of these mixed findings
and identify areas for future research using critical quantitative perspectives in education
research.
