Due to the rapid growth in demand for power for sensing devices located in remote locations, scientists'
attention has been drawn to vibration energy harvesting as an alternative to batteries. As a result
of over two decades of micro-scale vibration energy harvester research, the use of mechanical nonlinearity
in the dynamic behavior of the piezoelectric power generating structures had been recognized as
one of the promising solutions to the challenges presented by chaotic, low-frequency vibration
sources found in common application environments. In this study, the design and performance of
a unique MEMS-scale nonlinear vibration energy harvester based on coupled component structures
and bi-stable states are investigated. The coupled-components within the device consist of a main
buckled beam bonded with piezoelectric layers, a torsional rod, and two cantilever arms with tip
masses at their ends. These arms are connected to the main beam through the torsional rod and are designed
to help the main beam snap between its buckled stable states when subjected to sufficient vibration
loading. The fabrication of the device will be discussed, including use of plasma-enhanced chemical
vapor deposition (PECVD) of silicon nitride under an alternating power field to control compressive
stress development within the main buckled beam. After completing the fabrication process, the
next step would be testing the device under a variety of vibration loading conditions for its potential
use as a vibration energy harvester.
