Heavy (O+) ion energization and field-aligned motion in and near the ionosphere are still not well
understood. Based on observations from the CASSIOPE Enhanced Polar Outflow Probe (e-POP) at altitudes
between 325 km and 730 km over one year, we present a statistical study (24 events) of ion heating and
its relation to field-aligned ion bulk flow velocity, low-frequency waves and field-aligned currents
(FACs). The ion temperature and field-aligned bulk flow velocity are derived from 2-D ion velocity
distribution functions measured by the suprathermal electron imager (SEI) instrument. Consistent
ion heating and flow velocity characteristics are observed from both the SEI and the rapid-scanning
ion mass spectrometer (IRM) instruments. We find that transverse O+ ion heating in the ionosphere
can be intense (up to 4.5 eV), confined to very narrow regions (~ 2 km across B), is more likely to occur
in the downward current region, and is associated with broadband extremely low frequency (BBELF)
waves. These waves are interpreted as linearly polarized perpendicular to the magnetic field.
The amount of ion heating cannot be explained by frictional heating, and the correlation of ion heating
with BBELF waves suggest that significant wave-ion heating is occurring and even dominating at
altitudes as low as 350 km, a boundary that is lower than previously reported. Surprisingly, the
majority of these heating events (17 out 24) are associated with core ion downflows rather than upflows.
This may be explained by a downward-pointing electric field in the low-altitude return current
region.
