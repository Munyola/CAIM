An important challenge in several disciplines today is to understand how sudden changes can propagate
among coupled systems. Examples include the synchronization of business cycles, population collapse
in patchy ecosystems, markets shifting to a new technology platform, collapses in prices and in
confidence in financial markets, and protests erupting in multiple countries. A number of mathematical
models of these phenomena have multiple equilibria separated by saddle-node bifurcations, so
we study this behavior in its normal form as fast--slow ordinary differential equations. In our
model, a system consists of multiple subsystems, such as countries in the global economy or patches
of an ecosystem. Each subsystem is described by a scalar quantity, such as economic output or population,
that undergoes sudden changes via saddle-node bifurcations. The subsystems are coupled via their
scalar quantity (e.g., trade couples economic output; diffusion couples populations); that coupling
moves their bifurcations. The model demonstrates two ways in which sudden changes can propagate:
they can cascade (one causing the next), or they can hop over subsystems. We conclude by showing that
this "hopping" phenomenon, which is absent from classic models of cascades, may have occurred in
the Arab Spring protests, according to Facebook and telephone linkages across borders. These results
suggest ways to predict and to control sudden changes in coupled systems, and they highlight a new
class of temporal motifs in longitudinal network datasets.
