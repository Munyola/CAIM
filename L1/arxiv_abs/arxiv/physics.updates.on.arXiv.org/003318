Ce-doped SiO x N y films are deposited by magnetron reactive sputtering from a CeO 2 target under nitrogen
reactive gas atmosphere. Visible photoluminescence measurements regarding the nitrogen gas
flow reveal a large emission band centered at 450 nm for a sample deposited under a 2 sccm flow. A special
attention is paid to the origin of such an emission at high nitrogen concentration. Different emitting
centers are suggested in Ce doped SiO x N y films (e.g. band tails, CeO 2, Ce clusters, Ce 3+ ions), with
different activation scenarios to explain the luminescence. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS) reveals the exclusive presence of Ce 3+ ions whatever the nitrogen or Ce concentrations, while
transmission electron microscopy (TEM) shows no clusters or silicates upon high temperature annealing.
With the help of photoluminescence excitation spectroscopy (PLE), a wide excitation range from
250 nm up to 400 nm is revealed and various excitations of Ce 3+ ions are proposed involving direct
or indirect mechanisms. Nitrogen concentration plays an important role on Ce 3+ emission by modifying
Ce surroundings, reducing the Si phase volume in SiO x N y and causing a nephelauxetic effect. Taking
into account the optimized nitrogen growth parameters, the Ce concentration is analyzed as new
parameter. Under UV excitation, a strong emission is visible to the naked eye with high Ce 3+ concentration
(6 at. %). No saturation of the photoluminescence intensity is observed, confirming again the lack
of Ce cluster or silicate phase formation due do the nitrogen presence.
