The article analyses two potential metamaterial designs, the metafoundation and the metabarrier,
capable to attenuate seismic waves on buildings or structural components in a frequency band between
3.5 to 8 Hz. The metafoundation serves the dual purpose of reducing the seismic response and supporting
the superstructure. Conversely the metabarrier surrounds and shields the structure from incoming
waves. The two solutions are based on a cell layout of local resonators whose dynamic properties
are tuned using finite element simulations combined with Bloch-Floquet boundary conditions.
To enlarge the attenuation band, a graded design where the resonant frequency of each cell varies
spatially is employed. If appropriately enlarged or reduced, the metamaterial designs could be
used to attenuate lower frequency seismic waves or groundborne vibrations respectively. A sensitivity
analysis over various design parameters including size, number of resonators, soil type and source
directivity, carried out by computing full 3D numerical simulations in time domain for horizontal
shear waves is proposed. Overall, the metamaterial solutions discussed here can reduce the spectral
amplification of the superstructure between approx. 15 to 70% depending on several parameters
including the metastructure size and the properties of the soil. Pitfalls and advantages of each
configuration are discussed in detail. The role of damping, crucial to avoid multiple resonant
coupling, and the analogies between graded metamaterials and tuned mass dampers is also investigated.
