Biomolecules can be synthesized in interstellar ice grains subject to UV radiation. I show that
the large dose of UV radiation per molecule over sufficiently long time scales leads to the creation
of large percolation clusters of organic molecules. Such clusters will have large network of pores
traversing their entire lengths, which eventually collapse into small local networks. Some of
these clusters would have ended up in proto-planets where large, loosely bound aggregates of clusters
(superclusters) could have formed. The interior regions of such superclusters provided for micro-environments
that are filtered versions of the outside environment. Biochemical systems present inside such
micro-environments would be subject to cold-warm cycles. Models of abiogenesis where such cold-warm
cycles play an important role, can then also be considered inside such superclusters. The filtered
nature of the micro-environment makes such models more likely to work. As the supercluster gradually
breaks up, the biochemical system gradually becomes subject to a less filtered environment, allowing
it to get adapted to the more complex outside environment. A particular system originating from
a particular location on some supercluster would have been the first to get adapted to the raw outside
environment and survive there, thereby becoming the first microbe. A collision of a microbe-containing
proto-planet with the Moon could have led to fragments veering off back into space, microbes in small
fragments would have been able to survive a subsequent impact with the Earth.
