Multispectral photoacoustic (PA) imaging is a prime modality to monitor hemodynamics and changes
in blood oxygenation (sO2). Although sO2 changes can be an indicator of brain activity both in normal
and in pathological conditions, PA imaging of the brain has mainly focused on small animal models
with lissencephalic brains. Therefore, the purpose of this work was to investigate the usefulness
of multispectral PA imaging in assessing sO2 in a gyrencephalic brain. To this end, we continuously
imaged a porcine brain as part of an open neurosurgical intervention with a handheld PA and ultrasonic
(US) imaging system in vivo. Throughout the experiment, we varied respiratory oxygen and continuously
measured arterial blood gases. The arterial blood oxygenation (SaO2) values derived by the blood
gas analyzer were used as a reference to compare the performance of linear spectral unmixing algorithms
in this scenario. According to our experiment, PA imaging can be used to monitor sO2 in the porcine
cerebral cortex. While linear spectral unmixing algorithms are well-suited for detecting changes
in oxygenation, there are limits with respect to the accurate quantification of sO2, especially
in depth. Overall, we conclude that multispectral PA imaging can potentially be a valuable tool
for change detection of sO2 in the cerebral cortex of a gyrencephalic brain. The spectral unmixing
algorithms investigated in this work will be made publicly available as part of the open-source
software platform Medical Imaging Interaction Toolkit (MITK).
