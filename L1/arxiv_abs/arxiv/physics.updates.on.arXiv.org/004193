One-dimensional structures of non-Hermitian plasmonic metallic nanospheres are studied in this
paper. For a single sphere, solving Maxwell's equations results in quasi-stationary eigenmodes
with complex quantized frequencies. Coupled mode theory is employed in order to study more complex
structures. The similarity between the coupled mode equations and the effective non-Hermitian
Hamiltonians governing open quantum systems allows us to translate a series of collective phenomenon
emerging in condensed matter and nuclear physics to the system of plasmonic spheres. A nontrivial
physics emerges as a result of strong non-radiative near field coupling between adjacent spheres.
For a system of two identical spheres, this occurs when the width of the plasmonic resonance of the
uncoupled spheres is twice the imaginary component of the coupling constant. The two spheres then
become coupled through a single continuum channel and the effect of coherent interaction between
the spheres becomes noticeable. The eigenmodes of the system fall into two distinct categories:
superradiant states with enhanced radiation and dark states with no radiation. The transmission
through one-dimensional chains with an arbitrary number of spheres is also considered within the
effective Hamiltonian framework which allows us to calculate observables such as the scattering
and transmission amplitudes. This nano-scale waveguide can undergo an additional superradiance
phase transition through its coupling to the external world. It is shown that perfect transmission
takes place when the superradiance condition is satisfied.
