Leakage currents through insulators received continuous attention for decades, owing to their
importance for a wide range of technologies, and interest in their fundamental mechanisms. This
work investigates the leakage currents through atomic layer deposited (ALD) $Al_2O_3$, grown
on $SrTiO_3$. This combination is not only a key building block of oxide electronics, but also a clean
system for studying the leakage mechanisms without interfacial layers that form on most of the conventional
bottom electrodes. We show how tiny differences in the deposition process can have a dramatic effect
on the leakage behavior. Detailed analysis of the leakage behavior rules out Fowler-Nordheim tunneling
(FNT) and thermionic emission, and leaves the trap-related mechanisms of trap-assisted tunneling
(TAT) and Poole-Frenkel as the likely mechanisms. After annealing the sample in air, the currents
are reduced, which is ascribed to transition from trap-based mechanism to FNT, due to the elimination
of the traps. The dramatic role of the assumptions regarding the flat-band voltage used for analysis
is critically discussed, and the sensitivity of the extracted parameters on this magnitude is quantitatively
described. We show that field effect devices based on structures similar to those described here,
should be able to modulate $>10^{13} cm^{-2}$ electrons. These results provide general guidelines
for reducing and analyzing leakage currents in insulators, and highlight some of the possible approaches
and pitfalls in their analysis.
