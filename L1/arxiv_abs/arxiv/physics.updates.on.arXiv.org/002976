The noble elements, argon and xenon, are frequently employed as the target and event detector for
weakly interacting particles such as neutrinos and Dark Matter. For such rare processes, background
radiation must be carefully minimized. Radon provides one of the most significant contaminants
since it is an inevitable product of trace amounts of natural uranium. To design a purification system
for reducing such contamination, the adsorption characteristics of radon in nitrogen, argon,
and xenon carrier gases on various types of charcoals with different adsorbing properties and intrinsic
radioactive purities have been studied in the temperature range of 190-295 K at flow rates of 0.5
and 2 standard liters per minute. Essential performance parameters for the various charcoals include
the average breakthrough times ($\tau$), dynamic adsorption coefficients (k$_a$) and the number
of theoretical stages (n). It is shown that the k$_a$-values for radon in nitrogen, argon, and xenon
increase as the temperature of the charcoal traps decreases, and that they are significantly larger
in nitrogen and argon than in xenon gas due to adsorption saturation effects. It is found that, unlike
in xenon, the dynamic adsorption coefficients for radon in nitrogen and argon strictly obey the
Arrhenius law. The experimental results strongly indicate that nitric acid etched Saratech is
the best candidate among all used charcoal brands. It allows reducing total radon concentration
in the LZ liquid Xe detector to meet the ultimate goal in the search for Dark Matter.
