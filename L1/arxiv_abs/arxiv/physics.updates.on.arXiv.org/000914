Financial networks are dynamic. To assess their systemic importance to the world-wide economic
network and avert losses we need models that take the time variations of the links and nodes into account.
Using the methodology of classical mechanics and Laplacian determinism we develop a model that
can predict the response of the financial network to a shock. We also propose a way of measuring the
systemic importance of the banks, which we call BankRank. Using European Bank Authority 2011 stress
test exposure data, we apply our model to the bipartite network connecting the largest institutional
debt holders of the troubled European countries (Greece, Italy, Portugal, Spain, and Ireland).
From simulating our model we can determine whether a network is in a "stable" state in which shocks
do not cause major losses, or a "unstable" state in which devastating damages occur. Fitting the
parameters of the model, which play the role of physical coupling constants, to Eurozone crisis
data shows that before the Eurozone crisis the system was mostly in a "stable" regime, and that during
the crisis it transitioned into an "unstable" regime. The numerical solutions produced by our model
match closely the actual time-line of events of the crisis. We also find that, while the largest holders
are usually more important, in the unstable regime smaller holders also exhibit systemic importance.
Our model also proves useful for determining the vulnerability of banks and assets to shocks. This
suggests that our model may be a useful tool for simulating the response dynamics of shared portfolio
networks.
