A semi-empirical acoustic model for self-noise was adapted to predict the sound radiated from an
axial fan featuring rotating controlled diffusion blades (RCDB). Experimental data for wake velocity,
mass flow rate across the fan, and fan rotational speed were obtained. These experimental data along
with typical characteristics of turbulent boundary layers were used to predict the noise of the
axial fan. Hot-wire wake measurements were made in the near region downstream of the fan plane. The
fan noise was measured upstream of the fan. The experimentally obtained self-noise was then compared
to the predictions made by the semi-empirical acoustic model. Goody's and Rozenberg's models for
surface pressure spectra were used in the semi-empirical acoustic model. Rozenberg's model offered
a more accurate prediction in the final fan noise spectra. The predictions were in reasonable agreement
with experimental data, and the model was found to be a useful tool to reasonably estimate acoustic
emissions of a fan with limited information about the velocity field in the fan wake. Different operating
conditions and blade configurations were examined. For a given dimensionless operating condition,
the self-noise was obtained for different rotational speeds, and the effect of the fan speed on the
propagated noise was evaluated. The acoustic scaling function was experimentally obtained as
a function of normalized frequency and dimensionless operating condition and it was found to be
quite frequency dependent despite it is often assumed as a constant value.
