Coherent turbulent wave-packet structures in a jet at Reynolds number 460000 and Mach number 0.4
are extracted from experimental measurements and are modeled as linear fluctuations around the
mean flow. The linear model is based on harmonic optimal forcing structures and their associated
flow response at individual Strouhal numbers, obtained from analysis of the global linear resolvent
operator. These forcing-response wave packets ("resolvent modes") are first discussed with regard
to relevant physical mechanisms that provide energy gain of flow perturbations in the jet. Modal
shear instability and the nonmodal Orr mechanism are identified as dominant elements, cleanly
separated between the optimal and suboptimal forcing-response pairs. A theoretical development
in the framework of spectral covariance dynamics then explicates the link between linear harmonic
forcing-response structures and the cross-spectral density (CSD) of stochastic turbulent fluctuations.
A low-rank model of the CSD at given Strouhal number is formulated from a truncated set of linear resolvent
modes. Corresponding experimental CSD matrices are constructed from extensive two-point velocity
measurements. Their eigenmodes (spectral proper orthogonal or SPOD modes) represent coherent
wave-packet structures, and these are compared to their counterparts obtained from the linear
model. Close agreement is demonstrated in the range of "preferred mode" Strouhal numbers, around
a value of 0.4, between the leading coherent wave-packet structures as educed from the experiment
and from the linear resolvent-based model.
