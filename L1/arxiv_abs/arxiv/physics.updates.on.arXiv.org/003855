Ultrasound is increasingly being used to modulate the properties of biological membranes for applications
in drug delivery and neuromodulation. While various studies have investigated the mechanical
aspect of the interaction such as acoustic absorption and membrane deformation, it is not clear
how these effects transduce into biological functions, for example, changes in the permeability
or the enzymatic activity of the membrane. A critical aspect of the activity of an enzyme is the thermal
fluctuations of its solvation or hydration shell. Thermal fluctuations are also known to be directly
related to membrane permeability. Here solvation shell changes of lipid membranes subject to an
acoustic impulse were investigated using a fluorescence probe, Laurdan. Laurdan was embedded
in multi-lamellar lipid vesicles in water, which were exposed to broadband pressure impulses of
the order of 1MPa peak amplitude and 10{\mu}s pulse duration. An instrument was developed to monitor
changes in the emission spectrum of the dye at two wavelengths with sub-microsecond temporal resolution.
The experiments show that changes in the emission spectrum, and hence the fluctuations of the solvation
shell, are related to the changes in the thermodynamic state of the membrane and correlated with
the compression and rarefaction of the incident sound wave. The results suggest that acoustic fields
affect the state of a lipid membrane and therefore can potentially modulate the kinetics of channels
and proteins embedded in the membrane.
