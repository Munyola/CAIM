We present hydrodynamic and magneto-hydrodynamic simulations of a liquid sodium flow using the
compressible MHD code PLUTO to investigate the magnetic field regeneration in the Von-Karman-Sodium
dynamo experiment. The aim of the study is to analyze the influence of the fluid resistivity and turbulence
level on the collimation by helicoidal motions of a remnant magnetic field. We use a simplified cartesian
geometry to represent the flow dynamics in the vicinity of one cavity of a multi-blades impeller
inspired by those used in the Von-Karman-Sodium (VKS) experiment. We perform numerical simulations
with kinetic Reynolds numbers up to 1000 for magnetic Prandtl numbers between 30 and 0.1. Our study
shows that perfect ferromagnetic walls favour enhanced collimation of flow and magnetic fields
even if the turbulence degree of the model increases. The location of the helicoidal coherent vortex
in between the blades changes with the impinging velocity. It becomes closer to the upstream blade
and impeller base if the flow incident angle is analogous to the TM73 impeller configuration rotating
in the unscooping direction. This result is also obtained at higher kinetic Reynolds numbers when
the helicoidal vortex undergoes a precessing motion, leading to a reinforced effect in the vortex
evolution and in the magnetic field collimation when using again perfect ferromagnetic boundary
conditions. We estimate the efficiency of a hypothetical dynamo loop occurring in the vicinity
of the impeller and discuss the relevance of our findings in the context of mean field dynamo theory.
