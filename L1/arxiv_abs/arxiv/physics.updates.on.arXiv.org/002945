Localised response of a sensitive light detector, such as Hamamatsu H9500 multi anode photomultiplier
tube (MAPMT), is of vital importance for coded-aperture imaging systems. When coupled with a suitable
sensitive detector (e.g. EJ-299-34 plastic scintillator), output signals of the MAPMT can be retrieved
to infer the interaction location in the pixelated scintillator. Given the number of anodes in H9500
(256), significant processing power would be necessary to handle each pulse individually. Therefore,
a readout electronics system was developed, based on resistive network approach, which reduces
the number of output signals to individual X and Y coordinates, and subsequently allows particle
identification. Coordinates retrieved in this manner can be analysed in real time and used to infer
the two-dimensional location. Particle type can be also exploited by pulse shape discrimination
(PSD) application to the scintillator response. In this study, 169 anodes were used (due to coded-aperture
design rules), and reduced to two X and Y output signals. These have been digitised using a bespoke
FPGA based two channel 14-bit 150 MSPS digitiser. The digital data are transferred to a host application
using UART to USB converter operating at 12 Mbits/s. Promising results have been observed when the
scintillator's response was tested in single particle field of Cs-137. However, further tests
performed in the mixed-field environment of Cf-252 suggest that faster digitiser may be required
to obtain the required PSD performance.
