We present a numerical methodology for construction of reduced order models, ROMs, of fluid flows
through the combination of flow modal decomposition and regression analysis. Spectral proper
orthogonal decomposition, SPOD, is applied to reduce the dimensionality of the model and, at the
same time, filter the POD temporal modes. The regression step is performed by a deep feedforward
neural network, DNN, and the current framework is implemented in a context similar to the sparse
identification of non-linear dynamics algorithm, SINDy. A discussion on the optimization of the
DNN hyperparameters is provided for obtaining the best ROMs and an assessment of these models is
presented for a canonical nonlinear oscillator and the compressible flow past a cylinder. Then,
the method is tested on the reconstruction of a turbulent flow computed by a large eddy simulation
of a plunging airfoil under dynamic stall. The reduced order model is able to capture the dynamics
of the leading edge stall vortex and the subsequent trailing edge vortex. For the cases analyzed,
the numerical framework allows the prediction of the flowfield beyond the training window using
larger time increments than those employed by the full order model. We also demonstrate the robustness
of the current ROMs constructed via deep feedforward neural networks through a comparison with
sparse regression. The DNN approach is able to learn transient features of the flow and presents
more accurate and stable long-term predictions compared to sparse regression.
