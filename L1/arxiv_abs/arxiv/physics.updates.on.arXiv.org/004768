The spread of antimicrobial resistance calls for chronic wound management devices that can engage
with the wound exudate and signal infection by prompt visual effects. Here, the manufacture of a
two-layer fibrous device with independently-controlled exudate management capability and visual
infection responsivity was investigated by sequential free surface electrospinning of poly(methyl
methacrylate-co-methacrylic acid) (PMMA-co-MAA) and poly(acrylic acid) (PAA). By selecting
wound pH as infection indicator, PMMA-co-MAA fibres were encapsulated with halochromic bromothymol
blue (BTB) to trigger colour changes at infection-induced alkaline pH. Likewise, the exudate management
capability was integrated via the synthesis of a thermally-crosslinked network in electrospun
PAA layer. PMMA-co-MAA fibres revealed high BTB loading efficiency (> 80 wt.%) and demonstrated
prompt colour change and selective dye release at infected-like media (pH > 7). The synthesis of
the thermally-crosslinked PAA network successfully enabled high water uptake (up to nearly 2500
wt.%) and swelling index (up to nearly 300 a.%), in contrast to electrospun PAA controls. This dual
device functionality was lost when the same building blocks were configured in a single-layer mesh
of core-shell fibres, whereby significant BTB release (~ 70 wt.%) was measured even at acidic pH.
This study therefore demonstrates how the fibrous configuration can be conveniently manipulated
to trigger structure-induced functionalities critical to chronic wound management and monitoring.
