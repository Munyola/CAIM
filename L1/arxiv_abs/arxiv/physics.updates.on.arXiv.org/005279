Free-electron lasers (FELs) have been built ranging in wavelength from long-wavelength oscillators
using partial wave guiding through ultraviolet through hard x-ray FELs that are either seeded or
start from noise (SASE). Operation in the x-ray spectrum has relied on single-pass SASE due either
to the lack of seed lasers or difficulties in the design of x-ray mirrors. However, recent developments
in the production of diamond crystal Bragg reflectors point the way to the design of regenerative
amplifiers (RAFELs) which are, essentially, low-Q x-ray free-electron laser oscillators (XFELOs)
that out-couple a large fraction of the optical power on each pass. A RAFEL using a six-mirror resonator
providing out-coupling of 90% or more through a pinhole in the first downstream mirror is proposed
and analyzed using the MINERVA simulation code for the undulator interaction and the Optics Propagation
Code (OPC) for the resonator. MINERVA/OPC has been used in the past to simulate infrared FEL oscillators.
For the present purpose, OPC has been modified to treat Bragg reflection from diamond crystal mirrors.
The six-mirror resonator design has been analyzed within the context of the LCLS-II beamline under
construction at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center and using the HXR undulator which is also
to be installed on the LCLS-II beamline. Simulations have been run to optimize and characterize
the properties of the RAFEL, and indicate that substantial powers are possible at the fundamental
(3.05 keV) and third harmonic (9.15 keV).
