Symmetry and topology are two fundamental aspects of quantum states of matter such as the quantum
Hall effects. Band topology is often characterized by symmetry-protected quantization of Berry's
phases in wavevector space and is related to the quantum theory of polarization in crystals through
the Bloch-Wannier representation. Recently, a new class of topological materials, higher-order
topological insulators, were proposed and discovered, featuring bulk-edge-corner or bulk-surface-hinge
correspondence that goes beyond the conventional topological paradigm. A prototype is an insulator
with a topological quadrupole moment quantized by mirror symmetries, which leads to gapped edge
states and in-gap corner states. However, the existing quadrupole topological insulators are
based on a fine-tuned $\pi$-flux lattice model which does not directly illustrate the interplay
between symmetry and topology. Here, using tunable acoustic metacrystals, we discover experimentally
that the ``wallpaper" $p4g$ crystalline group leads to a symmetry-protected hierarchy of topological
Wannier multipoles: the lowest band gap has a quantized Wannier dipole and can mimic the quantum
spin Hall effect, while the second band gap gives an anomalous topological quadrupole and the bulk-edge-corner
correspondence. Such a topological hierarchy can be annihilated by tuning the metacrystal through
a geometry transition from the $p4g$ wallpaper group to the $C_{4v}$ point group, hence demonstrating
elegantly the fundamental relation between symmetry and topology...
