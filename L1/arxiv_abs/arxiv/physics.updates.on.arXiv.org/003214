In the first part of paper I propose the Construction Interpretation of the Quantum. The main point
of this interpretation is that (unlike previous interpretations) it is not actually an interpretation
but rather a methodology aimed to encourage a conceptually driven construction of a theory of Quantum
Gravity. In so doing we will, I hope, resolve the ontological problems that come along with Quantum
Theory. In the second part of this paper I offer a particular perspective on the theory of General
Relativity and set out a path of seven steps and three elements corresponding (more-or-less) to
the path that Einstein took to this theory. In the third part I review a particular operational approach
to Quantum Field Theory I have been developing - the operator tensor formulation. The physicality
condition (this ensures that probabilities are between 0 and 1 and that choices in the future cannot
effect the past) is discussed in some detail in this part and also in an appendix. In the fourth part
of the paper I set out one particular possible conceptually driven path to Quantum Gravity. This
approach works by establishing seven steps and three elements for a theory of Quantum Gravity that
are analogous to those of General Relativity. The holy grail in this approach is to generalize the
physicality conditions from Quantum Field theory (which presume definite causal structure) to
the new situation we find ourselves in in Quantum Gravity (where causal structure will be indefinite).
Such conditions, in the present approach, would be analogous to the Einstein Field Equations.
