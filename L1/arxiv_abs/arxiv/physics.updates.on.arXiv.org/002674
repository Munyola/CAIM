Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) allows to reconstruct the topography of surface with a resolution
in the nanometer range. The exceptional resolution attainable with the AFM makes this instrument
a key tool in nanoscience and technology. The core of the set-up relies on the detection of the mechanical
properties of a micro-oscillator when approached to a sample to image. Despite the fact that AFM
is nowadays a very common instrument for research and development applications, thanks to the exceptional
performances and the relative simplicity to use it, the fabrication of the micrometric scale mechanical
oscillator is still a very complicated and expensive task requiring a dedicated platform. Being
able to perform atomic force microscopy with a macroscopic oscillator would make the instrument
more versatile and accessible for an even larger spectrum of applications and audiences. We present
for the first time atomic force imaging with a centimetric oscillator. We show how it is possible
to perform topographical images with nanometric resolution with a grams tuning fork. The images
presented here are obtained with an aluminum tuning fork of centimeter size as sensor on which an
accelerometer is glued on one prong to measure the oscillation of the resonator. In addition to the
stunning sensitivity, by imaging both in air and in liquid, we show the high versatility of such oscillator.
The set up proposed here can be extended to numerous experiments where the probe needs to be heavy
and/or very complex as well as the environment.
