One of the major problems associated with exploitation of the copper ore deposit in underground
mines in Poland is the local disturbance in a state of stable equilibrium manifested in a sudden release
of strain energy stored in the deformed rock mass. It occurs mainly in the form of dynamic events which
may result in rockbursts and roof falls. In order to face this threats, a number of organisational
and technical prevention methods are applied in mines. It should be also noted that the greatest
difficulties with the roof control are observed in the vicinity of active mining fronts, where the
highest deformations are observed. The detonation of explosives generates a propagating shock
wave which may cause a serious damage to a material body that is encountered on its way. Thus, a number
of doubts during the mining operation emerged, that simultaneous firing of group of mining faces
may have the negative impact on the condition of applied roof support and condition of roof strata
as well The article discusses geomechanical influence of multi-faces blasting on immediate roof
strata condition through the mutual comparison of the instrumented bolts monitoring data and the
computer simulations results. The numerically assessed stress/strain field in the near vicinity
of the blasting works operation has proved to be in close agreement with the field measured data.
In the considered mining conditions both the numerical approach and field strain/stress monitoring
indicated the low effect of production blasting on the immediate roof fall potential.
