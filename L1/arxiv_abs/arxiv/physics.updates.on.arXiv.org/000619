Holmboe (1962) postulated that resonant interaction between two or more progressive, linear interfacial
waves produces exponentially growing instabilities in idealized (broken-line profiles), homogeneous
or density stratified, inviscid shear layers. In this paper, we generalize Holmboe's mechanistic
picture of linear shear instabilities by (i) not initially specifying the type of the waves, and
(ii) by providing the option for non-normal growth. We demonstrate the mechanism behind linear
shear instabilities by proposing a purely kinematic model consisting of two linear, Doppler-shifted,
progressive interfacial waves moving in opposite directions. Starting from arbitrary initial
conditions, the two waves eventually lock in phase and resonate (grow exponentially), provided
a certain condition is satisfied. This condition is shown to be the necessary and sufficient (N&S)
condition for exponentially growing instabilities in idealized shear flows. The instability
mechanism occurring prior to reaching steady state is non-modal, favouring rapid transient growth.
The theoretical underpinnings of our wave interaction model is analogous to that of synchronization
between two coupled harmonic oscillators. Our proposed model is used to study three well known types
of shear instabilities - Rayleigh/Kelvin-Helmholtz, Holmboe and Taylor-Caulfield. We show that
the N&S condition provides a range of unstable wavenumbers for each instability type, and this
range matches the predictions of the canonical normal-mode based linear stability theory.
