This paper describes a new code for simulating astrophysical plasmas that solves a hybrid model
composed of gyrokinetic ions (GKI) and an isothermal electron fluid (ITEF) [A. Schekochihin et
al., Astrophys. J. Suppl. \textbf{182}, 310 (2009)]. This model captures ion kinetic effects that
are important near the ion gyro-radius scale while electron kinetic effects are ordered out by an
electron-ion mass ratio expansion. The code is developed by incorporating the ITEF approximation
into {\tt AstroGK}, an Eulerian $\delta f$ gyrokinetics code specialized to a slab geometry [R.
Numata et al., J. Compute. Pays. \textbf{229}, 9347 (2010)]. The new code treats the linear terms
in the ITEF equations implicitly while the nonlinear terms are treated explicitly. We show linear
and nonlinear benchmark tests to prove the validity and applicability of the simulation code. Since
the fast electron timescale is eliminated by the mass ratio expansion, the Courant--Friedrichs--Lewy
condition is much less restrictive than in full gyrokinetic codes; the present hybrid code runs
$\sim 2\sqrt{m_\mathrm{i}/m_\mathrm{e}} \sim 100$ times faster than {\tt AstroGK}\ with a single
ion species and kinetic electrons where $m_\mathrm{i}/m_\mathrm{e}$ is the ion-electron mass
ratio. The improvement of the computational time makes it feasible to execute ion scale gyrokinetic
simulations with a high velocity space resolution and to run multiple simulations to determine
the dependence of turbulent dynamics on parameters such as electron--ion temperature ratio and
plasma beta.
