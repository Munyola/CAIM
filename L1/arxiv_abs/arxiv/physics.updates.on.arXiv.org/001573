We study the turbulent square duct flow of dense suspensions of neutrally-buoyant spherical particles.
Direct numerical simulations (DNS) are performed in the range of volume fractions $\phi=0-0.2$,
using the immersed boundary method (IBM) to account for the dispersed phase. Based on the hydraulic
diameter a Reynolds number of $5600$ is considered. We report flow features and particle statistics
specific to this geometry, and compare the results to the case of two-dimensional channel flows.
In particular, we observe that for $\phi=0.05$ and $0.1$, particles preferentially accumulate
on the corner bisectors, close to the duct corners as also observed for laminar square duct flows
of same duct-to-particle size ratios. At the highest volume fraction, particles preferentially
accumulate in the core region. For channel flows, in the absence of lateral confinement particles
are found instead to be uniformily distributed across the channel. We also observe that the intensity
of the cross-stream secondary flows increases (with respect to the unladen case) with the volume
fraction up to $\phi=0.1$, as a consequence of the high concentration of particles along the corner
bisector. For $\phi=0.2$ the turbulence activity is strongly reduced and the intensity of the secondary
flows reduces below that of the unladen case. The friction Reynolds number increases with $\phi$
in dilute conditions, as observed for channel flows. However, for $\phi=0.2$ the mean friction
Reynolds number decreases below the value for $\phi=0.1$.
