Investigations of a possible connection between population density and the propagation and magnitude
of epidemics have so far led to mixed and unconvincing results. There are three reasons for that.
(i) Previous studies did not focus on the appropriate density interval. (ii) For the density to be
a meaningful variable the population must be distributed as uniformly as possible. If an area has
towns and cities where a majority of the population is concentrated its average density is meaningless.
(iii) In the propagation of an epidemic the initial proportion of susceptibles (that is to say persons
who have not developed an immunity) is an essential, yet usually unknown, factor. The assumption
that most of the population is susceptible holds only for new strain of diseases. It will be shown
that when these requirements are taken care of, the size of epidemics is indeed closely connected
with the population density. This empirical observation comes as a welcome confirmation of the
classical KMK (Kermack-McKendrick 1927) model. Indeed, one of its key predictions is that the size
of the epidemic increases strongly (and in a non linear way) with the initial density of susceptibles.
An interesting consequence is that, contrary to common beliefs, in sparsely populated territories,
like Alaska, Australia or the west coast of the United states the size of epidemics among native populations
must have been limited by the low density even for diseases for which the natives had no immunity (i.e.,
were susceptibles).
