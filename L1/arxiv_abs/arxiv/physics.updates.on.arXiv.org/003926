Ultracompact nonlinear optical devices utilizing two-dimensional (2D) materials and nanostructures
are emerging as important elements of photonic circuits. Integration of the nonlinear material
into a subwavelength cavity or waveguide leads to a strong Purcell enhancement of the nonlinear
processes and compensates for a small interaction volume. The generic feature of such devices which
makes them especially challenging for analysis is strong dissipation of both the nonlinear polarization
and highly confined modes of a subwavelength cavity. Here we solve a quantum-electrodynamic problem
of the spontaneous and stimulated parametric down-conversion in a nonlinear quasi-2D waveguide
or cavity. We develop a rigorous Heisenberg-Langevin approach which includes dissipation and
fluctuations in the electron ensemble and in the electromagnetic field of a cavity on equal footing.
Within a relatively simple model, we take into account the nonlinear coupling of the quantized cavity
modes, their interaction with a dissipative reservoir and the outside world, amplification of
thermal noise and zero-point fluctuations of the electromagnetic field, and other relevant effects.
We derive closed-form analytic results for relevant quantities such as the spontaneous parametric
signal power and the threshold for parametric instability. We find a strong reduction in the parametric
instability threshold for 2D nonlinear materials in a subwavelength cavity and provide a comparison
with conventional nonlinear photonic devices.
