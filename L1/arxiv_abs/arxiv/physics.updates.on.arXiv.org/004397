Strongly coupled dusty plasma medium is often described as a viscoelastic fluid that retains its
memory. In a flowing dusty plasma medium, vortices of different sizes appear when the flow does not
remain laminar. The vortices also merge to transfer energy between different scales. In the present
work, we study the effect of viscoelasticity and compressibility over a localized vortex structure
and multiple rotational vortexes in a strongly coupled viscoelastic dusty plasma medium. In case
of single rotating vortex flow, a transverse wave is generated from the localized vortex source
and the evolution time of generated waves is found to be reduced due to finite viscoelasticity and
compressibility of the medium. It is found that the viscoelasticity suppresses the dispersion
of vorticity. In the presence of multiple vortices, we find, the vortex mergers get highly affected
in the presence of memory effect of the fluid, and thus the dynamics of the medium gets completely
altered compared to a non-viscoelastic fluid. For a compressible fluid, viscoelasticity damps
out the energy in the sonic waves generated in the medium. Thus a highly viscoelastic and compressible
fluid, in some cases, behaves similarly to an incompressible viscoelastic fluid. The wave-front
like rings propagate in elliptical orbits keeping the footprint of the earlier position of the point-vortex.
The rings collide with each other even within the patch vortex region forming regions of high vorticity
at the point of intersection and pass through each other.
