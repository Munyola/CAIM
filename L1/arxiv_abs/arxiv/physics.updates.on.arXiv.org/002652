The upper bound earthquake magnitude (maximum possible magnitude) of a truncated Gutenberg-Richter
relation is the right truncation point (right end-point) of a truncated exponential distribution
and is an important parameter in the probabilistic seismic hazard analysis. It is frequently estimated
by the Bayesian inference. This approach suffers some shortcomings. An important one is the convergence
of its point estimation towards infinity if the information content of the prior is decreasing.
This is in contrast to the regular Bayesian inference. From a statistical point of view, the Bayesian
inference is insufficient for the upper bound magnitude. As one consequence, important previous
non-Bayesian inference methods are outlined as alternatives and their weak points are discussed.
Due to various statistical reasons, the exponential distribution is suggested as approximation
for the confidence distributions, which determine the confidence interval or credible interval.
Additionally, the combination of prior information with a prior inference is deduced from the Bayesian
approach to consider prior information in the non-Bayesian inference. Besides, a new alternative
approach is suggested with three possible point estimators for the upper bound magnitude. Furthermore,
a design for a performance study is suggested - a Monte Carlo Simulation, wherein the random distribution
of the upper bound magnitude equals their prior distribution. Based on this design, the performance
of selected point estimators and confidence distributions is investigated...
