It is currently thought that the vast majority of ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) is powered
by neutron stars and stellar-mass black holes accreting at rates which may exceed the Eddington
limit by factors of a few up to hundreds. At these high accretion rates, radiation pressure is expected
to inflate the accretion disk and drive fast winds at significant fractions of the speed of light.
Evidence of such winds has been found in recent work with high-resolution grating spectrometers
(RGS) aboard XMM-Newton as well as moderate-resolution detectors. The thick disk structure and
the spectral energy distribution resembling those of a broadened disk significantly differ from
those of thin disk accretors such as sub-Eddington active galactic nuclei and X-ray binaries. The
thermal status of ULX winds, and of super-Eddington accretors in general, is therefore expected
to depart from sub-Eddington accreting objects. Here we show the first attempt to calculate the
photoionization balance of the winds driven by strong radiation pressure in thick disks with a focus
on ULXs, and the effects of different viewing angles. We find that the winds are generally in thermally
stable equilibrium, but long-term variations in the accretion rate and the inclination due to precession
may have significant effects on the appearance and stability. These trends can explain the correlation
between the spectral residuals around 1 keV and ULX spectral state. We also find a possible correlation
between the spectral hardness of the ULX, the wind velocity and the ionization parameter in support
of the general scenario.
