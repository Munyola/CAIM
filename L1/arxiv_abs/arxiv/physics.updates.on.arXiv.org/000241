Undulatory locomotion, a gait in which thrust is produced in the opposite direction of a traveling
wave of body bending, is a common mode of propulsion used by animals in fluids, on land, and even within
sand. As such it has been an excellent system for discovery of neuromechanical principles of movement.
In nearly all animals studied, the wave of muscle activation progresses faster than the wave of body
bending, leading to an advancing phase of activation relative to the curvature towards the tail.
This is referred to as "neuromechanical phase lags" (NPL). Several multi-parameter neuromechanical
models have reproduced this phenomenon, but due to model complexity the origin of the NPL has proved
difficult to identify. Here we use perhaps the simplest model of undulatory swimming to accurately
predict the NPL during sand-swimming by the sandfish lizard, with no fitting parameters. The sinusoidal
wave used in sandfish locomotion, the friction-dominated and non-inertial granular resistive
force environment, and the simplicity of the model allow detailed analysis, and reveal the fundamental
mechanism responsible for the phenomenon: the combination of synchronized torques from distant
points on the body and local traveling torques. This general mechanism should help explain the NPL
in organisms in other environments; we therefore propose that sand-swimming could be an excellent
system to quantitatively generate and test other neuromechanical models of movement. Such a system
can also provide guidance for the design and control of robotic undulatory locomotors in complex
environments.
