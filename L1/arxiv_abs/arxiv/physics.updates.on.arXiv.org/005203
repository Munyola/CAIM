We have built PRISM, a "Probabilistic Regression Instrument for Simulating Models". PRISM uses
the Bayes linear approach and history matching to construct an approximation ('emulator') of any
given model, by combining limited model evaluations with advanced regression techniques, covariances
and probability calculations. It is designed to easily facilitate and enhance existing Markov
chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods by restricting plausible regions and exploring parameter space
efficiently. However, PRISM can additionally be used as a standalone alternative to MCMC for model
analysis, providing insight into the behavior of complex scientific models. With PRISM, the time
spent on evaluating a model is minimized, providing developers with an advanced model analysis
for a fraction of the time required by more traditional methods. This paper provides an overview
of the different techniques and algorithms that are used within PRISM. We demonstrate the advantage
of using the Bayes linear approach over a full Bayesian analysis when analyzing complex models.
Our results show how much information can be captured by PRISM and how one can combine it with MCMC
methods to significantly speed up calibration processes (>15 times faster). PRISM is an open-source
Python package that is available under the BSD 3-Clause License (BSD-3) at https://github.com/1313e/PRISM
and hosted at https://prism-tool.readthedocs.io. PRISM has also been reviewed by "The Journal
of Open Source Software" (https://doi.org/10.21105/joss.01229).
