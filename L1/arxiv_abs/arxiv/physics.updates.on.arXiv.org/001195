Prostate cancer is the most common disease in men and the second leading cause of death from cancer.
Generic large imaging instruments used in cancer diagnosis have sensitivity, spatial resolution,
and contrast inadequate for the task of imaging details of a small organ such as the prostate. In addition,
multimodality imaging can play a significant role merging anatomical and functional details coming
from simultaneous PET and MRI. Indeed, multi-parametric PET/MRI was demonstrated to improve diagnosis,
but it suffers from too many false positives. In order to address the above limits of the current techniques,
we have proposed, built and tested, thanks to the TOPEM project funded by Italian National Institute
of Nuclear Phisics a prototype of an endorectal PET-TOF/MRI probe. In the applied magnification
PET geometry, performance is dominated by a high-resolution detector placed closer to the source.
The expected spatial resolution in the selected geometry is about 1.5 mm FWHM and efficiency a factor
of 2 with respect to what obtained with the conventional PET scanner. In our experimental studies,
we have obtained timing resolution of ~ 320 ps FWHM and at the same time Depth of Interaction (DOI)
resolution of under 1 mm. Tests also showed that mutual adverse PET-MR effects are minimal. In addition,
the matching endorectal RF coil was designed, built and tested. In the next planned studies, we expect
that benefiting from the further progress in scintillator crystal surface treatment, in SiPM technology
and associated electronics would allow us to significantly improve TOF resolution
