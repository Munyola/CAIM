Various interference effects are known to exist in the process of high harmonic generation (HHG)
both at the single atom and macroscopic levels. In particular, the quantum path difference between
the long and short trajectories of electron excursion causes the HHG yield to experience interference-based
temporal and spectral modulations. In solids, due to additional phenomena such as multi-band superposition
and crystal symmetry dependency, the HHG mechanism appears to be more complicated than in gaseous
atoms in identifying accompanying interference phenomena. Here, we first report experimental
data showing intensity-dependent spectral modulation and broadening of high harmonics observed
from bulk sapphire. Then, by adopting theoretical simulation, the extraordinary observation
is interpreted as a result of the quantum path interference between the long and short electron/hole
trajectories. Specifically, the long trajectory undergoes an intensity-dependent redshift,
which coherently combines with the short trajectory to exhibit spectral splitting in an anomalous
way of inverse proportion to the driving laser intensity. This quantum interference may be extended
to higher harmonics with increasing the laser intensity, underpinning the potential for precise
control of the phase matching and modulation even in the extreme ultraviolet and soft X-ray regime.
Further, this approach may act as a novel tool for probing arbitrary crystals so as to adjust the electron
dynamics of higher harmonics for attosecond spectroscopy.
