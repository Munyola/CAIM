Grain size is an important control on mantle viscosity and permeability, but is difficult or impossible
to measure in situ. We construct a two-dimensional, single phase model for the steady-state mean
grain size beneath a mid-ocean ridge. The mantle rheology is modelled as a composite of diffusion
creep, dislocation creep, dislocation accommodated grain boundary sliding, and a plastic stress
limiter. The mean grain size is calculated by the piezometric relationship of Austin and Evans [2007].
We investigate the sensitivity of our model to global variations in grain growth exponent, potential
temperature, spreading-rate, and mantle hydration. We interpret the mean mean grain-size field
in the context of permeability. The permeability structure due to mean grain size may be approximated
as a high permeability region beneath a low permeability region. The transition between high and
low permeability regions forms a boundary that is steeply sloped toward the ridge axis. We hypothesise
that such a permeability structure generated from the variability of the mean grain size may be able
to focus melt towards the ridge axis, analogous to a Sparks and Parmentier [1991]-type focusing.
This focusing may, in turn, constrain the region where significant melt fractions are observed
by seismic or magnetotelluric surveys. This interpretation of melt focusing via the grain-size
permeability structure is consistent with MT observation of the asthenosphere beneath the East
Pacific Rise [Baba et al., 2006, Key et al., 2013].
