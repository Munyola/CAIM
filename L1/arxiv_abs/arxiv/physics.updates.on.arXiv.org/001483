Efficient and high-fidelity prior sampling and inversion for complex geological media is still
a largely unsolved challenge. Here, we use a deep neural network of the variational autoencoder
type to construct a parametric low-dimensional base model parameterization of complex binary
geological media. For inversion purposes, it has the attractive feature that random draws from
an uncorrelated standard normal distribution yield model realizations with spatial characteristics
that are in agreement with the training set. In comparison with the most commonly used parametric
representations in probabilistic inversion, we find that our dimensionality reduction (DR) approach
outperforms principle component analysis (PCA), optimization-PCA (OPCA) and discrete cosine
transform (DCT) DR techniques for unconditional geostatistical simulation of a channelized prior
model. For the considered examples, important compression ratios (200 - 500) are achieved. Given
that the construction of our parameterization requires a training set of several tens of thousands
of prior model realizations, our DR approach is more suited for probabilistic (or deterministic)
inversion than for unconditional (or point-conditioned) geostatistical simulation. Probabilistic
inversions of 2D steady-state and 3D transient hydraulic tomography data are used to demonstrate
the DR-based inversion. For the 2D case study, the performance is superior compared to current state-of-the-art
multiple-point statistics inversion by sequential geostatistical resampling (SGR). Inversion
results for the 3D application are also encouraging.
