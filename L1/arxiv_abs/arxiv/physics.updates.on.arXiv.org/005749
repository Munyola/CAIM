We investigate the dynamics of an Airy pulse that experiences free carrier generated optical linear
potential in the vicinity of zero group velocity dispersion (GVD) wavelength inside a Si based waveguide.
The optically induced potential can be realized by an inhomogeneous medium which possesses a time
dependent refractive index. We propose a pump-probe scheme in Si-based waveguide where a strong
continuous wave (CW) pump excites free carriers that leads to a linear potential through a time dependent
refractive index change which is experienced by the finite energy Airy pulse (FEAP) (probe). The
linear potential significantly manipulate the dynamics of a FEAP and leads to a monotonous spectral
shift. We mathematically model the dynamics of the Airy pulse using linear dispersion equation
containing an optical potential term and establish the general solution of the pulse for non-vanishing
third order dispersion (TOD). We derive the expression of the trajectory of FEAP which deviates
significantly from its usual ballistic nature and can be tailored with the strength of the linear
potential. For positive TOD, the propagating Airy pulse experiences a singularity and flips in
time domain. We theoretically derive that for a specific potential strength the flipping region
is squeezed to a point and revives thereafter. We propose an exact analytical solution beyond flipping
region for this specific case. Our theoretical analysis corroborates well with the numerical results.
The present study may be useful in applications related to pulse reshaping and trajectory manipulation
