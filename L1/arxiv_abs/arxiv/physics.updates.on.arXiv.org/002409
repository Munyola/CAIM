Microfluidics is an established multidisciplinary research domain with widespread applications
in the fields of medicine, biotechnology and engineering. Conventional production methods of
microfluidic chips have been limited to planar structures, preventing the exploitation of truly
three-dimensional architectures for applications such as multi-phase droplet preparation or
wet-phase fibre spinning. Here the challenge of nanofabrication inside a microfluidic chip is
tackled for the showcase of a spider-inspired spinneret. Multiphoton lithography, an additive
manufacturing method, was used to produce free-form microfluidic masters, subsequently replicated
by soft lithography. Into the resulting microfluidic device, a threedimensional spider-inspired
spinneret was directly fabricated in-chip via multiphoton lithography. Applying this unprecedented
fabrication strategy, the to date smallest printed spinneret nozzle is produced. This spinneret
resides tightly sealed, connecting it to the macroscopic world. Its functionality is demonstrated
by wet-spinning of single-digit micron fibres through a polyacrylonitrile coagulation process
induced by a water sheath layer. The methodology developed here demonstrates fabrication strategies
to interface complex architectures into classical microfluidic platforms. Using multiphoton
lithography for in-chip fabrication adopts a high spatial resolution technology for improving
geometry and thus flow control inside microfluidic chips. The showcased fabrication methodology
is generic and will be applicable to multiple challenges in fluid control and beyond.
