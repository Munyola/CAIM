Objective: Minimal literature exists investigating changes in inflammation with respect to the
main nasal cavity (MNC) and paranasal sinuses (PS) before and after maximal medical therapy (MMT)
for chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS). We hypothesized that MMT produces a differential level of change
in the volume of air space in the MNC and PS, and that resolution of mucosal disease associated with
the osteomeatal complex (OMC) influences clinical response to MMT. Study Design: Retrospective
study of 12 pre- and post-MMT sinus-CT scans from 6 subjects with CRS, of which three succeeded and
three failed therapy. Methods: Mimics was used to create 3D-models of the MNC and PS, and then analysis
of the models was performed. Results: Mean differences in the sinonasal volume were 7866.5+/-4339.9
mm3 and 17869.10+/-19472.70 mm3, amongst the failures and successes, respectively. There is wide
variability in the contribution of PS and MNC airspace volume change to the overall change in the
sinonasal volume. In two subjects, the direction of volume change in the MNC and PS diverged with
respect to the overall change in volume. Line-of-sight analysis demonstrated that successful
responders to MMT had more patent MNC with direct access to the OMC. Conclusions: There is a differential
contribution to sinonasal, airspace volume change after MMT, when comparing the MNC and PS. Response
to MMT may not be solely attributable to PS change and may include a function of MNC change. Line-of-sight
models suggest that direct access to the OMC may impact response to MMT.
