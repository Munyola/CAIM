We apply the method of data-interpolating empirical orthogonal functions (EOFs) to ground-based
magnetic vector data from the SuperMAG archive to produce a series of month length reanalyses of
the surface external and induced magnetic field (SEIMF) in 110,000 km$^{2}$ equal-area bins over
the entire northern polar region at 5 min cadence over solar cycle 23, from 1997.0 to 2009.0. Each
EOF reanalysis also decomposes the measured SEIMF variation into a hierarchy of spatiotemporal
patterns which are ordered by their contribution to the monthly magnetic field variance. We find
that the leading EOF patterns can each be (subjectively) interpreted as well-known SEIMF systems
or their equivalent current systems. The relationship of the equivalent currents to the true current
flow is not investigated. We track the leading SEIMF or equivalent current systems of similar type
by intermonthly spatial correlation and apply graph theory to (objectively) group their appearance
and relative importance throughout a solar cycle, revealing seasonal and solar cycle variation.
In this way, we identify the spatiotemporal patterns that maximally contribute to SEIMF variability
over a solar cycle. We propose this combination of EOF and graph theory as a powerful method for objectively
defining and investigating the structure and variability of the SEIMF or their equivalent ionospheric
currents for use in both geomagnetism and space weather applications. It is demonstrated here on
solar cycle 23 but is extendable to any epoch with sufficient data coverage.
