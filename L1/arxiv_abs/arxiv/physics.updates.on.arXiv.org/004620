The LPCTrap experiment uses an open Paul trap which was built to enable precision measurements in
the beta decay of radioactive ions. The initial goal was the precise measurement of the beta-neutrino
angular correlation coefficient in the decay of 6He. Its geometry results from a careful optimization
of the harmonic potential created by cylindrical electrodes. It supersedes previously considered
geometries that presented a smaller detection solid angle to the beta particle and the recoiling
ion. We describe here the methods which were used for the potential optimization, and we present
the measured performances in terms of trapping time, cloud size and temperature, and space charge
related limits. The properties of the ion cloud at equilibrium are well reproduced by a simple numerical
simulation using hard sphere collisions, which additionally gives insights on the trapping loss
mechanism. The interpretation for the observed trapping liftetimes is further corroborated by
a model recently developed for ion clouds in Paul traps. The open trap shall serve other projects.
It is currently used for commissioning purpose in the TRAPSENSOR experiment and is also considered
in tests of the Standard Model involving the beta decay of polarized $^{23}$Mg and $^{39}$Ca ion
in the frame of the MORA experiment. The latter tests require in-trap polarization of the ions and
further optimization of the trapping and detection setup. Based on the results of the simulations
and of their interpretations given by the model, different improvements of the trapping setup are
discussed.
