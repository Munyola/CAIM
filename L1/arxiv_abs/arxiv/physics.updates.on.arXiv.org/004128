We present a purely numerical approach in Cartesian grid, for efficient computation of Hartree-Fock
(HF) exchange contribution in the HF and density functional theory models. This takes inspiration
from a recently developed algorithm [Liu \emph{et al.}, J.~Chem.~Theor.~Comput.~ \textbf{13},
2571 (2017)]. A key component is the accurate evaluation of electrostatic potential integral,
which is the rate-determining step. This introduces the Fourier convolution theorem in conjunction
with a range-separated Coulomb interaction kernel. The latter is efficiently mapped into real
grid through a simple optimization procedure, giving rise to a constraint in the range-separated
parameter. The overall process offers logarithmic scaling with respect to molecular size. It is
then extended towards global hybrid functionals such as B3LYP, PBE0 and BHLYP within pseudopotential
Kohn-Sham theory, through an LCAO-MO ansatz in Cartesian grid, developed earlier in our laboratory.
For sake of comparison, a parallel semi-numerical approach has also been worked out that exploits
the familiar Obara-Saika recursion algorithm. An excellent agreement between these two routes
is demonstrated through total energy and orbital energy in a series of atoms and molecules (including
10 $\pi$-electron molecules), employing an LANL2DZ-type basis function. A critical analysis
of these two algorithms reveals that the proposed numerical scheme could lead to very attractive
and competitive scaling. The success of our approach also enables us for further development of
optimally tuned range-separated hybrid and hyper functionals.
