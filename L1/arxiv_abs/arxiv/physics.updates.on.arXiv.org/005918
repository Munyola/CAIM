Positron Annihilation Lifetime Spectroscopy (PALS) is a non-destructive radiological technique
widely used in material science studies. PALS typically relies on an analog coincidence measurement
setup and allows the estimate of the positron lifetime in a material sample under investigation.
The positronium trapping at vacancies in the material results in an increased lifetime. In this
work, we have developed and optimized a PALS experimental setup using organic scintillators, fast
digitizers, and advanced pulse processing algorithms. We tested three pairs of different organic
scintillation detectors: EJ-309 liquid, EJ-276 newly developed plastic, and BC-418 plastic,
and optimized the data processing parameters for each pair separately. Our high-throughput data
analysis method is based on single-pulse interpolation and a constant fraction discrimination
(CFD) algorithm. The setup based on the BC-418 detector achieved the best time resolution of 198.3
+- 0.8 ps. We used such optimized setup to analyze two single-crystal quartz samples and found lifetimes
of 156 +- 9 ps and 366 +- 22 ps, in good agreement with the characteristic time constants of this material.
The proposed experimental set up achieve an excellent time resolution, which makes it possible
to accurately characterize material vacancies by discriminating between the lifetimes of either
the spin singlet or triplet states of positronium. The optimized data processing algorithms are
relevant to all the applications where fast timing is important, such as nuclear medicine and radiation
imaging.
