We study the behaviour of shocked wind-electrons leaving wind-driving stars after undergoing
the outer wind termination shock. As an example, we describe the evolution of the keV-energetic
electron distribution function downstream of the heliospheric termination shock. We start from
a kinetic transport equation in the bulk frame of the heliosheath plasma flow taking into account
shock-induced electron injection, convective changes, cooling processes, and whistler wave-induced
energy diffusion. From this equation we proceed to an associated pressure moment of the electron
distribution function arriving at a corresponding pressure transport equation which describes
the evolution of the electron pressure in the bulk frame of the plasma along the plasma flow lines.
We assume that the local distribution function, in view of the prevailing non-LTE conditions, is
represented by a local kappa function with local kappa parameters that vary with the streamline
coordinate $s$ downstream of the solar wind termination shock. We obtain the solution for the electron
pressure as a function of the streamline coordinate $s$ from the pressure transport equation and
demonstrate that, connected with this pressure, one obtains an expression for the entropy of the
electron fluid which can also be derived as a streamline function. We show that the heliosheath electron
fluid can essentially be characterized as an isobaric and isentropic flow. These results allow
to generally conclude that astrotail plasma flows are characterized as such flows.
