This work presents a review of previous articles dealing with an original turbulence theory proposed
by the author, and provides new theoretical insights into some related issues. The new theoretical
procedures and methodological approaches confirm and corroborate the previous results. These
articles study the regime of homogeneous isotropic turbulence for incompressible fluids and propose
theoretical approaches based on a specific Lyapunov theory for determining the closures of the
von K\'arm\'an-Howarth and Corrsin equations, and the statistics of velocity and temperature
difference. Furthermore, novel theoretical issues are here presented among which we can mention
the following ones. The bifurcation rate of the velocity gradient, calculated along fluid particles
trajectories, is shown to be much larger than the corresponding maximal Lyapunov exponent. On that
basis, an interpretation of the energy cascade phenomenon is given and the statistics of finite
time Lyapunov exponent of the velocity gradient is shown to be represented by normal distribution
functions. Next, the self--similarity produced by the proposed closures is analyzed, and a proper
bifurcation analysis of the closed von K\'arm\'an--Howarth equation is performed. This latter
investigates the route from developed turbulence toward the non--chaotic regimes, leading to
an estimate of the critical Taylor scale Reynolds number. A proper statistical decomposition based
on extended distribution functions and on the Navier--Stokes equations is presented, which leads
to the statistics of velocity and temperature difference.
