A recently developed Projection-based Digital Image Correlation (P-DVC) method is here extended
to 4D (space and time) displacement field measurement and mechanical identification based on a
single radiograph per loading step instead of volumes as in standard DVC methods. Two levels of data
reductions are exploited, namely, reduction of the data acquisition (and time) by a factor of 1000
and reduction of the solution space by exploiting model reduction techniques. The analysis of a
complete tensile elastoplastic test composed of 127 loading steps performed in 6 minutes is presented.
The 4D displacement field as well as the elastoplastic constitutive law are identified. Keywords:
Image-based identification, Model reduction, Fast 4D identification, In-situ tomography measurements.
INTRODUCTION Identification and validation of increasingly complex mechanical models is a major
concern in experimental solid mechanics. The recent developments of computed tomography coupled
with in-situ tests provide extremely rich and non-destructive analyses [1]. In the latter cases,
the sample was imaged inside a tomograph, either with interrupted mechanical load or with a continuously
evolving loading and on-the-fly acquisitions (as ultra-fast X-ray synchrotron tomography, namely,
20 Hz full scan acquisition for the study of crack propagation [2]). Visualization of fast transformations,
crack openings, or unsteady behavior become accessible. Combined with full-field measurements,
in-situ tests offer a quantitative basis for identifying a broad range of mechanical behavior.
