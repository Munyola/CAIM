A simplified analytical model of the resonant interaction of the beam of Larmor electrons drifting
in the crossed constant fields of a magnetron with a synchronous wave providing a phase grouping
of the drifting charge was developed to optimize the parameters of an rf resonant injected signal
driving the magnetrons for management of phase and power of rf sources with a rate required for superconducting
high-current accelerators. The model, which considers the impact of the rf resonant signal injected
into the magnetron on the operation of the injection-locked tube, substantiates the recently developed
method of fast power control of magnetrons in the range up to 10 dB at the highest generation efficiency,
with low noise, precise stability of the carrier frequency, and the possibility of wideband phase
control. Experiments with continuous wave 2.45 GHz, 1 kW microwave oven magnetrons have verified
the correspondence of the behavior of these tubes to the analytical model. A proof of the principle
of the novel method of power control in magnetrons, based on the developed model, was demonstrated
in the experiments. The method is attractive for high-current superconducting rf accelerators.
This paper also discusses vector methods of power control with the rates required for superconducting
accelerators, the impact of the rf resonant signal injected into the magnetron on the rate of phase
control of the injection-locked tubes, and a conceptual scheme of the magnetron transmitter with
highest efficiency for high-current accelerators.
