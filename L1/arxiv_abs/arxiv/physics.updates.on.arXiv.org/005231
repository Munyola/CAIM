Photoacoustic computed tomography (PACT), also known as optoacoustic tomography, is an emerging
imaging technique that holds great promise for biomedical imaging. PACT is a hybrid imaging method
that can exploit the strong endogenous contrast of optical methods along with the high spatial resolution
of ultrasound methods. In its canonical form that is addressed in this article, PACT seeks to estimate
the photoacoustically-induced initial pressure distribution within the object. Image reconstruction
methods are employed to solve the acoustic inverse problem associated with the image formation
process. When an idealized imaging scenario is considered, analytic solutions to the PACT inverse
problem are available; however, in practice, numerous challenges exist that are more readily addressed
within an optimization-based, or iterative, image reconstruction framework. In this article,
the PACT image reconstruction problem is reviewed within the context of modern optimization-based
image reconstruction methodologies. Imaging models that relate the measured photoacoustic wavefields
to the sought-after object function are described in their continuous and discrete forms. The basic
principles of optimization-based image reconstruction from discrete PACT measurement data are
presented, which includes a review of methods for modeling the PACT measurement system response
and other important physical factors. Non-conventional formulations of the PACT image reconstruction
problem, in which acoustic parameters of the medium are concurrently estimated along with the PACT
image, are also introduced and reviewed.
