Long-term bone healing/adaptation after a dental implant treatment starts with diffusion of mesenchymal
stem cells to the fracture callus and their subsequent differentiation. The healing phase is followed
by the bone-remodeling phase. In this work, a mechano-regulatory cellular differentiation model
was used to simulate tissue healing around an immediately loaded dental implant. All tissue types
were modeled as poroelastic in the healing phase. Material properties of the healing region were
updated after each loading cycle for 30 cycles (days). The tissue distribution in the healed state
was then used as the initial condition for the remodeling phase during which regions healed into
bone adapt their internal density with respect to a homeostatic remodeling stimulus. The short-
and long-term effects of micro-motion on bone healing and remodeling were studied. Development
of soft tissue was observed both in the coronal region due to high fluid velocity, and on the vertical
sides of the healing-callus due to high shear stress. In cases with small implant micromotion, tissue
between the implant threads differentiated into bone during the healing phase, but resorbed during
remodeling. In cases with large implant micromotion, higher percentage of the healing region differentiated
into soft tissue resulting in less volume available for bone remodeling. But, the remaining bone
region developed higher density bone tissue. It was concluded that an optimal range of controlled
micromotion could be designed for a given implant in order to achieve the desired functional properties.
