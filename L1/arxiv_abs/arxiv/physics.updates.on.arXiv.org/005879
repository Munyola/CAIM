Early recordings of nervous conduction revealed a notable thermal signature associated with the
electrical signal. The observed production and subsequent absorption of heat arise from physicochemical
processes that occur at the cell membrane level during the conduction of the action potential. In
particular, the reversible release of electrical energy stored as a difference of potential across
the cell membrane appears as a simple yet consistent explanation for the heat production, as proposed
in the "Condenser Theory." However, the Condenser Theory has not been analyzed beyond the analogy
between the cell membrane and a parallel-plate capacitor, i.e. a condenser, which cannot account
for the magnitude of the heat signature. In this work, we use a detailed electrostatic model of the
cell membrane to revisit the Condenser Theory. We derive expressions for free energy and entropy
changes associated with the depolarization of the membrane by the action potential, which give
a direct measure of the heat produced and absorbed by neurons. We show how the density of surface charges
on both sides of the membrane impacts the energy changes. Finally, considering a typical action
potential, we show that if the membrane holds a bias of surface charges, such that the internal side
of the membrane is 0.05 C m$^{-2}$ more negative than the external side, the size of the heat predicted
by the model reaches the range of experimental values. Based on our study, we identify the change
in electrical energy of the membrane as the primary mechanism of heat production and absorption
by neurons during nervous conduction.
