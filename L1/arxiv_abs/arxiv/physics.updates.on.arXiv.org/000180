Herein I propose a multi-scale dynamical analysis to facilitate the physical interpretation of
tide gauge records. The technique uses graphical diagrams. It is applied to six secular-long tide
gauge records representative of the world oceans: Sydney, Pacific coast of Australia; Fremantle,
Indian Ocean coast of Australia; New York City, Atlantic coast of USA; Honolulu, U.S. state of Hawaii;
San Diego, U.S. state of California; and Venice, Mediterranean Sea, Italy. For comparison, an equivalent
analysis is applied to the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) index and to the Atlantic Multidecadal
Oscillation (AMO) index. Finally, a global reconstruction of sea level and a reconstruction of
the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index are analyzed and compared: both sequences cover about
three centuries from 1700 to 2000. The proposed methodology quickly highlights oscillations and
teleconnections among the records at the decadal and multidecadal scales. At the secular time scales
tide gauge records present relatively small (positive or negative) accelerations, as found in
other studies. On the contrary, from the decadal to the secular scales (up to 110-year intervals)
the tide gauge accelerations oscillate significantly from positive to negative values mostly
following the PDO, AMO and NAO oscillations. In particular, the influence of a large quasi 60-70
year natural oscillation is clearly demonstrated in these records. The multiscale dynamical evolutions
of the rate and of the amplitude of the annual seasonal cycle of the chosen six tide gauge records are
also studied.
