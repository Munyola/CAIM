Given the piecewise approach to modeling intermolecular interactions for force fields, they can
be difficult to parameterize since they are fit to data like total energies that only indirectly
connect to their separable functional forms. Furthermore, by neglecting certain types of molecular
interactions such as charge penetration and charge transfer, most classical force fields must
rely on, but do not always demonstrate, how cancellation of errors occurs among the remaining molecular
interactions accounted for such as exchange repulsion, electrostatics, and polarization. In
this work we present the first generation of the (many-body) MB-UCB force field that explicitly
accounts for the decomposed molecular interactions commensurate with a variational energy decomposition
analysis, including charge transfer, with force field design choices that reduce the computational
expense of the MB-UCB potential while remaining accurate. We optimize parameters using only single
water molecule and water cluster data up through pentamers, with no fitting to condensed phase data,
and we demonstrate that high accuracy is maintained when the force field is subsequently validated
against conformational energies of larger water cluster data sets, radial distribution functions
of the liquid phase, and the temperature dependence of thermodynamic and transport water properties.
We conclude that MB-UCB is comparable in performance to MB-Pol, but is less expensive and more transferable
by eliminating the need to represent short-ranged interactions through large parameter fits to
high order polynomials.
