Parker spiral theory predicts the heliospheric magnetic field (HMF) will have components of opposite
polarity radially toward the Sun and tangentially antiparallel to the solar rotation (i.e. in GSE
coordinates, with Bx/By<0). This theory explains the average orientation of the HMF very well but
does not predict orthogardenhose (OGH) flux with BX/BY>0 that is often observed. We here study the
occurrence and structure of OGH flux, as seen in near-Earth space (r=1AU) and by the Helios spacecraft
at 0.29<r<1AU, in order to evaluate the contributions to OGH flux generation of the various mechanisms
and factors that are not accounted for in Parker spiral theory. We study the loss of OGH flux with increasing
averaging timescale between 16 seconds and 100 hours and so determine its spectrum of scale sizes.
OGH flux at sunspot minimum is shown to be more common than at sunspot maximum and caused by smaller-scale
structure in the HMF, with a mode temporal scale at a fixed point of 10hrs compared to 40hrs. OGH generated
by rotating the HMF through the radial direction is also shown to differ in its spectrum of scale sizes
from that generated by rotating the HMF through the tangential direction: the former does not contribute
to the excess open heliospheric flux at a given r but the latter does. We show that roughly half of the
HMF deflection from the ideal Parker spiral giving OGH at Earth occurs at r below 0.3AU. We highlight
some questions which can be addressed by the Parker Solar Probe mission which will study the HMF down
to r=0.046AU.
