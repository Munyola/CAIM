The network paradigm is widely accepted as the gold standard in modelling complex systems such as
epidemics or neuronal activity in the brain; however, in most cases, the exact nature of the network
on which such dynamics unfold is unknown. This has motivated a significant amount of work on network
inference. Whilst a large body of work is concerned with inferring network structure based on detailed
node-level temporal data, in this work we tackle the more challenging scenario of inferring the
family of the underlying network when only population-level temporal incidence data are available.
A key obstacle is the forbiddingly high dimensionality of the resulting stochastic epidemic model.
To tackle this, we approximate the susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) model on networks
by a Birth-Death process, whose rates encode the structure of the underlying network and disease
dynamics. Using systematic simulations, we propose a parsimonious (three-parameter) model of
these rates and show that different wellknown network families map onto distinct regions of the
parameter space of this model. This result provides an a priori characterisation of different network
families. Then, given populationlevel temporal epidemic data, we employ a Bayesian classifier
to derive posterior distributions over diferent network families. We show that the proposed methodology
yields excellent results when tested on synthetic and real-world networks. Our framework extends
readily to many network families and spreading processes and it could provide a new benchmark in
network inference from population-level data.
