We examine how known unstable equilibria of the Navier-Stokes equations in plane Couette flow adapt
to the presence of an imposed stable density difference between the two boundaries for varying values
of the Prandtl number $Pr$, the ratio of viscosity to density diffusivity, and fixed moderate Reynolds
number, $Re=400$. In the two asymptotic limits $Pr \to 0$ and $Pr \to \infty$, it is found that such
solutions exist at arbitrarily high bulk stratification but for different physical reasons. In
the $Pr \to 0$ limit, density variations away from a constant stable density gradient become vanishingly
small as diffusion of density dominates over advection, allowing equilibria to exist for bulk Richardson
number $Ri_b \lesssim O(Re^{-2}Pr^{-1})$. Alternatively, at high Prandtl numbers, density becomes
homogenised in the interior by the dominant advection which creates strongly stable stratified
boundary layers that recede into the wall as $Pr\to\infty$. In this scenario, the density stratification
and the flow essentially decouple, thereby mitigating the effect of increasing $Ri_b$. An asymptotic
analysis is presented in the passive scalar regime $Ri_b \lesssim O(Re^{-2})$, which reveals $O(Pr^{-1/3})$-thick
stratified boundary layers with $O(Pr^{-2/9})$-wide eruptions, giving rise to density fingers
of $O(Pr^{-1/9})$ length and $O(Pr^{-4/9})$ width that invade an otherwise homogeneous interior.
Finally, increasing $Re$ to $10^5$ in this regime reveals that interior stably stratified density
layers can form away from the boundaries, separating well-mixed regions.
