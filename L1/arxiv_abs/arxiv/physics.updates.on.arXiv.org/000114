ALICE is a general purpose experiment dedicated to the study of nucleus-nucleus collisions at LHC.
After more than 3 years of successful operation, an upgrade of the apparatus during the second long
shutdown of LHC (LS2) in 2017/18 is in preparation. One of the major goals of the proposed upgrade
is to extend the physics reach for rare probes at low transverse momentum. The reconstruction of
the rare probes requires a precise determination of the primary and secondary vertices that is performed
in ALICE by the Inner Tracking System (ITS). The present ITS made of 6 layers of three technologies
of silicon devices allows, for example, to reconstruct D mesons with the transverse momentum down
to ~2 GeV/c. Further extension of this range towards lower pT requires the installation of the new
ITS consisting of 7 layers of silicon detectors with significantly better single point resolution
and reduced material budget. It is expected that the new system will allow to improve the impact parameter
resolution by a factor of ~3. Moreover, the data rate capability of the upgraded ITS should be significantly
improved in order to exploit the full expected LHC lead-lead interaction rate of 50 kHz, almost two
orders of magnitude above the present readout rate. The present contribution describes first the
ITS upgrade requirements followed by the conceptual design of the new system and its expected performance.
Secondly, an overview of the different R&D activities from the concept towards the final detector
is given.
