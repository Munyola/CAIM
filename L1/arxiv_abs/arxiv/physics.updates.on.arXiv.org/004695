The Bertrand theorem concluded that; the Kepler potential, and the isotropic harmonic oscillator
potential are the only systems under which all the orbits are closed. It was never stressed enough
in the physical or mathematical literature that this is only true when the potentials are independent
of the initial conditions of motion, which, as we know, determine the values of the constants of motion
$E$ and $L$. In other words, the Bertrand theorem is correct only when $V\equiv V(r)\neq V(r,E,L)$.
It has been derived in this work an alternative orbit equation, which is a substitution to the Newton's
orbit equation. Through this equation, it was proved that there are infinitely many energy angular
momentum dependent potentials $V(r,E,L)$ that lead to closed orbits. The study was done by generalizing
the well known substitution $r=1/u$ in Newton's orbit equation to the substitution $r=1/s(u,E,L)$
in the equation of motion. This have led to a new orbit equation that was called the alternative orbit
equation. From this equation the results from Bertrand theorem can be derived. The equation was
used to study different orbits with different periodicity like second order linear differential
equation periodicity orbits and Weierstrasse periodicity orbits, where interestingly it has
been shown that the energy must be discrete so that the orbits can be closed. By this approach countless
of solvable system can be found with closed orbits. Further application was discussed, like applications
in Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization, and in stellar kinematics.
