The Yangtze River has been subject to heavy flooding throughout history, and in recent times severe
floods such as those in 1998 have resulted in heavy loss of life and livelihoods. Dams along the river
help to manage flood waters, and are important sources of electricity for the region. Being able
to forecast high-impact events at long lead times therefore has enormous potential benefit. Recent
improvements in seasonal forecasting mean that dynamical climate models can start to be used directly
for operational services. The teleconnection from El Ni\~no to Yangtze River basin rainfall meant
that the strong El Ni\~no in winter 2015/2016 provided a valuable opportunity to test the application
of a dynamical forecast system. This paper therefore presents a case study of a real time seasonal
forecast for the Yangtze River basin, building on previous work demonstrating the retrospective
skill of such a forecast. A simple forecasting methodology is presented, in which the forecast probabilities
are derived from the historical relationship between hindcast and observations. Its performance
for 2016 is discussed. The heavy rainfall in the May-June-July period was correctly forecast well
in advance. August saw anomalously low rainfall, and the forecasts for the June-July-August period
correctly showed closer to average levels. The forecasts contributed to the confidence of decision-makers
across the Yangtze River basin. Trials of climate services such as this help to promote appropriate
use of seasonal forecasts, and highlight areas for future improvements.
