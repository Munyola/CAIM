It is crucial that societies are informed on the risks of impoverished ecosystem health for their
well-being. For this purpose, Ecological Integrity (EI) is a useful concept that seeks to capture
the complex nature of ecosystems and their interaction with social welfare. But the challenge remains
to measure EI and translate scientific terminology into operational language to inform society.
We propose an approach that simplifies marine ecosystem complexity by applying scientific knowledge
to identify which components reflect the state or state change of ecosystems. It follows a bottom-up
structure that identifies, based on expert knowledge, biological components related with past
and present changing conditions. It is structured in 5 stages that interact in an adaptive way: stage
1, in situ observations suggest changes could be happening; stage 2 explores available data that
represent EI; stage 3, experts' workshops target the identification of the minimum set of variables
needed to define EI, or the risk of losing EI; an optative stage 4, where deviance from EI, or risk of
deviance, is statistically assessed; stage 5, findings are communicated to society. We demonstrate
the framework effectiveness in three case studies, including a data poor situation, an area where
lack of reference sites hampers the identification of historical changes, and an area where diffuse
sources of stress make it difficult to identify simple relationships with of ecological responses.
The future challenge is to operationalize the approach and trigger desirable society actions to
strengthen a social-nature link.
