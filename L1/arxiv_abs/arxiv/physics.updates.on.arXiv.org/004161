Explicitly correlated calculations of interaction energies with wave functions that include
all interparticle distances have suffered so far from the lack of size-consistency resulting from
the difficulty to define monomer energies corresponding to the applied dimer basis. As a consequence
it has not been possible to obtain interaction energies vanishing at infinite intermonomer distance
$R$. This has dramatically reduced the accuracy of calculations at distances where the error in
the dimer energy was comparable with the interaction energy itself. The same problem occurs in calculations
of interaction-induced properties. In this communication we show how to circumvent this difficulty
and obtain interaction energies or interaction-induced properties that vanish at large $R$. This
is achieved by relaxing the Pauli principle in the diagonalization of the Hamiltonian of noninteracting
monomers. The basis functions used for this diagonalization belong to the representation of the
permutation group of the dimer induced by the product of representations appropriate for the monomer
spin states. Nonlinear parameters of the basis set are optimized only for the dimer in the Pauli-allowed
sector of the Hilbert space. In this way, one obtains $R$-dependent energy of noninteracting monomers
and the corresponding interaction energy includes a counterpoise correction for the basis set
superposition error. The efficiency of this procedure is demonstrated for the interaction of two
hydrogen atoms where accurate reference data are known.
