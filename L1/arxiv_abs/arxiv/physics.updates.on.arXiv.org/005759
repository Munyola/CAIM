The Exact Regularized Point Particle (ERPP) method is extended to treat the interphase momentum
coupling between particles and fluid in the presence of walls by accounting for the vorticity generation
due to the particles close to solid boundaries. The ERPP method overcomes the limitations of other
methods by allowing the simulation of an extensive parameter space (Stokes number, mass loading,
particle-to-fluid density ratio and Reynolds number) and of particle spatial distributions that
are uneven (few particles per computational cell). The enhanced ERPP method is explained in detail
and validated by considering the global impulse balance. In conditions when particles are located
close to the wall, a common scenario in wall-bounded turbulent flows, the main contribution to the
total impulse arises from the particle-induced vorticity at the solid boundary. The method is applied
to direct numerical simulations of particle-laden turbulent pipe flow in the two-way coupling
regime to address the turbulence modulation. The effects of the mass loading, the Stokes number
and the particle-to-fluid density ratio are investigated. The drag is either unaltered or increased
by the particles with respect to the uncoupled case. No drag reduction is found in the parameter space
considered. The momentum stress budget, which includes an extra stress contribution by the particles,
provides the rationale behind the drag behaviour. The extra stress produces a momentum flux towards
the wall that strongly modifies the viscous stress, the culprit of drag at solid boundaries.
