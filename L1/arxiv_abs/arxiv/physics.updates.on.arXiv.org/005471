Observations from the Kepler mission have revealed frequent superflares on young and active solar-like
stars. Superflares result from the large-scale restructuring of stellar magnetic fields, and
are associated with the eruption of coronal material (a coronal mass ejection, or CME) and energy
release that can be orders of magnitude greater than those observed in the largest solar flares.
These catastrophic events, if frequent, can significantly impact the potential habitability
of terrestrial exoplanets through atmospheric erosion or intense radiation exposure at the surface.
We present results from numerical modeling designed to understand how an eruptive superflare from
a young solar-type star, $\kappa^{1}Cet$, could occur and would impact its astrospheric environment.
Our data-inspired, three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic modeling shows that global-scale
shear concentrated near the radial-field polarity inversion line can energize the closed-field
stellar corona sufficiently to power a global, eruptive superflare that releases approximately
the same energy as the extreme 1859 Carrington event from the Sun. We examine proxy measures of synthetic
emission during the flare and estimate the observational signatures of our CME-driven shock, both
of which could have extreme space-weather impacts on the habitability of any Earth-like exoplanets.
We also speculate that the observed 1986 Robinson-Bopp superflare from $\kappa^{1}Cet$ was perhaps
as extreme for that star as the Carrington flare was for the Sun.
