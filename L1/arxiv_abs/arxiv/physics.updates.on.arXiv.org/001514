Tailoring and enhancing the interaction between light and matter is of great importance for both
fundamental researches and future photonic and optoelectronic applications. Due to their high
exciton oscillator strength and large exciton binding energy, two-dimensional atomic semiconducting
transition metal dichalcogenides have recently emerged as an excellent platform for the strong
photon-exciton interaction by integrating with optically resonant cavities. Here, we propose
an all-semiconductor system composed of individual silicon nanospheres and monolayer WS2 and
investigate the resonance coupling between these two constituents. By coating the silicon nanospheres
with monolayer WS2, we demonstrate the strong resonance coupling between the magnetic dipole mode
and A-exciton, evidenced by an anticrossing behavior in the scattering energy diagram with a Rabi
splitting of 77 meV. Compared with the plasmonic analogues, the resonance coupling in all-semiconductor
heterostructure is much stronger and less sensitive to the spacing between the silicon nanosphere
core and WS2 shell. When the silicon nanospheres are placed onto the WS2 monolayer with a point contact,
resonance coupling manifested by the quenching dips in the scattering spectra can also be observed
at ambient conditions, which involves only a few excitons. Finally, resonance coupling in the all-semiconductor
heterostructure can be active controlled by temperature scanning. Our findings suggest that this
all-semiconductor heterostructure can be exploited for future on-chip nanophotonics associated
with strong light-matter interactions.
