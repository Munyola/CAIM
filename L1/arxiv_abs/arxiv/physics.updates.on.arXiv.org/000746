We introduce an extensible multi-fluid moment model in the context of collisionless magnetic reconnection.
This model evolves full Maxwell equations, and simultaneously moments of the Vlasov-Maxwell equation
for each species in the plasma. Effects like electron inertia and pressure gradient are self-consistently
embedded in the resulting multi-fluid moment equations, without the need to explicitly solving
a generalized Ohms's law. Two limits of the multi-fluid moment model are discussed, namely, the
five-moment limit that evolves a scalar pressures for each species, and the ten-moment limit that
evolves the full anisotropic, non-gyrotropic pressure tensor for each species. We first demonstrate,
analytically and numerically, that the five-moment model reduces to the widely used Hall Magnetohydrodynamics
(Hall MHD) model under the assumptions of vanishing electron inertia, infinite speed of light,
and quasi-neutrality. Then, we compare ten-moment and fully kinetic Particle-In-Cell (PIC) simulations
of a large scale Harris sheet reconnection problem, where the ten-moment equations are closed with
a local linear collisionless approximation for the heat flux. The ten-moment simulation gives
reasonable agreement with the PIC results regarding the structures and magnitudes of the electron
flows, the polarities and magnitudes of elements of the electron pressure tensor, and the decomposition
of the generalized Ohm's law. Possible ways to improve the simple local closure towards a nonlocal
fully three-dimensional closure are also discussed.
