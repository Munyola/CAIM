Extensive research papers of three-dimensional computational techniques are widely used for
the investigation of human brain pathophysiology. Eddy current analyzing could provide an indication
of conductivity change within a biological body. A significant obstacle to current trend analyses
is the development of a numerically stable and efficiency-finite element scheme that performs
well at low frequency and does not require a large number of degrees of freedom. Here, a custom finite
element method (FEM) solver based on edge elements is proposed using the weakly coupled theory,
which separates the solution into two steps. First, the background field (the magnetic vector potential
on each edge) is calculated and stored. Then, the electric scalar potential on each node is obtained
by FEM based on Galerkin formulations. Consequently, the electric field and eddy current distribution
in the object can be obtained. This solver is more efficient than typical commercial solvers since
it reduces the vector eddy current equation to a scalar one, and reduces the meshing domain to just
the eddy current region. It can therefore tackle complex eddy current calculations for models with
much larger numbers of elements, such as those encountered in eddy current computation in biological
tissues. An example is presented with a realistic human brain mesh of 2 million elements. In addition,
with this solver, the equivalent magnetic field induced from the excitation coil is applied, and
therefore there is no need to mesh the excitation coil. In combination, these significantly increase
the efficiency of the solver.
