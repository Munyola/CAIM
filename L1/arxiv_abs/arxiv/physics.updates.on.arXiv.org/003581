X-ray diffraction tomography (XDT) resolves spatially-variant XRD profiles within macroscopic
objects, and provides improved material contrast compared to the conventional transmission-based
computed tomography (CT). However, due to the small diffraction cross-section, XDT suffers from
long imaging acquisition time, which could take tens of hours for a full scan using a table-top X-ray
tube. In medical and industrial imaging applications, oftentimes only the XRD measurement within
a region-of-interest (ROI) is required, which, together with the demand to reduce imaging time
and radiation dose to the sample, motivates the development of interior XDT systems that scan and
reconstruct only an internal region within the sample. The interior problem does not have a unique
solution, and a direct inversion on the truncated projection data often leads to large reconstruction
errors in ROI. To reduce the truncation artifacts, conventional attenuation-based interior reconstruction
problems rely on a known region or piecewise constant constraint within the ROI, which do not apply
to all the samples in XDT. Here we propose a quasi-interior XDT scheme that incorporates a small fraction
of projection information from the exterior region to assist interior reconstruction. The low-resolution
exterior projection data obviates the requirement for prior knowledge on the object, and allows
the ROI reconstruction to be performed with the fast, widely-used filtered back-projection algorithm
for easy integration into real-time XDT imaging modules.
