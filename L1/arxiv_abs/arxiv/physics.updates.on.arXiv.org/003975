The model, that is usually called Lugiato-Lefever equation (LLE), was introduced in 1987 with the
aim of providing a paradigm for dissipative structure and pattern formation in nonlinear optics.
This model, describing a driven, detuned and damped nonlinear Schroedinger equation, gives rise
to dissipative spatial and temporal solitons. Recently, the rather idealized conditions, assumed
in the LLE, have materialized in the form of continuous wave driven optical microresonators, with
the discovery of temporal dissipative Kerr solitons (DKS). These experiments have revealed that
the LLE is a perfect and exact description of Kerr frequency combs - first observed in 2007, i.e. 20
years after the original formulation of the LLE. - and in particular describe soliton states. Observed
to spontaneously form in Kerr frequency combs in crystalline microresonators in 2013, such DKS
are preferred state of operation, offering coherent and broadband optical frequency combs, whose
bandwidth can be extended exploiting soliton induced broadening phenomena. Combined with the
ability to miniaturize and integrate on chip, microresonator based soliton Kerr frequency combs
have already found applications in self-referenced frequency combs, dual-comb spectroscopy,
frequency synthesis, low noise microwave generation, laser frequency ranging, and astrophysical
spectrometer calibration, and have the potential to make comb technology ubiquitous. As such,
pattern formation in driven, dissipative nonlinear optical systems is becoming the central Physics
of soliton micro-comb technology.
