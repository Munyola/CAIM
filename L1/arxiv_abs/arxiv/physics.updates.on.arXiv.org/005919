The next great leap toward improving treatment of cancer with radiation will require the combined
use of online adaptive and magnetic resonance guided radiation therapy techniques with automatic
X-ray beam orientation selection. Unfortunately, by uniting these advancements, we are met with
a substantial expansion in the required dose information and consequential increase to the overall
computational time imposed during radiation treatment planning, which cannot be handled by existing
techniques for accelerating Monte Carlo dose calculation. We propose a deep convolutional neural
network approach that unlocks new levels of acceleration and accuracy with regards to post-processed
Monte Carlo dose results by relying on data-driven learned representations of low-level beamlet
dose distributions instead of more limited filter-based denoising techniques that only utilize
the information in a single dose input. Our method uses parallel UNET branches acting on three input
channels before mixing latent understanding to produce noise-free dose predictions. Our model
achieves a normalized mean absolute error of only 0.106% compared with the ground truth dose contrasting
the 25.7% error of the under sampled MC dose fed into the network at prediction time. Our model's per-beamlet
prediction time is ~220ms, including Monte Carlo simulation and network prediction, with substantial
additional acceleration expected from batched processing and combination with existing Monte
Carlo acceleration techniques. Our method shows promise toward enabling clinical practice of
advanced treatment technologies.
