The reorientations of the large-scale circulation (LSC) in turbulent Rayleigh - B\'enard convective
flow in a cubic cell are considered in frame of a new approach, which instead of a single-roll description
introduces a superposition of a pair of large-scale orthogonal two-dimensional rolls. The reorientation
of LSC is considered as a result of cessation of one of the 2D rolls. The proposed approach is in good
agreement with results of water experiments (Prandtl number $\Pra=6.4$ and Rayleigh number $\Ray=2\times
10^{9}$) and results of numerical simulations for $\Pra=0.7$, $\Ray=10^8$. Analysis of integral
characteristics revealed that two-dimensional flows accumulate most of the kinetic energy of
the flows in the cubic cell. In long term numerical simulations, it was shown that the energy of rotational
motion around vertical axis (averaged over vertical coordinate) is negligible. A simple model
of the large-scale flows in cubic cell is introduced. Analysis of lowest spatial modes of the model
flow and of the flow in numerical simulations was done using Fourier decomposition. It showed that
the symmetry of the sign changes of the corresponding Fourier modes agrees with the proposed mechanism.
An increase of intensity of one of large-scale planar rolls is accompanied by a decrease of intensity
of the other one. It can be explained by an existence of the non-linear link between them. According
to proposed model, the periodic temperature oscillations in orthogonal direction to the LSC plane
and periodic oscillations of orientation of LSC appear as result of oscillations of lowest spatial
modes.
