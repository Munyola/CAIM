In De Sitter / Anti De Sitter space-time and in other geometries, reference sub-manifolds from which
proper time is measured along integral curves, are described as events. We introduce here a foliation
with the help of a scalar field. The scalar field need not be unique but from the gradient of the scalar
field, an intrinsic Reeb vector of the foliations perpendicular to the gradient vector is calculated.
The Reeb vector describes the acceleration of a physical particle that moves along the integral
curves that are formed by the gradient of the scalar field. The Reeb vector appears as a component
of an anti-symmetric matrix which is a part of a rank-2, 2-Form. The 2-form is extended into a non-degenerate
4-form and into rank-4 matrix of a 2-form, which when multiplied by a velocity of a particle, becomes
the acceleration of the particle. The matrix has one U(1) degree of freedom and an additional SU(2)
degrees of freedom in two vectors that span the plane perpendicular to the gradient of the scalar
field and to the Reeb vector. In total, there are U(1) x SU(2) degrees of freedom. SU(3) degrees of
freedom arise from three dimensional foliations but require an additional symmetry to exist in
order to have a valid covariant meaning. The model aims at Causal Sets, that when not aligned along
geodesic curves, force material clocks of different types, not to move geodetically, thus meaning
forces and matter. This paper mostly deals with U(1) type clocks but also discusses SU(2) and SU(3)
and in a more detailed way in appendix C.
