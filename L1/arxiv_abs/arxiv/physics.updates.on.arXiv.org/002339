An optical topological transition is defined as the change in the photonic isofrequency surface
around epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) frequencies which can considerably change the spontaneous emission
of a quantum emitter placed near a metamaterial slab. Here, we show that due to the strong Kerr nonlinearity
at ENZ frequencies, a high power pulse can induce a sudden transition in the topology of the iso-frequency
dispersion curve, leading to a significant change in the transmission of propagating as well as
evanescent waves through the metamaterial slab. This evanescent wave switch effect allows for
the control of spontaneous emission through modulation of the Purcell effect. We develop a theory
of the enhanced nonlinear response of ENZ media to s and p polarized inputs and show that this nonlinear
effect is stronger for p polarization and is almost independent of the incident angle. We perform
finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulations to demonstrate the transient response of the
metamaterial slab to an ultrafast pulse and fast switching of the Purcell effect at the sub-picosecond
scale. The Purcell factor changes at ENZ by almost a factor of three which is an order of magnitude
stronger than that away from ENZ. We also show that due to the inhomogeneous spatial field distribution
inside the multilayer metal-dielectric super-lattice, a unique spatial topological transition
metamaterial can be achieved by the control pulse induced nonlinearity. Our work can lead to ultra-fast
control of quantum phenomena in ENZ metamaterials.
