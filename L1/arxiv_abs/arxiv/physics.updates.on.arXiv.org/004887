Longstanding problems regarding the causality of the diffusion equation are resolved through
a class of exact solutions. A universal differential solution for diffusive processes is derived
that is causal and exact at any analytic point in the data, albeit infinite order in spatial derivatives.
This is true for systems both relativistic and nonrelativistic and shows that the hyperbolic and
other relativistic extensions of the heat equation are not valid. A similar effect is demonstrated
for flow enhanced mixing of solutions but with a new nonanalytic feature. Viscous hydrodynamics
of liquids have both features. Both Newtonian and non-Newtonian viscous liquids give a more important
and confounding alteration of the N-S equations for nonstationary flows. A careful analysis of
liquids in terms of microscopic constituents and Lagrangian paths show there is a well-defined
unique microscopic decomposition of fluid deformations into rotation and two modes corresponding
to organized layered flow that do not enhance mixing and a mode that induces mixing and preferred
static orientations. The resulting equations are both infinite order in spatial derivatives almost
everywhere and are divided into two disjoint classes by an essential nonanalytic hypersuface.
These give important rheological effects coupling hydrodynamic flow to diffusion and reaction
kinetics. Practical consequences include catalysis and reaction yield control by rheological
means. Implications of this work should percolate through almost all of continuum mechanics.
