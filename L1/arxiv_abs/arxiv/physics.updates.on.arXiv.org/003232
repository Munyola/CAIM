Sudden Stratospheric Warmings (SSW) affect the chemistry and dynamics of the middle atmosphere.
Major warmings occur roughly every second winter in the Northern Hemisphere (NH), but has only been
observed once in the Southern Hemisphere (SH), during the Antarctic winter of 2002. Observations
by the Global Ozone Monitoring by Occultation of Stars (GOMOS, an instrument on board Envisat) during
this rare event, show a 40% increase of ozone in the nighttime secondary ozone layer at subpolar latitudes
compared to non-SSW years. This study investigates the cause of the mesospheric nighttime ozone
increase, using the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Whole Atmosphere Community
Climate Model with specified dynamics (SD-WACCM). The 2002 SH winter was characterized by several
reductions of the strength of the polar night jet in the upper stratosphere before the jet reversed
completely, marking the onset of the major SSW. At the time of these wind reductions, corresponding
episodic increases can be seen in the modelled nighttime secondary ozone layer. This ozone increase
is attributed largely to enhanced upwelling and the associated cooling of the altitude region in
conjunction with the wind reversal. This is in correspondence to similar studies of SSW induced
ozone enhancements in NH. But unlike its NH counterpart, the SH secondary ozone layer appeared to
be impacted less by episodic variations in atomic hydrogen. Seasonally decreasing atomic hydrogen
plays however a larger role in SH compared to NH.
