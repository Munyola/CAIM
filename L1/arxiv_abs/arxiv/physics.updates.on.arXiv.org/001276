Photoacoustic computed tomography (PACT) is an emerging computed imaging modality that exploits
optical contrast and ultrasonic detection principles to form images of the absorbed optical energy
density within tissue. If the object possesses spatially variant acoustic properties that are
unaccounted for by the reconstruction method, the estimated image can contain distortions. While
reconstruction methods have recently been developed to compensate for this effect, they generally
require the object's acoustic properties to be known a priori. To circumvent the need for detailed
information regarding an object's acoustic properties, we previously proposed a half-time reconstruction
method for PACT. A half-time reconstruction method estimates the PACT image from a data set that
has been temporally truncated to exclude the data components that have been strongly aberrated.
However, this method can be improved upon when the approximate sizes and locations of isolated heterogeneous
structures, such as bones or gas pockets, are known. To address this, we investigate PACT reconstruction
methods that are based on a variable data truncation (VDT) approach. The VDT approach represents
a generalization of the half-time approach, in which the degree of temporal truncation for each
measurement is determined by the distance between the corresponding ultrasonic transducer location
and the nearest known bone or gas void location. Computer-simulated and experimental data are employed
to demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach in mitigating artifacts due to acoustic heterogeneities.
