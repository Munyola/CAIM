If a one-particle or multi-particle non-relativistic quantum system is initially in a stationary
state, and its wave function field is locally perturbed, then according to classical Schr\"odinger
equation, the perturbation instantaneously affects all infinite region because, according to
the equation, speed of the wave function perturbations propagation is infinite. This feature strongly
influences all theoretical predictions for time evolution of the system and contradicts the natural
limitation of the perturbations propagation speed by speed of light. We develop finite propagation
speed concept for multi-particle non-relativistic quantum systems. It consists of (a) eikonal
type equation for the wave function perturbation traveltime describing finite speed perturbation
waves in hyperspace including coordinates of all paricles in the system; (b) modified multi-particle
Schr\"odinger equation with finite speed of the wave function perturbations propagation; and
(c) hypothesis that speed of the wave function perturbations propagation is equal speed of light.
Analysis of derived equations shows characteristic features of quantum processes with finite
speed of the wave function perturbations propagation. Using derived equations we solve Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen
(EPR) paradox, and develop local interpretation of EPR paradox and entanglement. We show that our
claims regarding the wave function perturbations propagation with speed of light agree with classical
experiments on electron matter waves diffraction.
