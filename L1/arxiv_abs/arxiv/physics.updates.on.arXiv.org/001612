We study the phase transition from the persistence phase to the extinction phase for the SIRS (susceptible/
infected/ refractory/ susceptible) model of diseases spreading on the networks. We analytically
demonstrate that, in the case when the recovery time {\tau}R is larger than the infection time {\tau}I
, the infection flows on a one direction, i. e. from an infected node to its susceptible neighbor but,
that neighbor can not reinfect that node during its infection time. This behavior leads us to deduce
that, when the infection rate {\lambda} is high enough such that, each infected node on the network
infects all its neighbors during its infection time, SIRS model on the network evolves to extinction
state, where all nodes on the network become susceptible. Moreover, we assert that, existing the
loops on the network are necessary in this case in order to, the infection occurs repeatedly within
the nodes on the network. In this case, unlike the other models such as SIS model and SIR model, SIRS
model will have two critical thresholds separate the persistence phase from extinction phase.
That means, for fixed values of {\tau}I and {\tau}R there are two critical points of infection rate
{\lambda}1 and {\lambda}2, epidemic persists in between of those two points. We also prove that,
in between of these points, there is a value of {\lambda} in which the system settles down to stable
state with highest infected nodes. We confirm these results numerically by a simulation of regular
a one dimension system .
