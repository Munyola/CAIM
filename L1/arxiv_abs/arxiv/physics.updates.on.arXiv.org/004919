In the present study, numerical investigations were performed to determine the optimum non-uniform
suction profiles to control the flow around a circular cylinder in the range of Reynolds numbers
4<Re<200. To investigate how the characteristics of the optimal control and the resulting flow
change depending on the optimisation objective, several objectives were explored, namely: minimising
the separation angle, total drag, and pressure drag. A variety of suction control implementations
were investigated and compared to the performance of uniform suction. It was determined that the
optimal non-uniform suction profiles consisted of a distribution with compact support, and a single
locus. The location of the optimum suction region and the amount of suction necessary to achieve
each objective varied substantially with Reynolds number, but with a predictable relationship.
It is also shown that these parameters can alternatively be considered as related to the separation
angle of the uncontrolled flow (the initial separation angle). Depending on the objective, the
control parameters varied greatly: less suction was necessary to minimise total drag than to eliminate
separation. Non-uniform suction profiles were much more efficient at eliminating boundary layer
separation, requiring the removal of less than half the volume of fluid as uniform control to achieve
the same objective. Total elimination of boundary layer separation did not always result in an improvement
in total drag, and in some circumstances increased it.
