We have investigated the efficacy of online, multimedia learning modules (MLMs) as preparation
for in-class, lecture-based tutorials in electromagnetism in a physics course for natural science
majors (biology and marine science). Specifically, we report the results of a multiple-group pre/post-test
research design comparing two groups receiving different treatments with respect to activities
preceding participation in Tutorials in Introductory Physics. The different pre-tutorial activities
where as follows: (1) students were assigned reading from a traditional textbook, followed by a
traditional lecture; and (2) students completed online multimedia learning modules developed
by the Physics Education Research Group at the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign (UIUC),
and commercially known as smartPhysics. The MLM treatment group earned significantly higher mid-term
examination scores and larger gains in content knowledge as measured by the Conceptual Survey of
Electricity and Magnetism (CSEM). Student attitudes towards "reformed" instruction in the form
of active-engagement tutorials where also improved. Specifically, post-course surveys showed
MLM-group students believed class time was more effective and the instructor was more clear than
reported by non-MLM students, even though there was no significant difference between groups with
respect to in-class activities and the same instructor taught both groups. MLM activities can be
a highly effective tool for some student populations, especially when student preparation and
buy-in are important for realizing significant gains.
