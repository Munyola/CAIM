We analyze the optical continuum of star-forming galaxies in SDSS by fitting stacked spectra with
stellar population synthesis models to investigate the relation between stellar mass, stellar
metallicity, dust attenuation and star formation rate. We fit models calculated with star formation
and chemical evolution histories that are derived empirically from multi-epoch observations
of the stellar mass---star formation rate and the stellar mass---gas-phase metallicity relations,
respectively. We also fit linear combinations of single burst models with a range of metallicities
and ages. Star formation and chemical evolution histories are unconstrained for these models.
The stellar mass---stellar metallicity relations obtained from the two methods agree with the
relation measured from individual supergiant stars in nearby galaxies. These relations are also
consistent with the relation obtained from emission line analysis of gas-phase metallicity after
accounting for systematic offsets in the gas-phase-metallicity. We measure dust attenuation
of the stellar continuum and show that its dependence on stellar mass and star formation rate is consistent
with previously reported results derived from nebular emission lines. However, stellar continuum
attenuation is smaller than nebular emission line attenuation. The continuum-to-nebular attenuation
ratio depends on stellar mass and is smaller in more massive galaxies. Our consistent analysis of
stellar continuum and nebular emission lines paves the way for a comprehensive investigation of
stellar metallicities of star-forming and quiescent galaxies.
