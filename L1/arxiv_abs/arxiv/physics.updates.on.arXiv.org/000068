Motivated by some previous works of Rudra et al we set to explore the background dynamics when dark
energy in the form of New Variable Modified Chaplygin gas is coupled to dark matter with a suitable
interaction in the universe described by brane cosmology. The main idea is to find out the efficiency
of New variable modified Chaplygin gas to play the role of DE. As a result we resort to the technique
of comparison with standard dark energy models. Here the RSII brane model have been considered as
the gravity theory. An interacting model is considered in order to search for a possible solution
of the cosmic coincidence problem. A dynamical system analysis is performed because of the high
complexity of the system . The statefinder parameters are also calculated to classify the dark energy
model. Graphs and phase diagrams are drawn to study the variations of these parameters and get an
insight into the effectiveness of the dark energy model. It is also seen that the background dynamics
of New Variable Modified Chaplygin gas is consistent with the late cosmic acceleration. After performing
an extensive mathematical analysis, we are able to constrain the parameters of new variable modified
Chaplygin gas as $m<n$ to produce the best possible results. Future singularities are studied
and it is found that the model has a tendency to result in such singularities unlike the case of generalized
cosmic Chaplygin gas. Our investigation leads us to the fact that New Variable Modified Chaplygin
gas is not as effective as other Chaplygin gas models to play the role of dark energy.
