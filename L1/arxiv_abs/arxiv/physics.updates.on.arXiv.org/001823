Scrupulous measurements and detailed data analysis of the torque in a swirling turbulent flow driven
by counter-rotating bladed disks reveals an apparent breaking of the law of similarity. Potentially,
such breakdown could arise from several possible factors, including dependence on dimensionless
numbers other that $Re$ or velocity coupling to other fields such as temperature. However, careful
redesign and calibration of the experiment showed that this unexpected result was due to background
errorscaused by minute misalignments which lead to a noisy and irreproducible torque signal at
low rotation speeds and prevented correct background subtraction normally ascribed to frictional
losses. An important lesson to be learnt is that multiple minute misalignments can nonlinearly
couple to the torque signal and provide a dc offset that cannot be removed by averaging. That offset
can cause the observed divergence of the friction coefficient C_f from its constant value observed
in the turbulent regime. To minimize the friction and misalignments, we significantly modified
the experimental setup and carried out the experiment with one bladed disk where the disk, torque
meter and motor shaft axes can be aligned with significantly smaller error, close to the torque meter
resolution. As a result we made precise measurements with high resolution and sensitivity of the
small torques produced for low rotation speeds for several water-glycerin solutions of different
viscosities and confirmed the similarity law in a wide range of Re in particular in low viscosity
fluids.
