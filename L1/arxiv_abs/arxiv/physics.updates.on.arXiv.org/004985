Signal processing and system characterization tasks are often addressed utilizing state-space
modeling methods where the evolution operator of a dynamical system is defined in phase space. The
identification of this transient mapping by definition requires prior knowledge of dynamical
mechanisms governing the underlying physics, which reversely poses challenges to dynamical systems
analysis, especially when the dynamic equilibrium is not available or partially known. Fortunately,
unprecedented data availability in this information explosion era facilitates effective learning
of hidden dynamical mechanisms directly from data. This paper provides an equation-free learning
method that describes a nonlinear/chaotic dynamical system from a functional space rather than
the conventional phase space via the introduction of the Koopman operator. Spectral analysis of
the Koopman operator provides a physical characterization of transient signals in terms of a set
of dynamically coherent structures. The resolution scheme is designed in an eigendecomposition
form where identified eigen-tuples can not only capture dominant spatial structures but also isolate
each structure with a specific frequency and a corresponding growth/decay rate. To demonstrate
the unique feature of this approach, we consider learning the evolution dynamics of random wind
pressures fields over a tall building model using limited experimental data. The learned results
indicate the proposed method can accurately identify a wide range of dynamical mechanisms, each
of which is closely connected to a physical phenomenon.
