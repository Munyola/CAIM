The Large Volume Plasma device(LVPD), a cylindrically shaped, linear plasma device of dimension(
$\phi =2m $, $ L =3m $) have successfully demonstrated the excitation of Electron Temperature Gradient(ETG)
turbulence[ Mattoo et al.,[1]]. The observed ETG turbulence shows significant power between $\omega
\sim (25-90 krad/s )> \Omega_{ci}(= 8 krad/s )$, corresponding to the wavenumber, $ k_y \rho_e ~
(0.1- 0.2)$ where, $ \Omega_{ci}$ and $\rho_e(=5 mm ) $, ion cyclotron frequency and electron Larmor
radius, respectively. The observed frequency and wave number matches well with theoretical estimates
corresponding to Whistler-ETG mode. We investigated electromagnetic (EM) fluctuations induced
plasma transport in high beta ( $ \beta \sim 0.01 - 0.4 $ ) ETG mode suitable plasma in LVPD. The radial
electromagnetic (EM) electron (ion) flux ( $ \Gamma^{e,i}_{em} $) results primarily from the correlation
between fluctuations of parallel electron current ($\delta J_{\parallel ,e,i}$ ) and radial magnetic
field ($ \delta B_r $ ). The electromagnetic particle flux is observed to be much smaller than the
electrostatic particle flux,$ \Gamma_{em}\approx 10^{-5} \Gamma_{es} $ .The EM flux is small
but finite contrary to the conventional slab ETG model. The electromagnetic flux is non-ambipolar.
A theoretical model is obtained for the EM particle flux in straight homogeneous magnetic field
geometry. The theoretical estimates are seen to compare well with the experimental observations.
Sluggish parallel ion response is identified as the key mechanism for generation of small but finite
electromagnetic flux.
