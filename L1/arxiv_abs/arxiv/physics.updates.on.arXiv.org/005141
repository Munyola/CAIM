Complex systems in the real world can be modeled as a network of connected components. The human brain,
as a network of neurons among which the interactions cause perception, is a complex network. Synchronization
is a dynamical phenomenon that can be seen in the brain. The network topology has a remarkable impact
on both the function and the dynamics of neural networks. In this research, synchronization of neural
networks is scrutinized through creating various topologies. These networks include both excitatory
and inhibitory neurons. We investigate the dynamics of different networks by random rewiring of
the synaptic connections. In this manner, a regular network transforms into a small-world network
and then becomes a random network. Coherence level which is measured and utilized as the criteria
to analyze synchronicity, experiencing a sharp increase as the network changes into the small-world
network and growing steadily by the end. On the other hand, a decreasing trend of coherence level
is revealed starting from a complete excitatory network and gradually increasing of inhibitory
neurons. Thus, the coherence level reaches approximately zero in a complete inhibitory network.
By increasing the number of neurons in the network, the degree of synchronization follows a power-law
distribution; however, the number of synaptic connections of each neuron and their conductance
have a positive impact on synchronization. By applying the model to a C-elegance neural network,
not only the mentioned parameters but also the role of the degree distribution are highlighted.
