In the protein sequence space, natural proteins form clusters of families which are characterized
by their unique native folds whereas the great majority of random polypeptides are neither clustered
nor foldable to unique structures. Since a given polypeptide can be either foldable or unfoldable,
a kind of "folding transition" is expected at the boundary of a protein family in the sequence space.
By Monte Carlo simulations of a statistical mechanical model of protein sequence alignment that
coherently incorporates both short-range and long-range interactions as well as variable-length
insertions to reproduce the statistics of the multiple sequence alignment of a given protein family,
we demonstrate the existence of such transition between natural-like sequences and random sequences
in the sequence subspaces for 15 domain families of various folds. The transition was found to be
highly cooperative and two-state-like. Furthermore, enforcing or suppressing consensus residues
on a few of the well-conserved sites enhanced or diminished, respectively, the natural-like pattern
formation over the entire sequence. In most families, the key sites included ligand binding sites.
These results suggest some selective pressure on the key residues, such as ligand binding activity,
may cooperatively facilitate the emergence of a protein family during evolution. From a more practical
aspect, the present results highlight an essential role of long-range effects in precisely defining
protein families, which are absent in conventional sequence models.
