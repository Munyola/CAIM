In the classic model of first passage percolation, for pairs of vertices separated by a Euclidean
distance $L$, geodesics exhibit deviations from their mean length $L$ that are of order $L^\chi$,
while the transversal fluctuations, known as wandering, grow as $L^\xi$. We find that when weighting
edges directly with their Euclidean span in various spatial network models, we have two distinct
classes defined by different exponents $\xi=3/5$ and $\chi = 1/5$, or $\xi=7/10$ and $\chi = 2/5$,
depending only on coarse details of the specific connectivity laws used. Also, the travel time fluctuations
are Gaussian, rather than Tracy-Widom, which is rarely seen in first passage models. The first class
contains proximity graphs such as the hard and soft random geometric graph, and the $k$-nearest
neighbour random geometric graphs, where via Monte Carlo simulations we find $\xi=0.60\pm 0.01$
and $\chi = 0.20\pm 0.01$, showing a theoretical minimal wandering. The second class contains graphs
based on excluded regions such as $\beta$-skeletons and the Delaunay triangulation and are characterised
by the values $\xi=0.70\pm 0.01$ and $\chi = 0.40\pm 0.01$, with a nearly theoretically maximal
wandering exponent. We also show numerically that the KPZ relation $\chi = 2\xi -1$ is satisfied
for all these models. These results shed some light on the Euclidean first passage process, but also
raise some theoretical questions about the scaling laws and the derivation of the exponent values,
and also whether a model can be constructed with maximal wandering, or non-Gaussian travel fluctuations,
while embedded in space.
