In this talk, I present the recently established hyperunified field theory (HUFT) \cite{YLWU1,YLWU2}
for all basic forces and elementary particles within the framework of gravitational quantum field
theory (GQFT)\cite{YLWU3,YLWU4} in hyper-spacetime. GQFT treats gravity as a gauge theory in
the framework of quantum field theory to avoid the long term obstacle between the general relativity
and quantum mechanics. HUFT is built based on the guiding principle: the dimension of hyper-spacetime
correlates to intrinsic quantum numbers of basic building blocks of nature, and the action describing
the laws of nature obeys the gauge invariance and coordinate independence, which is more fundamental
than that proposed by Einstein for general relativity. The basic gravitational field is defined
in biframe hyper-spacetime as a bicovariant vector field, it is a gauge-type hyper-gravifield
rather than a metric field. HUFT is characterized by a bimaximal Poincar\'e and hyper-spin gauge
symmetry PO(1,$D_h$-1)$\Join$SP(1,$D_h$-1) with a global and local conformal scaling invariance
in biframe hyper-spacetime. The gravitational origin of gauge symmetry is revealed through the
hyper-gravifield that plays an essential role as a Goldstone-like field, which enables us to demonstrate
the gauge-gravity and gravity-geometry correspondences and to corroborate the gravitational
gauge-geometry duality with an emergent hidden general linear group symmetry GL($D_h$,R). The
Taiji Program in Space for the gravitational wave detection in China\cite{Nature,Taiji,HUWU}
is briefly outlined.
