Observing and taming unusual effects arising from non-trivial light-matter interaction has always
triggered scientists to better understand Nature and develop technological tools towards implementing
novel applications. Recently, several unusual optomechanical effects have been unveiled when
subtle spin-orbit interactions come at play to build up optical forces and torques that are hardly
seen in everyday life, such as negative optical radiation pressure, transverse optical forces,
or left-handed optical torques. To date, there are only a few experimental proposals to reveal these
effects despite tremendous conceptual advances. In particular, spin-dependent lateral forces
and their angular analog are done either at the expense of direct observations or at the cost of specific
instrumental complexity. Here we report on naked-eye identification of light-induced spin-dependent
lateral displacements of centimeter-sized objects endowed with structured birefringence. Its
angular counterpart is also discussed and the observation of left-handed macroscopic rotational
motion is reported. The unveiled effects are ultimately driven by lateral optical force fields
that are five orders of magnitude larger than those reported so far. These results allow structured
light-matter interaction to move from a scientific curiosity to a new asset for the existing multidisciplinary
optical manipulation toolbox across length scales. In addition, this highlights the spin-orbit
optomechanics of anisotropic and inhomogeneous media, which is just beginning to be explored.
