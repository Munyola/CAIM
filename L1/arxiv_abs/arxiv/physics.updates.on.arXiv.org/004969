Sand fences are often erected to reduce wind speed, prevent aeolian soil erosion, and induce sand
deposition and dune formation in areas affected by sand encroachment and desertification. However,
the search for the most efficient array of fences by means of field experiments alone poses a challenging
task given that field experiments are affected by weather conditions. Here we apply Computational
Fluid Dynamic simulations to investigate the three-dimensional structure of the turbulent wind
field over an array of fences of different sizes, porosity and spacing. Our goal is to perform a quantitative
analysis of this structure in the absence of saltation or suspension transport, as first step toward
the development of a continuum simulation of the aeolian soil in presence of the fences. We find that
the area of soil protected against direct aerodynamic entrainment has two regimes, depending on
the spacing $L_x$ between the fences. When $L_x$ is smaller than a critical value $L_{xc}$, the wake
zones associated with each fence are inter-connected (regime A), while these wake zones appear
separated from each other (regime B) when $L_x$ exceeds this critical value of spacing. The system
undergoes a second order phase transition at $L_x = L_{xc}$, with the cross-wind width of the protected
zone scaling with $\left[{1-{L}_x}/{L}_{xc}\right]^\beta$ in regime A, with $\beta \approx
0.32$. Our findings have implication for a better understanding of aeolian transport in the presence
of sand fences, as well as to develop optimization strategies for measures to protect soils from
wind erosion.
