Microwave frequency acousto-optic modulation is realized by exciting high overtone bulk acoustic
wave resonances (HBAR resonances) in the photonic stack. These confined mechanical stress waves
transmit exhibit vertically transmitting, high quality factor (Q) acoustic Fabry Perot resonances
that extend into the Gigahertz domain, and offer stress-optical interaction with the optical modes
of the microresonator. Although HBAR are ubiquitously used in modern communication, and often
exploited in superconducting circuits, this is the first time they have been incorporated on a photonic
circuit based chip. The electro-acousto-optical interaction observed within the optical modes
exhibits high actuation linearity, low actuation power and negligible crosstalk. Using the electro-acousto-optic
interaction, fast optical resonance tuning is achieved with sub-nanosecond transduction time.
By removing the silicon backreflection, broadband acoustic modulation at 4.1 and 8.7 GHz is realized
with a 3 dB bandwidth of 250 MHz each. The novel hybrid HBAR nanophotonic platform demonstrated here,
allowing on chip integration of micron-scale acoustic and photonic resonators, can find immediate
applications in tunable microwave photonics, high bandwidth soliton microcomb stabilization,
compact opto-electronic oscillators, and in microwave to optical conversion schemes. Moreover
the hybrid platform allows implementation of momentum biasing, which allows realization of on
chip non-reciprocal devices such as isolators or circulators and topological photonic bandstructures.
