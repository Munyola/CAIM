Nanostructures can be bound together at equilibrium by the van der Waals (vdW) effect, a small but
ubiquitous many-body attraction that presents challenges to density functional theory. How does
the binding energy depend upon the size or number of atoms in one of a pair of identical nanostructures?
To answer this question, we treat each nanostructure properly as a whole object, not as a collection
of atoms. Our calculations start from an accurate static dipole polarizability for each considered
nanostructure, and an accurate equilibrium center-to-center distance for the pair (the latter
from experiment, or from the vdW-DF-cx functional). We consider the competition in each term $-C_{2k}/d^{2k}$
($k=3, 4, 5$) of the long-range vdW series for the interaction energy, between the size dependence
of the vdW coefficient $C_{2k}$ and that of the $2k$-th power of the center-to-center distance $d$.
The damping of these vdW terms can be negligible, but in any case it does not affect the size dependence
for a given term in the absence of non-vdW binding. To our surprise, the vdW energy can be size-independent
for quasi-spherical nanoclusters bound to one another by vdW interaction, even with strong nonadditivity
of the vdW coefficient, as demonstrated for fullerenes. We also show that, for low-dimensional
systems, the vdW interaction yields the strongest size-dependence, in stark contrast to that of
fullerenes. We illustrate this with parallel planar polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Other
cases are between, as shown by sodium clusters.
