We have investigated the transport of light through slabs that both scatter and strongly absorb,
a situation that occurs in diverse application fields ranging from biomedical optics, powder technology,
to solid-state lighting. In particular, we study the transport of light in the visible wavelength
range between $420$ and $700$ nm through silicone plates filled with YAG:Ce$^{3+}$ phosphor particles,
that even re-emit absorbed light at different wavelengths. We measure the total transmission,
the total reflection, and the ballistic transmission of light through these plates. We obtain average
single particle properties namely the scattering cross-section $\sigma_s$, the absorption cross-section
$\sigma_a$, and the anisotropy factor $\mu$ using an analytical approach, namely the P3 approximation
to the radiative transfer equation. We verify the extracted transport parameters using Monte-Carlo
simulations of the light transport. Our approach fully describes the light propagation in phosphor
diffuser plates that are used in white LEDs and that reveal a strong absorption ($L/\ell_{\mathrm{a}}
> 1$) up to $L/\ell_{\mathrm{a}} = 4$, where $L$ is the slab thickness, $\ell_{\mathrm{a}}$ is the
absorption mean free path. In contrast, the widely used diffusion theory fails to describe this
parameter range. Our approach is a suitable analytical tool for industry, since it provides a fast
yet accurate determination of key transport parameters, and since it introduces predictive power
into the design process of white light emitting diodes.
