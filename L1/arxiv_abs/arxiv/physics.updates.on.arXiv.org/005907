A charged droplet can be levitated in the air when suspended in a trap subjected to quadrupole potential.
The applied potential is typically sinusoidal. Such a charged drop undergoes surface oscillations
subsequently building enough charge density to undergo Rayleigh breakup. In this work, we investigate
high-speed imaging of large amplitude surface oscillations of a levitated sub-Rayleigh charged
drop and corresponding Rayleigh breakup, by applying non-sinusoidal waveform. The droplet oscillation
behaviour and Rayleigh breakup (recorded at 100k frames per second) are investigated for different
applied waveforms such as sine, square and ramp at different imposed frequencies but a fixed voltage.
The surface oscillates in sphere-prolate-sphere-oblate (SPSO) mode and sometimes in the sphere-prolate-sphere
(SPS) modes depending upon the complex interplay of forces such as charge(Q), applied field ($\Lambda$)
and shift of the droplet from the geometric center of the trap ($Z_{shift}$). The Fast Fourier Transformation
(FFT) analysis shows that the droplet oscillates with the imposed frequency irrespective of the
type of waveform. While in the sinusoidal case, the nonlinearities are strong, in the square and
ramp potentials, there is an admittance of all the frequencies of the applied voltage. Further,
the droplet breakup characteristics do not change in the presence of various waveforms. The experimental
observations are validated with a potential theory with viscus correction and found to be in a fair
agreement.
