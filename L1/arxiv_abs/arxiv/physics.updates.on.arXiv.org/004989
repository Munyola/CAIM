Inertial sensors stimulate very large interest, not only for their application but also for fundamental
physics tests. Ring laser gyros, which measure angular rotation rate, are certainly among the most
sensitive inertial sensors, with excellent dynamic range and bandwidth. Large area ring laser
gyros are routinely able to measure fractions of prad/s, with high duty cycle and bandwidth, providing
fast, direct and local measurement of relevant geodetic and geophysical signals. Improvements
of a factor $10-100$ would open the windows for general relativity tests, as the GINGER project,
an Earth based experiment aiming at the Lense-Thirring test at $1\%$ level. However, it is well known
that the dynamics of the laser induces non-linearities, and those effects are more evident in small
scale instruments. Sensitivity and accuracy improvements are always worthwhile, and in general
there is demand for high sensitivity environmental study and development of inertial platforms,
where small scale transportable instruments should be used. We discuss a novel technique to analyse
the data, aiming at studying and removing those non-linearity. The analysis is applied to the two
ring laser prototypes GP2 and GINGERINO, and angular rotation rate evaluated with the new and standard
methods are compared. The improvement is evident, it shows that the back-scatter problem of the
ring laser gyros is negligible with a proper analysis of the data, improving the performances of
large scale ring laser gyros, but also indicating that small scale instruments with sensitivity
of nrad/s are feasible.
