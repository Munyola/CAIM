The electromagnetic field distribution as well as the resonating frequency of various modes in
superconducting cavities used in particle accelerators for example are sensitive to small geometry
deformations. The occurring variations are motivated by measurements of an available set of resonators
from which we propose to extract a small number of relevant and independent deformations by using
a truncated Karhunen-Lo\`eve expansion. The random deformations are used in an expressive uncertainty
quantification workflow to determine the sensitivity of the eigenmodes. For the propagation of
uncertainty, a stochastic collocation method based on sparse grids is employed. It requires the
repeated solution of Maxwell's eigenvalue problem at predefined collocation points, i.e., for
cavities with perturbed geometry. The main contribution of the paper is ensuring the consistency
of the solution, i.e., matching the eigenpairs, among the various eigenvalue problems at the stochastic
collocation points. To this end, a classical eigenvalue tracking technique is proposed that is
based on homotopies between collocation points and a Newton-based eigenvalue solver. The approach
can be efficiently parallelized while tracking the eigenpairs. In this paper, we propose the application
of isogeometric analysis since it allows for the exact description of the geometrical domains with
respect to common computer-aided design kernels, for a straightforward and convenient way of handling
geometrical variations and smooth solutions.
