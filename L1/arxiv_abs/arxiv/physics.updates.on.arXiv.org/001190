We present a simple model for the scaling properties of mixing in weakly rotating stratified flows
characterized by their Rossby, Froude and Reynolds numbers Ro, Fr and Re. It is based on (i) equipartition
between kinetic and potential modes; (ii) sub-dominant vertical velocity, w/urms smaller than
1; and (iii) lessening of the energy transfer to small scales as measured by a dissipation efficiency
compared to its dimensional expression. We determine the domains of validity of such laws by analyzing
a large numerical study of the unforced Boussinesq equations on grids of 1024 cube points, with an
emphasis on atmospheric and oceanic parameters (Ro/Fr larger than 2.47), and with mostly constant
Re around 10000; the Prandtl number is one, initial conditions are isotropic and at large scale for
the velocity, and zero for the temperature fluctuations. Three regimes in Froude number, as for
stratified flows, are observed: dominant waves, eddy-wave interactions and strong turbulence.
A wave-turbulence balance for the transfer time leads to energy dissipation efficiency growing
linearly with Fr (intermediate regime), with a saturation at larger Fr numbers. The mixing efficiency
Gamma, putting together the three relationships of the model allows for the prediction of the scaling
as the square of 1/Fr in the low/intermediate regimes for high Re, whereas for higher Fr, Gamma scales
as the square-root of RB, as already observed: as turbulence strengthens, smaller buoyancy fluxes
altogether correspond to a decoupling of velocity and temperature fluctuations which become passive.
