We compare the design options of the existing segmented plastic antineutrino detectors with our
new geometrically improved design in terms of antineutrino detection and light collection efficiency.
The purpose of this study is to determine the most suitable design style for remote reactor monitoring
in the context of nuclear safeguards. Using Monte Carlo based GEANT4 simulation package, we perform
detector simulation based on two prominent experiments: Plastic Antineutrino Detector Array
(PANDA) and Core Monitoring by Reactor Antineutrino Detector (CORMORAD). In addition to these
two well-known designs, the design we call PANDA2 and obtain by making a small change in PANDA design,
is also considered in the simulation. The results show that while the highest antineutrino detection
efficiency is achieved with the CORMORAD and PANDA2, the light collection efficiency of the CORMORAD
is substantially less with respect to other two detectors. Furthermore, as an alternative to these
design choices, which composed of an array of identical rectangular-shaped modules, we propose
to combine regular hexagonal-shaped modules which provides to minimise the surface area of the
whole detector and consequently reduces the number of optical readouts and the amount of covering
material considerably. The simulation results show that with this geometric improvement, it is
possible to obtain more cost-effective and slightly more efficient detector with respect to PANDA
design, while it can be more expensive but better energy resolution detector compared to CORMORAD
design.
