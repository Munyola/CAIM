We present the results of the measurements of the detection efficiency for a 4.7 \r{A} neutron beam
incident upon a detector incorporating a stack of up to five MultiWire Proportional Counters (MWPC)
with Boron-coated cathodes. The cathodes were made of Aluminum and had a surface exhibiting millimeter-deep
V-shaped grooves of 45{\deg}, upon which the thin Boron film was deposited by DC magnetron sputtering.
The incident neutrons interacting with the converter layer deposited on the sidewalls of the grooves
have a higher capture probability, owing to the larger effective absorption film thickness. This
leads to a higher overall detection efficiency for the grooved cathode when compared to a cathode
with a flat surface. Both the experimental results and the predictions of the GEANT4 model suggests
that a 5-counter detector stack with coated grooved cathodes has the same efficiency as a 7-counter
stack with flat cathodes. The reduction in the number of counters in the stack without altering the
detection efficiency will prove highly beneficial for large-area position-sensitive detectors
for neutron scattering applications, for which the cost-effective manufacturing of the detector
and associated readout electronics is an important objective. The proposed detector concept could
be a technological option for one of the new chopper spectrometers and other instruments planned
to be built at the future European Spallation Source in Sweden. These results with macrostructured
cathodes generally apply not just to MWPCs but to other gaseous detectors as well.
