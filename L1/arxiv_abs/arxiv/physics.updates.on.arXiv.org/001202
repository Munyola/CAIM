This study contributes to the evaluation of the robustness and accuracy of Green's function reconstruction
from cross-correlation of strongly dispersed reverberated signals, with disentangling of the
respective roles of ballistic and reverberated ('coda') contributions. We conduct a suite of experiments
on a highly reverberating thin duralumin plate, where an approximately diffuse flexural wavefield
is generated by taking advantage of the plate reverberation and wave dispersion. A large number
of impulsive sources that cover the whole surface of the plate are used to validate ambient-noise
theory through comparison of the causal and anticausal (i.e., positive- and negative-time) terms
of the cross-correlation to one another, and to the directly measured Green's function. To quantify
the contribution of the ballistic and coda signals, the cross-correlation integral is defined
over different time windows of variable length, and the accuracy of the reconstructed Green's function
is studied as a function of the initial and end times of the integral. We show that even cross-correlations
measured over limited time windows converge to a significant part of the Green's function. Convergence
is achieved over a wide time window, which includes not only direct flexural-wave arrivals, but
also the multiply reverberated coda. We propose a model, based on normal-mode analysis that relates
the similarity between the cross-correlation and the Green's function to the statistical properties
of the plate. We also determine quantitatively how incoherent noise degrades the estimation of
the Green's function.
