We show that the spectrum of a flow field can be extracted within a local region by straightforward
filtering in physical space. We find that for a flow with a certain level regularity, the filtering
kernel must have a sufficient number of vanishing moments in order for the "filtering spectrum"
to be meaningful. Our derivation follows a similar analysis by Perrier et al. 1995 for the wavelet
spectrum, where we show that the filtering kernel has to have at least $p$ vanishing moments in order
to correctly extract a spectrum $k^{-\alpha}$ with $\alpha < p+2$. For example, any flow with a spectrum
shallower than $k^{-3}$ can be extracted by a straightforward average on grid-cells of a stencil.
We construct two new "simple stencil" kernels, ${\mathcal M}^{I}$ and ${\mathcal M}^{II}$, with
only two and three fixed stencil weight coefficients, respectively, and that have sufficient vanishing
moments to allow for extracting spectra steeper than $k^{-3}$. We demonstrate our results using
synthetic fields, 2D turbulence from a Direct Numerical Simulation, and 3D turbulence from the
JHU Database. Our method guarantees energy conservation and can extract spectra of non-quadratic
quantities self-consistently, such as kinetic energy in variable density flows, which the wavelet
spectrum cannot. The method can be useful in both simulations and experiments when a straightforward
Fourier analysis is not justified, such as within coherent flow structures covering non-rectangular
regions, in multi-phase flows, or in geophysical flows on Earth's curved surface.
