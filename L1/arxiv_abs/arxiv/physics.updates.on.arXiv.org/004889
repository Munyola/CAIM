Small interplanetary magnetic flux ropes (SIMFRs) are often detected by space satellites in the
interplanetary space near 1 AU. These ropes can be fitted by a cylindrically symmetric magnetic
model. The durations of SIMFRsare usually <12 h, and the diameters of SIMFRsare <0.20 AU and show
power law distribution. Most SIMFRs are observed in the typically slow solar wind (<500 km/s), and
only several events are observed with high speed (>700 km/s). Some SIMFRs demonstrate abnormal
heavy ion compositions, such as abnormally high He abundance, abnormally high average iron ionization,
and enhanced O7+ abundance. These SIMFRs originate from remarkablyhot coronal origins. Approximately
74.5% SIMFRs exhibit counterstreamingsuprathermal electron signatures. Given their flux rope
configuration, SIMFRs are potentially more effective for substorms. SIMFRs and magnetic clouds
havemany similar observational properties but also show some different observations.These similar
properties may indicate that SIMFRs are the interplanetary counterparts of small coronal mass
ejections. Some direct bodies of evidence have confirmed that several SIMFRs areinterplanetary
counterparts of CMEs. However, their different properties may imply that some SIMFRs haveinterplanetary
origins. Therefore, one of the main aims of future research on SIMFRs is to determine whether SIMFRs
originate from two different sources, that is, some events are formed in the solar coronal atmosphere,
whereas others originate from the interplanetary space. Finally, in this study, we offer some prospects
that shouldbe addressed in the future.
