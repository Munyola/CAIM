In this paper, novel methods are presented to measure the optical properties of muon detectors (MDs)
in the Large High-Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO), which can also be used by other experiments.
Each MD consists of a cylindrical water Cherenkov detector, with a Tyvek liner containing pure water,
and a photomultiplier tube (PMT) mounted on the top. The time distribution of the photons collected
by the PMT in the water Cherenkov detector have an approximately exponential distribution, and
their decay factor is determined by the photon absorption length in the water, the reflectivity
of the inner Tyvek surface, the mean reflecting step length of photons reflected by the inner surface,
and the ratio of reflectional Tyvek area to the total inner surface area. By considering the principles
of photon propagation in the water Cherenkov detector, we have developed novel methods to measure
the water absorption length, the Tyvek reflectivity, and the mean step length of photons. The step
length of photons can be determined by measuring the time distribution of the reflected photons
hitting the PMT after multiple photons with single wavelength are generated in the tank, with slightly
different ratios of the inner Tyvek to the total inner area. The water absorption length and Tyvek
reflectivity can be measured simultaneously by the PMT by changing the height of the water, while
the step length and Tyvek reflectivity in air can also be measured simultaneously. The proposed
novel methods are supported by deduction of formulae and verified by GEANT4 simulations and the
prototype experiment.
