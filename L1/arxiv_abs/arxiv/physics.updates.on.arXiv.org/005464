Stochastic parameterizations are used in numerical weather prediction and climate modeling to
help capture the uncertainty in the simulations and improve their statistical properties. Convergence
issues can arise when time integration methods originally developed for deterministic differential
equations are applied naively to stochastic problems. (Hodyss et al 2013, 2014) demonstrated that
a correction term to various deterministic numerical schemes, known in stochastic analysis as
the It\^o correction, can help improve solution accuracy and ensure convergence to the physically
relevant solution without substantial computational overhead. The usual formulation of the It\^o
correction is valid only when the stochasticity is represented by {\it white} noise. In this study,
a generalized formulation of the It\^o correction is derived for noises of any color. It is applied
to a test problem described by an advection-diffusion equation forced with a spectrum of fast processes.
We present numerical results for cases with both constant and spatially varying advection velocities
to show that, for the same time step sizes, the introduction of the generalized It\^o correction
helps to substantially reduce time integration error and significantly improve the convergence
rate of the numerical solutions when the forcing term in the governing equation is rough (fast varying);
alternatively, for the same target accuracy, the generalized It\^o correction allows for the use
of significantly longer time steps and hence helps to reduce the computational cost of the numerical
simulation.
