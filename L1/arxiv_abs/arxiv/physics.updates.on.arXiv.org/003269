In recent years several research efforts focused on the development of high-order discontinuous
Galerkin (dG) methods for scale resolving simulations of turbulent flows. Nevertheless, in the
context of incompressible flow computations, the computational expense of solving large scale
equation systems characterized by indefinite Jacobian matrices has often prevented from dealing
with industrially-relevant computations. In this work we seek to improve the efficiency of Rosenbrock-type
linearly-implicit Runge-Kutta methods by devising robust, scalable and memory-lean solution
strategies. In particular, we combined p-multigrid preconditioners with matrix-free Krylov
iterative solvers: the p-multigrid preconditioner relies on specifically crafted rescaled-inherited
coarse operators and cheap block-diagonal smoother's preconditioners to obtain satisfactory
convergence rates and a low memory occupation. Extensive numerical validation is performed. The
rescaled-inherited p-multigrid algorithm for the BR2 dG discretization is firstly validated
solving Poisson problems. The Rosenbrock formulation is then applied to test cases of growing complexity:
the laminar unsteady flow around a two-dimensional cylinder at Re=200 and around a sphere at Re=300,
and finally the transitional T3L1 flow problem of the ERCOFTAC test case suite with different levels
of free-stream turbulence. For the latter good agreement with experimental data is documented,
moreover, strong memory savings and execution time gains with respect to state-of-the art preconditioners
are reported.
