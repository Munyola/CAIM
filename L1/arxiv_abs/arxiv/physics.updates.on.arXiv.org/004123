We present a local approach to the study of scale-to-scale energy transfers in magnetohydrodynamic
(MHD) turbulence. This approach is based on performing local averages of the physical fields, which
amounts to filtering scales smaller than some parameter $\ell$. A key step in this work is the derivation
of a local K\'arm\'an-Howarth-Monin relation which provides a local form of Politano and Pouquet's
4/3-law without any assumption of homogeneity or isotropy. Our approach is exact, non-random,
and we show its connection to the usual statistical notions of turbulence. We then apply it to turbulent
data obtained via a three dimensional direct numerical simulation of the forced, incompressible
MHD equations from the John Hopkins turbulent database. The local K\'arm\'an-Howarth-Monin relation
holds well. The space statistics of local cross-scale transfers is studied next, their means and
standard deviations being maximum at inertial scales, and their probability density functions
(PDFs) displaying very wide tails. Events constituting the tails of the PDFs are shown to form structures
of strong transfers, either positive or negative, and which can be observed over the whole available
range of scales. As $\ell$ is decreased, these structures become more and more localized in space
while contributing to an increasing fraction of the mean energy cascade rate. Finally, we highlight
their quasi 1D (filament-like) or quasi 2D (sheet/ribbon-lke) nature, and show that they appear
in areas of strong vorticity or electric current density.
