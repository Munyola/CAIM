Modeling buildings' heat dynamics is a complex process which depends on various factors including
weather, building thermal capacity, insulation preservation, and residents' behavior. Gray-box
models offer a causal inference of those dynamics expressed in few parameters specific to built
environments. These parameters can provide compelling insights into the characteristics of building
artifacts and have various applications such as forecasting HVAC usage, indoor temperature control
monitoring of built environments, etc. In this paper, we present a systematic study of modeling
buildings' thermal characteristics and thus derive the parameters of built conditions with a Bayesian
approach. We build a Bayesian state-space model that can adapt and incorporate buildings' thermal
equations and propose a generalized solution that can easily adapt prior knowledge regarding the
parameters. We show that a faster approximate approach using variational inference for parameter
estimation can provide similar parameters as that of a more time-consuming Markov Chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC) approach. We perform extensive evaluations on two datasets to understand the generative
process and show that the Bayesian approach is more interpretable. We further study the effects
of prior selection for the model parameters and transfer learning, where we learn parameters from
one season and use them to fit the model in the other. We perform extensive evaluations on controlled
and real data traces to enumerate buildings' parameter within a 95% credible interval.
