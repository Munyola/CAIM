The era of Unmanned aviation is flourishing and advancing in leaps and bounds jumping over all challenges
and obstacles. One of the serious hinderances to the booming industry is the lack of sufficient reliability
studies about the systems used on board these flying robots. Accordingly, this poses a threat to
the safety and well-being of human communities as well as the loss of assets, especially in BLOS flights.
The need for a reliable endurance investigation is emerging from the fact that many of the systems
and components used on UAS are COTS which comes with scarce information, if any, about its reliability
and operation-life expectancy. This topic is of vital importance to regulatory organizations
to consider legalizing commercial flights that are not in the field of the human operators' line
of sight. Servos are one type of these crucial components used in UAS which lack thorough reliability
evaluations. This study addresses this concern through a case study of the servo used on the Boeing
Insitu ScanEagle to control its ailerons. To offer the expected information about the reliability
of the components, a destructive test platform was sought. A test-bed was designed to operate the
servo to failure using the actual commanded positions it operates to in its real-life service. The
test-bed commands the servo and logs its actual movements along with the commanded positions. These
logs are used to detect the discrepancy between the commanded and actual positions to give a statistical
estimate about how long the servo will endure.
