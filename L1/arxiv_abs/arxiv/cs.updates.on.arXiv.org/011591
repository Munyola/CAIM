A widely studied problem in communication networks is that of finding the maximum number of communication
requests that can be concurrently scheduled, provided that there are at most $k$ requests that pass
through any given edge of the network. In this work we consider the problem of finding the largest
number of given subtrees of a tree that satisfy given load constraints. This is an extension of the
problem of finding a largest induced $k$-colorable subgraph of a chordal graph (which is the intersection
graph of subtrees of a tree). We extend a greedy algorithm that solves the latter problem for interval
graphs, and obtain an $M$-approximation for chordal graphs where $M$ is the maximum number of leaves
of the subtrees in the representation of the chordal graph. This implies a 2-approximation for \textsc{Vpt}}
graphs (vertex-intersection graphs of paths in a tree), and an optimal algorithm for the class of
directed path graphs (vertex-intersection graphs of paths in a directed tree) which in turn extends
the class of interval graphs. In fact, we consider a more general problem that is defined on the subtrees
of the representation of chordal graphs, in which we allow any set of different bounds on the vertices
and edges. Thus our algorithm generalizes the known one in two directions: first, it applies to more
general graph classes, and second, it does not require the same bound for all the edges (of the representation).
Last, we present a polynomial-time algorithm for the general problem where instances are restricted
to paths in a star.
