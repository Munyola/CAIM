We prove a quantum information-theoretic conjecture due to Ji, Liu and Song (CRYPTO 2018) which
suggested that a uniform superposition with random \emph{binary} phase is statistically indistinguishable
from a Haar random state. That is, any polynomial number of copies of the aforementioned state is
within exponentially small trace distance from the same number of copies of a Haar random state.
As a consequence, we get a provable elementary construction of \emph{pseudorandom} quantum states
from post-quantum pseudorandom functions. Generating pseduorandom quantum states is desirable
for physical applications as well as for computational tasks such as quantum money. We observe that
replacing the pseudorandom function with a $(2t)$-wise independent function (either in our construction
or in previous work), results in an explicit construction for \emph{quantum state $t$-designs}
for all $t$. In fact, we show that the circuit complexity (in terms of both circuit size and depth)
of constructing $t$-designs is bounded by that of $(2t)$-wise independent functions. Explicitly,
while in prior literature $t$-designs required linear depth (for $t > 2$), this observation shows
that polylogarithmic depth suffices for all $t$. We note that our constructions yield pseudorandom
states and state designs with only real-valued amplitudes, which was not previously known. Furthermore,
generating these states require quantum circuit of restricted form: applying one layer of Hadamard
gates, followed by a sequence of Toffoli gates. This structure may be useful for efficiency and simplicity
of implementation.
