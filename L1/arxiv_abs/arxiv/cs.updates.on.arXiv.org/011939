Hyperspectral image (HSI) classification, which aims to assign an accurate label for hyperspectral
pixels, has drawn great interest in recent years. Although low rank representation (LRR) has been
used to classify HSI, its ability to segment each class from the whole HSI data has not been exploited
fully yet. LRR has a good capacity to capture the underlying lowdimensional subspaces embedded
in original data. However, there are still two drawbacks for LRR. First, LRR does not consider the
local geometric structure within data, which makes the local correlation among neighboring data
easily ignored. Second, the representation obtained by solving LRR is not discriminative enough
to separate different data. In this paper, a novel locality and structure regularized low rank representation
(LSLRR) model is proposed for HSI classification. To overcome the above limitations, we present
locality constraint criterion (LCC) and structure preserving strategy (SPS) to improve the classical
LRR. Specifically, we introduce a new distance metric, which combines both spatial and spectral
features, to explore the local similarity of pixels. Thus, the global and local structures of HSI
data can be exploited sufficiently. Besides, we propose a structure constraint to make the representation
have a near block-diagonal structure. This helps to determine the final classification labels
directly. Extensive experiments have been conducted on three popular HSI datasets. And the experimental
results demonstrate that the proposed LSLRR outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.
