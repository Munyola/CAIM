Tactile sensing is a essential for skilled manipulation and object perception, but existing devices
are unable to capture mechanical signals in the full gamut of regimes that are important for human
touch sensing, and are unable to emulate the sensing abilities of the human hand. Recent research
reveals that human touch sensing relies on the transmission of mechanical waves throughout tissues
of the hand. This provides the hand with remarkable abilities to remotely capture distributed vibration
signatures of touch contact. Little engineering attention has been given to important sensory
system. Here, we present a wearable device inspired by the anatomy and function of the hand and by
human sensory abilities. The device is based on a 126 channel sensor array capable of capturing high
resolution tactile signals during natural manual activities. It employs a network of miniature
three-axis sensors mounted on a flexible circuit whose geometry and topology were designed match
the anatomy of the hand, permitting data capture during natural interactions, while minimizing
artifacts. Each sensor possesses a frequency bandwidth matching the human tactile frequency range.
Data is acquired in real time via a custom FPGA and an I$^2$C network. We also present physiologically
informed signal processing methods for reconstructing whole hand tactile signals using data from
this system. We report experiments that demonstrate the ability of this system to accurately capture
remotely produced whole hand tactile signals during manual interactions.
