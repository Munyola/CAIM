The human brain comprises about a hundred billion neurons connected through quadrillion synapses.
Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) take inspiration from the brain to model complex cognitive and learning
tasks. Neuromorphic engineering implements SNNs in hardware, aspiring to mimic the brain at scale
(i.e., 100 billion neurons) with biological area and energy efficiency. The design of ultra-energy
efficient and compact neurons is essential for the large-scale implementation of SNNs in hardware.
In this work, we have experimentally demonstrated a Partially Depleted (PD) Silicon-On-Insulator
(SOI) MOSFET based Leaky-Integrate & Fire (LIF) neuron where energy-and area-efficiency is enabled
by two elements of design - first tunneling based operation and second compact sub-threshold SOI
control circuit design. Band-to-Band Tunneling (BTBT) induced hole storage in the body is used
for the "Integrate" function of the neuron. A compact control circuit "Fires" a spike when the body
potential exceeds the firing threshold. The neuron then "Resets" by removing the stored holes from
the body contact of the device. Additionally, the control circuit provides "Leakiness" in the neuron
which is an essential property of biological neurons. The proposed neuron provides 10x higher area
efficiency compared to CMOS design with equivalent energy/spike. Alternatively, it has 10^4x
higher energy efficiency at area-equivalent neuron technologies. Biologically comparable energy-
and area-efficiency along with CMOS compatibility make the proposed device attractive for large-scale
hardware implementation of SNNs.
