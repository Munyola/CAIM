While bibliometrics are widely used for research evaluation purposes, a common theoretical framework
for conceptually understanding, empirically studying, and effectively teaching its usage is
lacking. In this paper, we outline such a framework: the fast-and-frugal heuristics research program,
proposed originally in the context of the cognitive and decision sciences, lends itself particularly
well for understanding and investigating the usage of bibliometrics in research evaluations.
Such evaluations represent judgments under uncertainty in which typically not all possible options,
their consequences, and those consequences' probabilities of occurring may be known. In these
situations of incomplete information, candidate descriptive and prescriptive models of human
behavior are heuristics. Heuristics are simple strategies that, by exploiting the structure of
environments, can aid people to make smart decisions. Relying on heuristics does not mean trading
off accuracy against effort: while reducing complexity, heuristics can yield better decisions
than more information-greedy procedures in many decision environments. The prescriptive power
of heuristics is documented in a cross-disciplinary literature, cutting across medicine, crime,
business, sports, and other domains. We outline the fast-and-frugal heuristics research program,
provide examples of past empirical work on heuristics outside the field of bibliometrics, explain
why heuristics may be especially suitable for studying the usage of bibliometrics, and propose
a corresponding conceptual framework.
