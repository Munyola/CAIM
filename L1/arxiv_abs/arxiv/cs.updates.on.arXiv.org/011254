In the fast-growing smart devices, Android is the most popular OS, and due to its attractive features,
mobility, ease of use, these devices hold sensitive information such as personal data, browsing
history, shopping history, financial details, etc. Therefore, any security gap in these devices
means that the information stored or accessing the smart devices are at high risk of being breached
by the malware. These malware are continuously growing and are also used for military espionage,
disrupting the industry, power grids, etc. To detect these malware, traditional signature matching
techniques are widely used. However, such strategies are not capable to detect the advanced Android
malicious apps because malware developer uses several obfuscation techniques. Hence, researchers
are continuously addressing the security issues in the Android based smart devices. Therefore,
in this paper using Drebin benchmark malware dataset we experimentally demonstrate how to improve
the detection accuracy by analyzing the apps after grouping the collected data based on the permissions
and achieved 97.15% overall average accuracy. Our results outperform the accuracy obtained without
grouping data (79.27%, 2017), Arp, et al. (94%, 2014), Annamalai et al. (84.29%, 2016), Bahman Rashidi
et al. (82%, 2017)) and Ali Feizollah, et al. (95.5%, 2017). The analysis also shows that among the
groups, Microphone group detection accuracy is least while Calendar group apps are detected with
the highest accuracy, and with the highest accuracy, and for the best performance, one shall take
80-100 features.
