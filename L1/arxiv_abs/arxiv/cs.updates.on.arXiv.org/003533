SRAM-based FPGAs are popular in the aerospace industry for their field programmability and low
cost. However, they suffer from cosmic radiation-induced Single Event Upsets (SEUs). Triple Modular
Redundancy (TMR) is a well-known technique to mitigate SEUs in FPGAs that is often used with another
SEU mitigation technique known as configuration scrubbing. Traditional TMR provides protection
against a single fault at a time, while partitioned TMR provides improved reliability and availability.
In this paper, we present a methodology to analyze TMR partitioning at early design stage using probabilistic
model checking. The proposed formal model can capture both single and multiple-cell upset scenarios,
regardless of any assumption of equal partition sizes. Starting with a high-level description
of a design, a Markov model is constructed from the Data Flow Graph (DFG) using a specified number
of partitions, a component characterization library and a user defined scrub rate. Such a model
and exhaustive analysis captures all the considered failures and repairs possible in the system
within the radiation environment. Various reliability and availability properties are then verified
automatically using the PRISM model checker exploring the relationship between the scrub frequency
and the number of TMR partitions required to meet the design requirements. Also, the reported results
show that based on a known voter failure rate, it is possible to find an optimal number of partitions
at early design stages using our proposed method.
