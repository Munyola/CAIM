The increasing popularity and diversity of social media sites has encouraged more and more people
to participate in multiple online social networks to enjoy their services. Each user may create
a user identity to represent his or her unique public figure in every social network. User identity
linkage across online social networks is an emerging task and has attracted increasing attention,
which could potentially impact various domains such as recommendations and link predictions.
The majority of existing work focuses on mining network proximity or user profile data for discovering
user identity linkages. With the recent advancements in graph neural networks (GNNs), it provides
great potential to advance user identity linkage since users are connected in social graphs, and
learning latent factors of users and items is the key. However, predicting user identity linkages
based on GNNs faces challenges. For example, the user social graphs encode both \textit{local}
structure such as users' neighborhood signals, and \textit{global} structure with community
properties. To address these challenges simultaneously, in this paper, we present a novel graph
neural network framework ({\m}) for user identity linkage. In particular, we provide a principled
approach to jointly capture local and global information in the user-user social graph and propose
the framework {\m}, which jointly learning user representations for user identity linkage. Extensive
experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.
