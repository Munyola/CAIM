In computer vision, the gradient and Laplacian of an image are used in many different applications,
such as edge detection, feature extraction and seamless image cloning. To obtain the gradient of
an image, it requires the use of numerical derivatives, which are available in most computer vision
toolboxes. However, the reverse problem is more difficult, since computing an image from its gradient
requires to solve the Laplacian differential equation. The problem with the current existing methods
is that they provide a solution that is prone to high numerical errors, and that they are either slow
or require heavy parallel computing. The objective of this paper is to present a novel fast and robust
method of computing the image from its gradient or Laplacian with minimal error, which can be used
for gradient-domain editing. By using a single convolution based on Green's function, the whole
process is faster and easier to implement. It can also be optimized on a GPU using fast Fourier transforms
and can easily be generalized for an n-dimension image. The tests show that the gradient solver takes
around 2 milliseconds (ms) to reconstruct an image of 801x1200 pixels compared to between 6ms and
3000ms for competing methods. Furthermore, it is proven mathematically that the proposed method
gives the optimal result when a perturbation is added, meaning that it always produces the least-error
solution for gradient-domain editing. Finally, the developed method is validated with examples
of Poisson blending, gradient removal, edge preserving blurring and edge-preserving painting
effect.
