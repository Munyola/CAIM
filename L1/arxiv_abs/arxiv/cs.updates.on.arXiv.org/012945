L\'{e}vy flights is a random walk where the step-lengths have a probability distribution that is
heavy-tailed. It has been shown that L\'{e}vy flights can maximize the efficiency of resource searching
in uncertain environments, and also movements of many foragers and wandering animals have been
shown to follow a L\'{e}vy distribution. The reason mainly comes from that the L\'{e}vy distribution,
has an infinite second moment, and hence is more likely to generate an offspring that is farther away
from its parent. However, the investigation into the efficiency of other different heavy-tailed
probability distributions in swarm-based searches is still insufficient up to now. For swarm-based
search algorithms, randomness plays a significant role in both exploration and exploitation,
or diversification and intensification. Therefore, it's necessary to discuss the optimal randomness
in swarm-based search algorithms. In this study, CS is taken as a representative method of swarm-based
optimization algorithms, and the results can be generalized to other swarm-based search algorithms.
In this paper, four different types of commonly used heavy-tailed distributions, including Mittag-Leffler
distribution, Pareto distribution, Cauchy distribution, and Weibull distribution, are considered
to enhance the searching ability of CS. Then four novel CS algorithms are proposed and experiments
are carried out on 20 benchmark functions to compare their searching performances. Finally, the
proposed methods are used to system identification to demonstrate the effectiveness.
