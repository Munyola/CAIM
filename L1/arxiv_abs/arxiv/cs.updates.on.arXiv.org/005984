We are witnessing an increasing growth of autonomous platforms such as self-driving cars and social
robots around us. These mobile machines need to navigate dynamic human environments safely and
in a socially acceptable way. Hence, understanding the human behavior and the physical constraints
of the environment is crucial. To address the task of path prediction for multiple interacting agents
in a scene, we present SoPhie; an interpretable framework based on Generative Adversarial Network
(GAN). Sophie leverages two sources of information: the past trajectory of all the agents in the
scene and a wide top-view image of the navigation scene. Our approach combines a physical attention
mechanism with a social attention mechanism. The physical attention component helps the model
to learn where to look in a large scene and extract the most salient parts of the image relevant to the
path. Whereas, the social attention component is able to aggregate information across different
involved agents and extract the most important trajectory information from the surrounding agents,
enabling our method to predict socially aware paths. SoPhie is able to capture the multi-modal nature
of the future prediction: given the history of trajectories and a navigation scene, there can be
multiple acceptable paths in the future. Through experiments on several trajectory forecasting
benchmarks, we show that SoPhie outperforms prior work in terms of accuracy, while predicting physically
appropriate paths. We also show that SoPhie is able to classify traversable vs non-traversable
locations in a scene.
