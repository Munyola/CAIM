With aggressively shrinking process technologies, physical design faces severe challenges and
early detection of failures is mandated. It may otherwise lead to many iterations and thus impact
time-to-market. This has encouraged to devise a feedback mechanism from a lower abstraction level
of the design flow towards the higher levels. Some of these efforts include placement driven synthesis,
routability (timing) driven placement etc. Motivated by this philosophy, we propose a novel global
routing method using monotone staircase routing regions (channels), defined at the floorplanning
stage. The intent is to identify the feasibility of a floorplan topology of the given design netlist
by estimating routability, routed net length and the number of vias while taking into account global
congestion scenario across the layout. This framework works on both unreserved as well as HV reserved
layer model for $M(\geq 2)$ metal layers and accommodates different capacity profiles of the routing
resources, due to uniform or different cases of metal pitch variation across the metals layers akin
to the latest technologies. This algorithm takes $O(n^2kt)$ time for a given design with $n$ blocks
and $k$ nets having at most $t$ terminals. Experimental results on MCNC/GSRC floorplanning benchmarks
show $100\%$ routability while congestion in the routing regions restricted to $100\%$. The routed
net length for all $t$-terminal ($t\geq$ 2) nets is comparable with the steiner length computed
by FLUTE. An estimation on the number of vias for different capacity profiles are also obtained.
