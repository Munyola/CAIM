Research on neural networks has gained significant momentum over the past few years. A plethora
of neural networks is currently being trained on available data in research as well as in industry.
Because training is a resource-intensive process and training data cannot always be made available
to everyone, there has been a recent trend to attempt to re-use already-trained neural networks.
As such, neural networks themselves have become research data. In this paper, we present the Neural
Network Ontology, an ontology to make neural networks findable, accessible, interoperable and
reusable as suggested by the well-established FAIR guiding principles for scientific data management
and stewardship. We created the new FAIRnets Dataset that comprises about 2,000 neural networks
openly accessible on the internet and uses the Neural Network Ontology to semantically annotate
and represent the neural networks. For each of the neural networks in the FAIRnets Dataset, the relevant
properties according to the Neural Network Ontology such as the description and the architecture
are stored. Ultimately, the FAIRnets Dataset can be queried with a set of desired properties and
responds with a set of neural networks that have these properties. We provide the service FAIRnets
Search which is implemented on top of a SPARQL endpoint and allows for querying, searching and finding
trained neural networks annotated with the Neural Network Ontology. The service is demonstrated
by a browser-based frontend to the SPARQL endpoint.
