Our problem of interest is to cluster vertices of a graph by identifying its underlying community
structure. Among various vertex clustering approaches, spectral clustering is one of the most
popular methods, because it is easy to implement while often outperforming traditional clustering
algorithms. However, there are two inherent model selection problems in spectral clustering,
namely estimating the embedding dimension and number of clusters. This paper attempts to address
the issue by establishing a novel model selection framework specifically for vertex clustering
on graphs under a stochastic block model. The first contribution is a probabilistic model which
approximates the distribution of the extended spectral embedding of a graph. The model is constructed
based on a theoretical result of asymptotic normality of the informative part of the embedding,
and on a simulation result of limiting behavior of the redundant part of the embedding. The second
contribution is a simultaneous model selection framework. In contrast with the traditional approaches,
our model selection procedure estimates embedding dimension and number of clusters simultaneously.
Based on our proposed distributional model, a theorem on the consistency of the estimates of model
parameters is stated and proven. The theorem provides a statistical support for the validity of
our method. Heuristic algorithms via the simultaneous model selection framework for vertex clustering
are proposed, with good performance shown in the experiment on synthetic data and on the real application
of connectome analysis.
