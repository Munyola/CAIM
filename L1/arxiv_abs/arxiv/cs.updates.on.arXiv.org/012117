A vector addition system with states (VASS) consists of a finite set of states and counters. A configuration
is a state and a value for each counter; a transition changes the state and each counter is incremented,
decremented, or left unchanged. While qualitative properties such as state and configuration
reachability have been studied for VASS, we consider the long-run average cost of infinite computations
of VASS. The cost of a configuration is for each state, a linear combination of the counter values.
In the special case of uniform cost functions, the linear combination is the same for all states.
The (regular) long-run emptiness problem is, given a VASS, a cost function, and a threshold value,
if there is a (lasso-shaped) computation such that the long-run average value of the cost function
does not exceed the threshold. For uniform cost functions, we show that the regular long-run emptiness
problem is (a)~decidable in polynomial time for integer-valued VASS, and (b)~decidable but nonelementarily
hard for natural-valued VASS (i.e., nonnegative counters). For general cost functions, we show
that the problem is (c)~NP-complete for integer-valued VASS, and (d)~undecidable for natural-valued
VASS. Our most interesting result is for (c) integer-valued VASS with general cost functions, where
we establish a connection between the regular long-run emptiness problem and quadratic Diophantine
inequalities. The general (nonregular) long-run emptiness problem is equally hard as the regular
problem in all cases except (c), where it remains open.
