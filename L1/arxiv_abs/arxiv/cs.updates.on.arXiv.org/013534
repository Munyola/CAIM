The classical setting of optimal control theory assumes full knowledge of the process dynamics
and the costs associated with every control strategy. The problem becomes much harder if the controller
only knows a finite set of possible running cost functions, but has no way of checking which of these
running costs is actually in place. In this paper we address this challenge for a class of evasive
path planning problems on a continuous domain, in which an Evader needs to reach a target while minimizing
his exposure to an enemy Observer, who is in turn selecting from a finite set of known surveillance
plans. Our key assumption is that both the evader and the observer need to commit to their (possibly
probabilistic) strategies in advance and cannot immediately change their actions based on any
newly discovered information about the opponent's current position. We consider two types of evader
behavior: in the first one, a completely risk-averse evader seeks a trajectory minimizing his {\em
worst-case} cumulative observability, and in the second, the evader is concerned with minimizing
the {\em average-case} cumulative observability. The latter version is naturally interpreted
as a semi-infinite strategic game, and we provide an efficient method for approximating its Nash
equilibrium. The proposed approach draws on methods from game theory, convex optimization, optimal
control, and multiobjective dynamic programming. We illustrate our algorithm using numerical
examples and discuss the computational complexity, including for the generalized version with
multiple evaders.
