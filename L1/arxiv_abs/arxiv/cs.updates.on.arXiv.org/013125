Poisson Voronoi tessellations have been used in modeling many types of systems across different
sciences, from geography and astronomy to telecommunications. The existing literature on the
statistical properties of Poisson Voronoi cells is vast, however, little is known about the properties
of Voronoi cells located close to the boundaries of a compact domain. In a domain with boundaries,
some Voronoi cells would be naturally clipped by the boundary, and the cell area falling inside the
deployment domain would have different statistical properties as compared to those of non-clipped
Voronoi cells located in the bulk of the domain. In this paper, we consider the planar Voronoi tessellation
induced by a homogeneous Poisson point process of intensity $\lambda\!>\!0$ in a quadrant, where
the two half-axes represent boundaries. We show that the mean cell area is less than $\lambda^{-1}$
when the seed is located exactly at the boundary, and it can be larger than $\lambda^{-1}$ when the
seed lies close to the boundary. In addition, we calculate the second moment of cell area at two locations
for the seed: (i) at the corner of a quadrant, and (ii) at the boundary of the half-plane. We illustrate
that the two-parameter Gamma distribution, with location-dependent parameters calculated using
the method of moments, can be of use in approximating the distribution of cell area. As a potential
application, we use the Gamma approximations to study the degree distribution for secure connectivity
in wireless sensor networks deployed over a domain with boundaries.
