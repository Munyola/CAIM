With the rise of the Internet, there is a growing need to build intelligent systems that are capable
of efficiently dealing with early risk detection (ERD) problems on social media, such as early depression
detection, early rumor detection or identification of sexual predators. These systems, nowadays
mostly based on machine learning techniques, must be able to deal with data streams since users provide
their data over time. In addition, these systems must be able to decide when the processed data is
sufficient to actually classify users. Moreover, since ERD tasks involve risky decisions by which
people's lives could be affected, such systems must also be able to justify their decisions. However,
most standard and state-of-the-art supervised machine learning models (such as SVM, MNB, Neural
Networks, etc.) are not well suited to deal with this scenario. This is due to the fact that they either
act as black boxes or do not support incremental classification/learning. In this paper we introduce
SS3, a novel supervised learning model for text classification that naturally supports these aspects.
SS3 was designed to be used as a general framework to deal with ERD problems. We evaluated our model
on the CLEF's eRisk2017 pilot task on early depression detection. Most of the 30 contributions submitted
to this competition used state-of-the-art methods. Experimental results show that our classifier
was able to outperform these models and standard classifiers, despite being less computationally
expensive and having the ability to explain its rationale.
