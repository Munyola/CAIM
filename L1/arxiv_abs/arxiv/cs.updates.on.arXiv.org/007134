Understanding nonlinear dynamical systems (NLDSs) is challenging in a variety of engineering
and scientific fields. Dynamic mode decomposition (DMD), which is a numerical algorithm for the
spectral analysis of Koopman operators, has been attracting attention as a way of obtaining global
modal descriptions of NLDSs without requiring explicit prior knowledge. However, since existing
DMD algorithms are in principle formulated based on the concatenation of scalar observables, it
is not directly applicable to data with dependent structures among observables, which take, for
example, the form of a sequence of graphs. In this paper, we formulate Koopman spectral analysis
for NLDSs with structures among observables and propose an estimation algorithm for this problem.
This method can extract and visualize the underlying low-dimensional global dynamics of NLDSs
with structures among observables from data, which can be useful in understanding the underlying
dynamics of such NLDSs. To this end, we first formulate the problem of estimating spectra of the Koopman
operator defined in vector-valued reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces, and then develop an estimation
procedure for this problem by reformulating tensor-based DMD. As a special case of our method, we
propose the method named as Graph DMD, which is a numerical algorithm for Koopman spectral analysis
of graph dynamical systems, using a sequence of adjacency matrices. We investigate the empirical
performance of our method by using synthetic and real-world data.
