While bibliometrics is widely used for research evaluation purposes, a common theoretical framework
for conceptually understanding, empirically studying, and effectively teaching their usage
is lacking. In this paper, we develop one such framework: the fast-and-frugal heuristics research
program, proposed originally in the context of the cognitive and decision sciences, lends itself
particularly well for understanding and investigating the usage of bibliometrics in research
evaluations. Such evaluations represent judgments under uncertainty in which typically neither
all possible outcomes, nor their consequences, and probabilities are known, knowable, or can be
reliably estimated. In such situations of fuzzy and incomplete information, good descriptive
and prescriptive models of human behavior are heuristics. Heuristics are simple strategies that,
by exploiting the structure of environments, can aid people to make smart decisions. Relying on
heuristics does not mean trading off accuracy against effort: while reducing complexity, heuristics
can yield better decisions than more information-greedy procedures in many environments. This
is well-documented in a large literature, cutting across psychology, computer science, crime,
the law, medicine, and other domains. We outline the fast-and-frugal research program, illustrate
examples of past research on heuristics outside the field of bibliometrics, explain why heuristics
are especially suitable for studying the usage of bibliometrics, and outline a corresponding conceptual
framework.
