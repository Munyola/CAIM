Software rejuvenation protects cyber-physical systems (CSPs) against cyber attacks on the run-time
code by periodically refreshing the system with an uncorrupted software image. The system is vulnerable
to attacks when it is communicating with other agents. Security is guaranteed during the software
refresh and re-initialization by turning off all communication. Although the effectiveness of
software rejuvenation has been demonstrated for some simple systems, many problems need to be addressed
to make it viable for real applications. This paper expands the scope of CPS applications for which
software rejuvenation can be implemented by introducing architectural and algorithmic features
to support trajectory tracking. Following each software refresh, while communication is still
off, a safety controller is executed to assure the system state is within a sufficiently small neighborhood
of the current point on the reference trajectory. Communication is then re-established and the
reference trajectory tracking control is resumed. A protected, verified hypervisor manages the
software rejuvenation sequence and delivers trusted reference trajectory points, which may be
received from untrusted communication, but are verified using an authentication process. We present
the approach to designing the tracking and safety controllers and timing parameters and demonstrate
the secure tracking control for a 6 DOF quadrotor using the PX4 jMAVSim quadrotor simulator. The
concluding section discusses directions for further research.
