A particular measure to evaluate a head-mounted display (HMD) based experience is the state of feeling
present in virtual reality. Interruptions of a presence experience - break in presence (BIP) - appearing
over time, need to be detected to assess and improve an application. Existing methods either lack
in taking these BIPs into account - questionnaires - or are complex in their application and evaluation
- physiological and behavioral measures -. To provide a practical approach, we propose a post-experience
method in which the users reflect on their experience by drawing a line, indicating their experienced
state of presence, in a paper-based drawing template. The amplitude of the drawn line represents
the variation of their presence experience over time. We propose a descriptive model that describes
temporal variations in the drawings by the definition of relevant points over time - e.g., putting
on the HMD -, phases of the experience - e.g., transition into VR - and parameters - e.g., the transition
time -. The descriptive model enables us to objectively evaluate user drawings and represent the
course of the drawings by a defined set of parameters. An exploratory user study (N=30) showed that
the drawings are very consistent, the method can detect all BIPs and shows good indications for representing
the intensity of a BIP. With our method practitioners and researchers can accelerate the evaluation
and optimization of experiences by evaluating BIPs. The possibility to store objective parameters
paves the way for automated evaluation methods and big data approaches.
