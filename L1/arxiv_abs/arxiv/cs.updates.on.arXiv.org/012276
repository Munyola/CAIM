Throughout the process of aging, deterioration of bone macro- and micro-architecture, as well
as material decomposition result in a loss of strength and therefore in an increased likelihood
of fractures. To date, precise contributions of age-related changes in bone (re)modeling and (de)mineralization
dynamics and its effect on the loss of functional integrity are not completely understood. Here,
we present an image-based deep learning approach to quantitatively describe the dynamic effects
of short-term aging and adaptive response to treatment in proximal mouse tibia and fibula. Our approach
allowed us to perform an end-to-end age prediction based on $\mu$CT images to determine the dynamic
biological process of tissue maturation during a two week period, therefore permitting a short-term
bone aging prediction with $95\%$ accuracy. In a second application, our radiomics analysis reveals
that two weeks of in vivo mechanical loading are associated with an underlying rejuvenating effect
of 5 days. Additionally, by quantitatively analyzing the learning process, we could, for the first
time, identify the localization of the age-relevant encoded information and demonstrate $89\%$
load-induced similarity of these locations in the loaded tibia with younger bones. These data suggest
that our method enables identifying a general prognostic phenotype of a certain bone age as well
as a temporal and localized loading-treatment effect on this apparent bone age. Future translational
applications of this method may provide an improved decision-support method for osteoporosis
treatment at low cost.
