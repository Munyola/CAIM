Several studies have used structural correlation networks, derived from anatomical covariance
of brain regions, to analyze neurologic changes associated with multiple sclerosis, schizophrenia
and breast cancer [1][2]. Graph-theoretical analyses of human brain structural networks have
consistently shown the characteristic of small-worldness that reflects a network with both high
segregation and high integration. A large neuroimaging literature on football players, with and
without history of concussion, has shown both functional and anatomical changes. Here we use graph-based
topological properties of anatomical correlation networks to study the effect of prior concussion
in collision-sport athletes. 40 high school collision-sport athletes (23 male football, 17 female
soccer; CSA) without self-reported history of concussion (HOC-), 18 athletes (13 male football,
5 female soccer) with self-reported history of concussion (HOC+) and 24 healthy controls (19 male,
5 female; CN) participated in imaging sessions before the beginning of a competition season. The
extracted residual volumes for each group were used for building the correlation networks and their
small-worldness, , is calculated. The small-worldness of CSA without prior history of concussion,
, is significantly greater than that of controls, . CSA with prior history have significantly higher
(vs. 95% confidence interval) small-worldness compared to HOC+, over a range of network densities.
The longer path lengths in HOC+ group could indicate disrupted neuronal integration relative to
healthy controls.
