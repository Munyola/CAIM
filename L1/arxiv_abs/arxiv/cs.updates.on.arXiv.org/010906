A non-redundant integer cone generator (NICG) of dimension $d$ is a set $S$ of vectors from $\{0,1\}^d$
whose vector sum cannot be generated as a positive integer linear combination of a proper subset
of $S$. The largest possible cardinality of NICG of a dimension $d$, denoted by $N(d)$, provides
an upper bound on the sparsity of systems of integer equations with a large number of integer variables.
A better estimate of $N(d)$ means that we can consider smaller sub-systems of integer equations
when solving systems with many integer variables. Furthermore, given that we can reduce constraints
on set algebra expressions to constraints on cardinalities of Venn regions, tighter upper bound
on $N(d)$ yields a more efficient decision procedure for a logic of sets with cardinality constraints
(BAPA), which has been applied in software verification. Previous attempts to compute $N(d)$ using
SAT solvers have not succeeded even for $d=3$. The only known values were computed manually: $N(d)=d$
for $d < 4$ and $N(4) > 4$. We provide the first exact values for $d > 3$, namely, $N(4)=5$, $N(5)=7$,
and $N(6)=9$, which is a significant improvement of the known asymptotic bound (which would give
only e.g. $N(6) \le 29$, making a decision procedure impractical for $d=6$). We also give lower bounds
for $N(7)$, $N(8)$, $N(9)$, and $N(10)$, which are: $11$, $13$, $14$, and $16$, respectively. We
describe increasingly sophisticated specialized search algorithms that we used to explore the
space of non-redundant generators and obtain these results.
