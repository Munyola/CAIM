The polytope containment problem is deciding whether a polytope is a contained within another polytope.
This problem is rooted in computational convexity, and arises in applications such as verification
and control of dynamical systems. The complexity heavily depends on how the polytopes are represented.
Describing polytopes by their hyperplanes (H-polytopes) is a popular representation. In many
applications we use affine transformations of H-polytopes, which we refer to as AH-polytopes.
Zonotopes, orthogonal projections of H-polytopes, and convex hulls/Minkowski sums of multiple
H-polytopes can be efficiently represented as AH-polytopes. While there exists efficient necessary
and sufficient conditions for AH-polytope in H-polytope containment, the case of AH-polytope
in AH-polytope is known to be NP-complete. In this paper, we provide a sufficient condition for this
problem that is cast as a linear program with size that grows linearly with the number of hyperplanes
of each polytope. Special cases on zonotopes, Minkowski sums, convex hulls, and disjunctions of
H-polytopes are studied. These efficient encodings enable us to designate certain components
of polytopes as decision variables, and incorporate them into a convex optimization problem. We
present examples on the zonotope containment problem, polytopic Hausdorff distances, zonotope
order reduction, inner approximations of orthogonal projections, and demonstrate the usefulness
of our results on formal controller verification and synthesis for hybrid systems.
