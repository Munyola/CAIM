In this paper, we study the leaderless consensus problem for multiple Lagrangian systems in the
presence of parametric uncertainties and external disturbances under directed graphs. For achieving
asymptotic behavior, a robust continuous term with adaptive varying gains is added to alleviate
the effects of the external disturbances with unknown bounds. In the case of a fixed directed graph,
by introducing an integrate term in the auxiliary variable design, the final consensus equilibrium
can be explicitly derived. We show that the agents achieve weighted average consensus, where the
final equilibrium is dependent on three factors, namely, the interactive topology, the initial
positions of the agents, and the control gains of the proposed control algorithm. In the case of switching
directed graphs, a model reference adaptive consensus based algorithm is proposed such that the
agents achieve leaderless consensus if the infinite sequence of switching graphs is uniformly
jointly connected. Motivated by the fact that the relative velocity information is difficult to
obtain accurately, we further propose a leaderless consensus algorithm with gain adaptation for
multiple Lagrangian systems without using neighbors' velocity information. We also propose a
model reference adaptive consensus based algorithm without using neighbors' velocity information
for switching directed graphs. The proposed algorithms are distributed in the sense of using local
information from its neighbors and using no comment control gains. Numerical simulations are performed
to show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.
