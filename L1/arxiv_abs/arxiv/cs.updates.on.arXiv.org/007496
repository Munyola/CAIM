Water managers in the western United States (U.S.) rely on longterm forecasts of temperature and
precipitation to prepare for droughts and other wet weather extremes. To improve the accuracy of
these longterm forecasts, the Bureau of Reclamation and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
(NOAA) launched the Subseasonal Climate Forecast Rodeo, a year-long real-time forecasting challenge,
in which participants aimed to skillfully predict temperature and precipitation in the western
U.S. two to four weeks and four to six weeks in advance. Here we present and evaluate our machine learning
approach to the Rodeo and release our SubseasonalRodeo dataset, collected to train and evaluate
our forecasting system. Our system is an ensemble of two regression models. The first integrates
the diverse collection of meteorological measurements and dynamic model forecasts in the SubseasonalRodeo
dataset and prunes irrelevant predictors using a customized multitask model selection procedure.
The second uses only historical measurements of the target variable (temperature or precipitation)
and introduces multitask nearest neighbor features into a weighted local linear regression. Each
model alone is significantly more accurate than the operational U.S. Climate Forecasting System
(CFSv2), and our ensemble skill exceeds that of the top Rodeo competitor for each target variable
and forecast horizon. We hope that both our dataset and our methods will serve as valuable benchmarking
tools for the subseasonal forecasting problem.
