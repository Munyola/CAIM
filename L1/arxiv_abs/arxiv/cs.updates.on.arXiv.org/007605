Outlier detection is an important topic in machine learning and has been used in a wide range of applications.
In this paper, we approach outlier detection as a binary-classification issue by sampling potential
outliers from a uniform reference distribution. However, due to the sparsity of data in high-dimensional
space, a limited number of potential outliers may fail to provide sufficient information to assist
the classifier in describing a boundary that can separate outliers from normal data effectively.
To address this, we propose a novel Single-Objective Generative Adversarial Active Learning (SO-GAAL)
method for outlier detection, which can directly generate informative potential outliers based
on the mini-max game between a generator and a discriminator. Moreover, to prevent the generator
from falling into the mode collapsing problem, the stop node of training should be determined when
SO-GAAL is able to provide sufficient information. But without any prior information, it is extremely
difficult for SO-GAAL. Therefore, we expand the network structure of SO-GAAL from a single generator
to multiple generators with different objectives (MO-GAAL), which can generate a reasonable reference
distribution for the whole dataset. We empirically compare the proposed approach with several
state-of-the-art outlier detection methods on both synthetic and real-world datasets. The results
show that MO-GAAL outperforms its competitors in the majority of cases, especially for datasets
with various cluster types or high irrelevant variable ratio.
