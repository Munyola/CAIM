Load forecasting is an integral part of power system operations and planning. Due to the increasing
penetration of rooftop PV, electric vehicles and demand response applications, forecasting the
load of individual and a small group of households is becoming increasingly important. Forecasting
the load accurately, however, is considerable more difficult when only a few households are included.
A way to mitigate this challenge is to provide a set of scenarios instead of one point forecast, so
an operator or utility can consider a range of behaviors. This paper proposes a novel scenario forecasting
approach for residential load using flow-based conditional generative models. Compared to existing
scenario forecasting methods, our approach can generate scenarios that are not only able to infer
possible future realizations of residential load from the observed historical data but also realistic
enough to cover a wide range of behaviors. Particularly, the flow-based models utilize a flow of
reversible transformations to maximize the value of conditional density function of future load
given the past observations. In order to better capture the complex temporal dependency of the forecasted
future load on the condition, we extend the structure design for the reversible transformations
in flow-based conditional generative models by strengthening the coupling between the output
and the conditional input in the transformations. The simulation results show the flow-based designs
outperform existing methods in scenario forecasting for residential load by both providing more
accurate and more diverse scenarios.
