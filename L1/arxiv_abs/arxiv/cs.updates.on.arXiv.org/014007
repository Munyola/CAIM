Retinal vessel segmentation is a crucial step in diagnosing and screening for various diseases,
including diabetes, ophthalmologic diseases, and cardiovascular diseases. In this paper, we
proposed an effective and efficient method for accurate vessel segmentation in color fundus images
using encoder-decoder based octave convolution network. Compared with other convolution network
based methods that utilize vanilla convolution for feature extraction, the proposed method adopts
octave convolution for multiple-spatial-frequency features learning, thus can better capture
retinal vasculature with varying size and shape. We empirically demonstrate that the feature map
of low-frequency kernels responses mainly focus on the major vascular tree, whereas the high-frequency
feature map can better capture the fine details of thin vessels. To provide the network capability
of learning how to decode multifrequency features, we extended octave convolution and proposed
a novel operation named octave transposed convolution with the same multifrequency approach as
the octave convolution. We also proposed a novel architecture of fully convolutional neural network
named Octave UNet based on the encoder-decoder architecture of UNet. The proposed Octave UNet can
generate high-resolution vessel segmentation in single forward feeding. The proposed method
is evaluated on four publicly available datasets, DRIVE, STARE, CHASE_DB1, and HRF datasets. Extensive
experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves better or comparable performance
to the state-of-the-art methods with fast processing speed.
