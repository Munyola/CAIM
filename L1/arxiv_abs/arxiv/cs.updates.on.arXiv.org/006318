Robots with flexible spines based on tensegrity structures have potential advantages over traditional
designs with rigid torsos. However, these robots can be difficult to control due to their high-dimensional
nonlinear dynamics. To overcome these issues, this work presents two controllers for tensegrity
spine robots, using model-predictive control (MPC), and demonstrates the first closed-loop control
of such structures. The first of the two controllers is formulated using only state tracking with
smoothing constraints. The second controller, newly introduced in this work, tracks both state
and input reference trajectories without smoothing. The reference input trajectory is calculated
using a rigid-body reformulation of the inverse kinematics of tensegrity structures, and introduces
the first feasible solutions to the problem for certain tensegrity topologies. This second controller
significantly reduces the number of parameters involved in designing the control system, making
the task much easier. The controllers are simulated with 2D and 3D models of a particular tensegrity
spine, designed for use as the backbone of a quadruped robot. These simulations illustrate the different
benefits of the higher performance of the smoothing controller versus the lower tuning complexity
of the more general input-tracking formulation. Both controllers show noise insensitivity and
low tracking error, and can be used for different control goals. The reference input tracking controller
is also simulated against an additional model of a similar robot, thereby demonstrating its generality.
