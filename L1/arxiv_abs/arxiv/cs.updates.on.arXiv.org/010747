Unlike common cancers, such as those of the prostate and breast, tumor grading in rare cancers is
difficult and largely undefined because of small sample sizes, the sheer volume of time needed to
undertake on such a task, and the inherent difficulty of extracting human-observed patterns. One
of the most challenging examples is intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC), a primary liver cancer
arising from the biliary system, for which there is well-recognized tumor heterogeneity and no
grading paradigm or prognostic biomarkers. In this paper, we propose a new unsupervised deep convolutional
autoencoder-based clustering model that groups together cellular and structural morphologies
of tumor in 246 ICC digitized whole slides, based on visual similarity. From this visual dictionary
of histologic patterns, we use the clusters as covariates to train Cox-proportional hazard survival
models. In univariate analysis, three clusters were significantly associated with recurrence-free
survival. Combinations of these clusters were significant in multivariate analysis. In a multivariate
analysis of all clusters, five showed significance to recurrence-free survival, however the overall
model was not measured to be significant. Finally, a pathologist assigned clinical terminology
to the significant clusters in the visual dictionary and found evidence supporting the hypothesis
that collagen-enriched fibrosis plays a role in disease severity. These results offer insight
into the future of cancer subtyping and show that computational pathology can contribute to disease
prognostication, especially in rare cancers.
