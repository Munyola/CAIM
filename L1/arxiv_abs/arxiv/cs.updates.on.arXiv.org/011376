In the past decade, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been widely used in various civilian applications,
most of which only require a single UAV. In the near future, it is expected that more and more applications
will be enabled by the cooperation of multiple UAVs. To facilitate such applications, it is desirable
to utilize a general control platform for cooperative UAVs. However, existing open-source control
platforms cannot fulfill such a demand because (1) they only support the leader-follower mode,
which limits the design options for fleet control, (2) existing platforms can support only certain
UAVs and thus lack of compatibility, and (3) these platforms cannot accurately simulate a flight
mission, which may cause a big gap between simulation and real flight. To address these issues, we
propose a general control and monitoring platform for cooperative UAV fleet, namely, CoUAV, which
provides a set of core cooperation services of UAVs, including synchronization, connectivity
management, path planning, energy simulation, etc. To verify the applicability of CoUAV, we design
and develop a prototype and we use the new system to perform an emergency search application that
aims to complete a task with the minimum flying time. To achieve this goal, we design and implement
a path planning service that takes both the UAV network connectivity and coverage into consideration
so as to maximize the efficiency of a fleet. Experimental results by both simulation and field test
demonstrate that the proposed system is viable.
