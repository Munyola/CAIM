When data schemata are enriched with expressive constraints that aim at representing the domain
of interest, in order to answer queries one needs to consider the logical theory consisting of both
the data and the constraints. Query answering in such a context is called ontological query answering.
Commonly adopted database constraints in this field are tuple-generating dependencies (TGDs)
and equality-generating dependencies (EGDs). It is well known that their interaction leads to
intractability or undecidability of query answering even in the case of simple subclasses. Several
conditions have been found to guarantee separability, that is lack of interaction, between TGDs
and EGDs. Separability makes EGDs (mostly) irrelevant for query answering and therefore often
guarantees tractability, as long as the theory is satisfiable. In this paper we review the two notions
of separability found in the literature, as well as several syntactic conditions that are sufficient
to prove them. We then shed light on the issue of satisfiability checking, showing that under a sufficient
condition called deep separability it can be done by considering the TGDs only. We show that, fortunately,
in the case of TGDs and EGDs, separability implies deep separability. This result generalizes several
analogous ones, proved ad hoc for particular classes of constraints. Applications include the
class of sticky TGDs and EGDs, for which we provide a syntactic separability condition which extends
the analogous one for linear TGDs; preliminary experiments show the feasibility of query answering
in this case.
