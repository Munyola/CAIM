Online advertising, the backbone of the free Web, has transformed the marketing business by creating
countless opportunities for advertisers to reach potential customers. The advertising ecosystem
exists upon a complex infrastructure composed by intermediate entities and technologies whose
main goal is to deliver personalized ads to such customers. In recent years, however, advertisers
have started to develop new advanced techniques such as Cross-Device Tracking, to detect and track
the user's activity across multiple devices and target them on the all possible device. For this
method to work, a variety of user data is collected, aggregated, processed and traded behind the
scenes, and often times, without the user-data owner's informed consent. Therefore, despite the
enormous value of online advertising and support it offers to the Web, the prevalence and intensity
of these tracking and targeting practices prompt serious concerns for the online users' privacy.
In this paper, we propose a novel methodology for systematically investigating Cross-Device Tracking
and various components affecting its targeting performance. We materialize our methodology into
a platform that is able to perform small and large scale automated measurements, under different
experimental scenarios, emulated users and settings. By conducting a variety of measurements
with our framework, we are able to detect and measure Cross-Device Tracking with average accuracy
of 78-96%, and also report significant insights about its internal mechanisms and its impact on
online user's privacy.
