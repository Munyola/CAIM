Retrieving indexed documents, not by their topical content but their writing style opens the door
for a number of applications in information retrieval (IR). One application is to retrieve textual
content of a certain author X, where the queried IR system is provided beforehand with a set of reference
texts of X. Authorship verification (AV), which is a research subject in the field of digital text
forensics, is suitable for this purpose. The task of AV is to determine if two documents (i.e. an indexed
and a reference document) have been written by the same author X. Even though AV represents a unary
classification problem, a number of existing approaches consider it as a binary classification
task. However, the underlying classification model of an AV method has a number of serious implications
regarding its prerequisites, evaluability, and applicability. In our comprehensive literature
review, we observed several misunderstandings regarding the differentiation of unary and binary
AV approaches that require consideration. The objective of this paper is, therefore, to clarify
these by proposing clear criteria and new properties that aim to improve the characterization of
existing and future AV approaches. Given both, we investigate the applicability of eleven existing
unary and binary AV methods as well as four generic unary classification algorithms on two self-compiled
corpora. Furthermore, we highlight an important issue concerning the evaluation of AV methods
based on fixed decision criterions, which has not been paid attention in previous AV studies.
