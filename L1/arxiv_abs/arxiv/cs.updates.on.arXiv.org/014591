Multiclass decomposition splits a multiclass classification problem into a series of independent
binary learners and recomposes them by combining their outputs to reconstruct the multiclass classification
results. Three widely-used realizations of such decomposition methods are One-Versus-All (OVA),
One-Versus-One (OVO), and Error-Correcting-Output-Code (ECOC). While OVA and OVO are quite simple,
both of them assume all classes are orthogonal which neglect the latent correlation between classes
in real-world. Error-Correcting-Output-Code (ECOC) based decomposition methods, on the other
hand, are more preferable due to its integration of the correlation among classes. However, the
performance of existing ECOC-based methods highly depends on the design of coding matrix and decoding
strategy. Unfortunately, it is quite uncertain and time-consuming to discover an effective coding
matrix with appropriate decoding strategy. To address this problem, we propose LightMC, an efficient
dynamic multiclass decomposition algorithm. Instead of using fixed coding matrix and decoding
strategy, LightMC uses a differentiable decoding strategy, which enables it to dynamically optimize
the coding matrix and decoding strategy, toward increasing the overall accuracy of multiclass
classification, via back propagation jointly with the training of base learners in an iterative
way. Empirical experimental results on several public large-scale multiclass classification
datasets have demonstrated the effectiveness of LightMC in terms of both good accuracy and high
efficiency.
