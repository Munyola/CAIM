We consider the \emph{budgeted} version of the classical \emph{connected dominating set} problem
(BCDS). Given a graph $G$ and an integer budget $k$, we seek to find a connected subset of at most $k$
vertices which maximizes the number of dominated vertices in $G$. We answer an open question in [Khuller,
Purohit, and Sarpatwar,\ \emph{SODA 2014}] and thus we improve over the previous $(1-1/e)/13$
approximation. Our algorithm provides a $(1-1/e)/7$ approximation guarantee by employing an
improved method for enforcing connectivity and performing tree decompositions. We also consider
the \emph{edge-vertex domination} variant, where an edge dominates its endpoints and all vertices
neighboring them. In \emph{budgeted edge-vertex domination} (BEVD), we are given a graph $G$,
and a budget $k$, and we seek to find a, not necessarily connected, subset of edges such that the number
of dominated vertices in $G$ is maximized. We prove there exists a $(1-1/e)$-approximation algorithm.
Also, for any $\epsilon > 0$, we present a $(1-1/e+\epsilon)$-inapproximability result by a gap-preserving
reduction from the \emph{maximum coverage} problem. We notice that, in the connected case, BEVD
becomes equivalent to BCDS. Moreover, we examine the ``dual'' \emph{partial edge-vertex domination}
(PEVD) problem, where a graph $G$ and a quota $n'$ are given. The goal is to select a minimum-size set
of edges to dominate at least $n'$ vertices in $G$. In this case, we present a $H(n')$-approximation
algorithm by a reduction to the \emph{partial cover} problem.
