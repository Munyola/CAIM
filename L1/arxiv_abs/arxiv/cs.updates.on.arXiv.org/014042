Detection and quantification of information leaks through timing side channels are important
to guarantee confidentiality. Although static analysis remains the prevalent approach for detecting
timing side channels, it is computationally challenging for real-world applications. In addition,
the detection techniques are usually restricted to 'yes' or 'no' answers. In practice, real-world
applications may need to leak information about the secret. Therefore, quantification techniques
are necessary to evaluate the resulting threats of information leaks. Since both problems are very
difficult or impossible for static analysis techniques, we propose a dynamic analysis method.
Our novel approach is to split the problem into two tasks. First, we learn a timing model of the program
as a neural network. Second, we analyze the neural network to quantify information leaks. As demonstrated
in our experiments, both of these tasks are feasible in practice --- making the approach a significant
improvement over the state-of-the-art side channel detectors and quantifiers. Our key technical
contributions are (a) a neural network architecture that enables side channel discovery and (b)
an MILP-based algorithm to estimate the side-channel strength. On a set of micro-benchmarks and
real-world applications, we show that neural network models learn timing behaviors of programs
with thousands of methods. We also show that neural networks with thousands of neurons can be efficiently
analyzed to detect and quantify information leaks through timing side channels.
