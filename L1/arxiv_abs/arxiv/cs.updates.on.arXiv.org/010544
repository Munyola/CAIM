Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) provide a novel means of extracting road and traffic information
via video data. Specifically, by analyzing objects in a video frame, UAVs can be used to detect traffic
characteristics and road incidents. Under congested conditions, the UAVs can supply accurate
incident information where it is otherwise difficult to infer the road state from traditional speed-density
measurements. Leveraging the mobility and detection capabilities of UAVs, we investigate navigation
algorithms that seek to maximize information on the road/traffic state under non-recurrent congestion.
We propose an active exploration framework that (1) assimilates UAV observations with speed-density
sensor data, (2) quantifies uncertainty on the road/traffic state, and (3) adaptively navigates
the UAV to minimize this uncertainty. The navigation algorithm uses the A-optimal information
measure (mean uncertainty) and it depends on covariance matrices generated by an ensemble Kalman
filter (EnKF). In the EnKF procedure, we incorporate nonlinear traffic observations through model
diagnostic variables, and we present a parameter update procedure that maintains a monotonic relationship
between states and measurements. We compare the traffic and incident state estimates resulting
from the coupled UAV navigation-estimation procedure against corresponding estimates that do
not use targeted UAV observations. Our results indicate that UAVs aid in detection of incidents
under congested conditions where speed-density data are not informative.
