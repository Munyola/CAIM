Many academic and industrial research works on WANETs rely on simulations, at least in the first
stages, to obtain preliminary results to be subsequently validated in real settings. Topology
generators (TG) are commonly used to generate the initial placement of nodes in artificial WANET
topologies, where those simulations take place. The significance of these experiments heavily
depends on the representativeness of artificial topologies. Indeed, if they were not drawn fairly,
obtained results would apply only to a subset of possible configurations, hence they would lack
of the appropriate generality required to port them to the real world. Although using many TGs could
mitigate this issue by generating topologies in several different ways, that would entail a significant
additional effort. Hence, the problem arises of what TGs to choose, among a number of available generators,
to maximise the representativeness of generated topologies and reduce the number of TGs to use.
In this paper, we address that problem by investigating the presence of bias in the initial placement
of nodes in artificial WANET topologies produced by different TGs. We propose a methodology to assess
such bias and introduce two metrics to quantify the diversity of the topologies generated by a TG
with respect to all the available TGs, which can be used to select what TGs to use. We carry out experiments
on three well-known TGs, namely BRITE, NPART and GT-ITM. Obtained results show that using the artificial
networks produced by a single TG can introduce bias.
