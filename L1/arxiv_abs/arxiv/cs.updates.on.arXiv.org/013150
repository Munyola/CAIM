This paper presents a dual-level model predictive control (MPC) scheme for two-timescale dynamical
systems subject to input and state constraints, with the scope to enforce closed-loop separable
dynamics. A novel dual-level MPC (i.e., D-MPC) algorithm is initially presented. At the high level
of the control structure, a stabilizing MPC regulator minimizes the deviation of the output and
its setpoint at a slow time scale. A shrinking horizon MPC is designed at the low level to refine the
computed control actions in the basic time scale so as to generate satisfactory short-term transient
of the output associated with the "fast" dynamics. To further improve the closed-loop control performance,
an incremental D-MPC algorithm is also proposed, via introducing at the high level of the D-MPC an
integral action and an explicit design of the "fast" output reference. The proposed algorithms
are not only suitable for systems characterized by different dynamics, but also capable of imposing
separable closed-loop performance for dynamics that are non-separable and strongly coupled.
The recursive feasibility and convergence properties of the D-MPC and incremental D-MPC closed-loop
control systems are proven. The simulation results concerning the use of the proposed approaches
for the control of a Boiler Turbine (BT) system, including the comparisons with a decentralized
PID controller and a multirate MPC, are reported to show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms
in imposing closed-loop separable dynamics and the advantages in generating satisfactory control
performance.
