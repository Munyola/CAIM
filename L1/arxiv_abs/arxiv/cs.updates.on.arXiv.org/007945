We consider a class of sequential interdiction settings where the interdictor has incomplete initial
information about the network while the evader has complete knowledge of the network, including
its structure and arc costs. In each time period, the interdictor can block at most k arcs known to
him for the duration of the period. By observing the evader's actions, the interdictor learns about
the network structure and costs and thus, can adjust his actions in subsequent time periods. It is
known from the literature that if the evader is greedy (i.e., she uses the shortest available path
in every time period), then under some assumptions on the the feedback generated from the evader's
actions, the greedy interdiction policies that block k-most vital arcs in each time period are efficient
and have a finite regret. In this paper, we consider the evader's perspective and explore strategic
evasion policies under the assumption that the interdictor is greedy. In particular, we show that
the evader's problem is NP-hard even for two time periods. Then we derive constructive properties
of optimal evasion policies for two time periods when the interdictor has no initial information
about the network structure. Based on these theoretical observations, we design a heuristic algorithm
for a strategic evader in a general setting with an arbitrary time horizon and any initial information
available to the interdictor initially. Finally, our computational experiments demonstrate
that the proposed heuristic consistently outperforms the greedy evasion policy on several classes
of synthetic network instances.
