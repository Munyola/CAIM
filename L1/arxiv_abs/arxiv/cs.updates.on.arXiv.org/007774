Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) are the gold standard for comparing the effectiveness of a
new treatment to the current one (the control). Most RCTs allocate the patients to the treatment
group and the control group by repeated tosses of a fair coin. We show that this procedure can be highly
sub-optimal if -- as is often the case -- patients can be recruited in cohorts (rather than all at once),
the effects on each cohort can be observed before recruiting the next cohort, and the effects are
heterogeneous across groups of patients. We formulate the patient allocation problem as a finite
stage Markov Decision Process in which the objective is to minimize a given weighted combination
of type-I and type-II errors. Because finding the exact solution to this Markov Decision Process
is computationally intractable, we propose an algorithm -- Knowledge Gradient for Randomized
Controlled Trials (RCT-KG) -- that yields an approximate solution. We illustrate our algorithm
on a synthetic dataset with Bernoulli outcomes, showing that it is significantly more efficient
than repeated fair coin tossing. For a given size of trial our method achieves significant reduction
in error, and to achieve a prescribed level of confidence (in identifying whether the treatment
is superior to the control), our method requires many fewer patients. Our approach uses what has
been learned from the effects on previous cohorts to allocate patients in succeeding cohorts, and
allocates more patients to subgroups for which the uncertainty is greater.
