A color appearance model (CAM) is an advanced colorimetric tool used to predict color appearance
under a wide variety of viewing conditions. A chromatic adaptation transform (CAT) is an integral
part of a CAM. Its role is to predict "corresponding colors," that is, a pair of colors that have the
same color appearance when viewed under different illuminants, after partial or full adaptation
to each illuminant. Modern CATs perform well when applied to a limited range of illuminant pairs
and a limited range of source (test) colors. However, they can fail if operated outside these ranges.
For imaging applications, it is important to have a CAT that can operate on any real color and illuminant
pair without failure. This paper proposes a new CAT that does not operate on the standard von Kries
model of adaptation. Instead it relies on spectral reconstruction and how these reconstructions
behave with respect to different illuminants. It is demonstrated that the proposed CAT is immune
to some of the limitations of existing CATs (such as producing colors with negative tristimulus
values). The proposed CAT does not use established empirical corresponding-color datasets to
optimize performance, as most modern CATs do, yet it performs as well as or better than the most recent
CATs when tested against the corresponding-color datasets. This increase in robustness comes
at the expense of additional complexity and computational effort. If robustness is of prime importance,
then the proposed method may be justifiable.
