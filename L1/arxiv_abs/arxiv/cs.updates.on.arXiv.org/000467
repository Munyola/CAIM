The calculation of a segment of eigenvalues and their corresponding eigenvectors of a Hermitian
matrix or matrix pencil has many applications. A new density-matrix-based algorithm has been proposed
recently and a software package FEAST has been developed. The density-matrix approach allows FEAST's
implementation to exploit a key strength of modern computer architectures, namely, multiple levels
of parallelism. Consequently, the software package has been well received, especially in the electronic
structure community. Nevertheless, theoretical analysis of FEAST has been lagging. For instance,
the FEAST algorithm has not been proven to converge. This paper offers a detailed numerical analysis
of FEAST. In particular, we show that the FEAST algorithm can be understood as the standard subspace
iteration algorithm in conjunction with the Rayleigh-Ritz procedure. The novelty of FEAST is that
it does not iterate directly with the original matrices, but instead iterates with an approximation
to the spectral projector onto the eigenspace in question. Analysis of the numerical nature of this
approximate spectral projector and the resulting subspaces generated in the FEAST algorithm establishes
the algorithm's convergence. This paper shows that FEAST is resilient against rounding errors
and establishes properties that can be leveraged to enhance the algorithm's robustness. We also
outline a possible extension of FEAST to handle non-Hermitian problems. Further investigations
into numerical quadrature rules suitable for approximating spectral projectors are also worthwhile.
