The problem of signal recovery from its Fourier transform magnitude, or equivalently, autocorrelation,
is of paramount importance in various fields of engineering and has been around for over 100 years.
In order to achieve this, additional structure information about the signal is necessary. In this
work, we first provide simple and general conditions, which when satisfied, allow unique recovery
almost surely. In particular, we focus our attention on sparse signals and show that most O(n)-sparse
signals, i.e., signals with O(n) non-zero components, have distinct Fourier transform magnitudes
(up to time-shift, time-reversal and global sign). Our results are a significant improvement over
the existing identifiability results, which provide such guarantees for only O(n^{1/4})-sparse
signals. Then, we exploit the sparse nature of the signals and develop a Two-stage Sparse Phase Retrieval
algorithm (TSPR), which involves: (i) identifying the support, i.e., the locations of the non-zero
components, of the signal (ii) identifying the signal values using the support knowledge. We show
that the proposed algorithm can provably recover O(n^{1/2-\eps})-sparse signals (up to time-shift,
time-reversal and global sign) with arbitrarily high probability in quadratic-time. To the best
of our knowledge, state of the art phase retrieval algorithms provide such recovery guarantees
for only O(n^{1/4})-sparse signals. Numerical experiments complement our theoretical analysis
and verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.
