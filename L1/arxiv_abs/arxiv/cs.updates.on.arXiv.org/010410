The recent surge of applications involving the use of $360^o$ video challenges mobile networks
infrastructure, as $360^o$ video files are of significant size, and current delivery and edge caching
architectures are unable to guarantee their timely delivery. In this paper, we investigate the
problem of joint collaborative content-aware caching and delivery of $360^o$ videos. The proposed
scheme takes advantage of $360^o$ video encoding in multiple tiles and layers to make fine-grained
decisions regarding which tiles to cache in each Small Base Station (SBS), and from where to deliver
them to the end users, as users may reside in the coverage area of multiple SBSs. This permits to cache
the most popular tiles in the SBSs, while the remaining tiles may be obtained through the backhaul.
In addition, we explicitly consider the time delivery constraints to ensure continuous video playback.
To reduce the computational complexity of the optimization problem, we simplify it by introducing
a fairness constraint. This allows us to split the original problem into subproblems corresponding
to Groups of Pictures (GoP). Each of the subproblems is then decoupled into their caching and routing
components and solved with the method of Lagrange partial relaxation. Finally, we evaluate the
performance of the proposed method for various system parameters and compare it with schemes that
do not consider $360^o$ video encoding into multiple tiles and quality layers. The results make
clear the benefits coming from caching and delivery decisions on per tile basis.
