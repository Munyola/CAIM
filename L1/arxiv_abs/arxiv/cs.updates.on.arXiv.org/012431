Learning effective embedding has been proved to be useful in many real-world problems, such as recommender
systems, search ranking and online advertisement. However, one of the challenges is data sparsity
in learning large-scale item embedding, as users' historical behavior data are usually lacking
or insufficient in an individual domain. In fact, user's behaviors from different domains regarding
the same items are usually relevant. Therefore, we can learn complete user behaviors to alleviate
the sparsity using complementary information from correlated domains. It is intuitive to model
users' behaviors using graph, and graph neural networks (GNNs) have recently shown the great power
for representation learning, which can be used to learn item embedding. However, it is challenging
to transfer the information across domains and learn cross-domain representation using the existing
GNNs. To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose a novel model - Deep Multi-Graph Embedding
(DMGE) to learn cross-domain representation. Specifically, we first construct a multi-graph
based on users' behaviors from different domains, and then propose a multi-graph neural network
to learn cross-domain representation in an unsupervised manner. Particularly, we present a multiple-gradient
descent optimizer for efficiently training the model. We evaluate our approach on various large-scale
real-world datasets, and the experimental results show that DMGE outperforms other state-of-art
embedding methods in various tasks.
