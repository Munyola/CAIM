The ignition of flammable liquids and gases in offshore oil and gas environments is a major risk and
can cause loss of life, serious injury, and significant damage to infrastructure. Power supplies
that are used to provide regulated voltages to drive motors, relays, and power electronic controls
can produce heat and cause sparks. As a result, the European Union requires ATEX certification on
electrical equipment to ensure safety in such extreme environments. Implementing designs that
meet this standard is time-consuming and adds to the cost of operations. Soft robots are often made
with soft materials and can be actuated pneumatically, without electronics, making these systems
inherently compliant with this directive. In this paper, we aim to increase the capability of new
soft robotic systems moving from a one-to-one control-actuator architecture and implementing
an electronics-free control system. We have developed a robot that demonstrates locomotion and
gripping using three-pneumatic lines: a vacuum power line, a control input, and a clock line. We
have followed the design principles of digital electronics and demonstrated an integrated fluidic
circuit with eleven, fully integrated fluidic switches and six actuators. We have realized the
basic building blocks of logical operation into combinational logic and memory using our fluidic
switches to create a two-state automata machine. This system expands on the state of the art increasing
the complexity over existing soft systems with integrated control.
