A dynamical system is said to have bounded sensitivity if an additive disturbance leads to a change
in the state trajectory that is bounded by a constant multiple of the size of the cumulative disturbance.
It was shown in Sharifnassab, et al. (2019) that the (negative) (sub)gradient field of a piecewise
constant and convex function with finitely many pieces has always bounded sensitivity. In this
paper, we investigate sensitivity of some generalizations of this class of systems, as well as other
classes of practical interest. In particular, we show that the result in Sharifnassab, et al. (2019)
does not generalize to the (negative) gradient field of a convex function. More concretely, we provide
examples of gradient field of a twice continuously differentiable convex function, and subgradient
field of a piecewise constant convex function with infinitely many pieces, that have unbounded
sensitivity. Moreover, we give a necessary and sufficient condition for a linear dynamical system
to have bounded sensitivity, in terms of the spectrum of the underlying matrix. The proofs and the
development of our examples involve some intermediate results concerning transformations of
dynamical systems, which are also of independent interest. More specifically, we study some transformations
that when applied on a dynamical system with bounded sensitivity, preserve the bounded sensitivity
property. These transformations include discretization of time and spreading of a system; a transformation
that captures approximate solutions of the original system in a certain sense.
