Background: Widespread adoption of electronic health records (EHRs) has enabled secondary use
of EHR data for clinical research and healthcare delivery. Natural language processing (NLP) techniques
have shown promise in their capability to extract the embedded information in unstructured clinical
data, and information retrieval (IR) techniques provide flexible and scalable solutions that
can augment the NLP systems for retrieving and ranking relevant records. Methods: In this paper,
we present the implementation of Cohort Retrieval Enhanced by Analysis of Text from EHRs (CREATE),
a cohort retrieval system that can execute textual cohort selection queries on both structured
and unstructured EHR data. CREATE is a proof-of-concept system that leverages a combination of
structured queries and IR techniques on NLP results to improve cohort retrieval performance while
adopting the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model (CDM) to enhance
model portability. The NLP component empowered by cTAKES is used to extract CDM concepts from textual
queries. We design a hierarchical index in Elasticsearch to support CDM concept search utilizing
IR techniques and frameworks. Results: Our case study on 5 cohort identification queries evaluated
using the IR metric, P@5 (Precision at 5) at both the patient-level and document-level, demonstrates
that CREATE achieves an average P@5 of 0.90, which outperforms systems using only structured data
or only unstructured data with average P@5s of 0.54 and 0.74, respectively.
