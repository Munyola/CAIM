The possibility to guide and control magnetic nanoparticles in a non-invasive manner has spawned
various applications in biotechnology such as targeted drug delivery and sensing of biological
substances. These applications are facilitated by the engineering of the size, selective chemical
reactivity, and general chemical composition of the employed particles. Motivated by their widespread
use and favorable properties, in this paper, we provide a theoretical study of the potential benefits
of magnetic nanoparticles for the design of molecular communication systems. In particular, we
consider magnetic nanoparticle based communication in a microfluidic channel where an external
magnetic field is employed to attract the information-carrying particles to the receiver. We show
that the particle transport affected by Brownian motion, fluid flow, and an external magnetic field
can be mathematically modeled as diffusion with drift. Thereby, we reveal that the key parameters
determining the magnetic force are the particle size and the magnetic field gradient. Moreover,
we derive an analytical expression for the channel impulse response, which is used to evaluate the
potential gain in the expected number of observed nanoparticles due to the magnetic field. Furthermore,
adopting the symbol error rate as performance metric, we show that using magnetic nanoparticles
can enable reliable communication in the presence of disruptive fluid flow. Numerical results
obtained by particle-based simulation validate the accuracy of the derived analytical expressions.
