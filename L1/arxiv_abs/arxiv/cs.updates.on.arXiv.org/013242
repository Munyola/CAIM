Linear data-detection algorithms that build on zero forcing (ZF) or linear minimum mean-square
error (L-MMSE) equalization achieve near-optimal spectral efficiency in massive multi-user
multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) systems. Such algorithms, however, typically rely
on centralized processing at the base-station (BS) which results in (i) excessive interconnect
and chip input/output (I/O) data rates and (ii) high computational complexity. Decentralized
baseband processing (DBP) partitions the BS antenna array into independent clusters that are associated
with separate radio-frequency circuitry and computing fabrics in order to overcome the limitations
of centralized processing. In this paper, we investigate decentralized equalization with feedforward
architectures that minimize the latency bottlenecks of existing DBP solutions. We propose two
distinct architectures with different interconnect and I/O bandwidth requirements that fuse
the local equalization results of each cluster in a feedforward network. For both architectures,
we consider maximum ratio combining, ZF, L-MMSE, and a nonlinear equalization algorithm that relies
on approximate message passing, and we analyze the associated post-equalization signal-to-noise-and-interference-ratio
(SINR). We provide reference implementation results on a multi graphics processing unit (GPU)
system which demonstrate that decentralized equalization with feedforward architectures enables
throughputs in the Gb/s regime and incurs no or only a small performance loss compared to centralized
solutions.
