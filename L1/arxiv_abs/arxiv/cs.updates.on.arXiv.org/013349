In 5G networks, slicing allows partitioning of network resources to meet stringent end-to-end
service requirements across multiple network segments, from access to transport. These requirements
are shaping technical evolution in each of these segments. In particular, the transport segment
is currently evolving in the direction of the so-called elastic optical networks (EONs), a new generation
of optical networks supporting a flexible optical-spectrum grid and novel elastic transponder
capabilities. In this paper, we focus on the reliability of 5G transport-network slices in EON.
Specifically, we consider the problem of slicing 5G transport networks, i.e., establishing virtual
networks on 5G transport, while providing dedicated protection. As dedicated protection requires
large amount of backup resources, our proposed solution incorporates two techniques to reduce
backup resources: (i) bandwidth squeezing, i.e., providing a reduced protection bandwidth with
respect to the original request; and (ii) survivable multi-path provisioning. We leverage the
capability of EONs to fine tune spectrum allocation and adapt modulation format and Forward Error
Correction (FEC) for allocating rightsize spectrum resources to network slices. Our numerical
evaluation over realistic case-study network topologies quantifies the spectrum savings achieved
by employing EON over traditional fixed-grid optical networks, and provides new insights on the
impact of bandwidth squeezing and multi-path provisioning on spectrum utilization.
