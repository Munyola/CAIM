Generating adversarial examples is an intriguing problem and an important way of understanding
the working mechanism of deep neural networks. Most existing approaches generated perturbations
in the image space, i.e., each pixel can be modified independently. However, in this paper we pay
special attention to the subset of adversarial examples that are physically authentic -- those
corresponding to actual changes in 3D physical properties (like surface normals, illumination
condition, etc.). These adversaries arguably pose a more serious concern, as they demonstrate
the possibility of causing neural network failure by small perturbations of real-world 3D objects
and scenes. In the contexts of object classification and visual question answering, we augment
state-of-the-art deep neural networks that receive 2D input images with a rendering module (either
differentiable or not) in front, so that a 3D scene (in the physical space) is rendered into a 2D image
(in the image space), and then mapped to a prediction (in the output space). The adversarial perturbations
can now go beyond the image space, and have clear meanings in the 3D physical world. Through extensive
experiments, we found that a vast majority of image-space adversaries cannot be explained by adjusting
parameters in the physical space, i.e., they are usually physically inauthentic. But it is still
possible to successfully attack beyond the image space on the physical space (such that authenticity
is enforced), though this is more difficult than image-space attacks, reflected in lower success
rates and heavier perturbations required.
