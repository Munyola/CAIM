Human contact networks are constituted by a multitude of individuals and pairwise contacts among
them. However, the dynamic nature, which generates the evolution of human contact networks, of
contact patterns is not known yet. Here, we analyse three empirical datasets and identify two crucial
mechanisms of the evolution of temporal human contact networks, i.e. the activity state transition
laws for an individual to be socially active, and the contact establishment mechanism that active
individuals adopt. We consider both of the two mechanisms to propose a temporal network model, named
the memory driven (MD) model, of human contact networks. Then we study the susceptible-infected
(SI) spreading processes on empirical human contact networks and four corresponding temporal
network models, and compare the full prevalence time of SI processes with various infection rates
on the networks. The full prevalence time of SI processes in the MD model is the same as that in real-world
human contact networks. Moreover, we find that the individual activity state transition promotes
the spreading process, while, the contact establishment of active individuals suppress the prevalence.
Apart from this, we observe that even a small percentage of individuals to explore new social ties
is able to induce an explosive spreading on networks. The proposed temporal network framework could
help the further study of dynamic processes in temporal human contact networks, and offer new insights
to predict and control the diffusion processes on networks.
