Context: Software refactoring aims to improve software quality and developer productivity. Numerous
empirical studies investigating the impact of refactoring activities on software quality have
been conducted over the last two decades. Objective: This study aims to perform a comprehensive
systematic mapping study of existing empirical studies on evaluation of the effect of object-oriented
code refactoring activities on software quality attributes. Method: We followed a multi-stage
scrutinizing process to select 142 primary studies published till December 2017. The selected
primary studies were further classified based on several aspects to answer the research questions
defined for this work. In addition, we applied vote-counting approach to combine the empirical
results and their analysis reported in primary studies. Results: The findings indicate that studies
conducted in academic settings found more positive impact of refactoring on software quality than
studies performed in industries. In general, refactoring activities caused all quality attributes
to improve or degrade except for cohesion, complexity, inheritance, fault-proneness and power
consumption attributes. Furthermore, individual refactoring activities have variable effects
on most quality attributes explored in primary studies, indicating that refactoring does not always
improve all quality attributes. Conclusions: This study points out several open issues which require
further investigation, e.g., lack of industrial validation, lesser coverage of refactoring activities,
limited tool support, etc.
