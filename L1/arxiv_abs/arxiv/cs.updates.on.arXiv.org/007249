The rapid growth of consumer Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) is creating promising new business
opportunities for cellular operators. On the one hand, UAVs can be connected to cellular networks
as new types of user equipment, therefore generating significant revenues for the operators that
guarantee their stringent service requirements. On the other hand, UAVs offer the unprecedented
opportunity to realize UAV-mounted flying base stations that can dynamically reposition themselves
to boost coverage, spectral efficiency and user quality of experience. Indeed, the standards bodies
are currently exploring possibilities for serving commercial UAVs with cellular networks. Industries
are beginning to trial early prototypes of flying base stations or user equipments, while academia
is in full swing researching mathematical and algorithmic solutions to many interesting new problems
arising from flying nodes in cellular networks. In this article, we provide a comprehensive survey
of all of these developments promoting smooth integration of UAVs in cellular networks. Specifically,
we survey the types of consumer UAVs currently available off-the-shelf, the interference issues
and potential solutions addressed by standardization bodies for serving aerial users with existing
terrestrial base stations, the challenges and opportunities for assisting cellular communications
with UAV-based flying relays and base stations, the ongoing prototyping and test bed activities,
the new regulations being developed to manage the commercial use of UAVs, and the cyber-physical
security of UAV-assisted cellular communications.
