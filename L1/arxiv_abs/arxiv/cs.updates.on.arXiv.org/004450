We consider the problem of constructing a physical system whose evolution implements some specified
stochastic matrix. We restrict attention to physical systems whose dynamics can be modeled with
a time-inhomogeneous master equation over a finite state space, which includes many of the systems
considered in stochastic thermodynamics. It is known that many stochastic matrices cannot be implemented
by any master equation, even approximately. This raises the question of how they can arise in the
real world. Here we investigate this question for the special case where the stochastic matrix being
implemented is a (single-valued) function $f$. Examples range from logical gates in digital circuits
to the (partial) function evaluated by an entire digital computer. As we show, any function $f$ over
a set of "visible" states $X$ can be implemented--if the master equation implementing $f$ has access
to some additional "hidden" states not in $X$. Motivated by engineering considerations, we then
consider a natural decomposition of any master equation that implements a given function into a
sequence of "hidden" timesteps, demarcated by changes in the set of allowed transitions between
states. We demonstrate a fundamental tradeoff between the number of hidden states and the number
of hidden timesteps needed to implement any given $f$ using master equation dynamics. These tradeoffs
are analogous to space / time tradeoffs in theoretical computer science. They can also be viewed
as a type of resource theory, applying to master equation models of physical systems rather than
quantum computation.
