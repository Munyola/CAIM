New remote sensing sensors acquire now high spatial and spectral Satellite Image Time Series (SITS)
of the world. These series of images are a key component of any classification framework to obtain
up-to-date and accurate land cover maps of the Earth's soils. More specifically, the combination
of the temporal, spectral and spatial resolutions of new SITS enables the monitoring of vegetation
dynamics. Although some traditional classification algorithms, such as Random Forest (RF), have
been successfully applied for SITS classification, these algorithms do not fully take advantage
of the temporal domain. Conversely, deep-learning based methods have been successfully used to
make the most of sequential data such as text and audio data. For the first time, this paper explores
the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with convolutions applied in the temporal dimension
for SITS classification. The goal is to quantitatively and qualitatively evaluate the contribution
of temporal CNNs for SITS classification. More precisely, this paper proposes a set of experiments
performed on a million Formosat-2 time series. The experimental results show that temporal CNNs
are 2 to 3 % more accurate than RF. The experiments also highlight some counter-intuitive results
on pooling layers: contrary to image classification, their use decreases accuracy. Moreover,
we provide some general guidelines on the network architecture, common regularization mechanisms,
and hyper-parameter values such as the batch size. Finally, the visual quality of the land cover
maps produced by the temporal CNN is assessed.
