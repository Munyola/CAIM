We extend the framework for complexity of operators in analysis devised by Kawamura and Cook (2012)
to allow for the treatment of a wider class of representations. The main novelty is to endow represented
spaces of interest with an additional function on names, called a parameter, which measures the
complexity of a given name. This parameter generalises the size function which is usually used in
second-order complexity theory and therefore also central to the framework of Kawamura and Cook.
The complexity of an algorithm is measured in terms of its running time as a second-order function
in the parameter, as well as in terms of how much it increases the complexity of a given name, as measured
by the parameters on the input and output side. As an application we develop a rigorous computational
complexity theory for interval computation. In the framework of Kawamura and Cook the representation
of real numbers based on nested interval enclosures does not yield a reasonable complexity theory.
In our new framework this representation is polytime equivalent to the usual Cauchy representation
based on dyadic rational approximation. By contrast, the representation of continuous real functions
based on interval enclosures is strictly smaller in the polytime reducibility lattice than the
usual representation, which encodes a modulus of continuity. Furthermore, the function space
representation based on interval enclosures is optimal in the sense that it contains the minimal
amount of information amongst those representations which render evaluation polytime computable.
