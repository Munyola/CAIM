Multiplication is an important arithmetic operation that is frequently encountered in microprocessing
and digital signal processing applications, and multiplication is physically realized using
a multiplier. This paper discusses the physical implementation of many indicating asynchronous
array multipliers, which are inherently elastic and modular and are robust to timing, process and
parametric variations. We consider the physical realization of many indicating asynchronous
array multipliers using a 32/28nm CMOS technology. The weak-indication array multipliers comprise
strong-indication or weak-indication full adders, and strong-indication 2-input AND functions
to realize the partial products. The multipliers were synthesized in a semi-custom ASIC design
style using standard library cells including a custom-designed 2-input C-element. 4x4 and 8x8
multiplication operations were considered for the physical implementations. The 4-phase return-to-zero
(RTZ) and the 4-phase return-to-one (RTO) handshake protocols were utilized for data communication,
and the delay-insensitive dual-rail code was used for data encoding. Among several weak-indication
array multipliers, a weak-indication array multiplier utilizing a biased weak-indication full
adder and the strong-indication 2-input AND function is found to have reduced cycle time and power-cycle
time product with respect to RTZ and RTO handshaking for 4x4 and 8x8 multiplications. Further, the
4-phase RTO handshaking is found to be preferable to the 4-phase RTZ handshaking for achieving enhanced
optimizations of the design metrics.
