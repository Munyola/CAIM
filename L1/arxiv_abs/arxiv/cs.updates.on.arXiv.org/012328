We consider the problem of separating error messages generated in large distributed data center
networks into error events. In such networks, each error event leads to a stream of messages generated
by hardware and software components affected by the event. These messages are stored in a giant message
log. We consider the unsupervised learning problem of identifying the signatures of events that
generated these messages; here, the signature of an error event refers to the mixture of messages
generated by the event. One of the main contributions of the paper is a novel mapping of our problem
which transforms it into a problem of topic discovery in documents. Events in our problem correspond
to topics and messages in our problem correspond to words in the topic discovery problem. However,
there is no direct analog of documents. Therefore, we use a non-parametric change-point detection
algorithm, which has linear computational complexity in the number of messages, to divide the message
log into smaller subsets called episodes, which serve as the equivalents of documents. After this
mapping has been done, we use a well-known algorithm for topic discovery, called LDA, to solve our
problem. We theoretically analyze the change-point detection algorithm, and show that it is consistent
and has low sample complexity. We also demonstrate the scalability of our algorithm on a real data
set consisting of $97$ million messages collected over a period of $15$ days, from a distributed
data center network which supports the operations of a large wireless service provider.
