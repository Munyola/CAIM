Laptops have become an indispensable asset in today's digital age. They often contain highly sensitive
information, such as credentials and confidential documents. As a result, the value of a laptop
is an accumulation of the value of both the physical device itself and the cyber assets it contains,
making it a lucrative target for theft. Educational institutions have a large population of potential
victims of laptop theft. To mitigate this risk, we investigate whether a simple warning sign can
reduce the opportunity for potential offenders. To this end, we have conducted an empirical study
to observe the prevalence of students/staff leaving their laptops unattended at a university study
hall at the Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands, both with and without a warning sign.
We observed 148 out of 220 subjects leaving their laptops unattended in just three weeks. The results
also showed that without the warning banner, 75.5% (83 out of 110) of subjects left their laptops
unattended and with the warning, only 59.1% (65 out of 110) of subjects showed the same behavior,
which is a significant reduction of 16.4%. In addition, a qualitative analysis was performed on
the responses of subjects who left their laptops unattended after the warning banner was placed.
The results showed a mix of convenience, and a blind trust on the safety of the faculty. In conclusion,
a simple banner was effective in reducing the opportunity for laptop theft. However, the percentage
of laptops left unattended was still high even after the introduction of the banner.
