Conventional generators in power grids are steadily substituted with new renewable sources of
electric power. The latter are connected to the grid via inverters and as such have little, if any
rotational inertia. The resulting reduction of total inertia raises important issues of power
grid stability, especially over short-time scales. We have constructed a model of the synchronous
grid of continental Europe with which we numerically investigate frequency deviations as well
as rates of change of frequency (RoCoF) following abrupt power losses. The magnitude of RoCoF's
and frequency deviations strongly depend on the fault location, and we find the largest effects
for faults located on the slowest mode - the Fiedler mode - of the network Laplacian matrix. This mode
essentially vanishes over Belgium, Eastern France, Western Germany, northern Italy and Switzerland.
Buses inside these regions are only weakly affected by faults occuring outside. Conversely, faults
inside these regions have only a local effect and disturb only weakly outside buses. Following this
observation, we reduce rotational inertia through three different procedures by either (i) reducing
inertia on the Fiedler mode, (ii) reducing inertia homogeneously and (iii) reducing inertia outside
the Fiedler mode. We find that procedure (iii) has little effect on disturbance propagation, while
procedure (i) leads to the strongest increase of RoCoF and frequency deviations. These results
for our model of the European transmission grid are corroborated by numerical investigations on
the ERCOT transmission grid.
