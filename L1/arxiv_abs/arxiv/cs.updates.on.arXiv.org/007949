Chromosome classification is critical for karyotyping in abnormality diagnosis. To relieve doctors
from such tedious work and expedite abnormality diagnosis, we present a novel method named Varifocal-Net
for simultaneous classification of chromosome's type and polarity using deep convolutional networks.
The approach consists of one global-scale network (G-Net) and one local-scale network (L-Net).
It follows two stages. The first stage is to learn both global and local features. We extract global
features and detect finer local regions via the G-Net. With the proposed varifocal mechanism, we
zoom into local parts and extract local features via the L-Net. Residual learning and multi-task
learning strategy are utilized to promote high-level feature extraction. The detection of discriminative
local parts is fulfilled by a localization subnet in the G-Net, whose training process involves
both supervised and weakly-supervised learning. The second stage is to build two multi-layer perceptron
classifiers that exploit features of both two scales to boost classification performance. We constructed
a large dataset with 1909 karyotyping cases for extensive experiments. Evaluation results demonstrate
that our Varifocal-Net achieved the highest accuracy of 0.9805, 0.9909 and average F1-score of
0.9771, 0.9909 for the type and polarity task, respectively. It outperformed state-of-the-art
methods, which proves the effectiveness of our varifocal mechanism and multi-scale feature ensemble.
The Varifocal-Net has been applied into clinical practice of karyotyping to assist numerical abnormality
diagnosis.
