Most research in the area of intrusion detection requires datasets to develop, evaluate or compare
systems in one way or another. In this field, however, finding suitable datasets is a challenge on
to itself. Most publicly available datasets have negative qualities that limit their usefulness.
In this article, we propose ID2T (Intrusion Detection Dataset Toolkit) to tackle this problem.
ID2T facilitates the creation of labeled datasets by injecting synthetic attacks into background
traffic. The injected synthetic attacks blend themselves with the background traffic by mimicking
the background traffic's properties to eliminate any trace of ID2T's usage. This work has three
core contribution areas. First, we present a comprehensive survey on intrusion detection datasets.
In the survey, we propose a classification to group the negative qualities we found in the datasets.
Second, the architecture of ID2T is revised, improved and expanded. The architectural changes
enable ID2T to inject recent and advanced attacks such as the widespread EternalBlue exploit or
botnet communication patterns. The toolkit's new functionality provides a set of tests, known
as TIDED (Testing Intrusion Detection Datasets), that help identify potential defects in the background
traffic into which attacks are injected. Third, we illustrate how ID2T is used in different use-case
scenarios to evaluate the performance of anomaly and signature-based intrusion detection systems
in a reproducible manner. ID2T is open source software and is made available to the community to expand
its arsenal of attacks and capabilities.
