Methods for automated collection and annotation are changing the cost-structures of random sampling
surveys for a wide range of applications. Digital samples in the form of images, audio recordings
or electronic documents can be collected cheaply, and in addition computer programs or crowd workers
can be utilized to provide cheap annotations of collected samples. We consider the problem of estimating
a population mean using random sampling under these new cost-structures and propose a novel `hybrid'
sampling design. This design utilizes a pair of annotators, a primary, which is accurate but costly
(e.g. a human expert) and an auxiliary which is noisy but cheap (e.g. a computer program), in order
to minimize the total cost of collection and annotation. We show that hybrid sampling is applicable
under a key condition: that the noise of the auxiliary annotator is smaller than the variance of the
sampled data. Under this condition, hybrid sampling can reduce the amount of primary annotations
needed and minimize total expenditures. The efficacy of hybrid sampling is demonstrated on two
marine ecology data mining applications, where computer programs were utilized in a hybrid sampling
designs to reduce the total cost by 50 - 79% compared to a sampling design that relied only on a human
expert. In addition, a `transfer' sampling design is derived which use the auxiliary annotations
only. Transfer sampling can be very cost-effective, but it requires a priori knowledge of the auxiliary
annotator misclassification rates. We discuss specific situations where such design is applicable.
