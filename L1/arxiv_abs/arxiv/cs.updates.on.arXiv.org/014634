When time-dependent partial differential equations (PDEs) are solved numerically in a domain
with curved boundary or on a curved surface, mesh error and geometric approximation error caused
by the inaccurate location of vertices and other interior grid points, respectively, could be the
main source of the inaccuracy and instability of the numerical solutions of PDEs. The role of these
geometric errors in deteriorating the stability and particularly the conservation properties
are largely unknown, which seems to necessitate very fine meshes especially to remove geometric
approximation error. This paper aims to investigate the effect of geometric approximation error
by using a high-order mesh with negligible geometric approximation error, even for high order polynomial
of order p. To achieve this goal, the high-order mesh generator from CAD geometry called NekMesh
is adapted for surface mesh generation in comparison to traditional meshes with non-negligible
geometric approximation error. Two types of numerical tests are considered. Firstly, the accuracy
of differential operators, such as the gradient, divergence, curl, and Laplacian, is compared
for various p on a curved element of the sphere. Secondly, by applying the method of moving frames,
four different time-dependent PDEs on the sphere, such as conservation laws, diffusion equations,
shallow water equations, and Maxwell's equations are numerically solved to investigate the impact
of geometric approximation error on the accuracy and conservation properties of high-order numerical
schemes for PDEs on the sphere.
