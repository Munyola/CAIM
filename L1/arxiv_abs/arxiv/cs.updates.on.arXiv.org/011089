We consider the problem of optimal decentralized estimation of a linear stochastic process by multiple
agents. Each agent receives a noisy observation of the state of the process and delayed observations
of its neighbors (according to a pre-specified, strongly connected, communication graph). Based
on their observations, all agents generate a sequence of estimates of the state of the process. The
objective is to minimize the total expected weighted mean square error between the state and the
agents' estimates over a finite horizon. In centralized estimation with weighted mean square error
criteria, the optimal estimator does not depend on the weight matrix in the cost function. We show
that this is not the case when the information is decentralized. The optimal decentralized estimates
depend on the weight matrix in the cost function. In particular, we show that the optimal estimate
consists of two parts: a common estimate which is the conditional mean of the state given the common
information and a correction term which is a linear function of the offset of the local information
from the conditional expectation of the local information given the common information. The corresponding
gain depends on the weight matrix as well as on the covariance between the offset of agents' local
information from the conditional mean of the local information given the common information. We
show that the local and common estimates can be computed from a single Kalman filter and derive recursive
expressions for computing the offset covariances and the estimation gains.
