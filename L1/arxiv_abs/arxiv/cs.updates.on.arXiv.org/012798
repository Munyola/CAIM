The discovery of new phenomena and mechanisms often begins with a scientist's intuitive ability
to recognize patterns, for example in satellite imagery or model output. Typically, however, such
intuitive evidence turns out to be difficult to encode and reproduce. Here, we show how crowd-sourcing
and deep learning can be combined to scale up the intuitive discovery of atmospheric phenomena.
Specifically, we focus on the organization of shallow clouds in the trades, which play a disproportionately
large role in the Earth's energy balance. Based on visual inspection four subjective patterns or
organization were defined: Sugar, Flower, Fish and Gravel. On cloud labeling days at two institutes,
67 participants classified more than 30,000 satellite images on a crowd-sourcing platform. Physical
analysis reveals that the four patterns are associated with distinct large-scale environmental
conditions. We then used the classifications as a training set for deep learning algorithms, which
learned to detect the cloud patterns with human accuracy. This enables analysis much beyond the
human classifications. As an example, we created global climatologies of the four patterns. These
reveal geographical hotspots that provide insight into the interaction of mesoscale cloud organization
with the large-scale circulation. Our project shows that combining crowd-sourcing and deep learning
opens new data-driven ways to explore cloud-circulation interactions and serves as a template
for a wide range of possible studies in the geosciences.
