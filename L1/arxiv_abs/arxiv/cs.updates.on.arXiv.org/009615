The focus of this work is the numerical approximation of time-dependent partial differential equations
associated to initial-boundary value problems. This master dissertation is mostly concerned
with the actual computation of the solution to nonlinear stochastic evolution problems governed
by Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) models. In addition, the dissertation aims to contribute to corroborate,
by means of a large set of numerical experiments, that the initial-boundary value problem with periodic
boundary conditions for the equation KPZ is ill-posed and that such equation needs to be renormalized.
The approach to discretization of KPZ equation perfomed by means of the use of hybrid and mixed finite
elements with a domain decomposition procedure along with a pertinent mollification of the noise.
The obtained solution is compared with the well known solution given by the Cole-Hopf transformation
of the stochastic heat equation with multiplicative noise. We were able to verify that both solutions
exhibit a good agreement, but there is a shift that grows as the support of the mollifier decreases.
For the numerical aproximation of the stochastic heat equation we use a state-of-the-art numerical
method for evaluating semilinear stochastic PDE , which in turn combine spectral techniques, Taylor's
expantions and particular numerical treatment to the underlying noise. Furthermore, a state-of-the-art
renormalization procedure introduced by Martin Hairer is used to renormalize KPZ equation that
is validated with nontrivial numerical experiments.
