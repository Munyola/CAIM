We consider the fully dynamic bin packing problem, where items arrive and depart in an online fashion.
The goal is to minimize the number of used bins at every timestep while repacking of already packed
items is allowed. Ivkovic and Lloyd [IL98] have developed an algorithm with asymptotic competitive
ratio of $5/4$ using $O(\log n)$ (amortized) shifting moves whenever an item is inserted or removed
(a shifting move is a shift of a single big item or a bundle of small items of bounded size). We improve
upon the result by Ivkovic and Lloyd by giving an algorithm with asymptotic competitive ratio of
$1 + \epsilon$ that has repacking costs of $O(1/\epsilon^4 \cdot \log 1/\epsilon)$ (non-amortized).
Hence, the repacking costs of our algorithm are constant for every fixed $\epsilon$. The running
time of our algorithm is polynomial in the number of items $n$ and in $1/\epsilon$ (AFPTAS). To measure
the repacking costs we use a modern notion developed by Sanders, Sivadasan and Skutella [SSS09]
called the migration factor, which is defined as the total size of repacked items divided by the size
of the arriving or departing item. However, our algorithm also performs only a fixed number (in $1/\epsilon$)
of shifting moves. Our results are based on a new dynamic rounding technique and new ideas to handle
small items in a dynamic setting such that no amortization is needed. Furthermore, we prove that
there is no algorithm with asymptotic competitive ratio $1 + \epsilon$ and migration factor of $o(1/\epsilon)$
even in the case that no items depart. This lower bound holds even if $P = NP$.
