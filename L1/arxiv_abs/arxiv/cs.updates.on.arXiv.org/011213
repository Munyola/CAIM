Point set registration is defined as a process to determine the spatial transformation from the
source point set to the target one. Existing methods often iteratively search for the optimal geometric
transformation to register a given pair of point sets, driven by minimizing a predefined alignment
loss function. In contrast, the proposed point registration neural network (PR-Net) actively
learns the registration pattern as a parametric function from a training dataset, consequently
predict the desired geometric transformation to align a pair of point sets. PR-Net can transfer
the learned knowledge (i.e. registration pattern) from registering training pairs to testing
ones without additional iterative optimization. Specifically, in this paper, we develop novel
techniques to learn shape descriptors from point sets that help formulate a clear correlation between
source and target point sets. With the defined correlation, PR-Net tends to predict the transformation
so that the source and target point sets can be statistically aligned, which in turn leads to an optimal
spatial geometric registration. PR-Net achieves robust and superior performance for non-rigid
registration of point sets, even in presence of Gaussian noise, outliers, and missing points, but
requires much less time for registering large number of pairs. More importantly, for a new pair of
point sets, PR-Net is able to directly predict the desired transformation using the learned model
without repetitive iterative optimization routine. Our code is available at https://github.com/Lingjing324/PR-Net.
