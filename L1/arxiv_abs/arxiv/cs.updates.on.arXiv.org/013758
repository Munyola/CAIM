Magnetic Resonance Imaging(MRI) has been widely used in clinical application and pathology research
by helping doctors make more accurate diagnoses. On the other hand, accurate diagnosis by MRI remains
a great challenge as images obtained via present MRI techniques usually have low resolutions. Improving
MRI image quality and resolution thus becomes a critically important task. This paper presents
an innovative Coupled-Projection Residual Network (CPRN) for MRI super-resolution. The CPRN
consists of two complementary sub-networks: a shallow network and a deep network that keep the content
consistency while learning high frequency differences between low-resolution and high-resolution
images. The shallow sub-network employs coupled-projection for better retaining the MRI image
details, where a novel feedback mechanism is introduced to guide the reconstruction of high-resolution
images. The deep sub-network learns from the residuals of the high-frequency image information,
where multiple residual blocks are cascaded to magnify the MRI images at the last network layer.
Finally, the features from the shallow and deep sub-networks are fused for the reconstruction of
high-resolution MRI images. For effective fusion of features from the deep and shallow sub-networks,
a step-wise connection (CPRN S) is designed as inspired by the human cognitive processes (from simple
to complex). Experiments over three public MRI datasets show that our proposed CPRN achieves superior
MRI super-resolution performance as compared with the state-of-the-art. Our source code will
