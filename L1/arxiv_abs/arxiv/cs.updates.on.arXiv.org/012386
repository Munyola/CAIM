Mental Imagery based Brain-Computer Interfaces (MI-BCI) enable their users to control an interface,
e.g., a prosthesis, by performing mental imagery tasks only, such as imagining a right arm movement
while their brain activity is measured and processed by the system. Designing and using a BCI requires
users to learn how to produce different and stable patterns of brain activity for each of the mental
imagery tasks. However, current training protocols do not enable every user to acquire the skills
required to use BCIs. These training protocols are most likely one of the main reasons why BCIs remain
not reliable enough for wider applications outside research laboratories. Learning companions
have been shown to improve training in different disciplines, but they have barely been explored
for BCIs so far. This article aims at investigating the potential benefits learning companions
could bring to BCI training by improving the feedback, i.e., the information provided to the user,
which is primordial to the learning process and yet have proven both theoretically and practically
inadequate in BCI. This paper first presents the potentials of BCI and the limitations of current
training approaches. Then, it reviews both the BCI and learning companion literature regarding
three main characteristics of feedback: its appearance, its social and emotional components and
its cognitive component. From these considerations, this paper draws some guidelines, identify
open challenges and suggests potential solutions to design and use learning companions for BCIs.
