The intermittent nature of the renewable energies increases the operation costs of conventional
generators. As the share of energy supplied by renewable sources increases, these costs also increase.
In this paper, we quantify these costs by developing a market clearing price of energy in the presence
of renewable energy and congestion constraints. We consider an electricity market where generators
propose their asking price per unit of energy to an independent system operator (ISO). The ISO solve
an optimization problem to dispatch energy from each generator to minimize the total cost of energy
purchased on behalf of the consumers. To ensure that the generators are able to meet the load within
a desired confidence level, we incorporate the notion of load variance using the Conditional Value-at-Risk
(CVAR) measure in an electricity market and we derive the amount of committed power and market clearing
price of energy as a function of CVAR. It is shown that a higher penetration of renewable energies
may increase the committed power, market clearing price of energy and consumer cost of energy due
to renewable generation uncertainties. We also obtain an upper-bound on the amount that congestion
constraints can affect the committed power. We present descriptive simulations to illustrate
the impact of renewable energy penetration and reliability levels on committed power by the non-renewable
generators, difference between the dispatched and committed power, market price of energy and
profit of renewable and non-renewable generators.
