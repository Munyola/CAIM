Recent work has shown how chemical reaction network theory may be used to design dynamical systems
that can be implemented biologically in nucleic acid-based chemistry. While this has allowed the
construction of advanced open-loop circuitry based on cascaded DNA strand displacement (DSD)
reactions, little progress has so far been made in developing the requisite theoretical machinery
to inform the systematic design of feedback controllers in this context. Here, we develop a number
of foundational theoretical results on the equilibria, stability, and dynamics of nucleic acid
controllers. In particular, we show that the implementation of feedback controllers using DSD
reactions introduces additional nonlinear dynamics, even in the case of purely linear designs,
e.g. PI controllers. By decomposing the effects of these non-observable nonlinear dynamics, we
show that, in general, the stability of the linear system design does not necessarily imply the stability
of the underlying chemical network, which can be lost under experimental variability when feedback
interconnections are introduced. We provide an in-depth theoretical analysis of an example illustrating
this phenomenon, whereby the linear design does not capture the instability of the full nonlinear
system implemented as a DSD reaction network, and we further confirm these results using VisualDSD,
a bespoke software tool for simulating nucleic acid-based circuits. Our analysis highlight the
many interesting and unique characteristics of this important new class of feedback control systems.
