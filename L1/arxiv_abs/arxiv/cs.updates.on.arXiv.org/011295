A limitation to molecular implementations of tile-based self-assembly systems is the high rate
of mismatch errors which has been observed to be between 1% and 10%. Controlling the physical conditions
of the system to reduce this intrinsic error rate $\epsilon$ prohibitively slows the growth rate
of the system. This has motivated the development of techniques to redundantly encode information
in the tiles of a system in such a way that the rate of mismatch errors in the final assembly is reduced
even without a reduction in $\epsilon$. Winfree and Bekbolatov, and Chen and Goel, introduced such
error-resilient systems that reduce the mismatch error rate to $\epsilon^2$ by replacing each
tile in an error-prone system with a $k \times k$ block of tiles in the error-resilient system, but
this increases the number of tile types used by a factor of $k^2$, and the scale of the pattern produced
by a factor of $k$. Reif, Sahu and Yin, and Sahu and Reif, introduced compact error-resilient systems
for the self-assembly of Boolean arrays that reduce the mismatch error rate to $\epsilon^2$ without
increasing the scale of the pattern produced. In this paper, we give a technique to design compact
error-resilient systems for the self-assembly of the recursively defined patterns introduced
by Kautz and Lathrop. We show that our compact error-resilient systems reduce the mismatch error
rate to $\epsilon^2$ by using the independent error model introduced by Sahu and Reif. Surprisingly,
our error-resilient systems use the same number of tile types as the error-prone system from which
they are constructed.
