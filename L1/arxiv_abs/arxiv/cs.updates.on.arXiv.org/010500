Human joint dynamic stiffness plays an important role in the stability of performance augmentation
exoskeletons. In this paper, we consider a new frequency domain model of the human joint dynamics
which features a complex value stiffness. This complex stiffness consists of a real stiffness and
a hysteretic damping. We use it to explain the dynamic behaviors of the human connected to the exoskeleton,
in particular the observed non-zero low frequency phase shift and the near constant damping ratio
of the resonant as stiffness and inertia vary. We validate this concept by experimenting with an
elbow-joint exoskeleton testbed on a subject while modifying joint stiffness behavior, exoskeleton
inertia, and strength augmentation gains. We compare three different models of elbow-joint dynamic
stiffness: a model with real stiffness, viscous damping and inertia, a model with complex stiffness
and inertia, and a model combining the previous two models. Our results show that the hysteretic
damping term improves modeling accuracy, using a statistical F-test. Moreover this improvement
is statistically more significant than using classical viscous damping term. In addition, we experimentally
observe a linear relationship between the hysteretic damping and the real part of the stiffness
which allows us to simplify the complex stiffness model as a 1-parameter system. Ultimately, we
design a fractional order controller to demonstrate how human hysteretic damping behavior can
be exploited to improve strength amplification performance while maintaining stability.
