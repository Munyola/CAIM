Traceability and integrity are major challenges for the increasingly complex supply chains of
today's world. Although blockchain technology has the potential to address these challenges through
providing a tamper-proof audit trail of supply chain events and data associated with a product life-cycle,
it does not solve the trust problem associated with the data itself. Reputation systems are an effective
approach to solve this trust problem. However, current reputation systems are not suited to the
blockchain based supply chain applications as they are based on limited observations, they lack
granularity and automation, and their overhead has not been explored. In this work, we propose TrustChain,
as a three-layered trust management framework which uses a consortium blockchain to track interactions
among supply chain participants and to dynamically assign trust and reputation scores based on
these interactions. The novelty of TrustChain stems from: (a) the reputation model that evaluates
the quality of commodities, and the trustworthiness of entities based on multiple observations
of supply chain events, (b) its support for reputation scores that separate between a supply chain
participant and products, enabling the assignment of product-specific reputations for the same
participant, (c) the use of smart contracts for transparent, efficient, secure, and automated
calculation of reputation scores, and (d) its minimal overhead in terms of latency and throughput
when compared to a simple blockchain based supply chain model.
