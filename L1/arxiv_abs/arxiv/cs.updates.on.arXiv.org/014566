In machine learning and other fields, suggesting a good solution to a problem is usually a harder
task than evaluating the quality of such a solution. This asymmetry is the basis for a large number
of selection oriented methods that use a generator system to guess a set of solutions and an evaluator
system to rank and select the best solutions. This work examines the use of this approach to the problem
of image segmentation. The generator/evaluator approach for this case consists of two independent
convolutional neural nets: a generator net that suggests variety segments corresponding to objects
and distinct regions in the image and an evaluator net that chooses the best segments to be merged
into the segmentation map. The result is a trial and error evolutionary approach in which a generator
that guesses segments with low average accuracy, but with wide variability, can still produce good
results when coupled with an accurate evaluator. Generating and evaluating each segment separately
is essential in this case since it demands exponentially fewer guesses compared to a system that
guesses and evaluates the full segmentation map in each try. Another form of modularity used in this
system is separating the segmentation and classification into independent neural nets. This allows
the segmentation to be class agnostic and hence capable of segmenting unfamiliar categories that
were not part of the training set. The method was examined on the COCO Panoptic segmentation benchmark
and gave competitive results to the standard semantic segmentation and instance segmentation
methods.
