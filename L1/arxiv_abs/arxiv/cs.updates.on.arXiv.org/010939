Hybrid analog-digital precoding is challenging for broadband millimeter-wave (mmWave) massive
MIMO systems, since the analog precoder is frequency-flat but the mmWave channels are frequency-selective.
In this paper, we propose a principal component analysis (PCA)-based broadband hybrid precoder/combiner
design, where both the fully-connected array and partially-connected subarray (including the
fixed and adaptive subarrays) are investigated. Specifically, we first design the hybrid precoder/combiner
for fully-connected array and partially-connected subarray given the antenna grouping pattern
based on PCA, whereby a low-dimensional frequency-flat precoder/combiner is extracted from the
optimal high-dimensional frequency-selective precoder/combiner. Meanwhile, the near-optimality
of our proposed PCA approach is theoretically proven. Moreover, for the adaptive subarray, a low-complexity
shared agglomerative hierarchical clustering algorithm is proposed to group antennas for the
further improvement of SE performance. Besides, we theoretically prove the proposed antenna grouping
algorithm is only determined by the slow time-varying channel statistic information in the large
antenna limit. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed solution over state-of-the-art
schemes in SE, energy efficiency (EE), and bit-error-rate performance. Our work reveals that the
EE advantage of adaptive subarray over fully-connected array is obvious for both active and passive
antennas, but the EE advantage of fixed subarray only holds for passive antennas.
