One of the main criticisms to game theory concerns the assumption of full rationality. Logit dynamics
is a decentralized algorithm in which a level of irrationality (a.k.a. "noise") is introduced in
players' behavior. In this context, the solution concept of interest becomes the logit equilibrium,
as opposed to Nash equilibria. Logit equilibria are distributions over strategy profiles that
possess several nice properties, including existence and uniqueness. However, there are games
in which their computation may take exponential time. We therefore look at an approximate version
of logit equilibria, called metastable distributions, introduced by Auletta et al. [SODA, 2012].
These are distributions which remain stable (i.e., players do not go too far from it) for a super-polynomial
number of steps (rather than forever, as for logit equilibria). The hope is that these distributions
exist and can be reached quickly by logit dynamics. We devise a sufficient condition for potential
games to admit distributions which are metastable no matter the level of noise present in the system,
and the starting profile of the dynamics. These distributions can be quickly reached if the rationality
level is not too big when compared to the inverse of the maximum difference in potential. Our proofs
build on results which may be of independent interest. Namely, we prove some spectral characterizations
of the transition matrix defined by logit dynamics for generic games and relate bottleneck ratio
and hitting time of Markov chains.
