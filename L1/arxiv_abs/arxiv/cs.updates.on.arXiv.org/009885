Purpose: To assess the feasibility of deep learning-based high resolution synthetic CT generation
from MRI scans of the lower arm for orthopedic applications. Methods: A conditional Generative
Adversarial Network was trained to synthesize CT images from multi-echo MR images. A training set
of MRI and CT scans of 9 ex vivo lower arms was acquired and the CT images were registered to the MRI images.
Three-fold cross-validation was applied to generate independent results for the entire dataset.
The synthetic CT images were quantitatively evaluated with the mean absolute error metric, and
Dice similarity and surface to surface distance on cortical bone segmentations. Results: The mean
absolute error was 63.5 HU on the overall tissue volume and 144.2 HU on the cortical bone. The mean
Dice similarity of the cortical bone segmentations was 0.86. The average surface to surface distance
between bone on real and synthetic CT was 0.48 mm. Qualitatively, the synthetic CT images corresponded
well with the real CT scans and partially maintained high resolution structures in the trabecular
bone. The bone segmentations on synthetic CT images showed some false positives on tendons, but
the general shape of the bone was accurately reconstructed. Conclusions: This study demonstrates
that high quality synthetic CT can be generated from MRI scans of the lower arm. The good correspondence
of the bone segmentations demonstrates that synthetic CT could be competitive with real CT in applications
that depend on such segmentations, such as planning of orthopedic surgery and 3D printing.
