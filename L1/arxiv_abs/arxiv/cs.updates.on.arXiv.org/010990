Yask is an online social collaborative network for practicing languages in a framework that includes
requests, answers, and votes. Since measuring linguistic competence using current approaches
is difficult, expensive and in many cases imprecise, we present a new alternative approach based
on social networks. Our method, called Proficiency Rank, extends the well-known Page Rank algorithm
to measure the reputation of users in a collaborative social graph. First, we extended Page Rank
so that it not only considers positive links (votes) but also negative links. Second, in addition
to using explicit links, we also incorporate other 4 types of signals implicit in the social graph.
These extensions allow Proficiency Rank to produce proficiency rankings for almost all users in
the data set used, where only a minority contributes by answering, while the majority contributes
only by voting. This overcomes the intrinsic limitation of Page Rank of only being able to rank the
nodes that have incoming links. Our experimental validation showed that the reputation/importance
of the users in Yask is significantly correlated with their language proficiency. In contrast,
their written production was poorly correlated with the vocabulary profiles of the Common European
Framework of Reference. In addition, we found that negative signals (votes) are considerably more
informative than positive ones. We concluded that the use of this technology is a promising tool
for measuring second language proficiency, even for relatively small groups of people.
