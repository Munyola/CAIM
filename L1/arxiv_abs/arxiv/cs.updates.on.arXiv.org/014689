Recent studies showed that the dialogs between app developers and app users on app stores are important
to increase user satisfaction and app's overall ratings. However, the large volume of reviews and
the limitation of resources discourage app developers from engaging with customers through this
channel. One solution to this problem is to develop an Automated Responding System for developers
to respond to app reviews in a manner that is most similar to a human response. Toward designing such
system, we have conducted an empirical study of the characteristics of mobile apps' reviews and
their human-written responses. We found that an app reviews can have multiple fragments at sentence
level with different topics and intentions. Similarly, a response also can be divided into multiple
fragments with unique intentions to answer certain parts of their review (e.g., complaints, requests,
or information seeking). We have also identified several characteristics of review (rating, topics,
intentions, quantitative text feature) that can be used to rank review by their priority of need
for response. In addition, we identified the degree of re-usability of past responses is based on
their context (single app, apps of the same category, and their common features). Last but not least,
a responses can be reused in another review if some parts of it can be replaced by a placeholder that
is either a named-entity or a hyperlink. Based on those findings, we discuss the implications of
developing an Automated Responding System to help mobile apps' developers write the responses
for users reviews more effectively.
