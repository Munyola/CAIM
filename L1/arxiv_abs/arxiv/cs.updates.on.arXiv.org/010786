Eye movements during text reading can provide insights about reading disorders. Via eye-trackers,
we can measure when, where and how eyes move with relation to the words they read. Machine Learning
(ML) algorithms can decode this information and provide differential analysis. This work developed
DysLexML, a screening tool for developmental dyslexia that applies various ML algorithms to analyze
fixation points recorded via eye-tracking during silent reading of children. It comparatively
evaluated its performance using measurements collected in a systematic field study with 69 native
Greek speakers, children, 32 of which were diagnosed as dyslexic by the official governmental agency
for diagnosing learning and reading difficulties in Greece. We examined a large set of features
based on statistical properties of fixations and saccadic movements and identified the ones with
prominent predictive power, performing dimensionality reduction. Specifically, DysLexML achieves
its best performance using linear SVM, with an a accuracy of 97 %, with a small feature set, namely
saccade length, number of short forward movements, and number of multiply fixated words. Furthermore,
we analyzed the impact of noise on the fixation positions and showed that DysLexML is accurate and
robust in the presence of noise. These encouraging results set the basis for developing screening
tools in less controlled, larger-scale environments, with inexpensive eye-trackers, potentially
reaching a larger population for early intervention.
