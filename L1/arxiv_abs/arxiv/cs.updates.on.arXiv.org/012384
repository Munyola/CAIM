In this paper, we provide a rigorous characterization of consensus solvability in synchronous
directed dynamic networks controlled by an arbitrary message adversary using point-set topology:
We extend the approach introduced by Alpern and Schneider in 1985 by introducing two novel topologies
on the space of infinite executions: the process-view topology, induced by a distance function
that relies on the local view of a given process in an execution, and the minimum topology, which is
induced by a distance function that focuses on the local view of the process that is the last to distinguish
two executions. We establish some simple but powerful topological results, which not only lead
to a topological explanation of bivalence arguments, but also provide necessary and sufficient
topological conditions on the admissible graph sequences of a message adversary for solving consensus.
In particular, we characterize consensus solvability in terms of connectivity of the set of admissible
graph sequences. For non-compact message adversaries, which are not limit-closed in the sense
that there is a convergent sequence of graph sequences whose limit is not permitted, this requires
the exclusion of all "fair" and "unfair" limit sequences that coincide with the forever bivalent
runs constructed in bivalence proofs. For both compact and non-compact message adversaries, we
also provide tailored characterizations of consensus solvability, i.e., tight conditions for
impossibility and existence of algorithms, based on the broadcastability of the connected components
of the set of admissible graph sequences.
