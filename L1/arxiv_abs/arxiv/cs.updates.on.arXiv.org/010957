In a blockchain system, consensus protocol as an incentive and security mechanism, is to ensure
the participants to build the block honestly and effectively. There are different consensus protocols
for blockchain, like Proof of work (PoW), Proof of Stake (PoS), Proof of Space (PoSpace), Proof of
Activities etc. But most of these consensus protocols are not designed for doing some useful jobs
for society because of too much competition and scalability limitation. Massive electric power
and computing resources, including CPU, RAM, storage and sensors have been wasted to run blockchain
network based on these consensus protocols. Current frameworks and middleware for building decentralised
applications (dApps) are largely limited to simple and less useful jobs. In this paper, we present
Proofware which is designed for developers to build their dApps easily with existing public/crowd-based
computing resources. Under Proofware, developers can develop and test their own Proof of Useful
Work (PoUW) consensus protocols. Also, rather than depending on a centralised accounting system,
each dApp has an embedded currency system to keep the whole incentive system decentralised, fair,
transparent, stable and sustainable. Based on Proofware, we have built a crowd based video sharing
application, called OurTube, as a case study. By the OurTube example, it has shown Proofware significantly
improves the productivity to build crowd-based computing system with the features of cost-effectiveness,
anti-censorship, elasticity and financial sustainability.
