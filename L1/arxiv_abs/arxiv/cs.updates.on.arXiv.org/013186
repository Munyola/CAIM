Background Precise prediction of cancer types is vital for cancer diagnosis and therapy. Important
cancer marker genes can be inferred through predictive model. Several studies have attempted to
build machine learning models for this task however none has taken into consideration the effects
of tissue of origin that can potentially bias the identification of cancer markers. Results In this
paper, we introduced several Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models that take unstructured
gene expression inputs to classify tumor and non-tumor samples into their designated cancer types
or as normal. Based on different designs of gene embeddings and convolution schemes, we implemented
three CNN models: 1D-CNN, 2D-Vanilla-CNN, and 2D-Hybrid-CNN. The models were trained and tested
on combined 10,340 samples of 33 cancer types and 731 matched normal tissues of The Cancer Genome
Atlas (TCGA). Our models achieved excellent prediction accuracies (93.9-95.0%) among 34 classes
(33 cancers and normal). Furthermore, we interpreted one of the models, known as 1D-CNN model, with
a guided saliency technique and identified a total of 2,090 cancer markers (108 per class). The concordance
of differential expression of these markers between the cancer type they represent and others is
confirmed. In breast cancer, for instance, our model identified well-known markers, such as GATA3
and ESR1. Finally, we extended the 1D-CNN model for prediction of breast cancer subtypes and achieved
an average accuracy of 88.42% among 5 subtypes. The codes can be found at https://github.com/chenlabgccri/CancerTypePrediction.
