Twitter accounts have already been used in many scientometrics studies, but the meaningfulness
of the data for societal impact measurements in research evaluation has been questioned. Earlier
research has compared social media counts with citations. We explore a novel network approach in
which we compare author keywords to Twitter hashtags as indicators of topics. We analyze the topics
of tweeted publications and compare them with the topics of all publications (tweeted and not tweeted).
Our study is based on a comprehensive publication set of climate change research. We are interested
in whether Twitter data are able to reveal topics of public discussions which can be separated from
research-focused topics. We find that the most tweeted topics regarding climate change research
focus on consequences for humans due to climate change. Twitter users are interested in climate
change publications which forecast effects of a changing climate on the agricultural sector. This
includes food production and conservation of forests. The networks based on the author keywords
in both tweeted and not tweeted papers are broader oriented. Overall, our results show that publications
using scientific jargon are less likely to be tweeted than publications using more general keywords.
Our results do not support the use of Twitter counts for research evaluation purposes. However,
publications that are tweeted can clearly be distinguished from publications that are not tweeted.
Furthermore, the Twitter networks can be used to visualize public discussions about specific topics.
