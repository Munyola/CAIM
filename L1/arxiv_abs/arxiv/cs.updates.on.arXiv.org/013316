Phantoms for surgical training are able to mimic cutting and suturing properties and patient-individual
shape of organs, but lack a realistic visual appearance that captures the heterogeneity of surgical
scenes. In order to overcome this in endoscopic approaches, hyperrealistic concepts have been
proposed to be used in an augmented reality-setting, which are based on deep image-to-image transformation
methods. Such concepts are able to generate realistic representations of phantoms learned from
real intraoperative endoscopic sequences. Conditioned on frames from the surgical training process,
the learned models are able to generate impressive results by transforming unrealistic parts of
the image (e.g.\ the uniform phantom texture is replaced by the more heterogeneous texture of the
tissue). Image-to-image synthesis usually learns a mapping $G:X~\to~Y$ such that the distribution
of images from $G(X)$ is indistinguishable from the distribution $Y$. However, it does not necessarily
force the generated images to be consistent and without artifacts. In the endoscopic image domain
this can affect depth cues and stereo consistency of a stereo image pair, which ultimately impairs
surgical vision. We propose a cross-domain conditional generative adversarial network approach
(GAN) that aims to generate more consistent stereo pairs. The results show substantial improvements
in depth perception and realism evaluated by 3 domain experts and 3 medical students on a 3D monitor
over the baseline method. In 84 of 90 instances our proposed method was preferred or rated equal to
the baseline.
