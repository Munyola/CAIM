To well understand crowd behavior, microscopic models have been developed in recent decades, in
which an individual's behavioral/psychological status can be modeled and simulated. A well-known
model is the social-force model innovated by physical scientists (Helbing and Molnar, 1995; Helbing,
Farkas and Vicsek, 2000; Helbing et al., 2002). This model has been widely accepted and mainly used
in simulation of crowd evacuation in the past decade. A problem, however, is that the testing results
of the model were not explained in consistency with the psychological findings, resulting in misunderstanding
of the model by psychologists. This paper will bridge the gap between psychological studies and
physical explanation about this model. We reinterpret this physics-based model from a psychological
perspective, clarifying that the model is consistent with psychological theories on stress, including
time-related stress and interpersonal stress. Based on the conception of stress, we renew the model
at both micro-and-macro level, referring to multi-agent simulation in a microscopic sense and
fluid-based analysis in a macroscopic sense. Existing simulation results such as faster-is-slower
effect will be reinterpreted by Yerkes-Dodson law, and herding and grouping effect are further
discussed by integrating attraction into the social force. In brief the social-force model exhibits
a bridge between the physics laws and psychological principles regarding crowd motion, and this
paper will renew and reinterpret the model on the foundation of psychological studies.
