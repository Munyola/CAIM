Cardiovascular disease (CD) is the number one leading cause of death worldwide, accounting for
more than 17 million deaths in 2015. Critical indicators of CD include heart murmurs, intense sounds
emitted by the heart during periods of irregular blood flow. Current diagnosis of heart murmurs
relies on echocardiography (ECHO), which costs thousands of dollars and medical professionals
to analyze the results, making it very unsuitable for areas with inadequate medical facilities.
Thus, there is a need for an accessible alternative. Based on a simple interface and deep learning,
HeartFit allows users to administer diagnoses themselves. An inexpensive, custom designed stethoscope
in conjunction with a mobile application allows users to record and upload audio of their heart to
a database. Using a deep learning network architecture, the database classifies the audio and returns
the diagnosis to the user. The model consists of a deep recurrent convolutional neural network trained
on 300 prelabeled heartbeat audio samples. After the model was validated on a previously unseen
set of 100 heartbeat audio samples, it achieved a f beta score of 0.9545 and an accuracy of 95.5 percent.
This value exceeds that of clinical examination accuracy, which is around 83 percent to 91 percent
and costs orders of magnitude less than ECHO, demonstrating the effectiveness of the HeartFit platform.
Through the platform, users can obtain immediate, accurate diagnosis of heart murmurs without
any professional medical assistance, revolutionizing how we combat CD.
