To understand how a complex system is organized and functions, researchers often identify communities
in the system's network of interactions. Because it is practically impossible to explore all solutions
to guarantee the best one, many community-detection algorithms rely on multiple stochastic searches.
But for a given combination of network and stochastic algorithm, how many searches are sufficient
to find a solution that is good enough? The standard approach is to pick a reasonably large number
of searches and select the network partition with the highest quality or derive a consensus solution
based on all network partitions. However, if different partitions have similar qualities such
that the solution landscape is degenerate, the single best partition may miss relevant information,
and a consensus solution may blur complementary communities. Here we address this degeneracy problem
with coarse-grained descriptions of the solution landscape. We cluster network partitions based
on their similarity and suggest an approach to determine the minimum number of searches required
to describe the solution landscape adequately. To make good use of all partitions, we also propose
different ways to explore the solution landscape, including a significance clustering procedure.
We test these approaches on synthetic and real-world networks, and find that different networks
and algorithms require a different number of searches and that exploring the coarse-grained solution
landscape can reveal noteworthy complementary solutions and enable more reliable community detection.
