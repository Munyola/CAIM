Thanks to the Big Data revolution and increasing computing capacities, Artificial Intelligence
(AI) has made an impressive revival over the past few years and is now omnipresent in both research
and industry. The creative sectors have always been early adopters of AI technologies and this continues
to be the case. As a matter of fact, recent technological developments keep pushing the boundaries
of intelligent systems in creative applications: the critically acclaimed movie "Sunspring",
released in 2016, was entirely written by AI technology, and the first-ever Music Album, called
"Hello World", produced using AI has been released this year. Simultaneously, the exploratory
nature of the creative process is raising important technical challenges for AI such as the ability
for AI-powered techniques to be accurate under limited data resources, as opposed to the conventional
"Big Data" approach, or the ability to process, analyse and match data from multiple modalities
(text, sound, images, etc.) at the same time. The purpose of this white paper is to understand future
technological advances in AI and their growing impact on creative industries. This paper addresses
the following questions: Where does AI operate in creative Industries? What is its operative role?
How will AI transform creative industries in the next ten years? This white paper aims to provide
a realistic perspective of the scope of AI actions in creative industries, proposes a vision of how
this technology could contribute to research and development works in such context, and identifies
research and development challenges.
