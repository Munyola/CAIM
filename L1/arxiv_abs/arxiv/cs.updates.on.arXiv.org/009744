In recent era prediction of enzyme class from an unknown protein is one of the challenging tasks in
bioinformatics. Day to day the number of proteins is increases as result the prediction of enzyme
class gives a new opportunity to bioinformatics scholars. The prime objective of this article is
to implement the machine learning classification technique for feature selection and predictions
also find out an appropriate classification technique for function prediction. In this article
the seven different classification technique like CRT, QUEST, CHAID, C5.0, ANN (Artificial Neural
Network), SVM and Bayesian has been implemented on 4368 protein data that has been extracted from
UniprotKB databank and categories into six different class. The proteins data is high dimensional
sequence data and contain a maximum of 48 features.To manipulate the high dimensional sequential
protein data with different classification technique, the SPSS has been used as an experimental
tool. Different classification techniques give different results for every model and shows that
the data are imbalanced for class C4, C5 and C6. The imbalanced data affect the performance of model.
In these three classes the precision and recall value is very less or negligible. The experimental
results highlight that the C5.0 classification technique accuracy is more suited for protein feature
classification and predictions. The C5.0 classification technique gives 95.56% accuracy and
also gives high precision and recall value. Finally, we conclude that the features that is selected
can be used for function prediction.
