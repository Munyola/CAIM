This paper introduces Bounded Fuzzy Possibilistic Method (BFPM) by addressing several issues
that previous clustering/classification methods have not considered. In fuzzy clustering, object's
membership values should sum to 1. Hence, any object may obtain full membership in at most one cluster.
Possibilistic clustering methods remove this restriction. However, BFPM differs from previous
fuzzy and possibilistic clustering approaches by allowing the membership function to take larger
values with respect to all clusters. Furthermore, in BFPM, a data object can have full membership
in multiple clusters or even in all clusters. BFPM relaxes the boundary conditions (restrictions)
in membership assignment. The proposed methodology satisfies the necessity of obtaining full
memberships and overcomes the issues with conventional methods on dealing with overlapping. Analysing
the objects' movements from their own cluster to another (mutation) is also proposed in this paper.
BFPM has been applied in different domains in geometry, set theory, anomaly detection, risk management,
diagnosis diseases, and other disciplines. Validity and comparison indexes have been also used
to evaluate the accuracy of BFPM. BFPM has been evaluated in terms of accuracy, fuzzification constant
(different norms), objects' movement analysis, and covering diversity. The promising results
prove the importance of considering the proposed methodology in learning methods to track the behaviour
of data objects, in addition to obtain accurate results.
