We present a novel optimal allocation model for perennial plants, in which assimilates are not allocated
directly to vegetative or reproductive parts but instead go first to a storage compartment from
where they are then optimally redistributed. We do not restrict considerations purely to periods
favourable for photosynthesis, as it was done in published models of perennial species, but analyse
the whole life period of a perennial plant. As a result, we obtain the general scheme of perennial
plant development, for which annual and monocarpic strategies are special cases. We not only re-derive
predictions from several previous optimal allocation models, but also obtain more information
about plants' strategies during transitions between favourable and unfavourable seasons. One
of the model's predictions is that a plant can begin to re-establish vegetative tissues from storage,
some time before the beginning of favourable conditions, which in turn allows for better production
potential when conditions become better. By means of numerical examples we show that annual plants
with single or multiple reproduction periods, monocarps, evergreen perennials and polycarpic
perennials can be studied successfully with the help of our unified model. Finally, we build a bridge
between optimal allocation models and models describing trade-offs between size and the number
of seeds: a modelled plant can control the distribution of not only allocated carbohydrates but
also seed size. We provide sufficient conditions for the optimality of producing the smallest and
largest seeds possible.
