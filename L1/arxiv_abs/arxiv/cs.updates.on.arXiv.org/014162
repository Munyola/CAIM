We propose Style Conditioned Recommendations (SCR) and introduce style injection as a method to
diversify recommendations. We use Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) architecture,
where both the encoder and decoder are conditioned on a user profile learned from item content data.
This allows us to apply style transfer methodologies to the task of recommendations, which we refer
to as injection. To enable style injection, user profiles are learned to be interpretable such that
they express users' propensities for specific predefined styles. These are learned via label-propagation
from a dataset of item content, with limited labeled points. To perform injection, the condition
on the encoder is learned while the condition on the decoder is selected per explicit feedback. Explicit
feedback can be taken either from a user's response to a style or interest quiz, or from item ratings.
In the absence of explicit feedback, the condition at the encoder is applied to the decoder. We show
a 12% improvement on NDCG@20 over the traditional VAE based approach and an average 22% improvement
on AUC across all classes for predicting user style profiles against our best performing baseline.
After injecting styles we compare the user style profile to the style of the recommendations and
show that injected styles have an average +133% increase in presence. Our results show that style
injection is a powerful method to diversify recommendations while maintaining personal relevance.
Our main contribution is an application of a semi-supervised approach that extends item labels
to interpretable user profiles.
