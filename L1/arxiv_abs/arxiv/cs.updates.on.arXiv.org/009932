User mobility prediction is widely considered to be helpful for various sorts of location based
services on mobile devices. A large amount of studies have explored different algorithms to predict
where a user will visit in the future based on their current and historical contexts and trajectories.
Most of them focus on specific targets of predictions, such as the next venue a user checks in or the
destination of her next trip, which usually depend on what their task is and what is available in their
data. While successful stories are often reported, little discussion can be found on what happens
if the prediction targets vary: whether coarser locations are easier to be predicted than finer
locations, and whether predicting the immediate next location on the trajectory is easier than
predicting the destination. On the other hand, commonly used in these prediction tasks, few have
utilized finer grained, on-device user behavioral data, which are supposed to be indicative of
user intentions. In this paper, we conduct a systematic study on the problem of mobility prediction
using a fine-grained real-world dataset. Based on a Markov model, a recurrent neural network, and
a multi-modal learning method, we perform a series of experiments to investigate the predictability
of different types of granularities of prediction targets and the effectiveness of different types
of signals. The results provide many insights on what can be predicted and how, which sheds light
on real-world mobility prediction in general.
