We develop a family of reformulations of an arbitrary consistent linear system into a stochastic
problem. The reformulations are governed by two user-defined parameters: a positive definite
matrix defining a norm, and an arbitrary discrete or continuous distribution over random matrices.
Our reformulation has several equivalent interpretations, allowing for researchers from various
communities to leverage their domain specific insights. In particular, our reformulation can
be equivalently seen as a stochastic optimization problem, stochastic linear system, stochastic
fixed point problem and a probabilistic intersection problem. We prove sufficient, and necessary
and sufficient conditions for the reformulation to be exact. Further, we propose and analyze three
stochastic algorithms for solving the reformulated problem---basic, parallel and accelerated
methods---with global linear convergence rates. The rates can be interpreted as condition numbers
of a matrix which depends on the system matrix and on the reformulation parameters. This gives rise
to a new phenomenon which we call stochastic preconditioning, and which refers to the problem of
finding parameters (matrix and distribution) leading to a sufficiently small condition number.
Our basic method can be equivalently interpreted as stochastic gradient descent, stochastic Newton
method, stochastic proximal point method, stochastic fixed point method, and stochastic projection
method, with fixed stepsize (relaxation parameter), applied to the reformulations.
