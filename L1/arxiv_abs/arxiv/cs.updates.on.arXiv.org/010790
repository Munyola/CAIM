The increasing use of fossil fuels to produce energy is leading to environmental problems. Hence,
it has led the human society to move towards the use of renewable energies, including solar energy.
In recent years, one of the most popular methods to gain energy is using photovoltaic arrays to produce
solar energy. Skyscrapers and different weather conditions cause shadings on these PV arrays,
which leads to less power generation. Various methods such as TCT and Sudoku patterns have been proposed
to improve power generation for partial shading PV arrays, but these methods have some problems
such as not generating maximum power and being designed for a specific dimension of PV arrays. Therefore,
we proposed a metaheuristic algorithm-based approach to extract maximum possible power in the
shortest possible time. In this paper, five algorithms which have proper results in most of the searching
problems are chosen from different groups of metaheuristic algorithms. Also, four different standard
shading patterns are used for more realistic analysis. Results show that the proposed method achieves
better results in maximum power generation compared to TCT arrangement (18.53%) and Sudoku arrangement
(4.93%). Also, the results show that GWO is the fastest metaheuristic algorithm to reach maximum
output power in PV arrays under partial shading condition. Thus, the authors believe that by using
metaheuristic algorithms, an efficient, reliable, and fast solution is reached to solve partial
shading PV arrays problem
