The rapid development of computer hardware and Internet technology makes large scale data dependent
models computationally tractable, and opens a bright avenue for annotating images through innovative
machine learning algorithms. Semi-supervised learning (SSL) has consequently received intensive
attention in recent years and has been successfully deployed in image annotation. One representative
work in SSL is Laplacian regularization (LR), which smoothes the conditional distribution for
classification along the manifold encoded in the graph Laplacian, however, it has been observed
that LR biases the classification function towards a constant function which possibly results
in poor generalization. In addition, LR is developed to handle uniformly distributed data (or single
view data), although instances or objects, such as images and videos, are usually represented by
multiview features, such as color, shape and texture. In this paper, we present multiview Hessian
regularization (mHR) to address the above two problems in LR-based image annotation. In particular,
mHR optimally combines multiple Hessian regularizations, each of which is obtained from a particular
view of instances, and steers the classification function which varies linearly along the data
manifold. We apply mHR to kernel least squares and support vector machines as two examples for image
annotation. Extensive experiments on the PASCAL VOC'07 dataset validate the effectiveness of
mHR by comparing it with baseline algorithms, including LR and HR.
