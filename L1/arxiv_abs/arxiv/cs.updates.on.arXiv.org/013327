We propose in the paper a novel framework for using a common control input to simultaneously steer
an infinite ensemble of networked control systems. We address the problem of co-designing information
flow topology and network dynamics of every individual networked system so that a continuum ensemble
of such systems is controllable. To keep the analysis tractable, we focus in the paper on a special
class of ensembles systems, namely ensembles of multi-agent formation systems. Specifically,
we consider an ensemble of formation systems indexed by a parameter in a compact, real analytic manifold.
Every individual formation system in the ensemble is composed of $N$ agents. These agents evolve
in $\mathbb{R}^n$ and can access relative positions of their neighbors. The information flow topology
within every individual formation system is, by convention, described by a directed graph where
the vertices correspond to the $N$ agents and the directed edges indicate the information flow.
For simplicity, we assume in the paper that all the individual formation systems share the same information
flow topology described by a common digraph $G$. Amongst other things, we establish a sufficient
condition for approximate path-controllability of the continuum ensemble of formation systems.
We show that if the digraph $G$ is strongly connected and the number $N$ of agents in each individual
system is great than $(n + 1)$, then every such system in the ensemble is simultaneously approximately
path-controllable over a path-connected, open dense subset.
