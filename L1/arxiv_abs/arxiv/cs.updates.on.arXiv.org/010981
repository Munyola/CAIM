This paper presents an integrated methodology supporting decisions in urban planning. In particular,
it deals with the prioritization and the selection of a portfolio of projects related to buildings
of some values for the cultural heritage in cities. More precisely, our methodology has been validated
to the historical center of Naples, Italy. Each project is assessed on the basis of a set of both quantitative
and qualitative criteria with the purpose to determine their level of priority for further selection.
This step was performed through the application of the Electre Tri-nC method which is a multiple
criteria outranking based method for ordinal classification (or sorting) problems and allows
to assign a priority level to each project as an analytical "recommendation" tool. To identify the
efficient portfolios and to support the selection of the most adequate set of projects to activate,
a set of resources (namely budgetary constraints) as well as some logical constraints related to
urban policy requirements have to be taken into consideration together with the priority of projects
in a portfolio analysis model. The process has been conducted by means of the interaction between
analysts, municipality representative and experts. The proposed methodology is generic enough
to be applied to other territorial or urban planning problems. We strongly believe that, given the
increasing interest of historical cities to restore their cultural heritage, the integrated multiple
criteria decision aiding analytical tool proposed in this paper has significant potential to be
used in the future.
