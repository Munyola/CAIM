The web has become a ubiquitous application development platform for mobile systems. Yet, energy-efficient
mobile web browsing remains an outstanding challenge. Prior work in the field mainly focuses on
the initial page loading stage but fails to exploit the opportunities for energy-efficiency optimization
while the user is interacting with a loaded page. This paper presents a novel approach for performing
energy optimization for interactive mobile web browsing. At the heart of our approach is a set of
machine learning models, which estimate \emph{at runtime} the frames per second for a given user
interaction input by running the computation-intensive web render engine on a specific processor
core under a given clock speed. We use the learned predictive models as a utility function to quickly
search for the optimal processor setting to carefully trade responsive time for reduced energy
consumption. We integrate our techniques to the open-source Chromium browser and apply it to two
representative mobile user events: scrolling and pinching (i.e., zoom in and out). We evaluate
the developed system on the landing pages of the top-100 hottest websites and two big.LITTLE heterogeneous
mobile platforms. Our extensive experiments show that the proposed approach reduces system-wide
energy consumption by over 36\% on average and up to 70\%. This translates to an over 10\% improvement
on energy-efficiency over a state-of-the-art event-based web browser scheduler, but with significantly
fewer violations on the quality of service.
