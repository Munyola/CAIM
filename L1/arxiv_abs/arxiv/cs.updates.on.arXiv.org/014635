The drone technology has been increasingly used by many tech-savvy consumers, a number of defense
companies, hobbyists and enthusiasts during the last ten years. Drones often come in various sizes
and are designed for a multitude of purposes. Nowadays many people have small-sized personal drones
for entertainment, filming, or transporting items from one place to another. However, personal
drones lack a privacy-preserving mechanism. While in mission, drones often trespass into the personal
territories of other people and capture photos or videos through windows without their knowledge
and consent. They may also capture video or pictures of people walking, sitting, or doing private
things within the drones' reach in clear form without their go permission. This could potentially
invade people's personal privacy. This paper, therefore, proposes a lightweight privacy-preserving-by-design
method that prevents drones from peeking through windows of houses and capturing people doing private
things at home. It is a fast window object detection and scrambling technology built based on image-enhancing,
morphological transformation, segmentation and contouring processes (MASP). Besides, a chaotic
scrambling technique is incorporated into it for privacy purpose. Hence, this mechanism detects
window objects in every image or frame of a real-time video and masks them chaotically to protect
the privacy of people. The experimental results validated that the proposed MASP method is lightweight
and suitable to be employed in drones, considered as edge devices.
