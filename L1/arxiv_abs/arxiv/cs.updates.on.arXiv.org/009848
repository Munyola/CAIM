In recent years, the performance of action recognition has been significantly improved with the
help of deep neural networks. Most of the existing action recognition works hold the \textit{closed-set}
assumption that all action categories are known beforehand while deep networks can be well trained
for these categories. However, action recognition in the real world is essentially an \textit{open-set}
problem, namely, it is impossible to know all action categories beforehand and consequently infeasible
to prepare sufficient training samples for those emerging categories. In this case, applying closed-set
recognition methods will definitely lead to unseen-category errors. To address this challenge,
we propose the Open Deep Network (ODN) for the open-set action recognition task. Technologically,
ODN detects new categories by applying a multi-class triplet thresholding method, and then dynamically
reconstructs the classification layer and "opens" the deep network by adding predictors for new
categories continually. In order to transfer the learned knowledge to the new category, two novel
methods, Emphasis Initialization and Allometry Training, are adopted to initialize and incrementally
train the new predictor so that only few samples are needed to fine-tune the model. Extensive experiments
show that ODN can effectively detect and recognize new categories with little human intervention,
thus applicable to the open-set action recognition tasks in the real world. Moreover, ODN can even
achieve comparable performance to some closed-set methods.
