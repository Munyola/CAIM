Ride-sharing is a modern urban-mobility paradigm with tremendous potential in reducing congestion
and pollution. Demand-aware design is a promising avenue for addressing a critical challenge in
ride-sharing systems, namely joint optimization of request-vehicle assignment and routing for
a fleet of vehicles. In this paper, we develop a \emph{probabilistic} demand-aware framework to
tackle the challenge. We focus on maximizing the expected number of passengers picked up by the fleet,
given a probability distribution of future demand. A salient feature of our framework is to assign
requests to vehicles in a probabilistic manner. It differentiates our work from existing ones and
allows us to explore a richer design space to tackle the request-vehicle assignment puzzle with
performance guarantee but still keeping the final solution practically implementable. The optimization
problem is non-convex, combinatorial, and NP-hard in nature. As a key contribution, we explore
the problem structure and propose an elegant approximation of the objective function to develop
a dual-subgradient heuristic. We characterize a condition under which the heuristic generates
a $\left(1-1/e\right)$ approximation solution. Our solution is simple and scalable, amendable
for practical implementation. We carry out numerical experiments based on real-world traces in
Manhattan. The results show that as compared to a conventional demand-oblivious scheme, our demand-aware
solution improves the total number of passenger pickups by 21\%.
