While cryptocurrencies and blockchain applications continue to gain popularity, their energy
cost is evidently becoming unsustainable. In most instances, the main cost comes from the required
amount of energy for the Proof-of-Work, and this cost is inherent to the design. In addition, useless
costs from discarded work (e.g., the so-called Forks) and lack of scalability (in number of users
and in rapid transactions) limit their practical effectiveness. In this paper, we present an innovative
scheme which eliminates the nonce and thus the burden of the Proof-of-Work which is the main cause
of the energy waste in cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin. We prove that our scheme guarantees a tunable
and bounded average number of simultaneous mining whatever the size of the population in competition,
thus by making the use of nonce-based techniques unnecessary, achieves scalability without the
cost of consuming a large volume of energy. The technique used in the proof of our scheme is based on
the analogy of the analysis of a green leader election. The additional difference with Proof-of-Work
schemes (beyond the suppression of the nonce field that is triggering most of the waste), is the introduction
of (what we denote as) "empty blocks" which aim are to call regular blocks following a staircase set
of values. Our scheme reduces the risk of Forks and provides tunable scalability for the number of
users and the speed of block generation. We also prove using game theoretical analysis that our scheme
is resilient to unfair competitive investments (e.g., "51 percent" attack) and block nursing.
