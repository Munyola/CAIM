Segmentation of colorectal cancerous regions from the Magnetic Resonance (MR) image is a crucial
procedure for radiotherapy, which requires to accurately delineate boundaries of the tumors.
This work aims to address this important while challenging task in an accurate as well as efficient
manner. We propose a novel multi-tasking framework, referred to as 3D RoI-aware U-Net (3D RU-Net),
for RoI localization and intra-RoI segmentation, where the two tasks share one backbone network.
With the region proposals from the localization branch, we crop multi-level feature maps from the
backbone network to form a U-Net-like intra-RoI segmentation branch. To effectively train the
model, we propose a novel Dice based hybrid loss to tackle the issue of class-imbalance under the
multi-task setting. Furthermore, we design a multi-resolution model ensemble strategy to improve
the discrimination capability of the framework. Results: Our method has been validated on 64 cancerous
cases with a four-fold cross-validation, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by a significant
margin in terms of both accuracy and speed. Experimental results demonstrated that the proposed
method enables accurate and fast whole volume RoI localization and intra-RoI segmentation. This
paper proposes a general 3D segmentation framework which rapidly locates the RoI region in large
volumetric images and accurately segments the in-region targets. The method has a great potential
to be extended to other small 3D object segmentation tasks from medical images.
