Background: A large number of neurology case reports have been published, but it is a challenging
task for human medical experts to explore all of these publications. Text mining offers a computational
approach to investigate neurology literature and capture meaningful patterns. The overarching
goal of this study is to provide a new perspective on case reports of neurological disease and syndrome
analysis over the last six decades using text mining. Methods: We extracted diseases and syndromes
(DsSs) from more than 65,000 neurology case reports from 66 journals in PubMed over the last six decades
from 1955 to 2017. Text mining was applied to reports on the detected DsSs to investigate high-frequency
DsSs, categorize them, and explore the linear trends over the 63-year time frame. Results: The text
mining methods explored high-frequency neurologic DsSs and their trends and the relationships
between them from 1955 to 2017. We detected more than 18,000 unique DsSs and found 10 categories of
neurologic DsSs. While the trend analysis showed the increasing trends in the case reports for top-10
high-frequency DsSs, the categories had mixed trends. Conclusion: Our study provided new insights
into the application of text mining methods to investigate DsSs in a large number of medical case
reports that occur over several decades. The proposed approach can be used to provide a macro level
analysis of medical literature by discovering interesting patterns and tracking them over several
years to help physicians explore these case reports more efficiently.
