In-band full-duplex (FD) communications - enabled by recent advances in antenna and RF circuit
design - has emerged as one of the promising techniques to improve data rates in wireless systems.
One of the major roadblocks in enabling high data rates in FD systems is the inter-user interference
(IUI) due to activating pairs of uplink and downlink users at the same time-frequency resource block.
Opportunistic user scheduling has been proposed as a means to manage IUI and fully exploit the multiplexing
gains in FD systems. In this paper, scheduling under long-term and short-term temporal fairness
for single-cell FD wireless networks is considered. Temporal fair scheduling is of interest in
delay-sensitive applications, and leads to predictable latency and power consumption. The feasible
region of user temporal demand vectors is derived, and a scheduling strategy maximizing the system
utility while satisfying long-term temporal fairness is proposed. Furthermore, a short-term
temporal fair scheduling strategy is devised which satisfies user temporal demands over a finite
window-length. It is shown that the strategy achieves optimal average system utility as the window-length
is increased asymptotically. Subsequently, practical construction algorithms for long-term
and short-term temporal fair scheduling are introduced. Simulations are provided to verify the
derivations and investigate the multiplexing gains. It is observed that using successive interference
cancellation at downlink users improves FD gains significantly in the presence of strong IUI.
