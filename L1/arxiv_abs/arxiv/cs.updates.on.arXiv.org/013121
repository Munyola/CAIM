Nowadays, due to the ubiquitous visual media there are vast amounts of already available high-resolution
(HR) face images. Therefore, for super-resolving a given very low-resolution (LR) face image of
a person it is very likely to find another HR face image of the same person which can be used to guide
the process. In this paper, we propose a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based solution, namely
GWAInet, which applies super-resolution (SR) by a factor 8x on face images guided by another unconstrained
HR face image of the same person with possible differences in age, expression, pose or size. GWAInet
is trained in an adversarial generative manner to produce the desired high quality perceptual image
results. The utilization of the HR guiding image is realized via the use of a warper subnetwork that
aligns its contents to the input image and the use of a feature fusion chain for the extracted features
from the warped guiding image and the input image. In training, the identity loss further helps in
preserving the identity related features by minimizing the distance between the embedding vectors
of SR and HR ground truth images. Contrary to the current state-of-the-art in face super-resolution,
our method does not require facial landmark points for its training, which helps its robustness
and allows it to produce fine details also for the surrounding face region in a uniform manner. Our
method GWAInet produces photo-realistic images in upscaling factor 8x and outperforms state-of-the-art
in quantitative terms and perceptual quality.
