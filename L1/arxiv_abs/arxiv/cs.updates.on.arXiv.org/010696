The 2-receiver broadcast channel is studied: a network with three parties where the transmitter
and one of the receivers are the primarily involved parties and the other receiver considered as
third party. The messages that are determined to be communicated are classified into public, private
and confidential based on the information they convey. The public message contains information
intended for both parties and is required to be decoded correctly by both of them, the private message
is intended for the primary party only, however, there is no secrecy requirement imposed upon it
meaning that it can possibly be exposed to the third party and finally the confidential message containing
information intended exclusively for the primary party such that this information must be kept
completely secret from the other receiver. A trade-off arises between the rates of the three messages,
when one of the rates is high, the other rates may need to be reduced to guarantee the reliable transmission
of all three messages. The encoder performs the necessary equivocation by virtue of dummy random
numbers whose rate is assumed to be limited and should be considered in the trade-off as well. We study
this trade-off in the one-shot regime of a quantum broadcast channel by providing achievability
and (weak) converse regions. In the achievability, we prove and use a conditional version of the
convex-split lemma as well as position-based decoding. By studying the asymptotic behaviour of
our bounds, we will recover several well-known asymptotic results in the literature.
