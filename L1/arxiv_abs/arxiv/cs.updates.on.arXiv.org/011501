Graph clustering is a fundamental computational problem with a number of applications in algorithm
design, machine learning, data mining, and analysis of social networks. Over the past decades,
researchers have proposed a number of algorithmic design methods for graph clustering. However,
most of these methods are based on complicated spectral techniques or convex optimisation, and
cannot be applied directly for clustering many networks that occur in practice, whose information
is often collected on different sites. Designing a simple and distributed clustering algorithm
is of great interest, and has wide applications for processing big datasets. In this paper we present
a simple and distributed algorithm for graph clustering: for a wide class of graphs that are characterised
by a strong cluster-structure, our algorithm finishes in a poly-logarithmic number of rounds,
and recovers a partition of the graph close to an optimal partition. The main component of our algorithm
is an application of the random matching model of load balancing, which is a fundamental protocol
in distributed computing and has been extensively studied in the past 20 years. Hence, our result
highlights an intrinsic and interesting connection between graph clustering and load balancing.
At a technical level, we present a purely algebraic result characterising the early behaviours
of load balancing processes for graphs exhibiting a cluster-structure. We believe that this result
can be further applied to analyse other gossip processes, such as rumour spreading and averaging
processes.
