Developing countries suffer from traffic congestion, poorly planned road/rail networks, and
lack of access to public transportation facilities. This context results in an increase in fuel
consumption, pollution level, monetary losses, massive delays, and less productivity. On the
other hand, it has a negative impact on the commuters feelings and moods. Availability of real-time
transit information - by providing public transportation vehicles locations using GPS devices
- helps in estimating a passenger's waiting time and addressing the above issues. However, such
solution is expensive for developing countries. This paper aims at designing and implementing
a crowd-sourced mobile phones-based solution to estimate the expected waiting time of a passenger
in public transit systems, the prediction of the remaining time to get on/off a vehicle, and to construct
a real time public transit schedule. Trans-Sense has been evaluated using real data collected for
over 800 hours, on a daily basis, by different Android phones, and using different light rail transit
lines at different time spans. The results show that Trans-Sense can achieve an average recall and
precision of 95.35% and 90.1%, respectively, in discriminating lightrail stations. Moreover,
the empirical distributions governing the different time delays affecting a passenger's total
trip time enable predicting the right time of arrival of a passenger to her destination with an accuracy
of 91.81%.In addition, the system estimates the stations dimensions with an accuracy of 95.71%.
