As computing systems become increasingly advanced and as users increasingly engage themselves
in technology, security has never been a greater concern. In malware detection, static analysis
has been the prominent approach. This approach, however, quickly falls short as malicious programs
become more advanced and adopt the capabilities of obfuscating its binaries to execute the same
malicious functions, making static analysis virtually inapplicable to newer variants. The approach
assessed in this paper uses dynamic analysis of malware which may generalize better than static
analysis to variants. Widely used document classification techniques were assessed in detecting
malware by doing such analysis on system call traces, a form of dynamic analysis. Features considered
are extracted from system call traces of benign and malicious programs, and the task to classify
these traces is treated as a binary document classification task using sparse features. The system
call traces were processed to remove the parameters to only leave the system call function names.
The features were grouped into various n-grams and weighted with Term Frequency-Inverse Document
Frequency. Support Vector Machines were used and optimized using a Stochastic Gradient Descent
algorithm that implemented L1, L2, and Elastic-Net regularization terms, the best of which achieved
a highest of 98% accuracy with 98% recall score. Additional contributions include the identification
of significant system call sequences that could be avenues for further research.
