We propose a generalized market equilibrium model using assignment game criteria for evaluating
transportation systems that consist of both operators' and users' decisions: fixed route transit,
multimodal systems, and Mobility-as-a-Service in general. The model finds stable pricing, in
terms of generalized costs, and matches between user populations in a network to links of a set of
routes with line capacities. The proposed model gives a set of stable outcomes instead of single
point pricing that allows operators to design ticket pricing, routes/schedules that impact access/egress,
shared policies that impact wait/transfer costs, etc., based on a desired mechanism or policy.
The set of stable outcomes is proven to be convex from which assignment-dependent unique user-optimal
and operator-optimal outcomes can be obtained. Different user groups can benefit from using this
model in a prescriptive manner or within a sequential design process. We look at several different
examples to test our model: small examples of fixed transit routes and a larger case study using taxi
data in NYC. Based on the taxi data and study area in Lower Manhattan, the model justifies a market
share of 69.3% of users that would take shared rides. Allowing shared taxi results in a 20.5% decrease
in travel mileage. The model suggests that a shared taxi dispatch algorithm adopting a policy that
can require passengers to walk up to 1 block away to meet with a shared taxi would require $0.35/traveler
of the operating cost savings to transfer back to the users if the operator does not wish to turn away
any of these passengers.
