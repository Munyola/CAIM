With the rapid development of marine activities, there has been an increasing number of maritime
mobile terminals, as well as a growing demand for high-speed and ultra-reliable maritime communications
to keep them connected. Traditionally, the maritime Internet of Things (IoT) is enabled by maritime
satellites. However, satellites are seriously restricted by their high latency and relatively
low data rate. As an alternative, shore & island-based base stations (BSs) can be built to extend
the coverage of terrestrial networks using fourth-generation (4G), fifth-generation (5G), and
beyond 5G services. Unmanned aerial vehicles can also be exploited to serve as aerial maritime BSs.
Despite of all these approaches, there are still open issues for an efficient maritime communication
network (MCN). For example, due to the complicated electromagnetic propagation environment,
the limited geometrically available BS sites, and rigorous service demands from mission-critical
applications, conventional communication and networking theories and methods should be tailored
for maritime scenarios. Towards this end, we provide a survey on the demand for maritime communications,
the state-of-the-art MCNs, and key technologies for enhancing transmission efficiency, extending
network coverage, and provisioning maritime-specific services. Future challenges in developing
an environment-aware, service-driven, and integrated satellite-air-ground MCN to be smart enough
to utilize external auxiliary information, e.g., sea state and atmosphere conditions, are also
discussed.
