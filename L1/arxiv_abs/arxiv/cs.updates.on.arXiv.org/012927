We consider the problem of functional matrix factorization, finding low-dimensional structure
in a matrix where every entry is a noisy function evaluated at a set of discrete points. Such problems
arise frequently in drug discovery, where biological samples form the rows, candidate drugs form
the columns, and entries contain the dose-response curve of a sample treated at different concentrations
of a drug. We propose Bayesian Tensor Filtering (BTF), a hierarchical Bayesian model of matrices
of functions. BTF captures the smoothness in each individual function while also being locally
adaptive to sharp discontinuities. The BTF model is agnostic to the likelihood of the underlying
observations, making it flexible enough to handle many different kinds of data. We derive efficient
Gibbs samplers for three classes of likelihoods: (i) Gaussian, for which updates are fully conjugate;
(ii) Binomial and related likelihoods, for which updates are conditionally conjugate through
P{\'o}lya--Gamma augmentation; and (iii) Black-box likelihoods, for which updates are non-conjugate
but admit an analytic truncated elliptical slice sampling routine. We compare BTF against a state-of-the-art
method for dynamic Poisson matrix factorization, showing BTF better reconstructs held out data
in synthetic experiments. Finally, we build a dose-response model around BTF and show on real data
from a multi-sample, multi-drug cancer study that BTF outperforms the current standard approach
in biology. Code for BTF is available at https://github.com/tansey/functionalmf.
