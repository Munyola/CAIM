In the last few years, deep multi-agent reinforcement learning (RL) has become a highly active area
of research. A particularly challenging class of problems in this area is partially observable,
cooperative, multi-agent learning, in which teams of agents must learn to coordinate their behaviour
while conditioning only on their private observations. This is an attractive research area since
such problems are relevant to a large number of real-world systems and are also more amenable to evaluation
than general-sum problems. Standardised environments such as the ALE and MuJoCo have allowed single-agent
RL to move beyond toy domains, such as grid worlds. However, there is no comparable benchmark for
cooperative multi-agent RL. As a result, most papers in this field use one-off toy problems, making
it difficult to measure real progress. In this paper, we propose the StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge
(SMAC) as a benchmark problem to fill this gap. SMAC is based on the popular real-time strategy game
StarCraft II and focuses on micromanagement challenges where each unit is controlled by an independent
agent that must act based on local observations. We offer a diverse set of challenge maps and recommendations
for best practices in benchmarking and evaluations. We also open-source a deep multi-agent RL learning
framework including state-of-the-art algorithms. We believe that SMAC can provide a standard
benchmark environment for years to come. Videos of our best agents for several SMAC scenarios are
