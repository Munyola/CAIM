Intelligent building automation systems can reduce the energy consumption of heating, ventilation
and air-conditioning (HVAC) units by sensing the comfort requirements automatically and scheduling
the HVAC operations dynamically. Traditional building automation systems rely on fairly inaccurate
occupancy sensors and basic predictive control using oversimplified building thermal response
models, all of which prevent such systems from reaching their full potential. Such limitations
can now be avoided due to the recent developments in embedded system technologies, which provide
viable low-cost computing platforms with powerful processors and sizeable memory storage in a
small footprint. As a result, building automation systems can now efficiently execute highly-sophisticated
computational tasks, such as real-time video processing and accurate thermal-response simulations.
With this in mind, we designed and implemented an occupancy-predictive HVAC control system in a
low-cost yet powerful embedded system (using Raspberry Pi 3) to demonstrate the following key features
for building automation: (1) real-time occupancy recognition using video-processing and machine-learning
techniques, (2) dynamic analysis and prediction of occupancy patterns, and (3) model predictive
control for HVAC operations guided by real-time building thermal response simulations (using
an on-board EnergyPlus simulator). We deployed and evaluated our system for providing automatic
HVAC control in the large public indoor space of a mosque, thereby achieving significant energy
savings.
