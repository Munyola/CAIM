Modern malware typically makes use of a domain generation algorithm (DGA) to avoid command and control
domains or IPs being seized or sinkholed. This means that an infected system may attempt to access
many domains in an attempt to contact the command and control server. Therefore, the automatic detection
of DGA domains is an important task, both for the sake of blocking malicious domains and identifying
compromised hosts. However, many DGAs use English wordlists to generate plausibly clean-looking
domain names; this makes automatic detection difficult. In this work, we devise a notion of difficulty
for DGA families called the smashword score; this measures how much a DGA family looks like English
words. We find that this measure accurately reflects how much a DGA family's domains look like they
are made from natural English words. We then describe our new modeling approach, which is a combination
of a novel recurrent neural network architecture with domain registration side information. Our
experiments show the model is capable of effectively identifying domains generated by difficult
DGA families. Our experiments also show that our model outperforms existing approaches, and is
able to reliably detect difficult DGA families such as matsnu, suppobox, rovnix, and others. The
model's performance compared to the state of the art is best for DGA families that resemble English
words. We believe that this model could either be used in a standalone DGA domain detector---such
as an endpoint security application---or alternately the model could be used as a part of a larger
malware detection system.
