Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) based on histopathological imaging has progressed rapidly in
recent years with the rise of machine learning based methodologies. Traditional approaches consist
of training a classification model using features extracted from the images, based on textures
or morphological properties. Recently, deep-learning based methods have been applied directly
to the raw (unprocessed) data. However, their usability is impacted by the paucity of annotated
data in the biomedical sector. In order to leverage the learning capabilities of deep Convolutional
Neural Nets (CNNs) within the confines of limited labelled data, in this study we shall investigate
the transfer learning approaches that aim to apply the knowledge gained from solving a source (e.g.,
non-medical) problem, to learn better predictive models for the target (e.g., biomedical) task.
As an alternative, we shall further propose a new adaptive and compact CNN based architecture that
can be trained from scratch even on scarce and low-resolution data. Moreover, we conduct quantitative
comparative evaluations among the traditional methods, transfer learning-based methods and
the proposed adaptive approach for the particular task of cancer detection and identification
from scarce and low-resolution histology images. Over the largest benchmark dataset formed for
this purpose, the proposed adaptive approach achieved a higher cancer detection accuracy with
a significant gap, whereas the deep CNNs with transfer learning achieved a superior cancer identification.
