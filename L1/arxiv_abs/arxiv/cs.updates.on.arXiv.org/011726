The VertexCover problem is proven to be computationally hard in different ways: It is NP-complete
to find an optimal solution and even NP-hard to find an approximation with reasonable factors. In
contrast, recent experiments suggest that on many real-world networks the run time to solve VertexCover
is way smaller than even the best known FPT-approaches can explain. Similarly, greedy algorithms
deliver very good approximations to the optimal solution in practice, although VertexCover is
NP-hard to approximate within reasonable factors. We link these observations to two properties
that are observed in many real-world networks, namely a heterogeneous degree distribution and
high clustering. To formalize these properties and explain the observed behavior, we analyze how
a branch-and-reduce algorithm performs on hyperbolic random graphs, which have become increasingly
popular for modeling real-world networks. In fact, we are able to show that the VertexCover problem
on hyperbolic random graphs can be solved in polynomial time, with high probability. The proof relies
on interesting structural properties of hyperbolic random graphs. Since these predictions of
the model are interesting in their own right, we conducted experiments on real-world networks showing
that these properties are also observed in practice. When utilizing the same structural properties
in an adaptive greedy algorithm, further experiments suggest that this leads to even better approximations
than the standard greedy approach on real instances.
