Cross-project defect prediction (CPDP) aims to predict defects of projects lacking training data
by using prediction models trained on historical defect data from other projects. However, since
the distribution differences between datasets from different projects, it is still a challenge
to build high-quality CPDP models. Unfortunately, class imbalanced nature of software defect
datasets further increases the difficulty. In this paper, we propose a transferlearning oriented
minority over-sampling technique (TOMO) based feature weighting transfer naive Bayes (FWTNB)
approach (TOMOFWTNB) for CPDP by considering both classimbalance and feature importance problems.
Differing from traditional over-sampling techniques, TOMO not only can balance the data but reduce
the distribution difference. And then FWTNB is used to further increase the similarity of two distributions.
Experiments are performed on 11 public defect datasets. The experimental results show that (1)
TOMO improves the average G-Measure by 23.7\%$\sim$41.8\%, and the average MCC by 54.2\%$\sim$77.8\%.
(2) feature weighting (FW) strategy improves the average G-Measure by 11\%, and the average MCC
by 29.2\%. (3) TOMOFWTNB improves the average G-Measure value by at least 27.8\%, and the average
MCC value by at least 71.5\%, compared with existing state-of-theart CPDP approaches. It can be
concluded that (1) TOMO is very effective for addressing class-imbalance problem in CPDP scenario;
(2) our FW strategy is helpful for CPDP; (3) TOMOFWTNB outperforms previous state-of-the-art CPDP
approaches.
