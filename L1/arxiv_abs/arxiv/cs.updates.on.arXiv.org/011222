We introduce Flexible Representative Democracy (FRD), a novel hybrid of Representative Democracy
(RD) and direct democracy (DD), in which voters can alter the issue-dependent weights of a set of
elected representatives. In line with the literature on Interactive Democracy, our model allows
the voters to actively determine the degree to which the system is direct versus representative.
However, unlike Liquid Democracy, FRD uses strictly non-transitive delegations, making delegation
cycles impossible, and maintains a fixed set of accountable elected representatives. We present
FRD and analyze it using a computational approach with issues that are binary and symmetric; we compare
the outcomes of various democratic systems using Direct Democracy with majority voting as an ideal
baseline. First, we demonstrate the shortcomings of Representative Democracy in our model. We
provide NP-Hardness results for electing an ideal set of representatives, discuss pathologies,
and demonstrate empirically that common multi-winner election rules for selecting representatives
do not perform well in expectation. To analyze the behavior of FRD, we begin by providing theoretical
results on how issue-specific delegations determine outcomes. Finally, we provide empirical
results comparing the outcomes of RD with fixed sets of proxies across issues versus FRD with issue-specific
delegations. Our results show that variants of Proxy Voting yield no discernible benefit over RD
and reveal the potential for FRD to improve outcomes as voter participation increases, further
motivating the use of issue-specific delegations.
