Cross-platform recommendation aims to improve the recommendation accuracy through aligning
or fusing informationfrom different platforms together. Existing cross-platform recommendation
approaches assume all cross-platform information to be consistent with each other and can be aligned.
However, there remain two challenges unsolved by previous works on cross-platform video recommendation:
i) there exist inconsistencies in cross-platform association due to the platform-specific disparity,
and ii) data from distinct platforms may share different semantic granularities. In this paper,
we propose a cross-platform association model for cross-platform video recommendation, i.e.,
Disparity-preserved Deep Cross-platform Association (DCA), taking platform-specific disparity
into consideration to address these challenges. The proposed DCA model employs a partially-connected
multi-modal autoencoder capable of explicitly capturing and preserving platform-specific information
in deep latent representation, as well as utilizes nonlinear mapping functions to handle granularity
differences from various platforms. We then present a cross-platform video recommendation approach
based on the proposed DCA model, which automatically concentrates on valuable cross-platform
information from a comprehensive semantic level. Extensive experiments for our cross-platform
recommendation framework on Twitter and YouTube datasets demonstrate that the proposed DCA model
can significantly outperform existing cross-platform recommendation methods in terms of various
evaluation metrics.
