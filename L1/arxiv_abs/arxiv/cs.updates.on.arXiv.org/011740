In the field of multi-objective optimization algorithms, multi-objective Bayesian Global Optimization
(MOBGO) is an important branch, in addition to evolutionary multi-objective optimization algorithms
(EMOAs). MOBGO utilizes Gaussian Process Models learned from previous objective function evaluations
to decide the next evaluation site by maximizing or minimizing an infill criterion. A common criterion
in MOBGO is the Expected Hypervolume Improvement (EHVI), which shows a good performance on a wide
range of problems, with respect to exploration and exploitation. However, so far it has been a challenge
to calculate exact EHVI values efficiently. In this paper, an efficient algorithm for the computation
of the exact EHVI for a generic case is proposed. This efficient algorithm is based on partitioning
the integration volume into a set of axis-parallel slices. Theoretically, the upper bound time
complexities are improved from previously $O (n^2)$ and $O(n^3)$, for two- and three-objective
problems respectively, to $\Theta(n\log n)$, which is asymptotically optimal. This article generalizes
the scheme in higher dimensional case by utilizing a new hyperbox decomposition technique, which
was proposed by D{\"a}chert et al, EJOR, 2017. It also utilizes a generalization of the multilayered
integration scheme that scales linearly in the number of hyperboxes of the decomposition. The speed
comparison shows that the proposed algorithm in this paper significantly reduces computation
time. Finally, this decomposition technique is applied in the calculation of the Probability of
Improvement (PoI).
