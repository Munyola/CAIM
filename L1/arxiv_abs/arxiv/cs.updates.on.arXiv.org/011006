A large-scale dataset of measurements of ETSI ITS-G5 Dedicated Short Range Communications (DSRC)
is presented. Our dataset consists of network interactions happening between two On-Board Units
(OBUs) and four Road Side Units (RSUs). Each OBU was fitted onto a vehicle. The two vehicles have been
driven across the Innovate UK-funded FLOURISH Test Track encompassing key roads in the center of
Bristol, UK. As for the RSUs, they were located at fixed locations around the track. Each RSU and OBU
is equipped with two transceivers operating at different frequencies. During our experiments,
each transceiver broadcast Cooperative Awareness Messages (CAMs) every $\SI{10}{\milli\second}$
to the neighboring RSUs and or OBUs. The dataset refers to eight experimental sessions of the length
of $\sim\SI{2}{\hour}$ each that have taken place over four days -- allocating two experimental
sessions per-day. During the same day, both transceivers onboard any of the RSUs and OBUs was operated
on two different frequencies. In particular, we operated the transceivers both over the licensed
DSRC band, and over the unlicensed Industrial, Scientific, and Medical radio (ISM) bands $\SI{2.4}{\giga\hertz}$-$\SI{2.5}{\giga\hertz}$
and $\SI{5.725}{\giga\hertz}$-$\SI{5.875}{\giga\hertz}$. During each experimental session,
for each transceiver, all the transmitted and received CAMs were recorded. For each of the received
CAMs, we also recorded its Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) and the location of the receiving
transceiver.
