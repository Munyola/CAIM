This work analyzes the convergence properties of signed networks with nonlinear edge functions.
We consider diffusively coupled networks comprised of maximal equilibrium-independent passive
(MEIP) dynamics on the nodes, and a general class of nonlinear coupling functions on the edges. The
first contribution of this work is to generalize the classical notion of signed networks for graphs
with scalar weights to graphs with nonlinear edge functions using notions from passivity theory.
We show that the output of the network can finally form one or several steady-state clusters if all
edges are positive, and in particular, all nodes can reach an output agreement if there is a connected
subnetwork spanning all nodes and strictly positive edges. When there are non-positive edges added
to the network, we show that the tension of the network still converges to the equilibria of the edge
functions if the relative outputs of the nodes connected by non-positive edges converge to their
equilibria. Furthermore, we establish the equivalent circuit models for signed nonlinear networks,
and define the concept of equivalent edge functions which is a generalization of the notion of effective
resistance. We finally characterize the relationship between the convergence property and the
equivalent edge function, when a non-positive edge is added to a strictly positive network comprised
of nonlinear integrators. We show that the convergence of the network is always guaranteed, if the
sum of the equivalent edge function of the previous network and the new edge function is passive.
