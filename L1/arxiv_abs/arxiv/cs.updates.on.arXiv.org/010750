Human Activity Recognition (HAR) using deep neural network has become a hot topic in human-computer
interaction. Machine can effectively identify human naturalistic activities by learning from
a large collection of sensor data. Activity recognition is not only an interesting research problem,
but also has many real-world practical applications. Based on the success of residual networks
in achieving a high level of aesthetic representation of the automatic learning, we propose a novel
\textbf{D}ual \textbf{R}esidual \textbf{N}etwork, named DRN. DRN is implemented using two identical
path frameworks consisting of (1) a short time window, which is used to capture spatial features,
and (2) a long time window, which is used to capture fine temporal features. The long time window path
can be made very lightweight by reducing its channel capacity, yet still being able to learn useful
temporal representations for activity recognition. In this paper, we mainly focus on proposing
a new model to improve the accuracy of HAR. In order to demonstrate the effectiveness of DRN model,
we carried out extensive experiments and compared with conventional recognition methods (HC,
CBH, CBS) and learning-based methods (AE, MLP, CNN, LSTM, Hybrid, ResNet). The benchmark datasets
(OPPORTUNITY, UniMiB-SHAR) were adopted by our experiments. Results from our experiments show
that our model is effective in recognizing human activities via wearable datasets. We discuss the
influence of networks parameters on performance to provide insights about its optimization.
