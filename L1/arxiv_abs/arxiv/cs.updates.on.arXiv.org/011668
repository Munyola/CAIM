Non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) is a modern and still expanding technique, helping to understand
fundamental energy consumption patterns and appliance characteristics. Appliance event detection
is an elementary step in the NILM pipeline. Unfortunately, several types of appliances (e.g., switching
mode power supply (SMPS) or multi-state) are known to challenge state-of-the-art event detection
systems due to their noisy consumption profiles. Classical rule-based event detection system
become infeasible and complex for these appliances. By stepping away from distinct event definitions,
we can learn from a consumer-configured event model to differentiate between relevant and irrelevant
event transients. We introduce a boosting oriented adaptive training, that uses false positives
from the initial training area to reduce the number of false positives on the test area substantially.
The results show a false positive decrease by more than a factor of eight on a dataset that has a strong
focus on SMPS-driven appliances. To obtain a stable event detection system, we applied several
experiments on different parameters to measure its performance. These experiments include the
evaluation of six event features from the spectral and time domain, different types of feature space
normalization to eliminate undesired feature weighting, the conventional and adaptive training,
and two common classifiers with its optimal parameter settings. The evaluations are performed
on two publicly available energy datasets with high sampling rates: BLUED and BLOND-50.
