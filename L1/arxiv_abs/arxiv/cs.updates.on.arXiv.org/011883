Bipedal robots adapt to the environment of the modern society due to the similarity of movement to
humans, and therefore they are a good partner for humans. However, maintaining the stability of
these robots during walking/running motion is a challenging issue that, despite the development
of new technologies and the advancement of knowledge, does not yet have a satisfactory solution.
In most of the proposed methods by researchers, to maintain the stability of walking bipedal robots,
it has been tried to ensure the momentary stability of motion by limiting the motion to multiple constraints.
Although these methods have good performance in sustaining stability, they leave the robot away
from the natural movement of humans, with low efficiency and high energy consumption. Hence, many
researchers have turned to the walking techniques that follow a certain motion limit cycle, in which
we can consider the overall stability rather than momentary. In this paper, a method is proposed
to maintain the stability of the limit cycle against disturbance. For this purpose, the dynamical
model of the biped robot is extracted in the space of total momentum variables and, according to the
desired step length and speed, the motion limit cycle is designed. Subsequently, a motion stabilizer
is proposed based on the idea of length shift, which is a natural human strategy for sustaining the
balance in case of impact. The simulations show that this technique has a good performance in maintaining
the stability of motion and has similar responses to human response.
