Heterogeneous networks are large graphs consisting of different types of nodes and edges. They
are an important category of complex networks, but the process of knowledge extraction and relations
discovery from these networks are so complicated and time-consuming. Moreover, the scale of these
networks is steadily increasing. Thus, scalable and accurate methods are required for efficient
knowledge extraction. In this paper, two distributed label propagation algorithms, namely DHLP-1
and DHLP-2, in the heterogeneous networks have been introduced. The Apache Giraph platform is employed
which provides a vertex-centric programming model for designing and running distributed graph
algorithms. Complex heterogeneous networks have many examples in the real world and are widely
used today for modeling complicated processes. Biological networks are one of such networks. As
a case study, we have measured the efficiency of our proposed DHLP-1 and DHLP-2 algorithms on a biological
network consisting of drugs, diseases, and targets. The subject we have studied in this network
is drug repositioning, aimed at saving both time and cost by suggesting new indications for the current
drugs. We compared the proposed algorithms with similar non-distributed versions of them namely
MINProp and Heter-LP. The experiments revealed that the runtime of the algorithms has decreased
in the distributed versions rather than non-distributed ones dramatically. The effectiveness
of our proposed algorithms against other algorithms is supported through statistical analysis
of 10-fold cross-validation as well as experimental analysis.
