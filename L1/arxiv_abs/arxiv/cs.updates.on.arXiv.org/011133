We present a framework for devising discretely energy-stable schemes for general dissipative
systems based on a generalized auxiliary variable. The auxiliary variable, a scalar number, can
be defined in terms of the energy functional by a general class of functions, not limited to the square
root function adopted in previous approaches. The current method has another remarkable property:
the computed values for the generalized auxiliary variable are guaranteed to be positive on the
discrete level, regardless of the time step sizes or the external forces. This property of guaranteed
positivity is not available in previous approaches. A unified procedure for treating the dissipative
governing equations and the generalized auxiliary variable on the discrete level has been presented.
The discrete energy stability of the proposed numerical scheme and the positivity of the computed
auxiliary variable have been proved for general dissipative systems. The current method, termed
gPAV (generalized Positive Auxiliary Variable), requires only the solution of linear algebraic
equations within a time step. With appropriate choice of the operator in the algorithm, the resultant
linear algebraic systems upon discretization involve only constant and time-independent coefficient
matrices, which only need to be computed once and can be pre-computed. Several specific dissipative
systems are studied in relative detail using the gPAV framework. Ample numerical experiments are
presented to demonstrate the performance of the method, and the robustness of the scheme at large
time step sizes.
