Energy efficiency, predictive maintenance and security are today key challenges in High Performance
Computing (HPC). In order to be addressed, accurate monitoring of the power and performance, along
with real-time analysis, are required. However, modern HPC systems still have limited power introspection
capabilities, lacking fine-grain and accurate measurements, as well as dedicated systems for
live edge analysis. With the goal of bridging this gap, we developed DiG (Dwarf in a Giant), an enabler
framework for green computing, predictive maintenance and security of supercomputers. DiG provides
high quality monitoring of power and energy consumption of HPC nodes. It is completely out-of-band
and can be deployed in any hardware architecture/large-scale datacenter at a low cost. It supports
(i) fine-grained power monitoring up to 20us (50x improvement in resolution than state-of-the-art
- SoA); (ii) below 1% (standard deviation) of uncertainty on power measurements, which makes it
suitable for the most rigorous requirements of HPC ranking lists (i.e. Top500); (iii) high-precision
time-stamping (sub-microsecond), which is three order of magnitude better than SoA; (vi) real-time
profiling, useful for debugging energy aware applications; (v) possibility for edge analytics
machine learning algorithms, with no impact on the HPC computing resources. Our experimental results
show it can capture key spectral features of real computing applications and network intrusion
attacks, opening new opportunities for learning algorithms on power management, maintenance
and security of supercomputers.
