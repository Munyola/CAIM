Objectives: To evaluate the performance of an Artificial Intelligence (AI) system (Pegasus, Visulytix
Ltd., UK), at the detection of Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) from images captured by a handheld portable
fundus camera. Methods: A cohort of 6,404 patients (~80% with diabetes mellitus) was screened for
retinal diseases using a handheld portable fundus camera (Pictor Plus, Volk Optical Inc., USA)
at the Mexican Advanced Imaging Laboratory for Ocular Research. The images were graded for DR by
specialists according to the Scottish DR grading scheme. The performance of the AI system was evaluated,
retrospectively, in assessing Referable DR (RDR) and Proliferative DR (PDR) and compared to the
performance on a publicly available desktop camera benchmark dataset. Results: For RDR detection,
Pegasus performed with an 89.4% (95% CI: 88.0-90.7) Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic
(AUROC) curve for the MAILOR cohort, compared to an AUROC of 98.5% (95% CI: 97.8-99.2) on the benchmark
dataset. This difference was statistically significant. Moreover, no statistically significant
difference was found in performance for PDR detection with Pegasus achieving an AUROC of 94.3% (95%
CI: 91.0-96.9) on the MAILOR cohort and 92.2% (95% CI: 89.4-94.8) on the benchmark dataset. Conclusions:
Pegasus showed good transferability for the detection of PDR from a curated desktop fundus camera
dataset to real-world clinical practice with a handheld portable fundus camera. However, there
was a substantial, and statistically significant, decrease in the diagnostic performance for
RDR when using the handheld device.
