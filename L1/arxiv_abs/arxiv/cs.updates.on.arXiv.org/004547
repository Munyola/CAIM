We study the equilibrium computation problem for two classical resource allocation games: atomic
splittable congestion games and multimarket Cournot oligopolies. For atomic splittable congestion
games with singleton strategies and player-specific affine cost functions, we devise the first
polynomial time algorithm computing a pure Nash equilibrium. Our algorithm is combinatorial and
computes the exact equilibrium assuming rational input. The idea is to compute an equilibrium for
an associated integrally-splittable singleton congestion game in which the players can only split
their demands in integral multiples of a common packet size. While integral games have been considered
in the literature before, no polynomial time algorithm computing an equilibrium was known. Also
for this class, we devise the first polynomial time algorithm and use it as a building block for our
main algorithm. We then develop a polynomial time computable transformation mapping a multimarket
Cournot competition game with firm-specific affine price functions and quadratic costs to an associated
atomic splittable congestion game as described above. The transformation preserves equilibria
in either games and, thus, leads -- via our first algorithm -- to a polynomial time algorithm computing
Cournot equilibria. Finally, our analysis for integrally-splittable games implies new bounds
on the difference between real and integral Cournot equilibria. The bounds can be seen as a generalization
of the recent bounds for single market oligopolies obtained by Todd [2016].
