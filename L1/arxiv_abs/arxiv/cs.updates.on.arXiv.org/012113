The notion of socioeconomic status (SES) of a person or family reflects the corresponding entity's
social and economic rank in society. Such information may help applications like bank loaning decisions
and provide measurable inputs for related studies like social stratification, social welfare
and business planning. Traditionally, estimating SES for a large population is performed by national
statistical institutes through a large number of household interviews, which is highly expensive
and time-consuming. Recently researchers try to estimate SES from data sources like mobile phone
call records and online social network platforms, which is much cheaper and faster. Instead of relying
on these data about users' cyberspace behaviors, various alternative data sources on real-world
users' behavior such as mobility may offer new insights for SES estimation. In this paper, we leverage
Smart Card Data (SCD) for public transport systems which records the temporal and spatial mobility
behavior of a large population of users. More specifically, we develop S2S, a deep learning based
approach for estimating people's SES based on their SCD. Essentially, S2S models two types of SES-related
features, namely the temporal-sequential feature and general statistical feature, and leverages
deep learning for SES estimation. We evaluate our approach in an actual dataset, Shanghai SCD, which
involves millions of users. The proposed model clearly outperforms several state-of-art methods
in terms of various evaluation metrics.
