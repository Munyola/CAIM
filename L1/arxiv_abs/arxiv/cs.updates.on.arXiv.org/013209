We develop a unified and easy to use framework to study robust fully discrete numerical methods for
nonlinear degenerate diffusion equations $$ \partial_t u-\mathfrak{L}^{\sigma,\mu}[\varphi(u)]=f
\quad\quad\text{in}\quad\quad \mathbb{R}^N\times(0,T), $$ where $\mathfrak{L}^{\sigma,\mu}$
is a general symmetric diffusion operator of L\'evy type and $\varphi$ is merely continuous and
non-decreasing. We then use this theory to prove convergence for many different numerical schemes.
In the nonlocal case most of the results are completely new. Our theory covers strongly degenerate
Stefan problems, the full range of porous medium equations, and for the first time for nonlocal problems,
also fast diffusion equations. Examples of diffusion operators $\mathfrak{L}^{\sigma,\mu}$
are the (fractional) Laplacians $\Delta$ and $-(-\Delta)^{\frac\alpha2}$ for $\alpha\in(0,2)$,
discrete operators, and combinations. The observation that monotone finite difference operators
are nonlocal L\'evy operators, allows us to give a unified and compact {\em nonlocal} theory for
both local and nonlocal, linear and nonlinear diffusion equations. The theory includes stability,
compactness, and convergence of the methods under minimal assumptions -- including assumptions
that lead to very irregular solutions. As a byproduct, we prove the new and general existence result
announced in \cite{DTEnJa17b}. We also present some numerical tests, but extensive testing is
deferred to the companion paper \cite{DTEnJa18b} along with a more detailed discussion of the numerical
methods included in our theory.
