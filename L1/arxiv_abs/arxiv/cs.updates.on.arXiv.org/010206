Today's customers are characterized by individual requirements that lead the manufacturing industry
to increased product variety and volume reduction. Manufacturing systems and more specifically
assembly systems (ASs) should allow quick adaptation of manufacturing assets so as to respond to
the evolving market requirements that lead to mass customization. Meanwhile, the manufacturing
era is changing due to the fourth industrial revolution, i.e., Industry 4.0, that will change the
traditional manufacturing environment to an IoT-based one. In this context, this paper introduces
the concept of cyber-physical microservice in the Manufacturing and the ASs domain and presents
the Cyber-Physical microservice and IoT-based (CPuS-IoT) framework. The CPuS-IoT framework
exploits the benefits of the microservice architectural style and the IoT technologies, but also
utilizes the existing in this domain huge investment based on traditional technologies, to support
the life cycle of evolvable ASs in the age of Industry 4.0. It provides a solid basis to capture domain
knowledge that is used by a model-driven engineering (MDE) approach to semi-automate the development,
evolution and operation of ASs, as well as, to establish a common vocabulary for assembly system
experts and IoT ones. The CPuS-IoT approach and framework effectively combines MDE with IoT and
the microservice architectural paradigm. A case study for the assembly of an everyday life product
is adopted to demonstrate the approach even to non-experts of this domain.
