Head pose estimation plays a vital role in various applications, e.g., driverassistance systems,
human-computer interaction, virtual reality technology, and so on. We propose a novel geometry
based algorithm for accurately estimating the head pose from a single 2D face image at a very low computational
cost. Specifically, the rectangular coordinates of only four non-coplanar feature points from
a predefined 3D facial model as well as the corresponding ones automatically/ manually extracted
from a 2D face image are first normalized to exclude the effect of external factors (i.e., scale factor
and translation parameters). Then, the four normalized 3D feature points are represented in spherical
coordinates with reference to the uniquely determined sphere by themselves. Due to the spherical
parameterization, the coordinates of feature points can then be morphed along all the three directions
in the rectangular coordinates effectively. Finally, the rotation matrix indicating the head
pose is obtained by minimizing the Euclidean distance between the normalized 2D feature points
and the 2D re-projections of morphed 3D feature points. Comprehensive experimental results over
two popular databases, i.e., Pointing'04 and Biwi Kinect, demonstrate that the proposed algorithm
can estimate head poses with higher accuracy and lower run time than state-of-the-art geometry
based methods. Even compared with start-of-the-art learning based methods or geometry based methods
with additional depth information, our algorithm still produces comparable performance.
