The emergence of e-commerce and e-voting platforms has resulted in the rise in the volume of sensitive
information over the Internet. This has resulted in an increased demand for secure and private means
of information computation. Towards this, the Yao's Millionaires' problem, i.e., to determine
the richer among two millionaires' securely, finds an application. In this work, we present a new
solution to the Yao's Millionaires' problem namely, Privacy Preserving Comparison (PPC). We show
that PPC achieves this comparison in constant time as well as in one execution. PPC uses semi-honest
third parties for the comparison who do not learn any information about the values. Further, we show
that PPC is collusion-resistance. To demonstrate the significance of PPC, we present a secure,
approximate single-minded combinatorial auction, which we call TPACAS, i.e., Truthful, Privacy-preserving
Approximate Combinatorial Auction for Single-minded bidders. We show that TPACAS, unlike previous
works, preserves the following privacies relevant to an auction: agent privacy, the identities
of the losing bidders must not be revealed to any other agent except the auctioneer (AU), bid privacy,
the bid values must be hidden from the other agents as well as the AU and bid-topology privacy, the
items for which the agents are bidding must be hidden from the other agents as well as the AU. We demonstrate
the practicality of TPACAS through simulations. Lastly, we also look at TPACAS' implementation
over a publicly distributed ledger, such as the Ethereum blockchain.
