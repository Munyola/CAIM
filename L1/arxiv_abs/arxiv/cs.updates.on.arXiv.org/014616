Multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) have been successfully applied to a number of
constrained optimization problems. Many of them adopt mutation and crossover operators from differential
evolution. However, these operators do not explicitly utilise features of fitness landscapes.
To improve the performance of algorithms, this paper aims at designing a search operator adapting
to fitness landscapes. Through an observation, we find that principle component analysis (PCA)
can be used to characterise fitness landscapes. Based on this finding, a new search operator, called
PCA-projection, is proposed. In order to verify the effectiveness of PCA-projection, we design
two algorithms enhanced with PCA-projection for solving constrained optimization problems,
called PMODE and HECO-PDE, respectively. Experiments have been conducted on the IEEE CEC 2017 competition
benchmark suite in constrained optimisation. PMODE and HECO-PDE are compared with the algorithms
from the IEEE CEC 2018 competition and another recent MOEA for constrained optimisation. Experimental
results show that an algorithm enhanced with PCA-projection performs better than its corresponding
opponent without this operator. Furthermore, HECO-PDE is ranked first on all dimensions according
to the competition rules. This study reveals that decomposition-based MOEAs, such as HECO-PDE,
are competitive with best single-objective and multiobjective evolutionary algorithms for constrained
optimisation, but MOEAs based on non-dominance, such as PMODE, may not.
