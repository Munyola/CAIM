Wireless sensor networks consist of a large number of distributed sensor nodes so that potential
risks are becoming more and more unpredictable. The new entrants pose the potential risks when they
move into the secure zone. To build a door wall that provides safe and secured for the system, many
recent research works applied the initial authentication process. However, the majority of the
previous articles only focused on the Central Authority (CA) since this leads to an increase in the
computation cost and energy consumption for the specific cases on the Internet of Things (IoT).
Hence, in this article, we will lessen the importance of these third parties through proposing an
enhanced authentication mechanism that includes key management and evaluation based on the past
interactions to assist the objects joining a secured area without any nearby CA. We refer to a mobility
dataset from CRAWDAD collected at the University Politehnica of Bucharest and rebuild into a new
random dataset larger than the old one. The new one is an input for a simulated authenticating algorithm
to observe the communication cost and resource usage of devices. Our proposal helps the authenticating
flexible, being strict with unknown devices into the secured zone. The threshold of maximum friends
can modify based on the optimization of the symmetric-key algorithm to diminish communication
costs (our experimental results compare to previous schemes less than 2000 bits) and raise flexibility
in resource-constrained environments.
