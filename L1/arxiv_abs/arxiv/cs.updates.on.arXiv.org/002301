Surgical debridement is the process of removing dead or damaged tissue to allow the remaining parts
to heal. Automating this procedure could reduce surgical fatigue and facilitate teleoperation,
but doing so is challenging for Robotic Surgical Assistants (RSAs) such as the da Vinci Research
Kit (dVRK) due to inherent non-linearities in cable-driven systems. Consequently, we propose
and evaluate a two-phase calibration process. In Phase I, the robot performs a set of open-loop trajectories
to obtain abundant, cheap but coarse data of camera pixels and internal robot joint values, and learns
a nonlinear transformation. In Phase II, the robot uses Phase I to move systematically to target
points in a printed array. Each time, a human operator manually adjusts the end-effector position
by direct contact (not through teleoperation), resulting in a small, high-quality dataset. Experiments
suggest that without calibration, position errors are 4.55mm. Phase I alone can reduce average
error to 2.14mm, but the combination of Phase I and Phase II reduces average error to 1.08mm. We apply
this combination to an approximation of debridement with randomly oriented raisins and pumpkin
seeds. Using an endoscopic stereo camera with standard edge detection, experiments with 120 trials
achieved success rates of 91.7% to 99.2%, slightly exceeding prior results (89.4%) and more than
2.1x faster, decreasing the time per fragment from 15.8 seconds to 7.3 seconds. Source code, data,
