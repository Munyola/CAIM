Planning a path for a nonholonomic robot is a challenging topic in motion planning and it becomes
more difficult when the desired path contains narrow passages. This kind of scenario can arise,
for instance, when quadcopters search a collapsed building after a natural disaster. Choosing
the quadcopter as the target platform, this paper proposes the Kinodynamic Aggressive Trajectory
(KAT) motion planning algorithm, which aims to compute aggressive trajectories for narrow passages
under nonholonomic constraints. This type of maneuvers is necessary because the dynamics of quadcopters
entail that some narrow passages can only be traversed at high speed. To find the best path, the KAT
uses RRT to determine a holonomic path first and then adjusts it to satisfy the nonholonomic constraints.
The innovations in this process are: 1) The states of the robot are divided into near-holonomic set
and non-holonomic set, which makes the constraints local rather than global; 2) For each of the most
confined waypoints in the path, KAT plans forward and backward simultaneously around the waypoint
to find a feasible local trajectory traversing the narrow passage. Our approach thus transforms
a globally-constrained planning problem into a problem with local constraints, and as a result,
the computation becomes tractable. We evaluate KAT by applying it to a quadcopter flying through
two inclined holes that require aggressive maneuvers in a simulated environment. The average computation
time to successfully find a solution for passing two 50 degree inclined holes is around 32 seconds.
