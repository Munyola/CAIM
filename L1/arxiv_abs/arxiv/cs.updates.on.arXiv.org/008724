Morphological analysis is an important first step in downstream tasks like machine translation
and dependency parsing of morphologically rich languages (MRLs) such as those belonging to Indo-Aryan
and Dravidian families. However, the ambiguities introduced by the recombination of morphemes
constructing several possible inflections for a word makes the prediction of syntactic traits
a notoriously complicated task for MRLs. We propose a character-level neural morphological analyzer,
the Multi Task Deep Morphological analyzer (MT-DMA), based on multitask learning of word-level
tag markers for Hindi. In order to show the portability of our system to other related languages,
we present results on Urdu too. MT-DMA predicts the complete set of morphological tags for words
of Indo-Aryan languages: Parts-of-speech (POS), Gender (G), Number (N), Person (P), Case (C),
Tense-Aspect-Modality (TAM) marker as well as the Lemma (L) by jointly learning all these in a single
end-to-end framework. We show the effectiveness of training of such deep neural networks by the
simultaneous optimization of multiple loss functions and sharing of initial parameters for context-aware
morphological analysis. Our model outperforms the state-of-art analyzers for Hindi and Urdu.
Exploring the use of a set of character-level features in phonological space optimized for each
tag through a multi-objective genetic algorithm, coupled with effective training strategies,
our model establishes a new state-of-the-art accuracy score upon all seven of the tasks for both
the languages. MT-DMA is publicly accessible to be used at this http URL
