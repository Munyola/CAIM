This paper is concerned with a subspace guarding game, which is a reach-avoid game, in high-dimensional
space which consists of a play subspace and a target subspace divided by a hyperplane. In this differential
game, two faster defenders cooperate to protect the target subspace by capturing an attacker which
strives to enter into the target subspace from the play subspace without being captured. A complete,
closed-form solution is provided from the perspectives of kind and degree. Contributions of the
work include the use of the attack subspace (AS) method to construct the barrier, by which the game
winner can be perfectly predicted before the game starts. In addition to this inclusion, with the
priori information about the game result, two critical payoff functions are designed for two winning
subspaces obtained from the barrier. Then, the optimal strategy for each player is reformulated
as a saddle-point equilibrium, and the expression of the saddle-point equilibrium is presented
in detail. Finally, we apply these theoretical results to a half-space guarding game in three-dimensional
space. More realistically, since the whole achieved developments are analytical, they require
a little memory without computational burden and allow for real-time updates, beyond the capacity
of traditional Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs method. It is worth noting that this is the first time in
the current work to consider the target guarding games for arbitrary high-dimensional space, and
simultaneously in a fully analytical form.
