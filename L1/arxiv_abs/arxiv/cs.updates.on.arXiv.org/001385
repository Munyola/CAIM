Graphical Models use the intuitive and well-studied methods of graph theory to implicitly represent
dependencies between variables in large systems and model the global behaviour of a complex system
by specifying only local factors. This paper studies the form and complexity of inference in graphical
models using the abstraction offered by algebraic structures. In particular, we broadly formalize
inference problems in graphical models by viewing them as a sequence of commutative semigroups
and study their computational complexity. This is in part achieved by organizing the problems in
an inference hierarchy, such that problems in the same class of the hierarchy also belong to the same
complexity class. When the underlying structure of an inference problem is a commutative semiring
-- i.e., a combination of two commutative semigroups with the distributive law -- a message passing
procedure can leverage this additional structure to perform inference. The resulting procedure,
known as belief propagation allows exact inference for tree structures and efficient approximations
for general graphs. We prove that for general graphs, exact inference in any commutative semiring
is NP-hard under randomized reduction. Moreover, we show that direct application of distributive
law for exact inference on tree structures is limited to inference problems with two commutative
semigroups. We then study a more involved form of message passing, called survey propagation, from
an algebraic point of view and express its updates using a combination of two commutative semirings.
