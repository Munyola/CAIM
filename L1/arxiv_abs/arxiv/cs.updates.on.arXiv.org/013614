We propose a method to solve online mixed-integer optimization (MIO) problems at very high speed
using machine learning. By exploiting the repetitive nature of online optimization, we are able
to greatly speedup the solution time. Our approach encodes the optimal solution into a small amount
of information denoted as strategy using the Voice of Optimization framework proposed in [BS18].
In this way the core part of the optimization algorithm becomes a multiclass classification problem
which can be solved very quickly. In this work we extend that framework to real-time and high-speed
applications focusing on parametric mixed-integer quadratic optimization (MIQO). We propose
an extremely fast online optimization algorithm consisting of a feedforward neural network (NN)
evaluation and a linear system solution where the matrix has already been factorized. Therefore,
this online approach does not require any solver nor iterative algorithm. We show the speed of the
proposed method both in terms of total computations required and measured execution time. We estimate
the number of floating point operations (flops) required to completely recover the optimal solution
as a function of the problem dimensions. Compared to state-of-the-art MIO routines, the online
running time of our method is very predictable and can be lower than a single matrix factorization
time. We benchmark our method against the state-of-the-art solver Gurobi obtaining from two to
three orders of magnitude speedups on benchmarks with real-world data.
