We study the spammablility of ranking functions on the web. Although graph-theoretic ranking functions,
such as Hubs and Authorities and PageRank exist, there is no graph theoretic notion of how spammable
such functions are. We introduce a very general cost model that only depends on the observation that
changing the links of a page that you own is free, whereas changing the links on pages owned by others
requires effort or money. We define spammability to be the ratio between the amount of benefit one
receives for one's spamming efforts and the amount of effort/money one must spend to spam. The more
effort/money it takes to get highly ranked, the less spammable the function. Our model helps explain
why both hubs and authorities and standard PageRank are very easy to spam. Although standard PageRank
is easy to spam, we show that there exist spam-resistant PageRanks. Specifically, we propose a ranking
method, Min-k-PPR, that is the component-wise min of a set of personalized PageRanks centered on
k trusted sites. Our main results are that Min-k-PPR is, itself, a type of PageRank and that it is expensive
to spam. We elucidate a surprisingly elegant algebra for PageRank. We define the space of all possible
PageRanks and show that this space is closed under some operations. Most notably, we show that PageRanks
are closed under (normalized) component-wise min, which establishes that (normalized) Min-k-PPRis
a PageRank. This algebraic structure is also key to demonstrating the spam resistance of Min-k-PPR.
