Massive integration of plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) into a power grid potentially gives rise
to its operating fluctuation, which is not easily controlled due to the unavailability of the PEVs'
power demand profiles prior to their random connections to the grid. The present paper considers
the problem of joint coordination of PEV charging and grid power control to minimize both PEV charging
cost and energy generation cost in meeting both residential and PEVs' power demands and suppressing
the potential impact of PEV integration. An on-off PEV charging strategy, under which individual
PEVs either charge at a maximal power in on-charging-mode or do not charge at all in off-charging-mode
at each of a sequence of time slots, is adopted to exploit its simple online implementation. Based
on a recently developed model predictive control, which is free from assumptions about the probability
distribution of PEV arrivals, knowledge of PEVs' future demand, or the unlimited charging capacity
of PEVs, a mixed integer nonlinear programming problem (MINP) in binary variables of the PEV charging
strategy and continuous variables of the grid voltages is proposed at each time for implementing
an online algorithm. Due to the large dimension of the continuous voltage variables and the binary
on-off decision variables, this MINP is a large scale optimization problem, which is very computationally
challenging. A major contribution of the paper is to develop a new solver for this MINP, which is practical
for its online computation. Its capability for achieving an optimal solution is shown by numerical
examples.
