Activity sensing and recognition have been demonstrated to be critical in health care and smart
home applications. Comparing to traditional methods such as using accelerometers or gyroscopes
for activity recognition, acoustic-based methods can collect rich information of human activities
together with the activity context, and therefore are more suitable for recognizing high-level
compound activities. However, audio-based activity recognition in practice always suffers from
the tedious and time-consuming process of collecting ground truth audio data from individual users.
In this paper, we proposed a new mechanism of audio-based activity recognition that is entirely
free from user training data by usage of millions of embedding features from general YouTube video
sound clips. Based on combination of oversampling and deep learning approaches, our scheme does
not require further feature extraction or outliers filtering for implementation. We developed
our scheme for recognition of 15 common home-related activities and evaluated its performance
under dedicated scenarios and in-the-wild scripted scenarios. In the dedicated recording test,
our scheme yielded 81.1% overall accuracy and 80.0% overall F-score for all 15 activities. In the
in-the-wild scripted tests, we obtained an averaged top-1 classification accuracy of 64.9% and
an averaged top-3 classification accuracy of 80.6% for 4 subjects in actual home environment. Several
design considerations including association between dataset labels and target activities, effects
of segmentation size and privacy concerns were also discussed in the paper.
