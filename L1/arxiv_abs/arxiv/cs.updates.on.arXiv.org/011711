High-utility sequential pattern mining is an emerging topic in the field of Knowledge Discovery
in Databases. It consists of discovering subsequences having a high utility (importance) in sequences,
referred to as high-utility sequential patterns (HUSPs). HUSPs can be applied to many real-life
applications, such as market basket analysis, E-commerce recommendation, click-stream analysis
and scenic route planning. For example, in economics and targeted marketing, understanding economic
behavior of consumers is quite challenging, such as finding credible and reliable information
on product profitability. Several algorithms have been proposed to address this problem by efficiently
mining utility-based useful sequential patterns. Nevertheless, the performance of these algorithms
can be unsatisfying in terms of runtime and memory usage due to the combinatorial explosion of the
search space for low utility threshold and large databases. Hence, this paper proposes a more efficient
algorithm for the task of high-utility sequential pattern mining, called HUSP-ULL. It utilizes
a lexicographic sequence (LS)-tree and a utility-linked (UL)-list structure to fast discover
HUSPs. Furthermore, two pruning strategies are introduced in HUSP-ULL to obtain tight upper-bounds
on the utility of candidate sequences, and reduce the search space by pruning unpromising candidates
early. Substantial experiments both on real-life and synthetic datasets show that the proposed
algorithm can effectively and efficiently discover the complete set of HUSPs and outperforms the
state-of-the-art algorithms.
