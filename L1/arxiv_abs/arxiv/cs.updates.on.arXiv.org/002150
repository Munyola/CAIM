We present FLASH ({\bf F}ast {\bf L}SH {\bf A}lgorithm for {\bf S}imilarity search accelerated
with {\bf H}PC (High-Performance Computing)), a similarity search system for ultra-high dimensional
datasets on a single machine, which does not require similarity computation. Our system is an auspicious
illustration of the power of randomized algorithms carefully tailored for high-performance computing
platforms. We leverage LSH style randomized indexing procedure and combine it with several principled
techniques, such as reservoir sampling, recent advances in one-pass minwise hashing, and count
based estimations. The combination, while retaining sound theoretical guarantees, reduces the
computational as well as parallelization overhead of our proposal. We provide CPU and hybrid CPU-GPU
implementations of FLASH for replicability of our results https://github.com/RUSH-LAB/Flash.
We evaluate FLASH on several real high dimensional datasets coming from different domains including
text, malicious URL, click-through prediction, social networks, etc. Our experiments shed new
light on the difficulties associated with datasets having several millions of dimensions. Current
state-of-the-art implementations either fail on the presented scale or are orders of magnitude
slower than our system. FLASH is capable of computing an approximate k-NN graph, from scratch, over
full webspam dataset (1.3 billion nonzeros) in less than 10 seconds. Computing full k-NN graph in
less than 10 seconds on webspam dataset, using brute-force ($n^2D$), will require at least 20 TFLOPS.
We hope that FLASH gets adopted in practice.
