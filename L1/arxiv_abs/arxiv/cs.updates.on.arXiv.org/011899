Visual information plays a critical role in human decision-making process. While recent developments
on visually-aware recommender systems have taken the product image into account, none of them has
considered the aesthetic aspect. We argue that the aesthetic factor is very important in modeling
and predicting users' preferences, especially for some fashion-related domains like clothing
and jewelry. This work addresses the need of modeling aesthetic information in visually-aware
recommender systems. Technically speaking, we make three key contributions in leveraging deep
aesthetic features: (1) To describe the aesthetics of products, we introduce the aesthetic features
extracted from product images by a deep aesthetic network. We incorporate these features into recommender
system to model users' preferences in the aesthetic aspect. (2) Since in clothing recommendation,
time is very important for users to make decision, we design a new tensor decomposition model for
implicit feedback data. The aesthetic features are then injected to the basic tensor model to capture
the temporal dynamics of aesthetic preferences (e.g., seasonal patterns). (3) We also use the aesthetic
features to optimize the learning strategy on implicit feedback data. We enrich the pairwise training
samples by considering the similarity among items in the visual space and graph space; the key idea
is that a user may likely have similar perception on similar items. We perform extensive experiments
on several real-world datasets and demonstrate the usefulness of aesthetic features and the effectiveness
of our proposed methods.
