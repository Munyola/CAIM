To alleviate the cost of collecting and annotating large-scale point cloud datasets, we propose
an unsupervised learning approach to learn features from unlabeled point cloud "3D object" dataset
by using part contrasting and object clustering with deep graph neural networks (GNNs). In the contrast
learning step, all the samples in the 3D object dataset are cut into two parts and put into a "part"
dataset. Then a contrast learning GNN (ContrastNet) is trained to verify whether two randomly sampled
parts from the part dataset belong to the same object. In the cluster learning step, the trained ContrastNet
is applied to all the samples in the original 3D object dataset to extract features, which are used
to group the samples into clusters. Then another GNN for clustering learning (ClusterNet) is trained
to predict the cluster ID of all the training samples. The contrasting learning forces the ContrastNet
to learn high-level semantic features of objects but probably ignores low-level features, while
the ClusterNet improves the quality of learned features by being trained to discover objects that
probably belong to the same semantic categories by the use of cluster IDs. We have conducted extensive
experiments to evaluate the proposed framework on point cloud classification tasks. The proposed
unsupervised learning approach obtained comparable performance to the state-of-the-art unsupervised
learning methods that used much more complicated network structures. The code of this work is publicly
