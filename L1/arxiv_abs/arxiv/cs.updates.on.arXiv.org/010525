Despite extensive use in related domains, Virtual Reality (VR) for generalised anxiety disorder
(GAD) has received little previous attention. We report upon a VR environment created for the Oculus
Rift and Unreal Engine 4 (UE4) to investigate the potential of a VR simulation to be used as an anxiety
management tool. We introduce the broad topic of GAD and related publications on the application
of VR to this, and similar, mental health conditions. We then describe the development of a real time
simulation tool, based upon the passive VR experience of a tranquil, rural alpine scene experienced
from a seated position with head tracking. Evaluation focused upon qualitative feedback on the
application. Testing was carried out over the period of two weeks on a sample group of eleven students
studying at Nottingham Trent University. All participants were asked to complete the Depression,
Anxiety and Stress Scale - 21 Items (DASS21) at the beginning and at the end of the study order to assess
their profile, and hence suitability to comment upon the software. Qualitative feedback was very
encouraging, with all participants reporting that they believed the experience helped and that
they would consider utilising it if it was available. Additionally, a psychologist was asked to
test the application to provide a specialist opinion on whether it would be appropriate for use as
an anxiety management tool. The results highlight several areas for improvement but are positive
overall in terms of its potential as a therapeutic tool.
