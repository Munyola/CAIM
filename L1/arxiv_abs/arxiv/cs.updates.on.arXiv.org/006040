Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), referenced as drones, have advanced to consumer adoption for
hobby and business use. Drone applications, such as infrastructure technology, security mechanisms,
and resource delivery, are just the starting point. More complex tasks are possible through the
use of UAV swarms. These tasks increase the potential impacts that drones will have on smart cities,
modern cities which have fully adopted technology in order to enhance daily operations as well as
the welfare of it's citizens. Smart cities not only consist of static mesh networks of sensors, but
can contain dynamic aspects as well including both ground and air based autonomous vehicles. Networked
computational devices require paramount security to ensure the safety of a city. To accomplish
such high levels of security, services rely on secure-by-design protocols, impervious to security
threats. Given the large number of sensors, autonomous vehicles, and other advancements, smart
cities necessitates this level of security. The SHARK protocol (Secure, Heterogeneous, Autonomous,
and Rotational Knowledge for Swarms) ensures this kind of security by allowing for new applications
for UAV swarm technology. Enabling drones to circle a target without a centralized control or selecting
lead agents, the SHARKS protocol performs organized movement among agents without creating a central
point for attackers to target. Through comparisons on the stability of the protocol in different
settings, experiments demonstrate the efficiency and capacity of the SHARKS protocol.
