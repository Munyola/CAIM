Although public clouds still occupy the largest portion of the total cloud infrastructure, private
clouds are attracting increasing interest from both industry and academia because of their better
security and privacy control. According to the existing studies, the high upfront cost is among
the most critical challenges associated with private clouds. To reduce cost and improve performance,
virtual machine placement (VMP) methods have been extensively investigated for a number of years;
however, few of these methods have focused on private clouds. In this paper, we propose a heterogeneous
and multidimensional clairvoyant dynamic bin packing (CDBP) model, in which the scheduler can
conduct more efficient VMP processes with additional information of the arrival time and duration
of virtual machines to reduce the scale of the datacenter and thereby decrease the upfront cost of
private clouds. In addition, a novel branch-and-bound algorithm with a divide-and-conquer strategy
(DCBB) is proposed to effectively and efficiently handle the derived problem. Extensive experiments
are conducted on both real-world and synthetic workloads to evaluate the accuracy and efficiency
of the algorithms. The experimental results demonstrate that DCBB delivers near-optimal solutions
with a much faster convergence rate than those of the other search-based algorithms that we evaluated.
In particular, DCBB yields the optimal solution on the real-world workload with an order of magnitude
less execution time than that required by the original branch-and-bound (BB) algorithm.
