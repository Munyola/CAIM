The Knowledge graph (KG) uses the triples to describe the facts in the real world. It has been widely
used in intelligent analysis and understanding of big data. In constructing a KG, especially in
the process of automation building, some noises and errors are inevitably introduced or much knowledges
is missed. However, learning tasks based on the KG and its underlying applications both assume that
the knowledge in the KG is completely correct and inevitably bring about potential errors. Therefore,
in this paper, we establish a unified knowledge graph triple trustworthiness measurement framework
to calculate the confidence values for the triples that quantify its semantic correctness and the
true degree of the facts expressed. It can be used not only to detect and eliminate errors in the KG
but also to identify new triples to improve the KG. The framework is a crisscrossing neural network
structure. It synthesizes the internal semantic information in the triples and the global inference
information of the KG to achieve the trustworthiness measurement and fusion in the three levels
of entity-level, relationship-level, and KG-global-level. We conducted experiments on the common
dataset FB15K (from Freebase) and analyzed the validity of the model's output confidence values.
We also tested the framework in the knowledge graph error detection or completion tasks. The experimental
results showed that compared with other models, our model achieved significant and consistent
improvements on the above tasks, further confirming the capabilities of our model.
