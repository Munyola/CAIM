Cloud computing has grown to become a popular distributed computing service offered by commercial
providers. More recently, Edge and Fog computing resources have emerged on the wide-area network
as part of Internet of Things (IoT) deployments. These three resource abstraction layers are complementary,
and provide distinctive benefits. Scheduling applications on clouds has been an active area of
research, with workflow and dataflow models serving as a flexible abstraction to specify applications
for execution. However, the application programming and scheduling models for edge and fog are
still maturing, and can benefit from learnings on cloud resources. At the same time, there is also
value in using these resources cohesively for application execution. In this article, we present
a taxonomy of concepts essential for specifying and solving the problem of scheduling applications
on edge, for and cloud computing resources. We first characterize the resource capabilities and
limitations of these infrastructure, and design a taxonomy of application models, Quality of Service
(QoS) constraints and goals, and scheduling techniques, based on a literature review. We also tabulate
key research prototypes and papers using this taxonomy. This survey benefits developers and researchers
on these distributed resources in designing and categorizing their applications, selecting the
relevant computing abstraction(s), and developing or selecting the appropriate scheduling algorithm.
It also highlights gaps in literature where open problems remain.
