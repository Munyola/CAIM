For an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) enabled network we investigate the energy-efficiency (EE)
of joint caching and cooperative communication (Fog-RAN). Since UAVs are battery- and cache-limited,
placing the popular contents in the caches and managing the energy expenditure of UAVs become crucial.
We formulate the energy consumption of UAVs as an aggregate of communication/caching, hovering,
and vertical displacement energies, and then devise an optimization problem for optimally assigning
contents to caches and choosing the height of UAVs. Adopting tools from stochastic geometry, we
also derive the EE in a numerically tractable form as a function of density, the radius of the cooperation
zone, cache size, main communication/physical characteristics of UAVs, and influential environmental
parameters. We develop two content placement strategies with low computational complexity. The
conducted numerical results demonstrate that by adopting these algorithms one is able to improve
EE by up to 800% compared to common content placement schemes, e.g., the least-frequently used (LRU),
the most-popular, and Hit-rate. Furthermore, while under LRU and Hit-rate schemes there is no benefit
in vertically displacing UAVs, under our algorithms one is able to increase EE by at most 600%. Importantly,
via our algorithms one can increase the size of cooperation zone in order to steadily increase EE,
which is not the cases of LRU, the most-popular, and Hit-rate schemes. We finally observe that there
is optimal values for density and cache-size of UAVs, granting maximum EE.
