OpenCL is an attractive model for heterogeneous high-performance computing systems, with wide
support from hardware vendors and significant performance portability. To support efficient
scheduling on HPC systems it is necessary to perform accurate performance predictions for OpenCL
workloads on varied compute devices, which is challeng- ing due to diverse computation, communication
and memory access characteristics which result in varying performance between devices. The Architecture
Independent Workload Characterization (AIWC) tool can be used to characterize OpenCL kernels
according to a set of architecture-independent features. This work presents a methodology where
AIWC features are used to form a model capable of predicting accelerator execution times. We used
this methodology to predict execution times for a set of 37 computational kernels running on 15 different
devices representing a broad range of CPU, GPU and MIC architectures. The predictions are highly
accurate, differing from the measured experimental run-times by an average of only 1.2%, and correspond
to actual execution time mispredictions of 9 {\mu}s to 1 sec according to problem size. A previously
unencountered code can be instrumented once and the AIWC metrics embedded in the kernel, to allow
performance prediction across the full range of modelled devices. The results suggest that this
methodology supports correct selection of the most appropriate device for a previously unencountered
code, which is highly relevant to the HPC scheduling setting.
