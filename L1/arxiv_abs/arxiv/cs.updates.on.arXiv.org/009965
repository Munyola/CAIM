We propose a new framework for constructing polar codes (i.e., selecting the frozen bit positions)
for arbitrary channels, and tailored to a given decoding algorithm, rather than based on the (not
necessarily optimal) assumption of successive cancellation (SC) decoding. The proposed framework
is based on the Genetic Algorithm (GenAlg), where populations (i.e., collections) of information
sets evolve successively via evolutionary transformations based on their individual error-rate
performance. These populations converge towards an information set that fits both the decoding
behavior and the defined channel. Using our proposed algorithm over the additive white Gaussian
noise (AWGN) channel, we construct a polar code of length 2048 with code rate 0.5, without the CRC-aid,
tailored to plain successive cancellation list (SCL) decoding, achieving the same error-rate
performance as the CRC-aided SCL decoding, and leading to a coding gain of 1 dB at BER of $10^{-6}$.
Further, a belief propagation (BP)-tailored construction approaches the SCL error-rate performance
without any modifications in the decoding algorithm itself. The performance gains can be attributed
to the significant reduction in the total number of low-weight codewords. To demonstrate the flexibility,
coding gains for the Rayleigh channel are shown under SCL and BP decoding. Besides improvements
in error-rate performance, we show that, when required, the GenAlg can be also set up to reduce the
decoding complexity, e.g., the SCL list size or the number of BP iterations can be reduced, while
maintaining the same error-rate performance.
