Multi-scale approach has been used for blind image / video deblurring problems to yield excellent
performance for both conventional and recent deep-learning-based state-of-the-art methods.
Bicubic down-sampling is a typical choice for multi-scale approach to reduce spatial dimension
after filtering with a fixed kernel. However, this fixed kernel may be sub-optimal since it may destroy
important information for reliable deblurring such as strong edges. We propose convolutional
neural network (CNN)-based down-scale methods for multi-scale deep-learning-based non-uniform
single image deblurring. We argue that our CNN-based down-scaling effectively reduces the spatial
dimension of the original image, while learned kernels with multiple channels may well-preserve
necessary details for deblurring tasks. For each scale, we adopt to use RCAN (Residual Channel Attention
Networks) as a backbone network to further improve performance. Our proposed method yielded state-of-the-art
performance on GoPro dataset by large margin. Our proposed method was able to achieve 2.59dB higher
PSNR than the current state-of-the-art method by Tao. Our proposed CNN-based down-scaling was
the key factor for this excellent performance since the performance of our network without it was
decreased by 1.98dB. The same networks trained with GoPro set were also evaluated on large-scale
Su dataset and our proposed method yielded 1.15dB better PSNR than the Tao's method. Qualitative
comparisons on Lai dataset also confirmed the superior performance of our proposed method over
other state-of-the-art methods.
