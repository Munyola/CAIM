In many two-sided markets, the parties to be matched have incomplete information about their characteristics.
We consider the settings where the parties engaged are extremely patient and are interested in long-term
partnerships. Hence, once the final matches are determined, they persist for a long time. Each side
has an opportunity to learn (some) relevant information about the other before final matches are
made. For instance, clients seeking workers to perform tasks often conduct interviews that require
the workers to perform some tasks and thereby provide information to both sides. The performance
of a worker in such an interview- and hence the information revealed - depends both on the inherent
characteristics of the worker and the task and also on the actions taken by the worker (e.g. the effort
expended), which are not observed by the client. Thus there is moral hazard. Our goal is to derive
a dynamic matching mechanism that facilitates learning on both sides before final matches are achieved
and ensures that the worker side does not have incentive to obscure learning of their characteristics
through their actions. We derive such a mechanism that leads to final matching that achieve optimal
performance (revenue) in equilibrium. We show that the equilibrium strategy is long-run coalitionally
stable, which means there is no subset of workers and clients that can gain by deviating from the equilibrium
strategy. We derive all the results under the modeling assumption that the utilities of the agents
are defined as limit of means of the utility obtained in each interaction.
