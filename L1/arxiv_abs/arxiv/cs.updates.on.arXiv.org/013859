Spectral techniques have proved amongst the most effective approaches to graph clustering. However,
in general they require explicit computation of the main eigenvectors of a suitable matrix (usually
the Laplacian matrix of the graph). Recent work (e.g., Becchetti et al., SODA 2017) suggests that
observing the temporal evolution of the power method applied to an initial random vector may, at
least in some cases, provide enough information on the space spanned by the first two eigenvectors,
so as to allow recovery of a hidden partition without explicit eigenvector computations. While
the results of Becchetti et al. apply to perfectly balanced partitions and/or graphs that exhibit
very strong forms of regularity, we extend their approach to graphs containing a hidden $k$ partition
and characterized by a milder form of volume-regularity. We show that the class of $k$-volume regular
graphs is the largest class of undirected (possibly weighted) graphs whose transition matrix admits
$k$ stepwise eigenvectors (i.e., vectors that are constant over each set of the hidden partition).
To obtain this result, we highlight a connection between volume regularity and lumpability of Markov
chains. Moreover, we prove that if the stepwise eigenvectors are those associated to the first $k$
eigenvalues and the gap between the $k$-th and the ($k$+1)-th eigenvalues is sufficiently large,
the Averaging dynamics of Becchetti et al. recovers the underlying community structure of the graph
in logarithmic time, with high probability.
