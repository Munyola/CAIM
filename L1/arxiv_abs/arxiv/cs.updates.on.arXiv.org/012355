A limitation of the Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) is that it assumes at a particular $l^{th}$
layer of the neural network model only the $l^{th}$ order neighbourhood nodes of a social network
are influential. Furthermore, the GCN has been evaluated on citation and knowledge graphs, but
not extensively on friendship-based social graphs. The drawback associated with the dependencies
between layers and the order of node neighbourhood for the GCN can be more prevalent for friendship-based
graphs. The evaluation of the full potential of the GCN on friendship-based social network requires
openly available datasets in larger quantities. However, most available social network datasets
are not complete. Also, the majority of the available social network datasets do not contain both
the features and ground truth labels. In this work, firstly, we provide a guideline on simulating
dynamic social networks, with ground truth labels and features, both coupled with the topology.
Secondly, we introduce an open-source Python-based simulation library. We argue that the topology
of the network is driven by a set of latent variables, termed as the social DNA (sDNA). We consider
the sDNA as labels for the nodes. Finally, by evaluating on our simulated datasets, we propose four
new variants of the GCN, mainly to overcome the limitation of dependency between the order of node-neighbourhood
and a particular layer of the model. We then evaluate the performance of all the models and our results
show that on 27 out of the 30 simulated datasets our proposed GCN variants outperform the original
model.
