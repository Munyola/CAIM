This paper introduces the problem of printing a cantilever beam with precise structural requirements
using Additive Manufacturing and feedback control. The manufactured cantilever beam is made of
\SI{500}{} horizontal layers with different widths, allowing for various final shapes of the beam.
The whole printing process is therefore formalized as a finite-horizon discrete control problem,
with a target stiffness to achieve and a cost function to minimize, and where the controls are the
widths of the successive layers. By using a model linking the widths of the different layers of the
printed part to its final stiffness, the shape is optimized by solving the related control problem.
The dynamics describing the printing process are based on a simple structural mechanics model depending
on four real parameters that are determined by printing several specimens parts prior to starting
the manufacturing of the cantilever beam. During the printing process, stiffness measurements
are performed on the partially built part in order to adjust the widths of the subsequent layers.
This type of feedback control, consisting in repeatedly solving an optimization problem starting
from the current state at each step, produces parts with more precise structural properties than
the equivalent open-loop control problem that only solves the optimization problem once at the
initial state. By using closed-loop control, we show that two sources of structural properties
uncertainty in AM can be alleviated: the difficulty to correctly model printing processes and their
variability.
