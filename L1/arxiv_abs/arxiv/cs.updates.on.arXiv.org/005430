We show how to multiply two $n \times n$ matrices $S$ and $T$ over semirings in the \clique model, where
$n$ nodes communicate in a fully connected synchronous network using $O(\log{n})$-bit messages,
within $O(nz(S)^{1/3} nz(T)^{1/3}/n)$ rounds of communication, where $nz(S)$ and $nz(T)$ denote
the number of non-zero elements in $S$ and $T$, respectively. By leveraging the sparsity of the input
matrices, our algorithm greatly reduces communication costs compared with general multiplication
algorithms [Censor-Hillel et al., PODC 2015], and thus improves upon the state-of-the-art for
matrices with $o(n^2)$ non-zero elements. Moreover, our algorithm exhibits the additional strength
of surpassing previous solutions also in the case where only one of the two matrices is such. Particularly,
this allows to efficiently raise a sparse matrix to a power greater than 2. Our algorithmic contribution
is a new \emph{deterministic} method of restructuring the input matrices in a sparsity-aware manner,
which assigns each node with element-wise multiplication tasks that are not necessarily consecutive
but guarantee a balanced element distribution, providing for communication-efficient multiplication.
As applications, we show how to speed up the computation on non-dense graphs of triangle- and $4$-cycle
counting, as well as of all-pairs-shortest-paths. Our triangle-counting algorithm completes
in $O(m^{2/3}/n)$ rounds, which is a \emph{cubic} improvement over the previously known $O(m^2/n^3)$-round
algorithm [Dolev et al., DISC 2012].
