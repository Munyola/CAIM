The recent proliferation of smart devices has given rise to ubiquitous computing, an emerging computing
paradigm which allows anytime & anywhere computing possible. In such a ubiquitous computing environment,
customers release different computing or sensing tasks, and people, also known as data processors,
participate in these tasks and get paid for providing their idle computing and communication resources.
Thus, how to select an appropriate and reliable customer while not disclosing processors' privacy
has become an interesting problem. In this article, we present a trust-based and privacy-preserving
customer selection scheme in ubiquitous computing, called TPCS, to enable potential processors
select the customers with good reputation. The basic concept of TPCS is that each data processor
holds a trust value, and the reputation score of the customer is calculated based on processors'
trust values and feedbacks via a truth discovery process. To preserve processors' privacy, pseudonyms
and Paillier cryptosystem are applied to conceal each processor's real identity. In addition,
three authentication protocols are designed to ensure that only the valid data processors (i.e.,
the processors registering in the system, holding the truthful trust values, and joining the computing
tasks) can pass the authentication. A comprehensive security analysis is conducted to prove that
our proposed TPCS scheme is secure and can defend against several sophisticated attacks. Moreover,
extensive simulations are conducted to demonstrate the correctness and effectiveness of the proposed
scheme.
