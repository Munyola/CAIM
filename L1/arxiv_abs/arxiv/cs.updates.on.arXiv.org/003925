In the ordinal Matroid Secretary Problem (MSP), elements from a weighted matroid are presented
in random order to an algorithm that must incrementally select a large weight independent set. However,
the algorithm can only compare pairs of revealed elements without using its numerical value. An
algorithm is $\alpha$ probability-competitive if every element from the optimum appears with
probability $1/\alpha$ in the output. We present a technique to design algorithms with strong probability-competitive
ratios, improving the guarantees for almost every matroid class considered in the literature:
e.g., we get ratios of 4 for graphic matroids (improving on $2e$ by Korula and P\'al [ICALP 2009])
and of 5.19 for laminar matroids (improving on 9.6 by Ma et al. [THEOR COMPUT SYST 2016]). We also obtain
new results for superclasses of $k$ column sparse matroids, for hypergraphic matroids, certain
gammoids and graph packing matroids, and a $1+O(\sqrt{\log \rho/\rho})$ probability-competitive
algorithm for uniform matroids of rank $\rho$ based on Kleinberg's $1+O(\sqrt{1/\rho})$ utility-competitive
algorithm [SODA 2005] for that class. Our second contribution are algorithms for the ordinal MSP
on arbitrary matroids of rank $\rho$. We devise an $O(\log \rho)$ probability-competitive algorithm
and an $O(\log\log \rho)$ ordinal-competitive algorithm, a weaker notion of competitiveness
but stronger than the utility variant. These are based on the $O(\log\log \rho)$ utility-competitive
algorithm by Feldman et al.~[SODA 2015].
