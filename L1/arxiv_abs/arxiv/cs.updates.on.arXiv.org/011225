"Trustworthy data" is the fuel for ensuring transparent traceability, precise decision-making,
and cogent coordination in the supply chain (SC) space. However, the disparate data silos act as
a trade barrier in orchestrating the provenance of product story starting from the transformation
of raw materials into the circuit board to the assembling of electronic components into end products
available on the store shelf for customers. Therefore, to bridge the fragmented siloed information
across global supply chain partners, the diffusion of blockchain (BC) as one of the advanced distributed
ledger technology (DLT) takeover the on-premise legacy systems. Nevertheless, the challenging
constraints of blockchain including scalability, accessing off-line data, fee-less microtransactions
and many more lead to the third wave of blockchain called IOTA. In this paper, we propose a framework
for supporting provenance in the electronic supply chain (ECS) by using permissioned IOTA ledger.
Realizing the crucial requirement of trustworthy data, we use Masked Authenticated Messaging
(MAM) channel provided by IOTA that allows the SC players to procure distributed information while
keeping confidential trade flows, tamper-proof data, and fine-grained accessibility rights.
To identify operational disruption, we devise a transparent product ledger through transaction
data and consignment information to keep track of the complete product journey at each intermediary
step during SC processes. Furthermore, we evaluate the secure provenance data construction time
for varying payload size.
