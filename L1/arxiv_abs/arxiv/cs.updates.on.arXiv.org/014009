Motion planning is an active field of research in robot navigation and autonomous driving. There
are plenty of classical and heuristic motion planning methods applicable to mobile robots and ground
vehicles. This paper is dedicated to introducing a novel method for collision prediction and path
planning. The method is called Time Distance (TD), and its basis returns to the swept volume idea.
However, there are considerable differences between the TD method and existing methods associated
with the swept volume concept. In this method, time is obtained as a dependent variable in TD functions.
TD functions are functions of location, velocity, and geometry of objects, determining the TD of
objects with respect to any location. Known as a relative concept, TD is defined as the time interval
that must be spent in order for an object to reach a certain location. It is firstly defined for the
one-dimensional case and then generalized to 2D space. The collision prediction algorithm consists
of obtaining the TD of different points of an object (the vehicle) with respect to all objects of the
environment using an explicit function which is a function of TD functions. The path planning algorithm
uses TD functions and two other functions called Z-Infinity and Route Function to create the collision-free
path in a dynamic environment. Both the collision prediction and the path planning algorithms are
evaluated in simulations. Comparisons indicate the capability of the method to generate length
optimal paths as the most effective methods do.
