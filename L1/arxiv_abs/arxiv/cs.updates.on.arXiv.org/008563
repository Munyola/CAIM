The best known circuit lower bounds against unrestricted circuits remained around $3n$ for several
decades. Moreover, the only known technique for proving lower bounds in this model, gate elimination,
is inherently limited to proving lower bounds of less than $5n$. In this work, we suggest a first non-gate-elimination
approach for obtaining circuit lower bounds. Namely, we prove that every (unbounded-depth) circuit
of size $s$ can be expressed as an OR of $2^{s/3.9}$ $16$-CNFs. While this structural result does
not immediately lead to new lower bounds, it suggests a new avenue of attack on them. Our result complements
the classical depth reduction result of Valiant which asserts that logarithmic-depth circuits
of linear size can be computed by an OR of $2^{\varepsilon n}$ $n^{\delta}$-CNFs. It is known that
no such graph-theoretic reduction can work for circuits of super-logarithmic depth. We overcome
this limitation (for small circuits) by taking into account both the graph-theoretic and functional
properties of circuits. We show that qualitative improvements of the following pseudorandom constructions
imply qualitative (from $3n$ to $\omega(n)$) improvement of size lower bounds for log-depth circuits
via Valiant's reduction: dispersers for varieties, correlation with constant degree polynomials,
matrix rigidity, and hardness for depth-$3$ circuits with constant bottom fan-in. On the other
hand, now even modest quantitative improvements of the known constructions give elementary proofs
of quantitatively stronger circuit lower bounds ($3.9n$ instead of $3n$).
