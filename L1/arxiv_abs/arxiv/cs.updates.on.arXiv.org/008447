Ultrasound elastography is gaining traction as an accessible and useful diagnostic tool for such
things as cancer detection and differentiation as well as liver and thyroid disease diagnostics.
Unfortunately, state of the art acoustic radiation force techniques, essential to promote this
goal, are limited to high end ultrasound hardware due to high power requirements; are extremely
sensitive to patient and sonographer motion; and generally suffer from low frame rates. Researchers
have shown that pressure wave velocity possesses similar diagnostic abilities to shear wave velocity.
Using pressure waves removes the need for generating shear waves, which in turn enables elasticity
based diagnostic techniques on portable and low cost devices. However, current travel time tomography
and full waveform inversion techniques for recovering pressure wave velocities require a full
circumferential field of view. Focus based techniques, on the other hand, provide only localized
measurements, are sensitive to the intermediate medium and require capturing multiple frames.
In this paper, we present a single sided sound speed inversion solution using a fully convolutional
deep neural network. We show that it is possible to invert for longitudinal sound speed in soft tissue
at real time frame rates. For the computation, analysis is performed on channel data information
from three diagonal plane waves. This is the first step towards a full waveform solver using a Deep
Learning framework for the elastic and viscoelastic inverse problem.
