This work examines the problem of graph learning over a diffusion network when data can be collected
from a limited portion of the network (partial observability). While most works in the literature
rely on a degree of sparsity to provide guarantees of consistent graph recovery, our analysis moves
away from this condition and includes the demanding setting of dense connectivity. We ascertain
that suitable estimators of the combination matrix (i.e., the matrix that quantifies the pairwise
interaction between nodes) possess an identifiability gap that enables the discrimination between
connected and disconnected nodes. Fundamental conditions are established under which the subgraph
of monitored nodes can be recovered, with high probability as the network size increases, through
universal clustering algorithms. This claim is proved for three matrix estimators: i) the Granger
estimator that adapts to the partial observability setting the solution that is optimal under full
observability ; ii) the one-lag correlation matrix; and iii) the residual estimator based on the
difference between two consecutive time samples. Comparison among the estimators is performed
through illustrative examples that reveal how estimators that are not optimal in the full observability
regime can outperform the Granger estimator in the partial observability regime. The analysis
reveals that the fundamental property enabling consistent graph learning is the statistical concentration
of node degrees, rather than the sparsity of connections.
