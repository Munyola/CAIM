Android applications are frequently plagiarized or maliciously repackaged, and software obfuscation
is a popular protection against these practices. In this study, we present the first comprehensive
analysis of the use and challenges of software obfuscation in Android applications. We surveyed
308 Google Play developers about their experiences with obfuscation, finding that the free ProGuard
software is by far the most commonly used obfuscation tool. With this insight, we analyzed 1.7 million
Android apps from Google Play, finding that only 24.9% of apps are obfuscated by the primary developer.
This is surprising, given that the most common integrated development environment for Android,
Android Studio, includes ProGuard by default. We investigated root causes of this low rate of obfuscation
in an in-depth study with 79 Google Play developers, assessing their experiences with obfuscation
and asking them to obfuscate a sample app using ProGuard. We found that while developers feel that
apps in general are at risk of malicious repackaging or plagiarism, they do not fear theft of their
own intellectual property. Developers also report difficulties applying obfuscation for their
own apps, which was substantiated when they demonstrated problems with all but the most basic configurations
to obfuscate our sample app. Our findings indicate that more work is needed to make the application
of obfuscation more usable and to educate developers on the risk of their apps being reverse engineered,
their intellectual property stolen and their apps being repackaged and redistributed as malware.
