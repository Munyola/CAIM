Electronic circuits can be separated into two groups, digital and analog circuits. Analog circuits
operate on analog quantities that are continuous in value, whereas digital circuits operate on
digital quantities that are discrete in value and limited in precision. In practice, most digital
systems contain combinational circuits along with memory; these systems are known as sequential
circuits. Sequential circuits are of two types: synchronous and asynchronous. In a synchronous
sequential circuit, a clock signal is used at discrete instants of time to synchronize desired operations.
Asynchronous sequential circuits do not require synchronizing clock pulses; however, the completion
of an operation signals the start of the next operation in sequence. The basic logic design steps
are generally identical for sequential and combinational circuits; these are specification,
formulation, optimization, and the implementation of the optimized equations using a suitable
hardware technology. The differences between sequential and combinational design steps appear
in the details of each step. The minimization (optimization) techniques used in logic design range
from simple (manual) to complex (automated). An example of manual optimization methods is the Karnough
map (K-map). Indeed, hardware implementation technology has been growing faster than the ability
of designers to produce hardware designs. Hence, there has been a growing interest in developing
techniques and tools that facilitate the process of logic design.
