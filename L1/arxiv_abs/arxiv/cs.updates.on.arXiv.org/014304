Metasurfaces are being widely investigated and adopted for their promising performances in manipulating
optical wavefronts and their potential for integrating multi-functionalities into one flat optical
device. A key challenge in metasurface design is the non-intuitive design process that produces
models and patterns from specific design requirements (commonly electromagnetic responses).
A complete exploration of all design spaces can produce optimal designs but is unrealistic considering
the massive amount of computation power required to explore large parameter spaces. Meanwhile,
machine learning techniques, especially generative adversarial networks, have proven to be an
effective solution to non-intuitive design tasks. In this paper, we present a novel conditional
generative network that can generate meta-atom/metasurface designs based on different performance
requirements. Compared to conventional trial-and-error or iterative optimization design methods,
this new methodology is capable of producing on-demand freeform designs on a one-time calculation
basis. More importantly, an increased complexity of design goals doesn't introduce further complexity
into the network structure or the training process, which makes this approach suitable for multi-functional
device designs. Compared to previous deep learning-based metasurface approaches, our network
structure is extremely robust to train and converge, and is readily expanded to many multi-functional
metasurface devices, including metasurface filters, lenses and holograms.
