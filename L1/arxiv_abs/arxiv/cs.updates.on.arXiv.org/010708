Most mobile robots for indoor use rely on 2D laser scanners for localization, mapping and navigation.
These sensors, however, cannot detect transparent surfaces or measure the full occupancy of complex
objects such as tables. Deep Neural Networks have recently been proposed to overcome this limitation
by learning to estimate object occupancy. These estimates are nevertheless subject to uncertainty,
making the evaluation of their confidence an important issue for these measures to be useful for
autonomous navigation and mapping. In this work we approach the problem from two sides. First we
discuss uncertainty estimation in deep models, proposing a solution based on a fully convolutional
neural network. The proposed architecture is not restricted by the assumption that the uncertainty
follows a Gaussian model, as in the case of many popular solutions for deep model uncertainty estimation,
such as Monte-Carlo Dropout. We present results showing that uncertainty over obstacle distances
is actually better modeled with a Laplace distribution. Then, we propose a novel approach to build
maps based on Deep Neural Network uncertainty models. In particular, we present an algorithm to
build a map that includes information over obstacle distance estimates while taking into account
the level of uncertainty in each estimate. We show how the constructed map can be used to increase
global navigation safety by planning trajectories which avoid areas of high uncertainty, enabling
higher autonomy for mobile robots in indoor settings.
