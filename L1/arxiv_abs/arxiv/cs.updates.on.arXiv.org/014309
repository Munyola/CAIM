Many voter-verifiable, coercion-resistant schemes have been proposed, but even the most carefully
designed systems necessarily leak information via the announced result. In corner cases, this
may be problematic. For example, if all the votes go to one candidate then all vote privacy evaporates.
The mere possibility of candidates getting no or few votes could have implications for security
in practice: if a coercer demands that a voter cast a vote for such an unpopular candidate, then the
voter may feel obliged to obey, even if she is confident that the voting system satisfies the standard
coercion resistance definitions. With complex ballots, there may also be a danger of "Italian"
style (aka "signature") attacks: the coercer demands the voter cast a ballot with a specific, identifying
pattern. Here we propose an approach to tallying end-to-end verifiable schemes that avoids revealing
all the votes but still achieves whatever confidence level in the announced result is desired. Now
a coerced voter can claim that the required vote must be amongst those that remained shrouded. Our
approach is based on the well-established notion of Risk-Limiting Audits, but here applied to the
tally rather than to the audit. We show that this approach counters coercion threats arising in extreme
tallies and "Italian" attacks. We illustrate our approach by applying it to the Selene scheme, and
we extend the approach to Risk-Limiting Verification, where not all vote trackers are revealed,
thereby enhancing the coercion mitigation properties of Selene.
