Sometimes knowing the future given the present is not enough. For sound policy making, predicting
possible futures given different user defined scenarios can be more important. However, the workhorse
for causality detection and impulse response, the Vector Autoregression (VAR), assumes linearity
and has produced poor forecasts (Reis, 2018). Here, we introduce a vector autoencoder nonlinear
autoregression neural network (VANAR) capable of both automatic time series feature extraction
for its inputs and automatic functional form estimation. We compare the performance of VANAR and
VAR across three tests: (1) forecasting skill, measured as n-step ahead forecast accuracy, (2)
correct detection of Granger Causality between variables, and (3) impulse response tests on modeled
trajectories subject to external shocks. These tests were performed on datasets with different
underlying dynamics: a simulated nonlinear chaotic system, a simulated linear system, and an empirical
system using Philippine macroeconomic data. Results show that VANAR significantly outperforms
VAR in terms of the forecast and causality tests especially for the nonlinear and empirical macroeconomic
systems. For the impulse response test, VANAR outperforms VAR in the linear system but both models
fail to predict the shocked trajectories of the nonlinear chaotic system. VANAR was robust in its
ability to model a wide variety of dynamics, from chaotic, high noise, and low data environments
to complex macroeconomic systems, thus illustrating its potential usefulness in modeling more
real world dynamical systems.
