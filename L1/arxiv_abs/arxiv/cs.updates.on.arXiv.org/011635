Sometimes knowing the future given the present is not enough. Predicting possible futures given
different defined scenarios can be more important. However, the workhorse for causality detection
and impulse response, the Vector Autoregression (VAR), assumes linearity and has produced poor
forecasts (Reis, 2018). Here, we introduce a vector autoencoder nonlinear autoregression neural
network (VANAR) capable of both automatic time series feature extraction for its inputs and automatic
functional form estimation. We evaluate VANAR in three ways: first in terms of pure forecast accuracy,
second in terms of detecting the correct causality between variables, and lastly in terms of impulse
response where we model trajectories given external shocks. These tests were performed on datasets
with different underlying dynamics: a simulated nonlinear chaotic system, a simulated linear
system, and an empirical system using Philippine macroeconomic data. Results show that VANAR significantly
outperforms VAR in the forecast and causality tests. For the macroeconomic forecast, VANAR has
consistently superior accuracy even over state of the art models such as SARIMA and TBATS (Hyndman
et al., 2011). For the impulse response test, VANAR outperforms VAR in the linear system but both
models fail to predict the shocked trajectories of the nonlinear chaotic system. VANAR was robust
in its ability to model a wide variety of dynamics, from chaotic, high noise, and low data environments
to complex macroeconomic systems, thus illustrating its potential usefulness in modeling more
real world dynamical systems.
