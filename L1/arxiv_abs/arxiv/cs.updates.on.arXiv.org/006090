Inspired by the numerous social and economic benefits of diversity, we analyze over 9 million papers
and 6 million scientists spanning 24 fields of study, to understand the relationship between research
impact and five types of diversity, reflecting (i) ethnicity, (ii) discipline, (iii) gender, (iv)
affiliation and (v) academic age. For each type, we study group diversity (i.e., the heterogeneity
of a paper's set of authors) and individual diversity (i.e., the heterogeneity of a scientist's
entire set of collaborators). Remarkably, of all the types considered, we find that ethnic diversity
is the strongest predictor of a field's scientific impact (r is 0.77 and 0.55 for group and individual
ethnic diversity, respectively). Moreover, to isolate the effect of ethnic diversity from other
confounding factors, we analyze a baseline model in which author ethnicities are randomized while
preserving all other characteristics. We find that the relationship between ethnic diversity
and impact is stronger in the empirical data compared to the randomized baseline model, regardless
of publication year, number of authors per paper, and number of collaborators per scientist. Finally,
we use coarsened exact matching to infer causality, whereby the scientific impact of ethnically
diverse papers and scientists are compared with closely-matched control groups. Impact gains
of 11.64% and 55.45% were observed between the top and bottom 10% group and individual diversities,
respectively. This provides further evidence that ethnic diversity leads to higher scientific
impact.
