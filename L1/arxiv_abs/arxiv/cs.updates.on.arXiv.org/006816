The development of chemical reaction models aids system design and optimization, along with fundamental
understanding, in areas including combustion, catalysis, electrochemistry, and biology. A systematic
approach to building reaction network models uses available data not only to estimate unknown parameters,
but also to learn the model structure. Bayesian inference provides a natural approach to this data-driven
construction of models. Traditional Bayesian model inference methodology is based on evaluating
a multidimensional integral for each model. This approach is often infeasible for nonlinear reaction
network inference, as the number of plausible models can be combinatorially large. An alternative
approach based on model-space sampling can enable large-scale network inference, but its efficient
implementation presents many challenges. In this paper, we present new computational methods
that make large-scale nonlinear network inference tractable. Firstly, we exploit the network-based
interactions of species to design improved "between-model" proposals for Markov chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC). We then introduce a sensitivity-based determination of move types which, when combined
with the network-aware proposals, yields further sampling efficiency. These algorithms are tested
on example problems with up to 1024 plausible models. We find that our new algorithms yield significant
gains in sampling performance, thus providing a means for tractable inference over a large number
reaction models with physics-based nonlinear species interactions.
