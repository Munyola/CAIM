Recently, cache-enabled heterogeneous cellular networks (C-HetNets) have been emerged as a promising
solution for next-generation wireless networks to cope with exponentially increasing demands
for high data rate and low latency multimedia services. In this paper, we design both the cache placement
and delivery strategies in the downlink of an orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA)-based
C-HetNet which operates in two separated phases: caching phase (CP) and delivery phase (DP) where
CP deals with placing contents in the network storages and DP deals with serving the content requests
to users. Since most of the current research efforts in cache-assisted wireless networks have neglected
the fair treatment of mobile users (MUs), in this work, we first propose two delay-based fairness
schemes called proportional fairness (PF) and min-max fairness (MMF). In PF, we minimize the total
weighted latency of MUs while in MMF, we aim to minimize the maximal latency among MUs. In the CP, we
propose novel fairness and transmission-aware cache placement strategies (CPSs) exploiting
the benefits of flexible physical-layer transmission opportunities for access and backhaul links,
simultaneously. Specifically, we jointly perform the allocation of physical resources as storage
and radio, and user assignment to improve the flexibility of the CPSs. Numerical assessments show
up to $27\%$ improvement in terms of total latency of MUs is achieved by our proposed CPSs compared
to the conventional baseline popular CPSs.
