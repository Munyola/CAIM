The rapid progress and advancement in electronic chips technology provide a variety of new implementation
options for system engineers. The choice varies between the flexible programs running on a general-purpose
processor (GPP) and the fixed hardware implementation using an application specific integrated
circuit (ASIC). Many other implementation options present, for instance, a system with a RISC processor
and a DSP core. Other options include graphics processors and microcontrollers. Specialist processors
certainly improve performance over general-purpose ones, but this comes as a quid pro quo for flexibility.
Combining the flexibility of GPPs and the high performance of ASICs leads to the introduction of
reconfigurable computing (RC) as a new implementation option with a balance between versatility
and speed. The focus of this chapter is on introducing reconfigurable computers as modern super
computing architectures. The chapter also investigates the main reasons behind the current advancement
in the development of RC-systems. Furthermore, a technical survey of various RC-systems is included
laying common grounds for comparisons. In addition, this chapter mainly presents case studies
implemented under the MorphoSys RC-system. The selected case studies belong to different areas
of application, such as, computer graphics and information coding. Parallel versions of the studied
algorithms are developed to match the topologies supported by the MorphoSys. Performance evaluation
and results analyses are included for implementations with different characteristics.
