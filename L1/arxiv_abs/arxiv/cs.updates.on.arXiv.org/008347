Drug-drug interactions (DDIs) are a major cause of preventable hospitalizations and deaths. Predicting
the occurrence of DDIs helps drug safety professionals allocate investigative resources and take
appropriate regulatory action promptly. Traditional DDI prediction methods predict DDIs based
on the similarity between drugs. Recently, researchers revealed that predictive performance
can be improved by better modeling the interactions between drug pairs with bilinear forms. However,
the shallow models leveraging bilinear forms suffer from limitations on capturing complicated
nonlinear interactions between drug pairs. To this end, we propose Multi-Label Robust Factorization
Autoencoder (abbreviated to MuLFA) for DDI prediction, which learns a representation of interactions
between drug pairs and has the capability of characterizing complicated nonlinear interactions
more precisely. Moreover, a novel loss called CuXCov is designed to effectively learn the parameters
of MuLFA. Furthermore, the decoder is able to generate high-risk chemical structures of drug pairs
for specific DDIs, assisting pharmacists to better understand the relationship between drug chemistry
and DDI. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that MuLFA consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art methods; particularly, it increases 21:3% predictive performance compared
to the best baseline for top 50 frequent DDIs.We also illustrate various case studies to demonstrate
the efficacy of the chemical structures generated by MuLFA in DDI diagnosis.
