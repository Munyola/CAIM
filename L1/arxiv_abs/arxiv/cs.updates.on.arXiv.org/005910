In the brain, the membrane potential of many neurons oscillates in a subthreshold damped fashion
and fire when excited by an input frequency that nearly equals their eigen frequency. In this work,
we investigate theoretically the artificial implementation of such "resonate-and-fire" neurons
by utilizing the magnetization dynamics of a fixed magnetic skyrmion in the free layer of a magnetic
tunnel junction (MTJ). To realize firing of this nanomagnetic implementation of an artificial
neuron, we propose to employ voltage control of magnetic anisotropy or voltage generated strain
as an input (spike or sinusoidal) signal, which modulates the perpendicular magnetic anisotropy
(PMA). This results in continual expansion and shrinking (i.e. breathing) of a skyrmion core that
mimics the subthreshold oscillation. Any subsequent input pulse having an interval close to the
breathing period or a sinusoidal input close to the eigen frequency drives the magnetization dynamics
of the fixed skyrmion in a resonant manner. The time varying electrical resistance of the MTJ layer
due to this resonant oscillation of the skyrmion core is used to drive a Complementary Metal Oxide
Semiconductor (CMOS) buffer circuit, which produces spike outputs. By rigorous micromagnetic
simulation, we investigate the interspike timing dependence and response to different excitatory
and inhibitory incoming input pulses. Finally, we show that such resonate and fire neurons have
potential application in coupled nanomagnetic oscillator based associative memory arrays.
