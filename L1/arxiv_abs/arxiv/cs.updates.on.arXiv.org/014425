Minimum Label Cut (or Hedge Connectivity) problem is defined as follows: given an undirected graph
$G=(V, E)$ with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges, in which, each edge is labeled (with one or multiple labels)
from a label set $L=\{\ell_1,\ell_2, ..., \ell_{|L|}\}$, the edges may be weighted with weight
set $W =\{w_1, w_2, ..., w_m\}$, the label cut problem(hedge connectivity) problem asks for the
minimum number of edge sets(each edge set (or hedge) is the edges with the same label) whose removal
disconnects the source-sink pair of vertices or the whole graph with minimum total weights(minimum
cardinality for unweighted version). This problem is more general than edge connectivity and hypergraph
edge connectivity problem and has a lot of applications in MPLS, IP networks, synchronous optical
networks, image segmentation, and other areas. However, due to limited communications between
different communities, this problem was studied in different names, with some important existing
literature citations missing, or sometimes the results are misleading with some errors. In this
paper, we make a further investigation of this problem, give uniform definitions, fix existing
errors, provide new insights and show some new results. Specifically, we show the relationship
between non-overlapping version(each edge only has one label) and overlapping version(each edge
has multiple labels), by fixing the error in the existing literature; hardness and approximation
performance between weighted version and unweighted version and some useful properties for further
research.
