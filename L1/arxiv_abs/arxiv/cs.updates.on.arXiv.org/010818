A graph $G$ with $n$ vertices is called an outerstring graph if it has an intersection representation
of a set of $n$ curves inside a disk such that one endpoint of every curve is attached to the boundary
of the disk. Given an outerstring graph representation, the Maximum Independent Set (MIS) problem
of the underlying graph can be solved in $O(s^3)$ time, where $s$ is the number of segments in the representation
(Keil et al., Comput. Geom., 60:19--25, 2017). If the strings are of constant size (e.g., line segments,
L-shapes, etc.), then the algorithm takes $O(n^3)$ time. In this paper, we examine the fine-grained
complexity of the MIS problem on some well-known outerstring representations. We show that solving
the MIS problem on grounded segment and grounded square-L representations is at least as hard as
solving MIS on circle graph representations. Note that no $O(n^{2-\delta})$-time algorithm,
$\delta>0$, is known for the MIS problem on circle graphs. For the grounded string representations
where the strings are $y$-monotone simple polygonal paths of constant length with segments at integral
coordinates, we solve MIS in $O(n^2)$ time and show this to be the best possible under the strong exponential
time hypothesis (SETH). For the intersection graph of $n$ L-shapes in the plane, we give a $(4\cdot
\log OPT)$-approximation algorithm for MIS (where $OPT$ denotes the size of an optimal solution),
improving the previously best-known $(4\cdot \log n)$-approximation algorithm of Biedl and Derka
(WADS 2017).
