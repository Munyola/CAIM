Device-to-device (D2D) communications is a promising technique for improving the efficiency
of 5G networks. Employing channel adaptive resource allocation can yield to a large enhancement
in almost any performance metric of D2D communications (e.g. Energy Efficiency). In this paper,
we show that minimizing the users transmission power while maintaining predefined throughput
constraint can be performed by simply adapting existing LTE CSI feedback. Thus, we propose a centralized
scheduling that requires the knowledge of D2D links' Channel State Information (CSI) at the base
station level. However, this CSI reporting suffers from the limited number of resources available
for feedback transmission. Alternately, we propose a distributed algorithm for resource allocation
that benefits from the users' knowledge of their local CSI in order to minimize the users' transmission
power while maintaining predefined throughput constraints. The key idea is that users compute
their local performance metrics (e.g. energy efficiency) and then use a new signaling mechanism
to share these values between each other. Under some condition, the performance of this distributed
algorithm achieves that of the \textit{ideal} scheduling (i.e. with a global CSI knowledge of all
the D2D links). We describe how these algorithms can be simply integrated to existing cellular networks.
Furthermore, numerical results are presented to corroborate our claims and demonstrate the gain
that the proposed scheduling algorithms bring to cellular networks.
