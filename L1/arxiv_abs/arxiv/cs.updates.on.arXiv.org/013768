A computer program is a set of electronic instructions executed from within the computer memory
by the computer central processing unit. Its purpose is to control the functionalities of the computer
allowing it to perform various tasks. Basically, a computer program is written by humans using a
programming language. A programming language is the set of grammatical rules and vocabulary that
governs the correct writing of a computer program. In practice, the majority of the existing programming
languages are written in English-speaking countries and thus they all use the English language
to express their syntax and vocabulary. However, many other programming languages were written
in non-English languages, for instance, the Chinese BASIC, the Chinese Python, the Russian Rapira,
and the Arabic Loughaty. This paper discusses the design and implementation of a new programming
language, called Phoenix. It is a General-Purpose, High-Level, Imperative, Object-Oriented,
and Compiled Arabic programming language that uses the Arabic language as syntax and vocabulary.
The core of Phoenix is a compiler system made up of six components, they are the Preprocessor, the
scanner, the parser, the semantic analyzer, the code generator, and the linker. The experiments
conducted have illustrated the several powerful features of the Phoenix language including functions,
while-loop, and arithmetic operations. As future work, more advanced features are to be developed
including inheritance, polymorphism, file processing, graphical user interface, and networking.
