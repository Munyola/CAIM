We investigate a special case of hereditary property in graphs, referred to as {\em robustness}.
A property (or structure) is called robust in a graph $G$ if it is inherited by all the connected spanning
subgraphs of $G$. We motivate this definition using two different settings of dynamic networks.
The first corresponds to networks of low dynamicity, where some links may be permanently removed
so long as the network remains connected. The second corresponds to highly-dynamic networks, where
communication links appear and disappear arbitrarily often, subject only to the requirement that
the entities are temporally connected in a recurrent fashion ({\it i.e.} they can always reach each
other through temporal paths). Each context induces a different interpretation of the notion of
robustness. We start by motivating the definition and discussing the two interpretations, after
what we consider the notion independently from its interpretation, taking as our focus the robustness
of {\em maximal independent sets} (MIS). A graph may or may not admit a robust MIS. We characterize
the set of graphs \forallMIS in which {\em all} MISs are robust. Then, we turn our attention to the
graphs that {\em admit} a robust MIS (\existsMIS). This class has a more complex structure; we give
a partial characterization in terms of elementary graph properties, then a complete characterization
by means of a (polynomial time) decision algorithm that accepts if and only if a robust MIS exists.
This algorithm can be adapted to construct such a solution if one exists.
