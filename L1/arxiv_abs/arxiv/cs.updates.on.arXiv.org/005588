Motivated by the increasing need to understand the distributed algorithmic foundations of large-scale
graph computations, we study some fundamental graph problems in a message-passing model for distributed
computing where $k \geq 2$ machines jointly perform computations on graphs with $n$ nodes (typically,
$n \gg k$). Our main contribution is the \emph{General Lower Bound Theorem}, a theorem that can be
used to show non-trivial lower bounds on the round complexity of distributed large-scale data computations.
The General Lower Bound Theorem is established via an information-theoretic approach that relates
the round complexity to the minimal amount of information required by machines for solving a problem.
Our approach is generic and this theorem can be used in a "cookbook" fashion to show distributed lower
bounds in the context of other problems (including non-graph problems). We present two applications
by showing (almost) tight bounds for the round complexity of two fundamental graph problems: 1)
PageRank: We show a lower bound of $\tilde{\Omega}(n/k^2)$ rounds, and present a distributed algorithm
that computes the PageRank of all the nodes of a graph in $\tilde{O}(n/k^2)$ rounds. 2) Triangle
enumeration: We show that there exist graphs with $m$ edges where any distributed algorithm requires
$\tilde{\Omega}(m/k^{5/3})$ rounds. This result implies the first non-trivial lower bound of
$\tilde\Omega(n^{1/3})$ rounds for the congested clique model. We also present a distributed
algorithm that enumerates all the triangles of a graph in $\tilde{O}(m/k^{5/3} + n/k^{4/3})$ rounds.
