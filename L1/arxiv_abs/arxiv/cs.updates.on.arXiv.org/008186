Diabetic eye disease is one of the fastest growing causes of preventable blindness. With the advent
of anti-VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) therapies, it has become increasingly important
to detect center-involved diabetic macular edema. However, center-involved diabetic macular
edema is diagnosed using optical coherence tomography (OCT), which is not generally available
at screening sites because of cost and workflow constraints. Instead, screening programs rely
on the detection of hard exudates as a proxy for DME on color fundus photographs, often resulting
in high false positive or false negative calls. To improve the accuracy of DME screening, we trained
a deep learning model to use color fundus photographs to predict DME grades derived from OCT exams.
Our "OCT-DME" model had an AUC of 0.89 (95% CI: 0.87-0.91), which corresponds to a sensitivity of
85% at a specificity of 80%. In comparison, three retinal specialists had similar sensitivities
(82-85%), but only half the specificity (45-50%, p<0.001 for each comparison with model). The positive
predictive value (PPV) of the OCT-DME model was 61% (95% CI: 56-66%), approximately double the 36-38%
by the retina specialists. In addition, we used saliency and other techniques to examine how the
model is making its prediction. The ability of deep learning algorithms to make clinically relevant
predictions that generally require sophisticated 3D-imaging equipment from simple 2D images
has broad relevance to many other applications in medical imaging.
