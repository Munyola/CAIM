This work considers the corner points of the capacity region of a two-user Gaussian interference
channel (IC). The problem originated in a paper by Costa (1985), followed by a note that raised an
issue and called for further study of these corner points (Sason, 2004). The operational meaning
of this study is to explore the situation where one transmitter sends its information at the maximal
achievable rate for a single-user (without interference), and the second transmitter needs to
keep its data rate below a certain value in order to achieve reliable communication for the two non-cooperating
receivers. The analysis in this paper mainly relies on existing outer bounds on the capacity region
of a two-user Gaussian IC, leading to informative bounds for these corner points. For weak interference,
where the interference coefficients in standard form are below~1, the resulting bounds are asymptotically
tight when the transmitted powers tend to infinity (thus making it an interference-limited channel),
and the corner points coincide in this case with their conjectured values (Costa, 1985). Furthermore,
the precision of the assessment of the two corner points for a Gaussian IC with weak interference
is high even for moderate signal-to-noise and interference-to-noise ratios. This work also provides
informative bounds for the corner points of the capacity region of a two-user Gaussian IC with mixed
interference. The corner points of the capacity region of a one-sided Gaussian interference channel
are considered as well. Topics for further research are finally addressed.
