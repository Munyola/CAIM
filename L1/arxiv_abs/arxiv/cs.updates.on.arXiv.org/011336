In the field of data mining and analytics, the utility theory from Economic can bring benefits in
many real-life applications. In recent decade, a new research field called utility-oriented mining
has already attracted great attention. Previous studies have, however, the limitation that they
rarely consider the inherent correlation of items among patterns. Consider the purchase behaviors
of consumer, a high-utility group of products (w.r.t. multi-products) may contain several very
high-utility products with some low-utility products. However, it is considered as a valuable
pattern even if this behavior/pattern may be not highly correlated, or even happen by chance. In
this paper, in light of these challenges, we propose an efficient utility mining approach namely
non-redundant Correlated high-Utility Pattern Miner (CoUPM) by taking positive correlation
and profitable value into account. The derived patterns with high utility and strong positive correlation
can lead to more insightful availability than those patterns only have high profitable values.
The utility-list structure is revised and applied to store necessary information of both correlation
and utility. Several pruning strategies are further developed to improve the efficiency for discovering
the desired patterns. Experimental results show that the non-redundant correlated high-utility
patterns have more effectiveness than some other kinds of interesting patterns. Moreover, efficiency
of the proposed CoUPM algorithm significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithm.
