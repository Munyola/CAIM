Simulation workflow is a top-level model for the design and control of simulation process. It connects
multiple simulation components with time and interaction restrictions to form a complete simulation
system. Before the construction and evaluation of the component models, the validation of upper-layer
simulation workflow is of the most importance in a simulation system. However, the methods especially
for validating simulation workflow is very limit. Many of the existing validation techniques are
domain-dependent with cumbersome questionnaire design and expert scoring. Therefore, this paper
present an empirical learning-based validation procedure to implement a semi-automated evaluation
for simulation workflow. First, representative features of general simulation workflow and their
relations with validation indices are proposed. The calculation process of workflow credibility
based on Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) is then introduced. In order to make full use of the historical
data and implement more efficient validation, four learning algorithms, including back propagation
neural network (BPNN), extreme learning machine (ELM), evolving new-neuron (eNFN) and fast incremental
gaussian mixture model (FIGMN), are introduced for constructing the empirical relation between
the workflow credibility and its features. A case study on a landing-process simulation workflow
is established to test the feasibility of the proposed procedure. The experimental results also
provide some useful overview of the state-of-the-art learning algorithms on the credibility evaluation
of simulation models.
