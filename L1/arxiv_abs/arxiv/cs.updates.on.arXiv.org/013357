Sentiment analysis benefits from large, hand-annotated resources in order to train and test machine
learning models, which are often data hungry. While some languages, e.g., English, have a vast array
of these resources, most under-resourced languages do not, especially for fine-grained sentiment
tasks, such as aspect-level or targeted sentiment analysis. To improve this situation, we propose
a cross-lingual approach to sentiment analysis that is applicable to under-resourced languages
and takes into account target-level information. This model incorporates sentiment information
into bilingual distributional representations, by jointly optimizing them for semantics and
sentiment, showing state-of-the-art performance at sentence-level when combined with machine
translation. The adaptation to targeted sentiment analysis on multiple domains shows that our
model outperforms other projection-based bilingual embedding methods on binary targeted sentiment
tasks. Our analysis on ten languages demonstrates that the amount of unlabeled monolingual data
has surprisingly little effect on the sentiment results. As expected, the choice of annotated source
language for projection to a target leads to better results for source-target language pairs which
are similar. Therefore, our results suggest that more efforts should be spent on the creation of
resources for less similar languages to those which are resource-rich already. Finally, a domain
mismatch leads to a decreased performance. This suggests resources in any language should ideally
cover varieties of domains.
