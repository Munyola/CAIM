The extended summary of Dr.Sc.Comp. thesis is created to emphasis the tight connection of the proposed
spectral analysis method with the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) - the most extensively studied
and frequently used approach in the history of signal processing. It is shown that in a typical application
case, where uniform data readings are transformed to the same number of uniformly spaced frequencies,
the results of the classical DFT and proposed approach coincide. The difference in performance
appears when the length of the DFT is selected to be greater then the length of the data. The DFT solves
the unknown data problem by padding readings with zeros up to the length of the DFT, while the proposed
Extended DFT (EDFT) deals with this situation in a different way, it finds an optimal transform basis
in the extended frequency domain without putting such restrictions on the time domain. Thus, the
Inverse DFT (IDFT) applied to the result of EDFT returns not only known readings but also the extrapolated
data, where classical DFT is able to give back just zeros. The EDFT significantly extends the usability
of the DFT based methods, where previously these approaches were considered inapplicable. The
EDFT founds the solution in an iterative way and requires repeated calculations to get the adaptive
basis, and this makes its numerical complexity much higher compared to DFT. This disadvantage was
a serious problem in 90-s, when the method has been proposed. Fortunately, since then the power of
computers has increased so much that nowadays EDFT application could be considered as a real alternative.
