Pipelined Krylov subspace methods avoid communication latency by reducing the number of global
synchronization bottlenecks and by hiding global communication behind useful computational
work. In exact arithmetic pipelined Krylov subspace algorithms are equivalent to classic Krylov
subspace methods and generate identical series of iterates. However, as a consequence of the reformulation
of the algorithm to improve parallelism, pipelined methods may suffer from severely reduced attainable
accuracy in a practical finite precision setting. This work presents a numerical stability analysis
that describes and quantifies the impact of local rounding error propagation on the maximal attainable
accuracy of the multi-term recurrences in the preconditioned pipelined BiCGStab method. Theoretical
expressions for the gaps between the true and computed residual as well as other auxiliary variables
used in the algorithm are derived, and the elementary dependencies between the gaps on the various
recursively computed vector variables are analyzed. The norms of the corresponding propagation
matrices and vectors provide insights in the possible amplification of local rounding errors throughout
the algorithm. Stability of the pipelined BiCGStab method is compared numerically to that of pipelined
CG on a symmetric benchmark problem. Furthermore, numerical evidence supporting the effectiveness
of employing a residual replacement type strategy to improve the maximal attainable accuracy for
the pipelined BiCGStab method is provided.
