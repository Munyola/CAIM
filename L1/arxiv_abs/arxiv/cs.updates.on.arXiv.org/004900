Policy iteration techniques for multiple-server dispatching rely on the computation of value
functions. In this context, we consider the M/G/1-FCFS queue endowed with an arbitrarily-designed
cost function for the waiting times of the incoming jobs, and we study an undiscounted value function
integrating the total cost surplus expected from each state relative to the steady-state costs.
When coupled with random initial policies, this value function takes closed-form expressions
for polynomial and exponential costs, or for piecewise compositions of the latter, thus hinting
in the most general case at the derivation of interval bounds for the value function in the form of
power series or trigonometric sums. The value function approximations induced by Taylor polynomial
expansions of the cost function prove however to converge only for entire cost functions with low
growth orders, and to diverge otherwise. A more suitable approach for assessing convergent interval
bounds is found in the uniform approximation framework. Bernstein polynomials constitute straightforward,
yet slowly convergent, cost function approximators over intervals. The best convergence rate
in the sense of D. Jackson's theorem is achieved by more sophisticated polynomial solutions derived
from trigonometric sums. This study is organized as a guide to implementing multiple-server dispatching
policies, from the specification of cost functions towards the computation of interval bounds
for the value functions and the implementation of the policy improvement step.
