Deep learning has been successfully applied to several problems related to autonomous driving.
Often, these solutions rely on large networks that require databases of real image samples of the
problem (i.e., real world) for proper training. The acquisition of such real-world data sets is
not always possible in the autonomous driving context, and sometimes their annotation is not feasible
(e.g., takes too long or is too expensive). Moreover, in many tasks, there is an intrinsic data imbalance
that most learning-based methods struggle to cope with. It turns out that traffic sign detection
is a problem in which these three issues are seen altogether. In this work, we propose a novel database
generation method that requires only (i) arbitrary natural images, i.e., requires no real image
from the domain of interest, and (ii) templates of the traffic signs, i.e., templates synthetically
created to illustrate the appearance of the category of a traffic sign. The effortlessly generated
training database is shown to be effective for the training of a deep detector (such as Faster R-CNN)
on German traffic signs, achieving 95.66% of mAP on average. In addition, the proposed method is
able to detect traffic signs with an average precision, recall and F1-score of about 94%, 91% and
93%, respectively. The experiments surprisingly show that detectors can be trained with simple
data generation methods and without problem domain data for the background, which is in the opposite
direction of the common sense for deep learning.
