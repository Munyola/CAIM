The goal of this paper was to take a flat solar panel and make cuts on the panel to make smaller, but still
viable solar panels. These smaller solar panels could then be arranged in a tree-like design. The
hope was that by having solar panels faced in different directions in 3-dimensional space, the tree
system would be able to pick up more sunlight than a flat solar panel. The results were promising,
but this project did not take every factor into account. Specifically, optimum shape, temperature
and the resistance of system, reflection of sun-rays were not explored in this project. This paper
will take an approach from origami paper folding to create the optimum arrangement that will allow
the overall system to absorb the maximum energy. Since the system stays stationary throughout the
day, it can reduce the maintenance cost and excess energy use because it does not require solar tracking.
In this project we have implemented a variety of Evolutionary Algorithms to find the most efficient
way to cut a flat solar panel and arrange the resulting smaller panels. Each solution in the population
will be tested by computing the amount of solar energy that is absorbed at particular times of the
day. The EA will be exploring different combinations of angles and heights of the smaller panels
on the tree such that the system can produce the maximum amount of power throughout the day. The performance
of our Evolutionary algorithms are comparable to the performance of flat solar panels. Keywords:
