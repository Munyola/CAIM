Emergency Department (ED) crowding is a worldwide issue that affects the efficiency of hospital
management and the quality of patient care. This occurs when the request for an admit ward-bed to
receive a patient is delayed until an admission decision is made by a doctor. To reduce the overcrowding
and waiting time of ED, we build a classifier to predict the disposition of patients using manually-typed
nurse notes collected during triage, thereby allowing hospital staff to begin necessary preparation
beforehand. However, these triage notes involve high dimensional, noisy, and also sparse text
data which makes model fitting and interpretation difficult. To address this issue, we propose
the semi-orthogonal non-negative matrix factorization (SONMF) for both continuous and binary
design matrices to first bi-cluster the patients and words into a reduced number of topics. The subjects
can then be interpreted as a non-subtractive linear combination of orthogonal basis topic vectors.
These generated topic vectors provide the hospital with a direct understanding of the cause of admission.
We show that by using a transformation of basis, the classification accuracy can be further increased
compared to the conventional bag-of-words model and alternative matrix factorization approaches.
Through simulated data experiments, we also demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms
other non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) methods in terms of factorization accuracy, rate
of convergence, and degree of orthogonality.
