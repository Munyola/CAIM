Objective image quality assessment (IQA) is imperative in the current multimedia-intensive world,
in order to assess the visual quality of an image at close to a human level of ability. Many~parameters
such as color intensity, structure, sharpness, contrast, presence of an object, etc., draw human
attention to an image. Psychological vision research suggests that human vision is biased to the
center area of an image and display screen. As a result, if the center part contains any visually salient
information, it draws human attention even more and any distortion in that part will be better perceived
than other parts. To the best of our knowledge, previous IQA methods have not considered this fact.
In this paper, we propose a full reference image quality assessment (FR-IQA) approach using visual
saliency and contrast; however, we give extra attention to the center by increasing the sensitivity
of the similarity maps in that region. We evaluated our method on three large-scale popular benchmark
databases used by most of the current IQA researchers (TID2008, CSIQ~and LIVE), having a total of
3345 distorted images with 28~different kinds of distortions. Our~method is compared with 13 state-of-the-art
approaches. This comparison reveals the stronger correlation of our method with human-evaluated
values. The prediction-of-quality score is consistent for distortion specific as well as distortion
independent cases. Moreover, faster processing makes it applicable to any real-time application.
