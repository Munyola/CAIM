This paper proposes a new method for simultaneous 3D reconstruction and semantic segmentation
of indoor scenes. Unlike existing methods that require recording a video using a color camera and/or
a depth camera, our method only needs a small number of (e.g., 3-5) color images from uncalibrated
sparse views as input, which greatly simplifies data acquisition and extends applicable scenarios.
Since different views have limited overlaps, our method allows a single image as input to discern
the depth and semantic information of the scene. The key issue is how to recover relatively accurate
depth from single images and reconstruct a 3D scene by fusing very few depth maps. To address this
problem, we first design an iterative deep architecture, IterNet, that estimates depth and semantic
segmentation alternately, so that they benefit each other. To deal with the little overlap and non-rigid
transformation between views, we further propose a joint global and local registration method
to reconstruct a 3D scene with semantic information from sparse views. We also make available a new
indoor synthetic dataset simultaneously providing photorealistic high-resolution RGB images,
accurate depth maps and pixel-level semantic labels for thousands of complex layouts, useful for
training and evaluation. Experimental results on public datasets and our dataset demonstrate
that our method achieves more accurate depth estimation, smaller semantic segmentation errors
and better 3D reconstruction results, compared with state-of-the-art methods.
