Crosstalk computing, involving engineered interference between nanoscale metal lines, offers
a fresh perspective to scaling through co-existence with CMOS. Through capacitive manipulations
and innovative circuit style, not only primitive gates can be implemented, but custom logic cells
such as an Adder, Subtractor can be implemented with huge gains. Our simulations show over 5x density
and 2x power benefits over CMOS custom designs at 16nm [1]. This paper introduces the Crosstalk circuit
style and a key method for large-scale circuit synthesis utilizing existing EDA tool flow. We propose
to manipulate the CMOS synthesis flow by adding two extra steps: conversion of the gate-level netlist
to Crosstalk implementation friendly netlist through logic simplification and Crosstalk gate
mapping, and the inclusion of custom cell libraries for automated placement and layout. Our logic
simplification approach first converts Cadence generated structured netlist to Boolean expressions
and then uses the majority synthesis tool to obtain majority functions, which is further used to
simplify functions for Crosstalk friendly implementations. We compare our approach of logic simplification
to that of CMOS and majority logic-based approaches. Crosstalk circuits share some similarities
to majority synthesis that are typically applied to Quantum Cellular Automata technology. However,
our investigation shows that by closely following Crosstalk's core circuit styles, most benefits
can be achieved. In the best case, our approach shows 36% density improvements over majority synthesis
for MCNC benchmark.
