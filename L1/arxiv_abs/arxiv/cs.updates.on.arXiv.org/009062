In industrial applications, nearly half the failures of motors are caused by the degradation of
rolling element bearings (REBs). Therefore, accurately estimating the remaining useful life
(RUL) for REBs are of crucial importance to ensure the reliability and safety of mechanical systems.
To tackle this challenge, model-based approaches are often limited by the complexity of mathematical
modeling. Conventional data-driven approaches, on the other hand, require massive efforts to
extract the degradation features and construct health index. In this paper, a novel online data-driven
framework is proposed to exploit the adoption of deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) in predicting
the RUL of bearings. More concretely, the raw vibrations of training bearings are first processed
using the Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT) and a novel nonlinear degradation indicator is constructed
as the label for learning. The CNN is then employed to identify the hidden pattern between the extracted
degradation indicator and the vibration of training bearings, which makes it possible to estimate
the degradation of the test bearings automatically. Finally, testing bearings' RULs are predicted
by using a $\epsilon$-support vector regression model. The superior performance of the proposed
RUL estimation framework, compared with the state-of-the-art approaches, is demonstrated through
the experimental results. The generality of the proposed CNN model is also validated by transferring
to bearings undergoing different operating conditions.
