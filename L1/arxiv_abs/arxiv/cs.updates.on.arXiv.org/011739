We present the first purely event-based, energy-efficient approach for object detection and categorization
using an event camera. Compared to traditional frame-based cameras, choosing event cameras results
in high temporal resolution (order of microseconds), low power consumption (few hundred mW) and
wide dynamic range (120 dB) as attractive properties. However, event-based object recognition
systems are far behind their frame-based counterparts in terms of accuracy. To this end, this paper
presents an event-based feature extraction method devised by accumulating local activity across
the image frame and then applying principal component analysis (PCA) to the normalized neighborhood
region. Subsequently, we propose a backtracking-free k-d tree mechanism for efficient feature
matching by taking advantage of the low-dimensionality of the feature representation. Additionally,
the proposed k-d tree mechanism allows for feature selection to obtain a lower-dimensional dictionary
representation when hardware resources are limited to implement dimensionality reduction. Consequently,
the proposed system can be realized on a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) device leading to
high performance over resource ratio. The proposed system is tested on real-world event-based
datasets for object categorization, showing superior classification performance and relevance
to state-of-the-art algorithms. Additionally, we verified the object detection method and real-time
FPGA performance in lab settings under non-controlled illumination conditions with limited training
data and ground truth annotations.
