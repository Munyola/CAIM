We study settings where agents with private information face a variety of issues and must take an
action with respect to each issue. For any given issue the order at which agents take actions is random
and each agent acts once. An agent's choice of action depends on his private information as well as
what he can deduce from observing relevant actions previously taken by predecessors. It is well
known that whenever agents observe all predecessors they may run into an `information cascade'
resulting in a herd on the inferior action. We depart from the classical in three aspects. First,
agents can only observe part of the population (modeled as neighbors on some undirected graph).
Second, agents face many decision problems and not just a single one, and finnally, we assume that
the arrival order of the agents is unknown. The central question we pose ask whether there is a natural
observability graph that prevents the aforementioned information cascade phenomenon for any
single issue and for all issues together. We introduce the `celebrities graph' and prove that indeed
it allows for proper information aggregation in large populations in a multiple issues setting,
even when the order at which agents decide is random and even when different issues are decided in
different orders. The celebrities graph can be viewed as an asymptotic version of preferential
attachment graphs, which arguably describe the evolution of real-world social networks. We complement
the theoretical model with simulations of social learning over preferential attachment graphs
and demonstrate the robustness of our results.
