Recently, autonomous driving development ignited competition among car makers and technical
corporations. Low-level automation cars are already commercially available. But high automated
vehicles where the vehicle drives by itself without human monitoring is still at infancy. Such autonomous
vehicles (AVs) entirely rely on the computing system in the car to to interpret the environment and
make driving decisions. Therefore, computing system design is essential particularly in enhancing
the attainment of driving safety. However, to our knowledge, no clear guideline exists so far regarding
safety-aware AV computing system and architecture design. To understand the safety requirement
of AV computing system, we performed a field study by running industrial Level-4 autonomous driving
fleets in various locations, road conditions, and traffic patterns. The field study indicates
that traditional computing system performance metrics, such as tail latency, average latency,
maximum latency, and timeout, cannot fully satisfy the safety requirement for AV computing system
design. To address this issue, we propose a `safety score' as a primary metric for measuring the level
of safety in AV computing system design. Furthermore, we propose a perception latency model, which
helps architects estimate the safety score of given architecture and system design without physically
testing them in an AV. We demonstrate the use of our safety score and latency model, by developing
and evaluating a safety-aware AV computing system computation hardware resource management scheme.
