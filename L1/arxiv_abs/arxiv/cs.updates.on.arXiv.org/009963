Rapid progress in genomics has enabled a thriving market for `direct-to-consumer' genetic testing,
whereby people have access to their genetic information without the involvement of a healthcare
provider. Companies like 23andMe and AncestryDNA, which provide affordable health, genealogy,
and ancestry reports, have already tested tens of millions of customers. At the same time, alas,
far-right groups have also taken an interest in genetic testing, using them to attack minorities
and prove their genetic `purity.' However, the relation between genetic testing and online hate
has not really been studied by the scientific community. To address this gap, we present a measurement
study shedding light on how genetic testing is discussed on Web communities in Reddit and 4chan.
We collect 1.3M comments posted over 27 months using a set of 280 keywords related to genetic testing.
We then use Latent Dirichlet Allocation, Google's Perspective API, Perceptual Hashing, and word
embeddings to identify trends, themes, and topics of discussion. Our analysis shows that genetic
testing is discussed frequently on Reddit and 4chan, and often includes highly toxic language expressed
through hateful, racist, and misogynistic comments. In particular, on 4chan's politically incorrect
board (/pol/), content from genetic testing conversations involves several alt-right personalities
and openly antisemitic memes. Finally, we find that genetic testing appears in a few unexpected
contexts, and that users seem to build groups ranging from technology enthusiasts to communities
using it to promote fringe political views.
