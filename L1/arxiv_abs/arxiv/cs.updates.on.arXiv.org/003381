The health and function of tissue rely on its vasculature network to provide reliable blood perfusion.
Volumetric imaging approaches, such as multiphoton microscopy, are able to generate detailed
3D images of blood vessels that could contribute to our understanding of the role of vascular structure
in normal physiology and in disease mechanisms. The segmentation of vessels, a core image analysis
problem, is a bottleneck that has prevented the systematic comparison of 3D vascular architecture
across experimental populations. We explored the use of convolutional neural networks to segment
3D vessels within volumetric in vivo images acquired by multiphoton microscopy. We evaluated different
network architectures and machine learning techniques in the context of this segmentation problem.
We show that our optimized convolutional neural network architecture, which we call DeepVess,
yielded a segmentation accuracy that was better than both the current state-of-the-art and a trained
human annotator, while also being orders of magnitude faster. To explore the effects of aging and
Alzheimer's disease on capillaries, we applied DeepVess to 3D images of cortical blood vessels
in young and old mouse models of Alzheimer's disease and wild type littermates. We found little difference
in the distribution of capillary diameter or tortuosity between these groups, but did note a decrease
in the number of longer capillary segments ($>75\mu m$) in aged animals as compared to young, in both
wild type and Alzheimer's disease mouse models.
