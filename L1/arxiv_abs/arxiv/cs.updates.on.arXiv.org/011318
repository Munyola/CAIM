We present improved upper bounds on the spanning ratio of constrained $\theta$-graphs with at least
6 cones and constrained Yao-graphs with 5 or at least 7 cones. Given a set of points in the plane, a Yao-graph
partitions the plane around each vertex into $m$ disjoint cones, each having aperture $\theta =
2 \pi/m$, and adds an edge to the closest vertex in each cone. Constrained Yao-graphs have the additional
property that no edge properly intersects any of the given line segment constraints. Constrained
$\theta$-graphs are similar to constrained Yao-graphs, but use a different method to determine
the closest vertex. We present tight bounds on the spanning ratio of a large family of constrained
$\theta$-graphs. We show that constrained $\theta$-graphs with $4k + 2$ ($k \geq 1$ and integer)
cones have a tight spanning ratio of $1 + 2 \sin(\theta/2)$, where $\theta$ is $2 \pi / (4k + 2)$. We
also present improved upper bounds on the spanning ratio of the other families of constrained $\theta$-graphs.
These bounds match the current upper bounds in the unconstrained setting. We also show that constrained
Yao-graphs with an even number of cones ($m \geq 8$) have spanning ratio at most $1 / ( 1 - 2 \sin (\theta/2)
)$ and constrained Yao-graphs with an odd number of cones ($m \geq 5$) have spanning ratio at most
$1 / ( 1 - 2 \sin (3\theta/8) )$. As is the case with constrained $\theta$-graphs, these bounds match
the current upper bounds in the unconstrained setting, which implies that like in the unconstrained
setting using more cones can make the spanning ratio worse.
