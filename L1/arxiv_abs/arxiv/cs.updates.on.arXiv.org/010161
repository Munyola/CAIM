To improve the experience of consumers, all social media, commerce and entertainment sites deploy
Recommendation Systems (RSs) that aim to help users locate interesting content. These RSs are black-boxes
- the way a chunk of information is filtered out and served to a user from a large information base is
mostly opaque. No one except the parent company generally has access to the entire information required
for auditing these systems - neither the details of the algorithm nor the user-item interactions
are ever made publicly available for third-party auditors. Hence auditing RSs remains an important
challenge, especially with the recent concerns about how RSs are affecting the views of the society
at large with new technical jargons like "echo chambers", "confirmation biases", "filter bubbles"
etc. in place. Many prior works have evaluated different properties of RSs such as diversity, novelty,
etc. However, most of these have focused on evaluating static snapshots of RSs. Today, auditors
are not only interested in these static evaluations on a snapshot of the system, but also interested
in how these systems are affecting the society in course of time. In this work, we propose a novel network-centric
framework which is not only able to quantify various static properties of RSs, but also is able to
quantify dynamic properties such as how likely RSs are to lead to polarization or segregation of
information among their users. We apply the framework to several popular movie RSs to demonstrate
its utility.
