We present a method for fast and accurate physics-based predictions during non-prehensile manipulation
planning and control. Given an initial state and a sequence of controls, the problem of predicting
the resulting sequence of states is a key component of a variety of model-based planning and control
algorithms. We propose combining a coarse (i.e. computationally cheap but not very accurate) predictive
physics model, with a fine (i.e. computationally expensive but accurate) predictive physics model,
to generate a hybrid model that is at the required speed and accuracy for a given manipulation task.
Our approach is based on the Parareal algorithm, a parallel-in-time integration method used for
computing numerical solutions for general systems of ordinary differential equations. We adapt
Parareal to combine a coarse pushing model with an off-the-shelf physics engine to deliver physics-based
predictions that are as accurate as the physics engine but run in substantially less wall-clock
time, thanks to parallelization across time. We use these physics-based predictions in a model-predictive-control
framework based on trajectory optimization, to plan pushing actions that avoid an obstacle and
reach a goal location. We show that with hybrid physics models, we can achieve the same success rates
as the planner that uses the off-the-shelf physics engine directly, but significantly faster.
We present experiments in simulation and on a real robotic setup. Videos are available here: https://youtu.be/5e9oTeu4JOU
