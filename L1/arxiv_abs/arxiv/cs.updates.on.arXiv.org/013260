Timing side channels pose a significant threat to the security and privacy of software applications.
We propose an approach for mitigating this problem by decreasing the strength of the side channels
as measured by entropy-based objectives, such as min-guess entropy. Our goal is to minimize the
information leaks while guaranteeing a user-specified maximal acceptable performance overhead.
We dub the decision version of this problem Shannon mitigation, and consider two variants, deterministic
and stochastic. First, we show the deterministic variant is NP-hard. However, we give a polynomial
algorithm that finds an optimal solution from a restricted set. Second, for the stochastic variant,
we develop an algorithm that uses optimization techniques specific to the entropy-based objective
used. For instance, for min-guess entropy, we used mixed integer-linear programming. We apply
the algorithm to a threat model where the attacker gets to make functional observations, that is,
where she observes the running time of the program for the same secret value combined with different
public input values. Existing mitigation approaches do not give confidentiality or performance
guarantees for this threat model. We evaluate our tool SCHMIT on a number of micro-benchmarks and
real-world applications with different entropy-based objectives. In contrast to the existing
mitigation approaches, we show that in the functional-observation threat model, SCHMIT is scalable
and able to maximize confidentiality under the performance overhead bound.
