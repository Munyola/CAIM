Air traffic control increasingly depends on information and communication technology (ICT) to
manage traffic flow through highly congested and increasingly interdependent airspace regions.
While these systems are critical to ensuring the efficiency and safety of our airspace, they are
also increasingly vulnerable to cyber threats that could potentially lead to reduction in capacity
and/or reorganization of traffic flows. In this paper, we model various cyber threats to air traffic
control systems, and analyze how these attacks could impact the flow of aircraft through the airspace.
To perform this analysis, we consider a model for wide-area air traffic based on a dynamic queuing
network model. Then we introduce three different attacks (Route Denial of Service, Route Selection
Tampering, and Sector Denial of Service) to the air traffic control system, and explore how these
attacks manipulate the sector flows by evaluating the queue backlogs for each sector's outflows.
Furthermore, we then explore graph-level vulnerability metrics to identify the sectors that are
most vulnerable to various flow manipulations, and compare them to case-study simulations of the
various attacks. The results suggest that Route Denial of Service attacks have a significant impact
on the target sector and lead to the largest degradation to the overall air traffic flows. Furthermore,
the impact of Sector Denial of Service attack impacts are primarily confined to the target sector,
while the Route Selection Tampering impacts are mostly confined to certain aircraft.
