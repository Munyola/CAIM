A Kannada OCR, named Lipi Gnani, has been designed and developed from scratch, with the motivation
of it being able to convert printed text or poetry in Kannada script, without any restriction on vocabulary.
The training and test sets have been collected from over 35 books published between the period 1970
to 2002, and this includes books written in Halegannada and pages containing Sanskrit slokas written
in Kannada script. The coverage of the OCR is nearly complete in the sense that it recognizes all the
punctuation marks, special symbols, Indo-Arabic and Kannada numerals and also the interspersed
English words. Several minor and major original contributions have been done in developing this
OCR at the different processing stages such as binarization, line and character segmentation,
recognition and Unicode mapping. This has created a Kannada OCR that performs as good as, and in some
cases, better than the Google's Tesseract OCR, as shown by the results. To the knowledge of the authors,
this is the maiden report of a complete Kannada OCR, handling all the issues involved. Currently,
there is no dictionary based postprocessing, and the obtained results are due solely to the recognition
process. Four benchmark test databases containing scanned pages from books in Kannada, Sanskrit,
Konkani and Tulu languages, but all of them printed in Kannada script, have been created. The word
level recognition accuracy of Lipi Gnani is 4% higher on the Kannada dataset than that of Google's
Tesseract OCR, 8% higher on the datasets of Tulu and Sanskrit, and 25% higher on the Konkani dataset.
