We consider the problem of distributed secondary frequency regulation in power networks such that
stability and an optimal power allocation are attained. This is a problem that has been widely studied
in the literature, and two main control schemes have been proposed, usually referred to as 'primal-dual'
and 'distributed averaging proportional-integral (DAPI)' respectively. However, each has its
limitations, with the former requiring knowledge of uncontrollable demand, which can be difficult
to obtain in real time, and with the existing literature on the latter being based on static models
for generation and demand. We propose a novel control scheme that overcomes these issues by making
use of generation measurements in the control policy. In particular, our analysis allows distributed
stability and optimality guarantees to be deduced with practical measurement requirements and
permits a broad range of linear generation dynamics, that can be of higher order, to be incorporated
in the power network. We show how the controller parameters can be selected in a computationally
efficient way by solving appropriate linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Furthermore, we demonstrate
how the proposed analysis applies to several examples of turbine governor models. The practicality
of our analysis is demonstrated with simulations on the Northeast Power Coordinating Council (NPCC)
140-bus system that verify that our proposed controller achieves convergence to the nominal frequency
and an economically optimal power allocation.
