Consider a random access communication scenario over a channel whose operation is defined for any
number of possible transmitters. Inspired by the model recently introduced by Polyanskiy for the
Multiple Access Channel (MAC) with a fixed, known number of transmitters, we assume that the channel
is invariant to permutations on its inputs, and that all active transmitters employ identical encoders.
Unlike Polyanskiy, we consider a scenario where neither the transmitters nor the receiver know
which transmitters are active. We refer to this agnostic communication setup as the Random Access
Channel, or RAC. Limited feedback is used to ensure that the collection of active transmitters remains
fixed during each epoch. The decoder is tasked with determining from the channel output the number
of active transmitters $(k)$ and their messages but not which transmitter sent which message. The
decoding procedure occurs at a time $n_t$ depending on the decoder's estimate $t$ of the number of
active transmitters, thereby achieving a rate that varies with the number of active transmitters.
Single-bit feedback at each time $n_i, i \leq t$, enables all transmitters to determine the end of
one coding epoch and the start of the next. The central result of this work demonstrates the achievability
on a RAC of performance that is first-order optimal for the MAC in operation during each coding epoch.
While prior multiple access schemes for a fixed number of transmitters require $2^k - 1$ simultaneous
threshold rules, the proposed scheme uses a single threshold rule and achieves the same dispersion.
