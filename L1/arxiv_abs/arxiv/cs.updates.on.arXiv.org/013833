Location-based queries enable fundamental services for mobile road network travelers. While
the benefits of location-based services (LBS) are numerous, exposure of mobile travelers' location
information to untrusted LBS providers may lead to privacy breaches. In this paper, we propose StarCloak,
a utility-aware and attack-resilient approach to building a privacy-preserving query system
for mobile users traveling on road networks. StarCloak has several desirable properties. First,
StarCloak supports user-defined k-user anonymity and l-segment indistinguishability, along
with user-specified spatial and temporal utility constraints, for utility-aware and personalized
location privacy. Second, unlike conventional solutions which are indifferent to underlying
road network structure, StarCloak uses the concept of stars and proposes cloaking graphs for effective
location cloaking on road networks. Third, StarCloak achieves strong attack-resilience against
replay and query injection-based attacks through randomized star selection and pruning. Finally,
to enable scalable query processing with high throughput, StarCloak makes cost-aware star selection
decisions by considering query evaluation and network communication costs. We evaluate StarCloak
on two real-world road network datasets under various privacy and utility constraints. Results
show that StarCloak achieves improved query success rate and throughput, reduced anonymization
time and network usage, and higher attack-resilience in comparison to XStar, its most relevant
competitor.
