Owing to a growing number of attacks, the assessment of Industrial Control Systems (ICSs) has gained
in importance. An integral part of an assessment is the creation of a detailed inventory of all connected
devices, enabling vulnerability evaluations. For this purpose, scans of networks are crucial.
Active scanning, which generates irregular traffic, is a method to get an overview of connected
and active devices. Since such additional traffic may lead to an unexpected behavior of devices,
active scanning methods should be avoided in critical infrastructure networks. In such cases,
passive network monitoring offers an alternative, which is often used in conjunction with complex
deep-packet inspection techniques. There are very few publications on lightweight passive scanning
methodologies for industrial networks. In this paper, we propose a lightweight passive network
monitoring technique using an efficient Media Access Control (MAC) address-based identification
of industrial devices. Based on an incomplete set of known MAC address to device associations, the
presented method can guess correct device and vendor information. Proving the feasibility of the
method, an implementation is also introduced and evaluated regarding its efficiency. The feasibility
of predicting a specific device/vendor combination is demonstrated by having similar devices
in the database. In our ICSi testbed, we reached a host discovery rate of 100% at an identification
rate of more than 66%, outperforming the results of existing tools.
