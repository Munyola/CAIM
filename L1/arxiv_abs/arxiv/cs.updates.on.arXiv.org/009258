The success of many Internet of Things (IoT) applications relies on the ability of the network to
deliver sensing measurements from the IoT devices to the destination nodes while they are still
fresh. In this article, we provide an accessible introduction to the emerging idea of Age-of-Information
(AoI) that quantifies freshness of information and explore its possible role in the efficient design
of freshness-aware IoT. We start by summarizing the concept of AoI and its variants with emphasis
on the differences between AoI and other well-known performance metrics in the literature, such
as throughput and delay. Building on this, we explore freshness-aware IoT design for a network in
which IoT devices sense potentially different physical processes and are supposed to frequently
update the status of these processes at a destination node (such as a cellular base station). Inspired
by the recent interest, we also assume that these IoT devices are powered by wireless energy transfer
by the destination node. For this setting, we investigate the optimal sampling policy for IoT devices
that minimizes long-term weighted sum-AoI. This policy jointly optimizes wireless energy transfer
and scheduling of update packet transmissions from IoT devices. Using this, we also characterize
the achievable AoI region and demonstrate a fundamental trade-off between achieving fairness
among different processes and achieving the minimum sum-AoI. Multiple promising directions for
future research and extensions for our proposed system setup are presented.
