The characteristics of mobile Underwater Sensor Networks (UWSNs), such as low communication bandwidth,
large propagation delay, and sparse deployment, pose challenging issues for successful localization
of sensor nodes. In addition, sensor nodes in UWSNs are usually powered by batteries whose replacements
introduce high cost and complexity. Thus, the critical problem in UWSNs is to enable each sensor
node to find enough anchor nodes in order to localize itself, with minimum energy costs. In this paper,
an Energy-Efficient Localization Algorithm (EELA) is proposed to analyze the decentralized interactions
among sensor nodes and anchor nodes. A Single-Leader-Multi-Follower Stackelberg game is utilized
to formulate the topology control problem of sensor nodes and anchor nodes by exploiting their available
communication opportunities. In this game, the sensor node acts as a leader taking into account
factors such as 'two-hop' anchor nodes and energy consumption, while anchor nodes act as multiple
followers, considering their ability to localize sensor nodes and their energy consumption. We
prove that both players select best responses and reach a socially optimal Stackelberg Nash Equilibrium.
Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed EELA improves the perfor- mance of localization
in UWSNs significantly, and in particular the energy cost of sensor nodes. Compared to the baseline
schemes, the energy consumption per node is about 48% lower in EELA, while providing a desirable
localization coverage, under reasonable error and delay.
