We consider the problem of designing distributed controllers to guarantee dissipativity of a networked
system comprised of dynamically coupled subsystems. Additionally, we require that the control
synthesis is carried out locally at the subsystem-level, without explicit knowledge of the dynamics
of other subsystems in the network. We solve this problem in two steps. First, we provide an approach
to decompose a dissipativity condition on the networked dynamical system into equivalent conditions
on the dissipativity of individual subsystems. We then use these distributed dissipativity conditions
to synthesize controllers locally at the subsystem-level, using only the knowledge of the dynamics
of that subsystem, and limited information about the dissipativity of the subsystems to which it
is dynamically coupled. We show that the subsystem-level controllers synthesized in this manner
are sufficient to guarantee dissipativity of the networked dynamical system. We also provide an
approach to make this synthesis compositional, that is, when a new subsystem is added to an existing
network, only the dynamics of the new subsystem, and information about the dissipativity of the
subsystems in the existing network to which it is coupled are used to design a controller for the new
subsystem, while guaranteeing dissipativity of the networked system including the new subsystem.
Finally, we demonstrate the application of this synthesis in enabling plug-and-play operations
of generators in a microgrid by extending our results to networked switched systems.
