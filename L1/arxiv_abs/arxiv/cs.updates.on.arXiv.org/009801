Smartphone based travel data collection has become an important tool for the analysis of transportation
systems. Interest in sharing travel survey data has gained popularity in recent years as "Open Data
Initiatives" by governments seek to allow the public to use these data, and hopefully be able to contribute
their findings and analysis to the public sphere. The public release of such precise information,
particularly location data such as place of residence, opens the risk of privacy violation. At the
same time, in order for such data to be useful, as much spatial resolution as possible is desirable
for utility in transportation applications and travel demand modeling. This paper evaluates geographic
random perturbation methods (i.e. Geo-indistinguishability and the Donut geomask) in protecting
the privacy of respondents whose residential location may be published. We measure the performance
of location privacy methods, preservation of utility and randomness in the distribution of perturbation
distances with varying parameters. It is found that both methods produce distributions of spatial
perturbations that conform closely to common probability distributions and as a result, that the
original locations can be inferred with little information and a high degree of precision. It is
also found that while Achieved K-estimate anonymity increases linearly with desired anonymity
for the Donut geomask, Geo-Indistinguishability is highly dependent upon its privacy budget factor
(epsilon) and is not very effective at assuring desired Achieved K-estimate anonymity.
