The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) gives control of personal data back to the owners
by appointing higher requirements and obligations on service providers (SPs) who manage and process
personal data. As the verification of GDPR-compliance, handled by a supervisory authority, is
irregularly conducted; it is challenging to be certify that an SP has been continuously adhering
to the GDPR. Furthermore, it is beyond the data owner's capability to perceive whether an SP complies
with the GDPR and effectively protects her personal data. This motivates us to envision a design
concept for developing a GDPR-compliant personal data management platform leveraging the emerging
blockchain (BC) and smart contract technologies. The goals of the platform are to provide decentralised
mechanisms to both SPs and data owners for processing personal data; meanwhile empower data provenance
and transparency by leveraging advanced features of the BC. The platform enables data owners to
impose data usage consent, ensures only designated parties can process personal data, and logs
all data activities in an immutable distributed ledger using smart contract and cryptography techniques.
By honestly participating in the platform, an SP can be endorsed by the BC network that it is fully
GDPR-compliant; otherwise any violation is immutably recorded and is easily figured out by associated
parties. We then demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed design concept by developing
a profile management platform implemented on top of a permissioned BC framework, following by valuable
analysis and discussion.
