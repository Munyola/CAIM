Deep learning techniques are rapidly advanced recently, and becoming a necessity component for
widespread systems. However, the inference process of deep learning is black-box, and not very
suitable to safety-critical systems which must exhibit high transparency. In this paper, to address
this black-box limitation, we develop a simple analysis method which consists of 1) structural
feature analysis: lists of the features contributing to inference process, 2) linguistic feature
analysis: lists of the natural language labels describing the visual attributes for each feature
contributing to inference process, and 3) consistency analysis: measuring consistency among
input data, inference (label), and the result of our structural and linguistic feature analysis.
Our analysis is simplified to reflect the actual inference process for high transparency, whereas
it does not include any additional black-box mechanisms such as LSTM for highly human readable results.
We conduct experiments and discuss the results of our analysis qualitatively and quantitatively,
and come to believe that our work improves the transparency of neural networks. Evaluated through
12,800 human tasks, 75% workers answer that input data and result of our feature analysis are consistent,
and 70% workers answer that inference (label) and result of our feature analysis are consistent.
In addition to the evaluation of the proposed analysis, we find that our analysis also provide suggestions,
or possible next actions such as expanding neural network complexity or collecting training data
to improve a neural network.
