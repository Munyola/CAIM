Demand response (DR) is not only a crucial solution to the demand side management but also a vital
means of electricity market in maintaining power grid reliability, sustainability and stability.
DR can enable consumers (e.g. data centers) to reduce their electricity consumption when the supply
of electricity is a shortage. The consumers will be rewarded in the case of DR if they reduce or shift
some of their energy usage during peak hours. Aiming at solving the efficiency of DR, in this paper,
we present MEDR, a mechanism on emergency DR in colocation data center. First, we formalize the MEDR
problem and propose a dynamic programming to solve the optimization version of the problem. We then
design a deterministic mechanism as a solution to solve the MEDR problem. We show that our proposed
mechanism is truthful. Next, we prove that our mechanism is an FPTAS, i.e., it can be approximated
within $1 + \epsilon$ for any given $\epsilon > 0$, while the running time of our mechanism is polynomial
in $n$ and $1/\epsilon$, where $n$ is the number of tenants in the datacenter. Furthermore, we also
give an auction system covering the efficient FPTAS algorithm as bidding decision program for DR
in colocation datacenter. Finally, we choose a practical smart grid dataset to build a large number
of datasets for simulation in performance evaluation. By evaluating metrics of the approximation
ratio of our mechanism, the non-negative utility of tenants and social cost of colocation datacenter,
the results demonstrate the effectiveness of our work.
