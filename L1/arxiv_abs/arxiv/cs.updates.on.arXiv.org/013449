OpenCitations is a scholarly infrastructure organization dedicated to open scholarship and the
publication of open bibliographic and citation data as Linked Open Data using Semantic Web technologies,
to the development of software tools and services that enable convenient access to these open data,
and to community advocacy for open citations. This paper describes OpenCitations and its datasets,
tools, services and activities. It introduces the OpenCitations Data Model and the SPAR (Semantic
Publishing and Referencing) Ontologies for encoding scholarly bibliographic and citation data
in RDF, and OpenCitations' open software of generic applicability for searching, browsing and
providing REST APIs over RDF triplestores. It describes Open Citation Identifiers (OCIs), globally
unique and persistent identifiers for bibliographic citations, and the OpenCitations OCI Resolution
Service that returns bibliographic and citation metadata when queried with an OCI. And it describes
the OpenCitations Corpus (OCC), a database of open downloadable bibliographic and citation data
harvested from bibliographic references in the scholarly literature and made available in RDF
under a Creative Commons public domain dedication. Finally, it outlines the Open Citation Indexes
of citation data openly available in third-party bibliographic databases that OpenCitations
is currently making available as Linked Open Datasets accessible via its REST API, of which the first
and largest is COCI, the OpenCitations Index of Crossref DOI-to-DOI Citations which currently
contains over 445 million bibliographic citations.
