Wi-Fi channel state information (CSI) has emerged as a plausible modality for sensing different
human activities as a function of modulations in the wireless signal that travels between wireless
devices. Until now, most research has taken a statistical approach and/or purpose-built inference
pipeline. Although interesting, these approaches struggle to sustain sensing performances beyond
experimental conditions. As such, the full potential of CSI as a general-purpose sensing modality
is yet to be realised. We argue a universal approach with well-grounded formalisation is necessary
to characterise the relationship between wireless channel modulations (spatial and temporal)
and human movement. To this end, we present a formalism for quantifying the changing part of the wireless
signal modulated by human motion. Grounded in this formalisation, we then present a new subspace
tracking technique to describe the channel statistics in an interpretable way, which succinctly
contains the human modulated part of the channel. We characterise the signal and noise subspaces
for the case of uncontrolled human movement, and show that these subspaces are dynamic. Our results
demonstrate that proposed channel statistics alone can robustly reproduce state-of-the-art
application-specific feature engineering baseline, however, across multiple usage scenarios.
We expect, our universal channel statistics will yield an effective general-purpose featurisation
of wireless channel measurements and will uncover opportunities for applying CSI for a variety
of human sensing applications in a robust way.
