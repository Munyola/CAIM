Given the reach of web platforms, bad actors have considerable incentives to manipulate and defraud
users at the expense of platform integrity. This has spurred research in numerous suspicious behavior
detection tasks, including detection of sybil accounts, false information, and payment scams/fraud.
In this paper, we draw the insight that many such initiatives can be tackled in a common framework
by posing a detection task which seeks to find groups of entities which share too many properties
with one another across multiple attributes (sybil accounts created at the same time and location,
propaganda spreaders broadcasting articles with the same rhetoric and with similar reshares,
etc.) Our work makes four core contributions: Firstly, we posit a novel formulation of this task
as a multi-view graph mining problem, in which distinct views reflect distinct attribute similarities
across entities, and contextual similarity and attribute importance are respected. Secondly,
we propose a novel suspiciousness metric for scoring entity groups given the abnormality of their
synchronicity across multiple views, which obeys intuitive desiderata that existing metrics
do not. Finally, we propose the SliceNDice algorithm which enables efficient extraction of highly
suspicious entity groups, and demonstrate its practicality in production, in terms of strong detection
performance and discoveries on Snapchat's large advertiser ecosystem (89% precision and numerous
discoveries of real fraud rings), marked outperformance of baselines (over 97% precision/recall
in simulated settings) and linear scalability.
