Which characteristics distinguish liars from truth-tellers? Recent research has explored "when"
and "why" people lie. Yet little is known about "who" lies. Previous studies have found mixed results
about the effect of gender on deception, and they have largely neglected the role of other characteristics,
such as age and level of education. To shed light on these questions, here I report a meta-analysis
of 8,728 distinct observations, collected in 65 Sender-Receiver game treatments, by 14 research
groups. I find that: (i) males are significantly more likely than females to tell black lies (lies
that benefit the liar at a cost for another person, N=4,161); (ii) males are significantly more likely
than females to tell altruistic white lies (lies that benefit another person at a cost for the liar,
N=2,940); (iii) males are marginally significantly more likely than females to tell Pareto white
lies (lies that benefit both the liar and another person, N=1,627); (iv) age has a significant positive
effect on honesty in the case of black lies, but only among people in the older half of the sample (age>29);
(v) age has no effect on the decision to tell altruistic white lies; (vi) age has no effect on the decision
to tell Pareto white lies; (vii) educated subjects are significantly more likely than non-educated
subjects to tell black lies; (viii) the level of education has no effect on the decision to tell altruistic
white lies; (ix) the level of education has a mixed effect on the decision to tell Pareto white lies.
