Modern automobiles are entirely controlled by electronic circuits and programs which undoubtedly
exposes them to the threat of cyberattacks. Alongside, there is a potential for massive growth in
electric vehicle (EV) adoption. The cyber vulnerabilities are magnified with electric vehicles
because of the unique and critical risks that entail most EV batteries. EV battery packs provide
'limited driving range' and have 'finite lifetime', and there is widespread anxiety regarding
range and life. In this study, we develop a systematic framework to model cyberattacks on auxiliary
components and identify the consequent impact on EV batteries. We model the possible cyberattacks
on auxiliary components by engaging them in various 'modes' and analyze the impact on battery packs
described through a physics-driven experimentally-validated model that accurately captures
battery dynamics and degradation. In the short-term, cyberattacks could deplete a battery pack
by up to 20% per hour and completely drain the available range. The EV battery pack is most vulnerable
to cyberattacks when it is fully charged due to the influence of state-of-charge (SOC) on the battery
health. For long-term impact, we explore the location effect of attack and identify that cyberattacks
could cause a 3-fold increase in the internal resistance (an indicator of cycle life) in cold regions
versus hot regions. We believe that the methodology and the approach presented will help in building
the foundational principles for cyber-security in the context of electric vehicles; a very nascent
but crucially important topic in the coming years.
