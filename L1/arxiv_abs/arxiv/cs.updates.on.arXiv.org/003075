Voice input has been tremendously improving the user experience of mobile devices by freeing our
hands from typing on the small screen. Speech recognition is the key technology that powers voice
input, and it is usually outsourced to the cloud for the best performance. However, the cloud might
compromise users' privacy by identifying their identities by voice, learning their sensitive
input content via speech recognition, and then profiling the mobile users based on the content.
In this paper, we design an intermediate between users and the cloud, named VoiceMask, to sanitize
users' voice data before sending it to the cloud for speech recognition. We analyze the potential
privacy risks and aim to protect users' identities and sensitive input content from being disclosed
to the cloud. VoiceMask adopts a carefully designed voice conversion mechanism that is resistant
to several attacks. Meanwhile, it utilizes an evolution-based keyword substitution technique
to sanitize the voice input content. The two sanitization phases are all performed in the resource-limited
mobile device while still maintaining the usability and accuracy of the cloud-supported speech
recognition service. We implement the voice sanitizer on Android systems and present extensive
experimental results that validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our app. It is demonstrated
that we are able to reduce the chance of a user's voice being identified from 50 people by 84% while
keeping the drop of speech recognition accuracy within 14.2%.
