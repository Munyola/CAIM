Telemedicine refers to the use of information and communication technology to assist with medical
information and services. In health care applications, high reliable communication links between
the health care provider and the desired destination in the human body play a central role in designing
end-to-end (E2E) telemedicine system. In the advanced health care applications, $\text{e.g.}$
drug delivery, molecular communication becomes a major building block in bio-nano-medical applications.
In this paper, an E2E communication link consisting of the electromagnetic and the molecular link
is investigated. This paradigm is crucial when the body is a part of the communication system. Based
on the quality of service (QoS) metrics, we present a closed-form expression for the E2E BER of the
combination of molecular and wireless electromagnetic communications. \textcolor{black}{
Next, we formulate an optimization problem with the aim of minimizing the E2E BER of the system to
achieve the optimal symbol duration for EC and DMC regarding the imposing delivery time from telemedicine
services.} The proposed problem is solved by an iterative algorithm based on the bisection method.
Also, we study the impact of the system parameters, including drift velocity, detection threshold
at the receiver in molecular communication, on the performance of the system. Numerical results
show that the proposed method obtains the minimum E2E bit error probability by selecting an appropriate
symbol duration of electromagnetic and molecular communications.
