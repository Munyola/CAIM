Energy-harvesting-powered computing offers intriguing and vast opportunities to dramatically
transform the landscape of the Internet of Things (IoT) devices by utilizing ambient sources of
energy to achieve battery-free computing. In order to operate within the restricted energy capacity
and intermittency profile, it is proposed to innovate Intermittent Robust Computation (IRC) Unit
as a new duty-cycle-variable computing approach leveraging the non-volatility inherent in spin-based
switching devices. The foundations of IRC will be advanced from the device-level upwards, by extending
a Spin Hall Effect Magnetic Tunnel Junction (SHE-MTJ) device. The device will then be used to realize
SHE-MTJ Majority/Polymorphic Gate (MG/PG) logic approaches and libraries. Then a Logic-Embedded
Flip-Flop (LE-FF) is developed to realize rudimentary Boolean logic functions along with an inherent
state-holding capability within a compact footprint. Finally, the NV-Clustering synthesis procedure
and corresponding tool module are proposed to instantiate the LE-FF library cells within conventional
Register Transfer Language (RTL) specifications. This selectively clusters together logic and
NV state-holding functionality, based on energy and area minimization criteria. It also realizes
middleware-coherent, intermittent computation without checkpointing, micro-tasking, or software
bloat and energy overheads vital to IoT. Simulation results for various benchmark circuits including
ISCAS-89 validate functionality and power dissipation, area, and delay benefits.
