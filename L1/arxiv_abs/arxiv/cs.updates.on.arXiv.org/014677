Many scientific applications require the solution of large initial-value problems, such as those
produced by the method of lines after semi-discretization in space of partial differential equations.
The computational cost of implicit time discretizations is dominated by the solution of nonlinear
systems of equations at each time step. In order to decrease this cost, the recently developed Rosenbrock-Krylov
(ROK) time integration methods extend the classical linearly-implicit Rosenbrock(-W) methods,
and make use of a Krylov subspace approximation to the Jacobian computed via an Arnoldi process.
Since the ROK order conditions rely on the construction of a single Krylov space, no restarting of
the Arnoldi process is allowed, and the iterations quickly become expensive with increasing subspace
dimensions. This work extends the ROK framework to make use of the Lanczos biorthogonalization
procedure for constructing Jacobian approximations. The resulting new family of methods is named
biorthogonal ROK (BOROK). The Lanczos procedure's short two-term recurrence allows BOROK methods
to utilize larger subspaces for the Jacobian approximation, resulting in increased numerical
stability of the time integration at a reduced computational cost. Adaptive subspace size selection
and basis extension procedures are also developed for the new schemes. Numerical experiments show
that for stiff problems, where a large subspace used to approximate the Jacobian is required for
stability, the BOROK methods outperform the original ROK methods.
