One of the most prominent problems in machine learning in the age of deep learning is the availability
of sufficiently large annotated datasets. While for standard problem domains (ImageNet classification),
appropriate datasets exist, for specific domains, \eg classification of animal species, a long-tail
distribution means that some classes are observed and annotated insufficiently. Challenges like
iNaturalist show that there is a strong interest in species recognition. Acquiring additional
labels can be prohibitively expensive. First, since domain experts need to be involved, and second,
because acquisition of new data might be costly. Although there exist methods for data augmentation,
which not always lead to better performance of the classifier, there is more additional information
available that is to the best of our knowledge not exploited accordingly. In this paper, we propose
to make use of existing class hierarchies like WordNet to integrate additional domain knowledge
into classification. We encode the properties of such a class hierarchy into a probabilistic model.
From there, we derive a special label encoding together with a corresponding loss function. Using
a convolutional neural network, on the ImageNet and NABirds datasets our method offers a relative
improvement of 10.4% and 9.6% in accuracy over the baseline respectively. After less than a third
of training time, it is already able to match the baseline's fine-grained recognition performance.
Both results show that our suggested method is efficient and effective.
