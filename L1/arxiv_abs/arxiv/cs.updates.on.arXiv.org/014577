We customize an end-to-end image compression framework for retina OCT images based on deep convolutional
neural networks (CNNs). The customized compression scheme consists of three parts: data Preprocessing,
compression CNNs, and reconstruction CNNs. Data preprocessing module reduces the speckle noise
of the OCT images and the segments out the region of interest. We added customized skip connections
between the compression CNNs and the reconstruction CNNs to reserve the detail information and
trained the two nets together with the semantic segmented image patches from data preprocessing
module. To train the two networks sensitive to both low frequency information and high frequency
information, we adopted an objective function with two parts: A PatchGAN discriminator to judge
the high frequency information and a differentiable MS-SSIM penalty to evaluate the low frequency
information. The proposed framework was trained and evaluated on a publicly available OCT dataset.
The evaluation showed above 99% similarity in terms of multi-scale structural similarity (MS-SSIM)
when the compression ratio is as high as 40. Furthermore, the reconstructed images of compression
ratio 80 from the proposed framework even have better quality than that of compression ratio 20 from
JPEG by visual comparison. The testing result outperforms JPEG in term of both of MS-SSIM and visualization,
which is more obvious as the increase of compression ratio. Our preliminary result indicates the
huge potential of deep neural networks on customized medical image compression.
