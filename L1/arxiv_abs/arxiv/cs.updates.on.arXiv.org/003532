Group Testing (GT) addresses the problem of identifying a small subset of defective items from a
large population, by grouping items into as few test pools as possible. In Adaptive GT (AGT), outcomes
of previous tests can influence the makeup of future tests. This scenario has been studied from an
information theoretic point of view. Aldridge $2012$ showed that in the regime of a few defectives,
adaptivity does not help much, as the number of tests required for identification of the set of defectives
is essentially the same as for non-adaptive GT. Secure GT considers a scenario where there is an eavesdropper
who may observe a fraction $\delta$ of the outcomes, and should not be able to infer the status of the
items. In the non-adaptive scenario, the number of tests required is $1/(1-\delta)$ times the number
of tests without the secrecy constraint. In this paper, we consider Secure Adaptive GT. Specifically,
when an adaptive algorithm has access to a private feedback link of rate $R_f$, we prove that the number
of tests required for both correct reconstruction at the legitimate user, with high probability,
and negligible mutual information at the eavesdropper is $1/min\{1,1-\delta+R_f\}$ times the
number of tests required with no secrecy constraint. Thus, unlike non-secure GT, where an adaptive
algorithm has only a mild impact, under a security constraint it can significantly boost performance.
A key insight is that not only the adaptive link should disregard test results and send keys, these
keys should be enhanced through a "secret sharing" scheme before usage.
