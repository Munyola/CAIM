Inspired by the success of deploying deep learning in the fields of Computer Vision and Natural Language
Processing, this learning paradigm has also found its way into the field of Music Information Retrieval.
In order to benefit from deep learning in an effective, but also efficient manner, deep transfer
learning has become a common approach. In this approach, it is possible to reuse the output of a pre-trained
neural network as the basis for a new learning task. The underlying hypothesis is that if the initial
and new learning tasks show commonalities and are applied to the same type of input data (e.g. music
audio), the generated deep representation of the data is also informative for the new task. Since,
however, most of the networks used to generate deep representations are trained using a single initial
learning source, the validity of the above hypothesis is questionable for an arbitrary future task.
In this paper, we present the results of our investigation of what the most important factor to generate
deep representations for the data and learning tasks in the music domain. We conducted this investigation
via an extensive empirical study that involves multiple learning sources, as well as multiple deep
learning architectures with varying levels of information sharing between sources, in order to
learn music representations. We then validate these representations considering multiple target
datasets for evaluation. The results of our experiments yield several insights on how to approach
the design of methods for learning widely deployable deep data representations in the music domain.
