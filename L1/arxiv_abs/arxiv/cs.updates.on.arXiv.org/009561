With the rapid expansion of applied 3D computational vision, shape descriptors have become increasingly
important for a wide variety of applications and objects from molecules to planets. Appropriate
shape descriptors are critical for accurate (and efficient) shape retrieval and 3D model classification.
Several spectral-based shape descriptors have been introduced by solving various physical equations
over a 3D surface model. In this paper, for the first time, we incorporate a specific group of techniques
in statistics and machine learning, known as manifold learning, to develop a global shape descriptor
in the computer graphics domain. The proposed descriptor utilizes the Laplacian Eigenmap technique
in which the Laplacian eigenvalue problem is discretized using an exponential weighting scheme.
As a result, our descriptor eliminates the limitations tied to the existing spectral descriptors,
namely dependency on triangular mesh representation and high intra-class quality of 3D models.
We also present a straightforward normalization method to obtain a scale-invariant descriptor.
The extensive experiments performed in this study show that the present contribution provides
a highly discriminative and robust shape descriptor under the presence of a high level of noise,
random scale variations, and low sampling rate, in addition to the known isometric-invariance
property of the Laplace-Beltrami operator. The proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art
algorithms on several non-rigid shape retrieval benchmarks.
