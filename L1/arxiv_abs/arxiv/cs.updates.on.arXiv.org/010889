The need for countering Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) attacks has led to the solutions that ubiquitously
monitor system activities in each enterprise host, and perform timely abnormal system behavior
detection over the stream of monitoring data. However, existing stream-based solutions lack explicit
language constructs for expressing anomaly models that capture abnormal system behaviors, thus
facing challenges in incorporating expert knowledge to perform timely anomaly detection over
the large-scale monitoring data. To address these limitations, we build SAQL, a novel stream-based
query system that takes as input, a real-time event feed aggregated from multiple hosts in an enterprise,
and provides an anomaly query engine that queries the event feed to identify abnormal behaviors
based on the specified anomaly models. SAQL provides a domain-specific query language, Stream-based
Anomaly Query Language (SAQL), that uniquely integrates critical primitives for expressing major
types of anomaly models. In the demo, we aim to show the complete usage scenario of SAQL by (1) performing
an APT attack in a controlled environment, and (2) using SAQL to detect the abnormal behaviors in
real time by querying the collected stream of system monitoring data that contains the attack traces.
The audience will have the option to perform the APT attack themselves under our guidance, and interact
with the system and detect the attack footprints in real time via issuing queries and checking the
query results through a command-line UI.
