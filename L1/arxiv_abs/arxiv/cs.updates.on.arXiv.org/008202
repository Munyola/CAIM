While bibliometrics are widely used for research evaluation purposes, a common theoretical framework
for conceptually understanding, empirically studying, and effectively teaching its usage is
lacking. In this paper we develop such a framework: the fast-and-frugal heuristics research program,
proposed originally in the context of the cognitive and decision sciences, lends itself particularly
well for understanding and investigating the usage of bibliometrics in research evaluations.
Such evaluations represent judgments under uncertainty in which typically neither all possible
outcomes, nor their consequences and probabilities are known. In such situations of incomplete
information, candidate descriptive and prescriptive models of human behavior are heuristics.
Heuristics are simple strategies that, by exploiting the structure of environments, can aid people
to make smart decisions. Relying on heuristics does not mean trading off accuracy against effort:
while reducing complexity, heuristics can yield better decisions than more information-greedy
procedures in many decision environments. The prescriptive power of heuristics is well-documented
in a large literature, cutting across medicine, crime, business, sports, and other domains. We
outline the fast-and-frugal research program, provide examples of past empirical work on heuristics
outside the field of bibliometrics, explain why heuristics may be especially suitable for studying
the usage of bibliometrics, and propose a corresponding conceptual framework.
