This paper addresses receiver (RX) signal processing in multi-user multiple-input multiple-output
(MU-MIMO) systems. We focus on uplink orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA)-based
MU-MIMO communications under in-phase quadrature-phase (I/Q) imbalance in the associated radio
frequency electronics. It is shown in the existing literature that transceiver I/Q imbalances
cause cross-talk of mirror-subcarriers in OFDM systems. Opposed to typically reported single-user
studies, we extend the studies to OFDMA-based MU-MIMO communications and incorporate also external
interference from multiple sources at RX input, for modeling challenging conditions in increasingly
popular heterogeneous networks. In the signal processing developments, we exploit the augmented
subcarrier processing, which processes each subcarrier jointly with its counterpart at the image
subcarrier, and jointly across all RX antennas. Furthermore, we derive optimal augmented linear
RX in terms of minimizing the mean-squared error. Extensive numerical results show the signal-to-interference-plus-noise
ratio as a function of different system and impairment parameters. Based on the results, the performance
of the conventional per-subcarrier processing is heavily limited under transceiver I/Q imbalances,
and is particularly sensitive to external interferers, whereas the proposed augmented subcarrier
processing provides a high-performance signal processing solution being able to detect the signals
of different users as well as suppress external interference efficiently.
