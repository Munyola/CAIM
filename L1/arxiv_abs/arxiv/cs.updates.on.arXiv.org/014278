Image inpainting aims at restoring missing region of corrupted images, which has many applications
such as image restoration and object removal. However, current GAN-based inpainting models fail
to explicitly consider the semantic consistency between restored images and original images.
Forexample, given a male image with image region of one eye missing, current models may restore it
with a female eye. This is due to the ambiguity of GAN-based inpainting models: these models can generate
many possible restorations given a missing region. To address this limitation, our key insight
is that semantically interpretable information (such as attribute and segmentation information)
of input images (with missing regions) can provide essential guidance for the inpainting process.
Based on this insight, we propose a boosted GAN with semantically interpretable information for
image inpainting that consists of an inpainting network and a discriminative network. The inpainting
network utilizes two auxiliary pretrained networks to discover the attribute and segmentation
information of input images and incorporates them into the inpainting process to provide explicit
semantic-level guidance. The discriminative network adopts a multi-level design that can enforce
regularizations not only on overall realness but also on attribute and segmentation consistency
with the original images. Experimental results show that our proposed model can preserve consistency
on both attribute and segmentation level, and significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art
models.
