Representation learning provides new and powerful graph analytical approaches and tools for the
highly valued data science challenge of mining knowledge graphs. Since previous graph analytical
methods have mostly focused on homogeneous graphs, an important current challenge is extending
this methodology for richly heterogeneous graphs and knowledge domains. The biomedical sciences
are such a domain, reflecting the complexity of biology, with entities such as genes, proteins,
drugs, diseases, and phenotypes, and relationships such as gene co-expression, biochemical regulation,
and biomolecular inhibition or activation. Therefore, the semantics of edges and nodes are critical
for representation learning and knowledge discovery in real world biomedical problems. In this
paper, we propose the edge2vec model, which represents graphs considering edge semantics. An edge-type
transition matrix is trained by an Expectation-Maximization approach, and a stochastic gradient
descent model is employed to learn node embedding on a heterogeneous graph via the trained transition
matrix. edge2vec is validated on three biomedical domain tasks: biomedical entity classification,
compound-gene bioactivity prediction, and biomedical information retrieval. Results show that
by considering edge-types into node embedding learning in heterogeneous graphs, \textbf{edge2vec}\
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models on all three tasks. We propose this method
for its added value relative to existing graph analytical methodology, and in the real world context
of biomedical knowledge discovery applicability.
