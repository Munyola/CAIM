The application of rough set theory in incomplete information systems is a key problem in practice
since missing values almost always occur in knowledge acquisition due to the error of data measuring,
the limitation of data collection, or the limitation of data comprehension, etc. An incomplete
information system is mainly processed by compressing the indiscernibility relation. The existing
rough set extension models based on tolerance or symmetric similarity relations typically discard
one relation among the reflexive, symmetric and transitive relations, especially the transitive
relation. In order to overcome the limitations of the current rough set extension models, we define
a new relation called the positive transitive relation and then propose a novel rough set extension
model built upon which. The new model holds the merit of the existing rough set extension models while
avoids their limitations of discarding transitivity or symmetry. In comparison to the existing
extension models, the proposed model has a better performance in processing the incomplete information
systems while substantially reducing the computational complexity, taking into account the relation
of tolerance and similarity of positive transitivity, and supplementing the related theories
in accordance to the intuitive classification of incomplete information. In summary, the positive
transitive relation can improve current theoretical analysis of incomplete information systems
and the newly proposed extension model is more suitable for processing incomplete information
systems and has a broad application prospect.
