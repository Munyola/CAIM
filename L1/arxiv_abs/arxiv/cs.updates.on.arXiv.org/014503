Recent advances in Session-based recommender systems have gained attention due to their potential
of providing real-time personalized recommendations with high recall, especially when compared
to traditional methods like matrix factorization and item-based collaborative filtering. Nowadays,
two of the most recent methods are Short-Term Attention/Memory Priority Model for Session-based
Recommendation (STAMP) and Neural Attentive Session-based Recommendation (NARM). However,
when these two methods were applied in the similar-item recommendation dataset of Zalando (Fashion-Similar),
they did not work out-of-the-box compared to a simple Collaborative-Filtering approach. Aiming
for improving the similar-item recommendation, we propose to concentrate efforts on enhancing
the rank of the few most relevant items from the original recommendations, by employing the information
of the session of the user encoded by an attention network. The efficacy of this strategy was confirmed
when using a novel Candidate Rank Embedding that encodes the global ranking information of each
candidate in the re-ranking process. Experimental results in Fashion-Similar show significant
improvements over the baseline on Recall and MRR at 20, as well as improvements in Click Through Rate
based on an online test. Additionally, it is important to point out from the evaluation that was performed
the potential of this method on the next click prediction problem because when applied to STAMP and
NARM, it improves the Recall and MRR at 20 on two publicly available real-world datasets.
