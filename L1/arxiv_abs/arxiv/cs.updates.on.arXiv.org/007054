In the age of cloud computing, cloud users with a limited amount of storage can outsource their data
to remote servers. The cloud servers, in lieu of monetary benefits, offer retrievability of their
clients' data at any point of time. A client's data can be dynamic (or static) in nature depending
on whether the client can (or cannot) update the uploaded data as needed. Secure cloud storage protocols
enable a client to check the integrity of her outsourced data by auditing the data. In this work, we
explore the possibility of constructing a secure cloud storage for dynamic data by leveraging the
idea of secure network coding. We show that some of the secure network coding schemes can be used to
construct efficient secure cloud storage protocols for dynamic data, and we construct such a secure
cloud storage protocol (DSCS I) based on a secure network coding protocol. To the best of our knowledge,
DSCS I is the first secure cloud storage protocol for dynamic data that is based on a secure network
coding protocol and that is secure in the standard model. Although generic dynamic data support
arbitrary insertions, deletions and modifications, append-only data find numerous applications
in the real world and have been already deployed for various log structures. Thus, we provide another
construction of a secure cloud storage protocol (DSCS II) specific to append-only data --- that
overcomes some limitations of DSCS I. We compare the asymptotic performance of DSCS I and DSCS II
with that of other secure cloud storage schemes.
