Recent spectral graph sparsification research allows constructing nearly-linear-sized subgraphs
that can well preserve the spectral (structural) properties of the original graph, such as the the
first few eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the graph Laplacian, leading to the development of a variety
of nearly-linear time numerical and graph algorithms. However, there is not a unified approach
that allows for truly-scalable spectral sparsification of both directed and undirected graphs.
For the first time, this paper proves the existence of linear-sized spectral sparsifiers for general
directed graphs, and introduces a practically-efficient yet unified spectral graph sparsification
approach that allows sparsifying real-world, large-scale directed and undirected graphs with
guaranteed preservation of the original graph spectra. By exploiting a highly-scalable (nearly-linear
complexity) spectral matrix perturbation analysis framework for constructing nearly-linear
sized (directed) subgraphs, it enables to well preserve the key eigenvalues and eigenvectors of
the original (directed) graph Laplacians. Compared with prior works that are limited to only strongly-connected
directed graphs, the proposed approach is more general and thus will allow for truly-scalable spectral
sparsification of a much wider range of real-world complex graphs. The proposed method has been
validated using various kinds of directed graphs obtained from public domain sparse matrix collections,
showing promising spectral sparsification and partitioning results for general directed graphs.
