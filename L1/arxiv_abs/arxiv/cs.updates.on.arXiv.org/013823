In this paper, we revisit the Minimum Enclosing Ball (MEB) problem and its robust version, MEB with
outliers, in Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^d$. Though the problem has been extensively studied
before, most of the existing algorithms need at least linear time (in the number of input points $n$
and the dimensionality $d$) to achieve a $(1+\epsilon)$-approximation. Motivated by some recent
developments on beyond worst-case analysis, we introduce the notion of stability for MEB (with
outliers), which is natural and easy to understand. Under the stability assumption, we present
two sampling algorithms for computing approximate MEB with sample complexities independent of
the number of input points; further, we achieve the first sub-linear time single-criterion approximation
algorithm for the MEB with outliers problem. Our result can be viewed as a new step along the direction
of beyond worst-case analysis. We also show that our ideas can be extended to be more general techniques,
a novel uniform-adaptive sampling method and a sandwich lemma, for solving the general case of MEB
with outliers ({\em i.e.,} without the stability assumption) and the problem of $k$-center clustering
with outliers. We achieve sub-linear time bi-criteria approximation algorithms for these problems
respectively; the algorithms have sample sizes independent of the number of points $n$ and the dimensionality
$d$, which significantly improve the time complexities of existing algorithms. We expect that
our technique will be applicable to design sub-linear time algorithms for other shape fitting with
outliers problems.
