Voltage collapse is a type of blackout-inducing dynamic instability that occurs when the power
demand exceeds the maximum power that can be transferred through the network. The traditional (preventive)
approach to avoid voltage collapse is based on ensuring that the network never reaches its maximum
capacity. However, such an approach leads to inefficiencies as it prevents operators to fully utilize
the network resources and does not account for unprescribed events. To overcome this limitation,
this paper seeks to initiate the study of \emph{voltage collapse stabilization}. More precisely,
for a DC network, we formulate the problem of voltage stability as a dynamic problem where each load
seeks to achieve a constant power consumption by updating its conductance as the voltage changes.
We show that such a system can be interpreted as a dynamic game, where each player (load) seeks to myopically
maximize their utility, and where every stable power flow solution amounts to a Local Nash Equilibrium.
Using this framework, we show that voltage collapse is equivalent to the non-existence of a Local
Nash Equilibrium in the game and, as a result, it is caused by the lack of cooperation between loads.
Finally, we propose a \emph{Voltage Collapse Stabilizer} (VCS) controller that uses (flexible)
loads that are willing to cooperate and provides a fair allocation of the curtailed demand. Our solution
stabilizes voltage collapse even in the presence of non-cooperative loads. Numerical simulations
validate several features of our controllers.
