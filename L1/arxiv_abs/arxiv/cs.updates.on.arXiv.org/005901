Recent years have witnessed a rise in the frequency and intensity of cyberattacks targeted at critical
infrastructure systems. This study designs a versatile, data-driven cyberattack detection platform
for infrastructure systems cybersecurity, with a special demonstration in water sector. A deep
generative model with variational inference autonomously learns normal system behavior and detects
attacks as they occur. The model can process the natural data in its raw form and automatically discover
and learn its representations, hence augmenting system knowledge discovery and reducing the need
for laborious human engineering and domain expertise. The proposed model is applied to a simulated
cyberattack detection problem involving a drinking water distribution system subject to programmable
logic controller hacks, malicious actuator activation, and deception attacks. The model is only
provided with observations of the system, such as pump pressure and tank water level reads, and is
blind to the internal structures and workings of the water distribution system. The simulated attacks
are manifested in the model's generated reproduction probability plot, indicating its ability
to discern the attacks. There is, however, need for improvements in reducing false alarms, especially
by optimizing detection thresholds. Altogether, the results indicate ability of the model in distinguishing
attacks and their repercussions from normal system operation in water distribution systems, and
the promise it holds for cyberattack detection in other domains.
