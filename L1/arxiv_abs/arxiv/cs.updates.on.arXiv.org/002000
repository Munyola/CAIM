This paper presents GRAPHR, the first ReRAM-based graph processing accelerator. GRAPHR follows
the principle of near-data processing but explores the opportunity of per-forming massive parallel
operations with low hardware and energy cost. Compared to recent works in applying ReRAM to more
regular neural computations, we are faced with several challenges: 1) The graph data are stored
in the com-pressed format, instead of matrix forms, making it impossible to perform direct in-situ
computations in memory; 2) It is less intuitive to map various graph algorithms to ReRAM with hardware
constrains; 3) Coordinating data movements among ReRAM crossbars and memory to achieve high throughput.
GRAPHR is a novel accelerator architecture consisting of two major components: memory ReRAM and
graph engine (GE). The core graph computations are performed in sparse matrix format in GEs (ReRAM
crossbars), which perform efficient matrix-vector multiplications. The vector/matrix-based
graph computation is not new, but ReRAM offers the unique opportunity to realize the massive parallelism
with unprecedented energy efficiency and low hardware cost. Due to the same cost/performance tradeoff,
with ReRAM, the gain of performing parallel operations overshadows the wastes due to sparsity in
matrix view within a small subgraph. Moreover, it naturally enables near data processing with reduced
data movements. The experiment results show that GRAPHR achieves a16.01x (up to132.67x) speedup
and an33.82x energy saving on geometric mean compared to a CPU baseline system.
