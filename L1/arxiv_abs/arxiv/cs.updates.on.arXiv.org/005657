In recent years, many research works propose to embed the network structured data into a low-dimensional
feature space, where each node is represented as a feature vector. However, due to the detachment
of embedding process with external tasks, the learned embedding results by most existing embedding
models can be ineffective for application tasks with specific objectives, e.g., community detection
or information diffusion. In this paper, we propose study the application oriented heterogeneous
social network embedding problem. Significantly different from the existing works, besides the
network structure preservation, the problem should also incorporate the objectives of external
applications in the objective function. To resolve the problem, in this paper, we propose a novel
network embedding framework, namely the "appLicAtion orienTed neTwork Embedding" (Latte) model.
In Latte, the heterogeneous network structure can be applied to compute the node "diffusive proximity"
scores, which capture both local and global network structures. Based on these computed scores,
Latte learns the network representation feature vectors by extending the autoencoder model model
to the heterogeneous network scenario, which can also effectively unite the objectives of network
embedding and external application tasks. Extensive experiments have been done on real-world
heterogeneous social network datasets, and the experimental results have demonstrated the outstanding
performance of Latte in learning the representation vectors for specific application tasks.
