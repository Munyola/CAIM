Contemporary deep learning based inpainting algorithms are mainly based on a hybrid dual stage
training policy of supervised reconstruction loss followed by an unsupervised adversarial critic
loss. However, there is a dearth of literature for a fully unsupervised GAN based inpainting framework.
The primary aversion towards the latter genre is due to its prohibitively slow iterative optimization
requirement during inference to find a matching noise prior for a masked image. In this paper, we
show that priors matter in GAN: we learn a data driven parametric network to predict a matching prior
for a given image. This converts an iterative paradigm to a single feed forward inference pipeline
with a massive 1500X speedup and simultaneous improvement in reconstruction quality. We show that
an additional structural prior imposed on GAN model results in higher fidelity outputs. To extend
our model for sequence inpainting, we propose a recurrent net based grouped noise prior learning.
To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of an unsupervised GAN based sequence inpainting.
A further improvement in sequence inpainting is achieved with an additional subsequence consistency
loss. These contributions improve the spatio-temporal characteristics of reconstructed sequences.
Extensive experiments conducted on SVHN, Standford Cars, CelebA and CelebA-HQ image datasets,
synthetic sequences and ViDTIMIT video datasets reveal that we consistently improve upon previous
unsupervised baseline and also achieve comparable performances(sometimes also better) to hybrid
benchmarks.
