Implicit authentication (IA) is gaining popularity over recent years due to its use of user behavior
as the main input, relieving users from explicit actions such as remembering and entering passwords.
However, such convenience comes at a cost of authentication accuracy and delay which we propose
to improve in this paper. Authentication accuracy deteriorates as users' behaviors change as a
result of mood, age, a change of routine, etc. Current authentication systems handle failed authentication
attempts by locking the user out of her mobile device. It is unsuitable for IA whose accuracy deterioration
induces high false reject rate, rendering the IA system unusable. Furthermore, existing IA systems
leverage computationally expensive machine learning which can introduce large authentication
delay. It is challenging to improve the authentication accuracy of these systems without sacrificing
authentication delay. In this paper, we propose a multi-level privilege control (MPC) scheme that
dynamically adjusts users' access privilege based on their behavior change. MPC increases the
system's confidence on users' legitimacy even when their behaviors deviate from historical data,
thus improving authentication accuracy. It is a lightweight feature added to the existing IA schemes
that helps avoid frequent and expensive retraining of machine learning models, thus improving
authentication delay. We demonstrate that MPC increases authentication accuracy by 18.63\% and
reduces authentication delay by 7.02 minutes on average, using a public dataset that contains comprehensive
user behavior data.
