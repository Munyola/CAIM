Over the past couple of years, anecdotal evidence has emerged linking coordinated campaigns by
state-sponsored actors with efforts to manipulate public opinion on the Web, often around major
political events, through dedicated accounts, or "trolls." Although they are often involved in
spreading disinformation on social media, there is little understanding of how these trolls operate,
what type of content they disseminate, and most importantly their influence on the information
ecosystem. In this paper, we shed light on these questions by analyzing 27K tweets posted by 1K Twitter
users identified as having ties with Russia's Internet Research Agency and thus likely state-sponsored
trolls. We compare their behavior to a random set of Twitter users, finding interesting differences
in terms of the content they disseminate, the evolution of their account, as well as their general
behavior and use of the Twitter platform. Then, using a statistical model known as Hawkes Processes,
we quantify the influence that these accounts had on the dissemination of news on social platforms
such as Twitter, Reddit, and 4chan. Overall, our findings indicate that Russian troll accounts
managed to stay active for long periods of time and to reach a substantial number of Twitter users
with their messages. When looking at their ability of spreading news content and making it viral,
however, we find that their effect on social platforms was minor, with the significant exception
of news published by the Russian state-sponsored news outlet RT (Russia Today).
