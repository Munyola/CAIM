Game theory provides a well-established framework for the analysis of concurrent and multi-agent
systems. The basic idea is that concurrent processes (agents) can be understood as corresponding
to players in a game; plays represent the possible computation runs of the system; and strategies
define the behaviour of agents. Typically, strategies are modelled as functions from sequences
of system states to player actions. Analysing a system in such a setting involves computing the set
of (Nash) equilibria in the concurrent game. However, we show that, with respect to the above model
of strategies (arguably, the `standard' model in the computer science literature), bisimilarity
does not preserve the existence of Nash equilibria. Thus, two concurrent games which are behaviourally
equivalent from a semantic perspective, and which from a logical perspective satisfy the same temporal
logic formulae, may nevertheless have fundamentally different properties (solutions) from a
game theoretic perspective. Our aim in this paper is to explore the issues raised by this discovery.
After illustrating the issue by way of a motivating example, we present three models of strategies
with respect to which the existence of Nash equilibria is preserved under bisimilarity. We use some
of these models of strategies to provide new semantic foundations for logics for strategic reasoning,
and investigate restricted scenarios where bisimilarity can be shown to preserve the existence
of Nash equilibria with respect to the conventional model of strategies in the computer science
literature.
