The issue of Internet addiction has become a serious social and health issue in East Asian countries.
There are only a few treatment programs for Internet addiction, and their effectiveness with people
from East Asian remains unclear. As support and treatment develop, it is necessary to understand
cultural preferences for dealing with this concern. Using data from the East Asian Social Survey
(EASS), this study examined preferred sources of assistance for help with internet use problems
in four countries - China, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan. Preferences for kin versus non-kin support,
use of alternative medicine, and professional mental health assistance were examined, as were
between-country differences in support preferences. The results indicate a strong preference
for seeking assistance from close relatives, followed by non-kin support (i.e., close friends
and co-participants in religious institutions), alternative medicine, and professional mental
health services, respectively. While there is a strong preference for family support, over 80%
of survey respondents were open to seeking formal or informal mental health support outside the
family. There were some significant differences between countries, with South Koreans being more
likely to seek non-kin support and professional support for internet addiction concerns compared
to Chinese. These differences are discussed in the context of cultural and policy developments
in East Asian countries. Findings suggest the need for a more holistic approach to treating low mental
health concerns.
