The creative process is essentially Darwinian and only a small proportion of creative ideas are
selected for further development. However, the threshold that identifies this small fraction
of successfully disseminated creative ideas at their early stage has not been thoroughly analyzed
through the lens of Rogers innovation diffusion theory. Here, we take highly cited (top 1%) research
papers as an example of the most successfully disseminated creative ideas and explore the time it
takes and citations it receives at their take off stage, which play a crucial role in the dissemination
of creativity. Results show the majority of highly cited papers will reach 10% and 25% of their total
citations within two years and four years, respectively. Interestingly, our results also present
a minimal number of articles that attract their first citation before publication. As for the discipline,
number of references, and Price index, we find a significant difference exists: Clinical, Pre-Clinical
& Health and Life Sciences are the first two disciplines to reach the C10% and C25% in a shorter amount
of time. Highly cited papers with limited references usually take more time to reach 10% and 25% of
their total citations. In addition, highly cited papers will attract citations rapidly when they
cite more recent references. These results provide insights into the timespan and citations for
a research paper to become highly cited at the take off stage in its diffusion process, as well as the
factors that may influence it.
