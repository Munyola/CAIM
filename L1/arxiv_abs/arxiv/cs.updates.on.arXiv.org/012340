One of the key requirements to facilitate the semantic analytics of information regarding contemporary
and historical events on the Web, in the news and in social media is the availability of reference
knowledge repositories containing comprehensive representations of events, entities and temporal
relations. Existing knowledge graphs, with popular examples including DBpedia, YAGO and Wikidata,
focus mostly on entity-centric information and are insufficient in terms of their coverage and
completeness with respect to events and temporal relations. In this article we address this limitation,
formalise the concept of a temporal knowledge graph and present its instantiation - EventKG. EventKG
is a multilingual event-centric temporal knowledge graph that incorporates over 690 thousand
events and over 2.3 million temporal relations obtained from several large-scale knowledge graphs
and semi-structured sources and makes them available through a canonical RDF representation.
Whereas popular entities often possess hundreds of relations within a temporal knowledge graph
such as EventKG, generating a concise overview of the most important temporal relations for a given
entity is a challenging task. In this article we demonstrate an application of EventKG to biographical
timeline generation, where we adopt a distant supervision method to identify relations most relevant
for an entity biography. Our evaluation results provide insights on the characteristics of EventKG
and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed biographical timeline generation method.
