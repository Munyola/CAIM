Network softwarization triggered a new wave of innovation in modern network design. The next generation
of mobile networks embraces this trend. Mobile-edge computing (MEC) is a key part of emerging mobile
networks that enables ultra-low latency mission-critical application such as vehicle-to vehicle
communication. MEC aims at bringing delay-sensitive applications closer to the radio access network
to enable ultra-low latency for users and decrease the back-haul pressure on mobile service providers.
However, there are no practical solutions to enable mobility at MEC where connections are no longer
anchored to the core network and serving applications are supposed to move as their users move. We
propose the mobile-edge gateway (MEGW) to address this gap. MEGW enables mobility for MEC applications
transparently and without requiring any modifications to existing protocols and applications.
MEGW supports mobility by reconstructing mobile users' location via listening to LTE control plane
in addition to using two-stage location-dependent traffic steering for edge connections. Networks
can incrementally upgrade to support MEC by upgrading some IP router to programmable switches that
run MEGW. We have implemented MEGW using P4 language and verified its compatibility with existing
LTE networks in a testbed running reference LTE protocol stack. Furthermore, using packet-level
simulations we show that the two-stage traffic steering algorithm reduces the number of application
migrations and simplifies service provisioning.
