One decade ago, Bitcoin was introduced, becoming the first cryptocurrency and establishing the
concept of "blockchain" as a distributed ledger. As of today, there are many different implementations
of cryptocurrencies working over a blockchain, with different approaches and philosophies. However,
many of them share one common feature: they require proof-of-work to support the generation of blocks
(mining) and, eventually, the generation of money. This proof-of-work scheme often consists in
the resolution of a cryptography problem, most commonly breaking a hash value, which can only be
achieved through brute-force. The main drawback of proof-of-work is that it requires ridiculously
large amounts of energy which do not have any useful outcome beyond supporting the currency. In this
paper, we present a theoretical proposal that introduces a proof-of-useful-work scheme to support
a cryptocurrency running over a blockchain, which we named Coin.AI. In this system, the mining scheme
requires training deep learning models, and a block is only mined when the performance of such model
exceeds a threshold. The distributed system allows for nodes to verify the models delivered by miners
in an easy way (certainly much more efficiently than the mining process itself), determining when
a block is to be generated. Additionally, this paper presents a proof-of-storage scheme for rewarding
users that provide storage for the deep learning models, as well as a theoretical dissertation on
how the mechanics of the system could be articulated with the ultimate goal of democratizing access
to artificial intelligence.
