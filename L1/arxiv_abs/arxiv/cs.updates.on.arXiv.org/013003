In virtualized computing platforms, energy consumption is related to the computing-plus-communication
processes. However, most of the proposed energy consumption models and energy saving solutions
found in literature consider only the active Virtual Machines (VMs), thus the overall operational
energy expenditure is usually related to solely the computation process. To address this shortcoming,
in this paper we consider a computing-plus-communication energy model, within the Multi-access
Edge Computing (MEC) paradigm, and then put forward a combination of a traffic engineering- and
MEC Location Service-based online server management algorithm with Energy Harvesting (EH) capabilities,
called Automated Resource Controller for Energy-aware Server (ARCES), for autoscaling and reconfiguring
the computing-plus-communication resources. The main goal is to minimize the overall energy consumption,
under hard per-task delay constraints (i.e., Quality of Service (QoS)). ARCES jointly performs
(i) a short-term server demand and harvested solar energy forecasting, (ii) VM soft-scaling, workload
and processing rate allocation and lastly, (iii) switching on/off of transmission drivers (i.e.,
fast tunable lasers) coupled with the location-aware traffic scheduling. Our numerical results
reveal that ARCES achieves on average energy savings of 69%, and an energy consumption ranging from
31%-45%and from 21%-25% at different values of per-VM reconfiguration cost, with respect to the
case where no energy management is applied.
