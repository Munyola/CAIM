A pseudocircle is a simple closed curve on the sphere or in the plane. The study of arrangements of
pseudocircles was initiated by Gr\"{u}nbaum, who defined them as collections of simple closed
curves that pairwise intersect in exactly two crossings. Gr\"{u}nbaum conjectured that the number
of triangular cells $p_3$ in digon-free arrangements of $n$ pairwise intersecting pseudocircles
is at least $2n-4$. We present examples to disprove this conjecture. With a recursive construction
based on an example with $12$ pseudocircles and $16$ triangles we obtain a family with $p_3(\mathcal{A})/n
\to 16/11 = 1.\overline{45}$. We expect that the lower bound $p_3(\mathcal{A}) \geq 4n/3$ is tight
for infinitely many simple arrangements. It may however be that digon-free arrangements of $n$
pairwise intersecting circles indeed have at least $2n-4$ triangles. For pairwise intersecting
arrangements with digons we have a lower bound of $p_3 \geq 2n/3$, and conjecture that $p_3 \geq n-1$.
Concerning the maximum number of triangles in pairwise intersecting arrangements of pseudocircles,
we show that $p_3 \le 2n^2/3 +O(n)$. This is essentially best possible because families of pairwise
intersecting arrangements of $n$ pseudocircles with $p_3/n^2 \to 2/3$ as $n \to \infty$ are known.
The paper contains many drawings of arrangements of pseudocircles and a good fraction of these drawings
was produced automatically from the combinatorial data produced by the generation algorithm.
In the final section we describe some aspects of the drawing algorithm.
