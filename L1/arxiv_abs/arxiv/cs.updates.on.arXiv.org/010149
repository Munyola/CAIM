Distributed Software Defined Networking (SDN) controllers aim to solve the issue of single-point-of-failure
and improve the scalability of the control plane. Byzantine and faulty controllers, however, may
enforce incorrect configurations and thus endanger the control plane correctness. Multiple Byzantine
Fault Tolerance (BFT) approaches relying on Replicated State Machine (RSM) execution have been
proposed in the past to cater for this issue. The scalability of such solutions is, however, limited.
Additionally, the interplay between progressing the state of the distributed controllers and
the consistency of the external reconfigurations of the forwarding devices has not been thoroughly
investigated. In this work, we propose an agreement-and-execution group-based approach to increase
the overall throughput of a BFT-enabled distributed SDN control plane. We adapt a proven sequencing-based
BFT protocol, and introduce two optimized BFT protocols that preserve the uniform agreement, causality
and liveness properties. A state-hashing approach which ensures causally ordered switch reconfigurations
is proposed, that enables an opportunistic RSM execution without relying on strict sequencing.
The proposed designs are implemented and validated for two realistic topologies, a path computation
application and a set of KPIs: switch reconfiguration (response) time, signaling overhead, and
acceptance rates. We show a clear decrease in the system response time and communication overhead
with the proposed models, compared to a state-of-the-art approach.
