We attempt to make two arguments in this essay. First, through a case study of a mobile phone based
voice-media service we have been running in rural central India for more than six years, we describe
several implementation complexities we had to navigate towards realizing our intended vision
of bringing social development through technology. Most of these complexities arose in the interface
of our technology with society, and we argue that even other technology providers can create similar
processes to manage this socio-technological interface and ensure intended outcomes from their
technology use. We then build our second argument about how to ensure that the organizations behind
both market driven technologies and those technologies that are adopted by the state, pay due attention
towards responsibly managing the socio-technological interface of their innovations. We advocate
for the technology engineers and researchers who work within these organizations, to take up the
responsibility and ensure that their labour leads to making the world a better place especially
for the poor and marginalized. We outline possible governance structures that can give more voice
to the technology developers to push their organizations towards ensuring that responsible outcomes
emerge from their technology. We note that the examples we use to build our arguments are limited
to contemporary information and communication technology (ICT) platforms used directly by end-users
to share content with one another, and hence our argument may not generalize to other ICTs in a straightforward
manner.
