Recent standardization efforts in IEEE 802.15.4-2015 Time Scheduled Channel Hopping (TSCH) and
the IETF 6TiSCH Working Group (WG), aim to provide deterministic communications and efficient
allocation of resources across constrained Internet of Things (IoT) networks, particularly in
Industrial IoT (IIoT) scenarios. Within 6TiSCH, Software Defined Networking (SDN) has been identified
as means of providing centralized control in a number of key situations. However, implementing
a centralized SDN architecture in a Low Power and Lossy Network (LLN) faces considerable challenges:
not only is controller traffic subject to jitter due to unreliable links and network contention,
but the overhead generated by SDN can severely affect the performance of other traffic. This paper
proposes using 6TiSCH tracks, a Layer-2 slicing mechanism for creating dedicated forwarding paths
across TSCH networks, in order to isolate the SDN control overhead. Not only does this prevent control
traffic from affecting the performance of other data flows, but the properties of 6TiSCH tracks
allows deterministic, low-latency SDN controller communication. Using our own lightweight SDN
implementation for Contiki OS, we firstly demonstrate the effect of SDN control traffic on application
data flows across a 6TiSCH network. We then show that by slicing the network through the allocation
of dedicated resources along a SDN control path, tracks provide an effective means of mitigating
the cost of SDN control overhead in IEEE 802.15.4-2015 TSCH networks.
