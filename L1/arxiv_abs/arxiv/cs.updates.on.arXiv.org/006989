Cancer is among the leading causes of death worldwide. Risk stratification of cancer tumors in radiology
images can be improved with computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) tools which can be made faster and more
accurate. Tumor characterization through CADs can enable non-invasive cancer staging and prognosis,
and foster personalized treatment planning as a part of precision medicine. In this study, we propose
both supervised and unsupervised machine learning strategies to improve tumor characterization.
Our first approach is based on supervised learning for which we demonstrate significant gains in
deep learning algorithms, particularly by utilizing a 3D Convolutional Neural Network along with
transfer learning. Motivated by the radiologists' interpretations of the scans, we then show how
to incorporate task dependent feature representations into a CAD system via a "graph-regularized
sparse Multi-Task Learning (MTL)" framework. In the second approach, we explore an unsupervised
scheme to address the limited availability of labeled training data, a common problem in medical
imaging applications. Inspired by learning from label proportion (LLP) approaches, we propose
a new algorithm, proportion-SVM, to characterize tumor types. We also seek the answer to the fundamental
question about the goodness of "deep features" for unsupervised tumor classification. We evaluate
our proposed approaches (both supervised and unsupervised) on two different tumor diagnosis challenges:
lung and pancreas with 1018 CT and 171 MRI scans respectively.
