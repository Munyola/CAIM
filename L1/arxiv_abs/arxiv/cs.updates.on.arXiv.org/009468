In this paper, we propose a hybrid bankcard response model, which integrates decision tree based
chi-square automatic interaction detection (CHAID) into logistic regression. In the first stage
of the hybrid model, CHAID analysis is used to detect the possibly potential variable interactions.
Then in the second stage, these potential interactions are served as the additional input variables
in logistic regression. The motivation of the proposed hybrid model is that adding variable interactions
may improve the performance of logistic regression. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
hybrid model, it is evaluated on a real credit customer response data set. As the results reveal,
by identifying potential interactions among independent variables, the proposed hybrid approach
outperforms the logistic regression without searching for interactions in terms of classification
accuracy, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC), and Kolmogorov-Smirnov
(KS) statistics. Furthermore, CHAID analysis for interaction detection is much more computationally
efficient than the stepwise search mentioned above and some identified interactions are shown
to have statistically significant predictive power on the target variable. Last but not least,
the customer profile created based on the CHAID tree provides a reasonable interpretation of the
interactions, which is the required by regulations of the credit industry. Hence, this study provides
an alternative for handling bankcard classification tasks.
