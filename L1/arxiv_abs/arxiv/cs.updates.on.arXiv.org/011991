"Feint Attack", as a new type of APT attack, has become the focus of attention. It adopts a multi-stage
attacks mode which can be concluded as a combination of virtual attacks and real attacks. Under the
cover of virtual attacks, real attacks can achieve the real purpose of the attacker, as a result,
it often caused huge losses inadvertently. However, to our knowledge, all previous works use common
methods such as Causal-Correlation or Cased-based to detect outdated multi-stage attacks. Few
attentions have been paid to detect the "Feint Attack", because the difficulty of detection lies
in the diversification of the concept of "Feint Attack" and the lack of professional datasets, many
detection methods ignore the semantic relationship in the attack. Aiming at the existing challenge,
this paper explores a new method to solve the problem. In the attack scenario, the fuzzy clustering
method based on attribute similarity is used to mine multi-stage attack chains. Then we use a few-shot
deep learning algorithm (SMOTE&CNN-SVM) and bidirectional Recurrent Neural Network model (Bi-RNN)
to obtain the "Feint Attack" chains. "Feint Attack" is simulated by the real attack inserted in the
normal causal attack chain, and the addition of the real attack destroys the causal relationship
of the original attack chain. So we used Bi-RNN coding to obtain the hidden feature of "Feint Attack"
chain. In the end, our method achieved the goal to detect the "Feint Attack" accurately by using the
LLDoS1.0 and LLDoS2.0 of DARPA2000 and CICIDS2017 of Canadian Institute for Cybersecurity.
