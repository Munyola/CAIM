Conventional electromagnetic transient (EMT) and phasor-domain hybrid simulation approaches
presently exist for trans-mission system level studies. Their simulation efficiency is generally
constrained by the EMT simulation. With an increasing number of distributed energy resources and
non-conventional loads being installed in distribution systems, it is imperative to extend the
hybrid simulation application to include distribution systems and integrated transmission and
distribution systems. Meanwhile, it is equally important to improve the simulation efficiency
as the modeling scope and complexity of the detailed system in the EMT simulation increases. To meet
both requirements, this paper introduces an advanced EMT and phasor-domain hybrid simulation
approach. This approach has two main features: 1) a comprehensive phasor-domain modeling framework
which supports positive-sequence, three-sequence, three-phase and mixed three-sequence/three-phase
representations and 2) a robust and flexible simulation mode switching scheme. The developed scheme
enables simulation switching from hybrid simulation mode back to pure phasor-domain dynamic simulation
mode to achieve significantly improved simulation efficiency. The proposed method has been tested
on integrated transmission and distribution systems. The results show that with the developed
simulation switching feature, the total computational time is significantly reduced compared
to running the hybrid simulation for the whole simulation period, while maintaining good simulation
accuracy.
