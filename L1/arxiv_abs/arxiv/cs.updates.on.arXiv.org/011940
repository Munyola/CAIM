In recent years, descriptive evaluation has been introduced as a new model for educational evaluation
of Iranian students. The current descriptive evaluation method is based on four-valued logic.
Assessing all students with only four values is led to a lack of relative justice and the creation
of unrealistic equality. Also, the complexity of the evaluation process in the current method increases
teacher errors likelihood. As a suitable solution, in this paper, a fuzzy descriptive evaluation
system has been proposed. The proposed method is based on fuzzy logic, which is an infinite-valued
logic and it can perform approximate reasoning on natural language propositions. By the proposed
fuzzy system, student assessment is performed over the school year with infinite values instead
of four values. But to eliminate the diversity of assigned values to students, at the end of the school
year, the calculated values for each student will be rounded to the nearest value of the four standard
values of the current descriptive evaluation system. It can be implemented easily in an appropriate
smartphone app, which makes it much easier for the teachers to evaluate the evaluation process.
In this paper, the evaluation process of the elementary third-grade mathematics course in Iran
during the period from the beginning of the MEHR (The Seventh month of Iran) to the end of BAHMAN (The
Eleventh Month of Iran) is examined by the proposed system. To evaluate the validity of this system,
the proposed method has been simulated in MATLAB software.
