My research lies in the intersection of security and machine learning. This overview summarizes
one component of my research: combining computer vision with malware exploit detection for enhanced
security solutions. I will present the perspectives of efficacy, reliability and resiliency to
formulate threat detection as computer vision problems and develop state-of-the-art image-based
malware classification. Representing malware binary as images provides a direct visualization
of data samples, reduces the efforts for feature extraction, and consumes the whole binary for holistic
structural analysis. Employing transfer learning of deep neural networks effective for large
scale image classification to malware classification demonstrates superior classification
efficacy compared with classical machine learning algorithms. To enhance reliability of these
vision-based malware detectors, interpretation frameworks can be constructed on the malware
visual representations and useful for extracting faithful explanation, so that security practitioners
have confidence in the model before deployment. In cyber-security applications, we should always
assume that a malware writer constantly modifies code to bypass detection. Addressing the resiliency
of the malware detectors is equivalently important as efficacy and reliability. Via understanding
the attack surfaces of machine learning models used for malware detection, we can greatly improve
the robustness of the algorithms to combat malware adversaries in the wild. Finally I will discuss
future research directions worth pursuing in this research community.
