Background: Patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD) can avoid vision
loss via certain therapy. However, methods to predict the progression to neovascular age-related
macular degeneration (nvAMD) are lacking. Purpose: To develop and validate a deep learning (DL)
algorithm to predict 1-year progression of eyes with no, early, or intermediate AMD to nvAMD, using
color fundus photographs (CFP). Design: Development and validation of a DL algorithm. Methods:
We trained a DL algorithm to predict 1-year progression to nvAMD, and used 10-fold cross-validation
to evaluate this approach on two groups of eyes in the Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS): none/early/intermediate
AMD, and intermediate AMD (iAMD) only. We compared the DL algorithm to the manually graded 4-category
and 9-step scales in the AREDS dataset. Main outcome measures: Performance of the DL algorithm was
evaluated using the sensitivity at 80% specificity for progression to nvAMD. Results: The DL algorithm's
sensitivity for predicting progression to nvAMD from none/early/iAMD (78+/-6%) was higher than
manual grades from the 9-step scale (67+/-8%) or the 4-category scale (48+/-3%). For predicting
progression specifically from iAMD, the DL algorithm's sensitivity (57+/-6%) was also higher
compared to the 9-step grades (36+/-8%) and the 4-category grades (20+/-0%). Conclusions: Our
DL algorithm performed better in predicting progression to nvAMD than manual grades. Future investigations
are required to test the application of this DL algorithm in a real-world clinical setting.
