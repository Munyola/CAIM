The scarcity and class imbalance of training data are known issues in current rumor detection tasks.
We propose a straight-forward and general-purpose data augmentation technique which is beneficial
to early rumor detection relying on event propagation patterns. The key idea is to exploit massive
unlabeled event data sets on social media to augment limited labeled rumor source tweets. This work
is based on rumor spreading patterns revealed by recent rumor studies and semantic relatedness
between labeled and unlabeled data. A state-of-the-art neural language model (NLM) and large credibility-focused
Twitter corpora are employed to learn context-sensitive representations of rumor tweets. Six
different real-world events based on three publicly available rumor datasets are employed in our
experiments to provide a comparative evaluation of the effectiveness of the method. The results
show that our method can expand the size of an existing rumor data set nearly by 200% and corresponding
social context (i.e., conversational threads) by 100% with reasonable quality. Preliminary experiments
with a state-of-the-art deep learning-based rumor detection model show that augmented data can
alleviate over-fitting and class imbalance caused by limited train data and can help to train complex
neural networks (NNs). With augmented data, the performance of rumor detection can be improved
by 12.1% in terms of F-score. Our experiments also indicate that augmented training data can help
to generalize rumor detection models on unseen rumors.
