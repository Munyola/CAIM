To evaluate the cyclic behavior under different loading conditions using the kinematic and isotropic
hardening theory of steel, a Chaboche viscoplastic material model is employed. The parameters
of a constitutive model are usually identified by minimization of the difference between model
response and experimental data. However, measurement errors and differences in the specimens
lead to deviations in the determined parameters. In this article, the Choboche model is used and
a stochastic simulation technique is applied to generate artificial data which exhibit the same
stochastic behavior as experimental data. Then the model parameters are identified by applying
an estimation using Bayes's theorem. The Transitional Markov Chain Monte Carlo method (TMCMC)
is introduced and employed to estimate the model parameters in the Bayesian setting. The uniform
distributions of the parameters representing their priors are considered which literally means
no knowledge of the parameters is available. Identified parameters are compared with the true parameters
in the simulation, and the efficiency of the identification method is discussed. In fact, the main
purpose of this study is to observe the possibility of identifying the model and hardening parameters
of a viscoplastic model as a very high non-linear model with only a surface displacement measurement
vector in the Bayesian setting using TMCMC and evaluate the number of measurements needed for a very
acceptable estimation of the uncertain parameters of the model.
