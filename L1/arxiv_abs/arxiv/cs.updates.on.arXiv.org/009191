We consider a multiple-unicast network flow problem of maximizing aggregate user utilities over
a multi-hop network, subject to link capacity constraints, maximum end-to-end delay constraints,
and user throughput requirements. A user's utility is an arbitrary function of the achieved throughput
or the experienced maximum delay. The problem is important for supporting real-time multimedia
or Cyber-Physical System (CPS) traffic, and it is uniquely challenging due to the need of simultaneously
considering maximum delay constraints and throughput requirements. We first show that it is NP-complete
to even construct a feasible solution to our problem. We then develop the first set of polynomial-time
algorithms in the literature, to our best knowledge, named PASS, to obtain solutions that (i) achieve
constant or problem-dependent approximation ratios, at the cost of (ii) violating maximum delay
constraints or throughput requirements up to constant or problem-dependent ratios, under certain
conditions derived in this paper. We observe that the conditions are satisfied in many popular application
scenarios, where hence PASS can be applied with strong theoretical performance guarantee. We evaluate
the empirical performance of PASS in simulations of supporting video-conferencing traffic across
Amazon EC2 datacenters. Our design leverages a novel understanding between non-convex maximum-delay-aware
problems and their convex average-delay-aware counterparts, which can be of independent interest
and suggest a new avenue for solving maximum-delay-aware network optimization problems.
