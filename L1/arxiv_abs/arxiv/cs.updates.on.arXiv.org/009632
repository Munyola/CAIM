Proof-of-Stake systems randomly choose, on each round, one of the participants as a consensus leader
that extends the chain with the next block such that the selection probability is proportional to
the owned stake. However, distributed random number generation is notoriously difficult. Systems
that derive randomness from the previous blocks are completely insecure; solutions that provide
secure random selection are inefficient due to their high communication complexity; and approaches
that balance security and performance exhibit selection bias. When block creation is rewarded
with new stake, even a minor bias can have a severe cumulative effect. In this paper, we propose Robust
Round Robin, a new consensus scheme that addresses this selection problem. We create reliable long-term
identities by bootstrapping from an existing infrastructure, such as Intel's SGX processors,
or by mining them starting from an initial fair distribution. For leader selection we use a deterministic
approach. On each round, we select a set of the previously created identities as consensus leader
candidates in round robin manner. Because simple round-robin alone is vulnerable to attacks and
offers poor liveness, we complement such deterministic selection policy with a lightweight endorsement
mechanism that is an interactive protocol between the leader candidates and a small subset of other
system participants. Our solution has low good efficiency as it requires no expensive distributed
randomness generation and it provides block creation fairness which is crucial in deployments
that reward it with new stake.
