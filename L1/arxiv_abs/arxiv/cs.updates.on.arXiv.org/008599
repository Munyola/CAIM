Modern processor optimizations such as branch prediction and out-of-order execution are crucial
for performance. Recent research on transient execution attacks including Spectre and Meltdown
showed, however, that exception or branch misprediction events may leave secret-dependent traces
in the CPU's microarchitectural state. This observation led to a proliferation of new Spectre and
Meltdown attack variants and even more ad-hoc defenses (e.g., microcode and software patches).
Unfortunately, both the industry and academia are now focusing on finding efficient defenses that
mostly address only one specific variant or exploitation methodology. This is highly problematic,
as the state-of-the-art provides only limited insight on residual attack surface and the completeness
of the proposed defenses. In this paper, we present a sound and extensible systematization of transient
execution attacks. Our systematization uncovers 7 (new) transient execution attacks that have
been overlooked and not been investigated so far. This includes 2 new Meltdown variants: Meltdown-PK
on Intel, and Meltdown-BR on Intel and AMD. It also includes 5 new Spectre mistraining strategies.
We evaluate all 7 attacks in proof-of-concept implementations on 3 major processor vendors (Intel,
AMD, ARM). Our systematization does not only yield a complete picture of the attack surface, but
also allows a systematic evaluation of defenses. Through this systematic evaluation, we discover
that we can still mount transient execution attacks that are supposed to be mitigated by rolled out
patches.
