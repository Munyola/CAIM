Dictionary learning is a popular class of methods for modeling complex data by learning sparse representations
directly from the data. For some large-scale applications, exploiting a known structure of the
signal is often essential for reducing the complexity of algorithms and representations. One such
method is tensor factorization by which a large multi-dimensional dataset can be explicitly factored
or separated along each dimension of the data in order to break the representation up into smaller
components. Learning dictionaries for tensor structured data is called tensor or separable dictionary
learning. While there have been many recent works on separable dictionary learning, typical formulations
involve solving a non-convex optimization problem and guaranteeing global optimality remains
a challenge. In this work, we propose a framework that uses recent developments in matrix/tensor
factorization to provide theoretical and numerical guarantees of the global optimality for the
separable dictionary learning problem. We will demonstrate our algorithm on diffusion magnetic
resonance imaging (dMRI) data, a medical imaging modality which measures water diffusion along
multiple angular directions in every voxel of an MRI volume. For this application, state-of-the-art
methods learn dictionaries for the angular domain of the signals without consideration for the
spatial domain. In this work, we apply the proposed separable dictionary learning method to learn
spatial and angular dMRI dictionaries jointly and show results on denoising phantom and real dMRI
brain data.
