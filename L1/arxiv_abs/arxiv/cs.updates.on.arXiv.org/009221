IoT devices are increasingly deployed in daily life. Many of these devices are, however, vulnerable
due to insecure design, implementation, and configuration. As a result, many networks already
have vulnerable IoT devices that are easy to compromise. This has led to a new category of malware
specifically targeting IoT devices. However, existing intrusion detection techniques are not
effective in detecting compromised IoT devices given the massive scale of the problem in terms of
the number of different types of devices and manufacturers involved. In this paper, we present D\"IoT,
an autonomous self-learning distributed system for detecting compromised IoT devices effectively.
In contrast to prior work, D\"IoT uses a novel self-learning approach to classify devices into device
types and build normal communication profiles for each of these that can subsequently be used to
detect anomalous deviations in communication patterns. D\"IoT utilizes a federated learning
approach for aggregating behavior profiles efficiently. To the best of our knowledge, it is the
first system to employ a federated learning approach to anomaly-detection-based intrusion detection.
Consequently, D\"IoT can cope with emerging new and unknown attacks. We systematically and extensively
evaluated more than 30 off-the-shelf IoT devices over a long term and show that D\"IoT is highly effective
(95.6% detection rate) and fast (~257 ms) at detecting devices compromised by, for instance, the
infamous Mirai malware. D\"IoT reported no false alarms when evaluated in a real-world smart home
deployment setting.
