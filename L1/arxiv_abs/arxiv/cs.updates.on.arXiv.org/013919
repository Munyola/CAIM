High-quality data is key to interpretable and trustworthy data analytics and the basis for meaningful
data-driven decisions. In practical scenarios, data quality is typically associated with data
preprocessing, profiling, and cleansing for subsequent tasks like data integration or data analytics.
However, from a scientific perspective, a lot of research has been published about the measurement
(i.e., the detection) of data quality issues and different generally applicable data quality dimensions
and metrics have been discussed. In this work, we close the gap between research into data quality
measurement and practical implementations by investigating the functional scope of current data
quality tools. With a systematic search, we identified 667 software tools dedicated to "data quality",
from which we evaluated 13 tools with respect to three functionality areas: (1) data profiling,
(2) data quality measurement in terms of metrics, and (3) continuous data quality monitoring. We
selected the evaluated tools with regard to pre-defined exclusion criteria to ensure that they
are domain-independent, provide the investigated functions, and are evaluable freely or as trial.
This survey aims at a comprehensive overview on state-of-the-art data quality tools and reveals
potential for their functional enhancement. Additionally, the results allow a critical discussion
on concepts, which are widely accepted in research, but hardly implemented in any tool observed,
for example, generally applicable data quality metrics.
