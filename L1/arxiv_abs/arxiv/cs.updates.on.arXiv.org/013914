A super point is a host that interacts with a far larger number of counterparts in the network over
a period of time. Super point detection plays an important role in network research and application.
With the increase of network scale, distributed super point detection has become a hot research
topic. Compared with single-node super point detection algorithm, the difficulty of super point
detection in multi-node distributed environment is how to reduce communication overhead. Therefore,
this paper proposes a three-stage communication distributed super point detection algorithm:
Rough Estimator based Asynchronous Distributed super point detection algorithm (READ). READ
uses a lightweight estimator, the Rough Estimator (RE), which is fast in computation and takes less
memory to generate candidate super point. At the same time, the Linear Estimator (LE) is used to accurately
estimate the cardinality of each candidate super point, so as to detect the super point correctly.
In READ, each node scans IP address pairs asynchronously. When reaching the time window boundary,
READ starts three-stage communication to detect the super point. In this paper, we proof that the
accuracy of READ in distributed environment is no less than that in the single node environment.
Four groups of 10 Gb/s and 40 Gb/s real-world high-speed network traffic are used to test READ. The
experimental results show that READ not only has higher accuracy in distributed environment, but
also has less than 5% of communication burden compared with existing algorithms.
