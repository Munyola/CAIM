Real-time simulation methods for investigations on electric networks and integration of grid
connected generation units are increasingly in the focus of ongoing research areas. While laboratory
testing methods are the predominant method for the verification of safety and quality related features
of grid-connected generation units in the past, load flow modeling verification methods have been
integrated in state-of-the-art standardization frameworks recently. The next step is comprised
in real-time simulation methodologies applied for compliance testing of entire power electronic
systems integrated in power distribution networks. The Controller Hardware-in-the-Loop (CHIL)
approach is an appropriate methodology that combines numerical simulations with software modeling
approaches and classical hardware testing in labs. Control boards represent the hardware device
directly connected to the power electronic periphery, which is entirely simulated in a real-time
simulation environment. Hereby, input signals from voltage and current measurements and output
signals for power system control are exchanged in real-time. Thanks to this setup the testing of
the true behavior of entire generation units within the electric network can be emulated precisely.
With the application of CHIL a shorter time to market and a lower risk in the development phase can
be achieved. However, an analysis from realized CHIL experiments shows the need for more harmonized
procedures. This paper addresses this topic and provides an outlook about necessary future CHIL
standardization needs.
