RSL19BD (Waseda University Sakai Laboratory) participated in the Fourth Dialogue Breakdown Detection
Challenge (DBDC4) and submitted five runs to both English and Japanese subtasks. In these runs,
we utilise the Decision Tree-based model and the Long Short-Term Memory-based (LSTM-based) models
following the approaches of RSL17BD and KTH in the Third Dialogue Breakdown Detection Challenge
(DBDC3) respectively. The Decision Tree-based model follows the approach of RSL17BD but utilises
RandomForestRegressor instead of ExtraTreesRegressor. In addition, instead of predicting the
mean and the variance of the probability distribution of the three breakdown labels, it predicts
the probability of each label directly. The LSTM-based model follows the approach of KTH with some
changes in the architecture and utilises Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to perform text feature
extraction. In addition, instead of targeting the single breakdown label and minimising the categorical
cross entropy loss, it targets the probability distribution of the three breakdown labels and minimises
the mean squared error. Run 1 utilises a Decision Tree-based model; Run 2 utilises an LSTM-based
model; Run 3 performs an ensemble of 5 LSTM-based models; Run 4 performs an ensemble of Run 1 and Run
2; Run 5 performs an ensemble of Run 1 and Run 3. Run 5 statistically significantly outperformed all
other runs in terms of MSE (NB, PB, B) for the English data and all other runs except Run 4 in terms of
MSE (NB, PB, B) for the Japanese data (alpha level = 0.05).
