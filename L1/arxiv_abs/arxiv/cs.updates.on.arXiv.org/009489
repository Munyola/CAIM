Regional innovation is more and more considered an important enabler of welfare. It is no coincidence
that the European Commission has started looking at regional peculiarities and dynamics, in order
to focus Research and Innovation Strategies for Smart Specialization towards effective investment
policies. In this context, this work aims to support policy makers in the analysis of innovation-relevant
trends. We exploit a European database of the regional patent application to determine the dynamics
of a set of technological innovation indicators. For this purpose, we design and develop a software
system for assessing unfolding trends in such indicators. In contrast with conventional knowledge-based
design, our approach is biologically-inspired and based on self-organization of information.
This means that a functional structure, called track, appears and stays spontaneous at runtime
when local dynamism in data occurs. A further prototyping of tracks allows a better distinction
of the critical phenomena during unfolding events, with a better assessment of the progressing
levels. The proposed mechanism works if structural parameters are correctly tuned for the given
historical context. Determining such correct parameters is not a simple task since different indicators
may have different dynamics. For this purpose, we adopt an adaptation mechanism based on differential
evolution. The study includes the problem statement and its characterization in the literature,
as well as the proposed solving approach, experimental setting and results.
