Although deep learning approaches have achieved performance surpassing humans for still image-based
face recognition, unconstrained video-based face recognition is still a challenging task due
to large volume of data to be processed and intra/inter-video variations on pose, illumination,
occlusion, scene, blur, video quality, etc. In this work, we consider challenging scenarios for
unconstrained video-based face recognition from multiple-shot videos and surveillance videos
with low-quality frames. To handle these problems, we propose a robust and efficient system for
unconstrained video-based face recognition, which is composed of face/fiducial detection, face
association, and face recognition. First, we use multi-scale single-shot face detectors to efficiently
localize faces in videos. The detected faces are then grouped respectively through carefully designed
face association methods, especially for multi-shot videos. Finally, the faces are recognized
by the proposed face matcher based on an unsupervised subspace learning approach and a subspace-to-subspace
similarity metric. Extensive experiments on challenging video datasets, such as Multiple Biometric
Grand Challenge (MBGC), Face and Ocular Challenge Series (FOCS), JANUS Challenge Set 6 (CS6) for
low-quality surveillance videos and IARPA JANUS Benchmark B (IJB-B) for multiple-shot videos,
demonstrate that the proposed system can accurately detect and associate faces from unconstrained
videos and effectively learn robust and discriminative features for recognition.
