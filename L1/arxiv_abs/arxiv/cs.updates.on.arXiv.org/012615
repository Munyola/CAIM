Software engineering involves the consideration of both human and technical aspects, and although
its origins come from the sub-disciplines of computer science and engineering, today the importance
of the social and human aspects of software development are widely accepted by practitioners and
researchers alike. Researchers have at their disposal many research methods they can choose from,
but does software engineering research, at a community level, use methods that adequately capture
the social and human aspects of the socio-technical endeavour that is software development? To
answer this question, we conducted a categorization study of 253 ICSE papers and found a bigger emphasis
on computational studies that rely on trace data of developer activity, with fewer studies controlling
for human and social aspects. To understand tradeoffs that researchers make among their choice
of research methods, we conducted a follow-up survey with the authors of the mapping study papers
and found they generally prioritize generalizability and realism over control of human behaviours
in their studies, sometimes for reasons of convenience or to appease reviewers of their papers.
Furthermore, our findings surprisingly suggest a gap in knowledge about triangulation that could
help address this gap within our community. We suggest our community, as a whole, diversify its use
of research methods, to increase the use of methods that involve more control of the human and social
aspects of software development practice while balancing our understanding of innovations on
the technical side.
