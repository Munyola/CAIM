Learning from unlabeled and noisy data is one of the grand challenges of machine learning. As such,
it has seen a flurry of research with new ideas proposed continuously. In this work, we revisit a classical
idea: Stein's Unbiased Risk Estimator (SURE). We show that, in the context of image recovery, SURE
and its generalizations can be used to train convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for a range of
image denoising and recovery problems without any ground truth data. Specifically, our goal is
to reconstruct an image $x$ from a noisy linear transformation (measurement) of the image. We consider
two scenarios: one where no additional data is available and one where we have measurements of other
images that are drawn from the same noisy distribution as $x$, but have no access to the clean images.
Such is the case, for instance, in the context of medical imaging, microscopy, and astronomy, where
noise-less ground truth data is rarely available. We show that in this situation, SURE can be used
to estimate the mean-squared-error loss associated with an estimate of $x$. Using this estimate
of the loss, we train networks to perform denoising and compressed sensing recovery. In addition,
we also use the SURE framework to partially explain and improve upon an intriguing results presented
by Ulyanov et al. in "Deep Image Prior": that a network initialized with random weights and fit to
a single noisy image can effectively denoise that image. Public implementations of the networks
and methods described in this paper can be found at https://github.com/ricedsp/D-AMP_Toolbox.
