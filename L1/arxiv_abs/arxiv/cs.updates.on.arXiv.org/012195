Correlation filters (CFs) have been continuously advancing the state-of-the-art tracking performance
and have been extensively studied in the recent few years. Most of the existing CF trackers adopt
a cosine window to spatially reweight base image to alleviate boundary discontinuity. However,
cosine window emphasizes more on the central region of base image and has the risk of contaminating
negative training samples during model learning. On the other hand, spatial regularization deployed
in many recent CF trackers plays a similar role as cosine window by enforcing spatial penalty on CF
coefficients. Therefore, we in this paper investigate the feasibility to remove cosine window
from CF trackers with spatial regularization. When simply removing cosine window, CF with spatial
regularization still suffers from small degree of boundary discontinuity. To tackle this issue,
binary and Gaussian shaped mask functions are further introduced for eliminating boundary discontinuity
while reweighting the estimation error of each training sample, and can be incorporated with multiple
CF trackers with spatial regularization. In comparison to the counterparts with cosine window,
our methods are effective in handling boundary discontinuity and sample contamination, thereby
benefiting tracking performance. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks show that our methods
perform favorably against the state-of-the-art trackers using either handcrafted or deep CNN
features. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/lifeng9472/Removing_cosine_window_from_CF_trackers.
