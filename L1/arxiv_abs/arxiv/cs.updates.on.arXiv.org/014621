In this work, we propose a framework that constructs reduced order models for nonlinear structural
mechanics in a nonintrusive fashion, and can handle large scale simulations. We identify three
steps that are carried out separately in time, and possibly on different devices: (i) the production
of high-fidelity solutions by a commercial software, (ii) the offline stage of the model reduction
and (iii) the online stage where the reduced order model is exploited. The nonintrusivity assumes
that only the displacement field solution is known, and relies on operations on simulation data
during the offline phase by using an in-house code. The compatibility with a new commercial code
only needs the implementation of a routine converting the mesh and result format into our in-house
data format. The nonintrusive capabilities of the framework are demonstrated on numerical experiments
using commercial versions of the finite element softwares Zset and Ansys Mechanical. The nonlinear
constitutive equations are evaluated by using the same external plugins as for Zset or Ansys Mechanical.
The large scale simulations are handled using domain decomposition and parallel computing with
distributed memory. The features and performances of the framework are evaluated on two numerical
applications involving elastoviscoplastic materials: the second one involves a model of high-pressure
blade, where the framework is used to extrapolate cyclic loadings in 6.5 hours, whereas the reference
high-fidelity computation would take 9.5 days.
