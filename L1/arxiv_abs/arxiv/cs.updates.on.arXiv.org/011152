Large intelligent surfaces (LISs) constitute a new and promising wireless communication paradigm
that relies on the integration of a massive number of antenna elements over the entire surfaces of
man-made structures. The LIS concept provides many advantages, such as the capability to provide
reliable and space-intensive communications by effectively establishing line-of-sight (LOS)
channels. In this paper, the system spectral efficiency (SSE) of an uplink LIS system is asymptotically
analyzed under a practical LIS environment with a well-defined uplink frame structure. In order
to verify the impact on the SSE of pilot contamination, the SSE of a multi-LIS system is asymptotically
studied and a theoretical bound on its performance is derived. Given this performance bound, an
optimal pilot training length for multi-LIS systems subjected to pilot contamination is characterized
and, subsequently, the performance-maximizing number of devices that the LIS system must service
is derived. Simulation results show that the derived analyses are in close agreement with the exact
mutual information in presence of a large number of antennas, and the achievable SSE is limited by
the effect of pilot contamination and intra/inter-LIS interference through the LOS path, even
if the LIS is equipped with an infinite number of antennas. Additionally, the SSE obtained with the
proposed pilot training length and number of scheduled devices is shown to reach the one obtained
via a brute-force search for the optimal solution.
