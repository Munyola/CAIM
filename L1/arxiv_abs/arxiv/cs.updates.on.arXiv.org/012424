Swarm robotic search is concerned with searching targets in unknown environments (e.g., for search
and rescue or hazard localization), using a large number of collaborating simple mobile robots.
In such applications, decentralized swarm systems are touted for their task/coverage scalability,
time efficiency, and fault tolerance. To guide the behavior of such swarm systems, two broad classes
of approaches are available, namely nature-inspired swarm heuristics and multi-robotic search
methods. However, simultaneously offering computationally-efficient scalability and fundamental
insights into the exhibited behavior (instead of a black-box behavior model), remains challenging
under either of these two class of approaches. In this paper, we develop an important extension of
the batch Bayesian search method for application to embodied swarm systems, searching in a physical
2D space. Key contributions lie in: 1) designing an acquisition function that not only balances
exploration and exploitation across the swarm, but also allows modeling knowledge extraction
over trajectories; and 2) developing its distributed implementation to allow asynchronous task
inference and path planning by the swarm robots. The resulting collective informative path planning
approach is tested on target search case studies of varying complexity, where the target produces
a spatially varying (measurable) signal. Significantly superior performance, in terms of mission
completion efficiency, is observed compared to exhaustive search and random walk baselines, along
with favorable performance scalability with increasing swarm size.
