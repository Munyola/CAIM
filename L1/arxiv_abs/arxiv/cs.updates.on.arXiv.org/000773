Over the past few years, the Internet has become a powerful means for the masses to interact, coordinate
activities, and gather and disseminate information. As such, it is increasingly relevant for many
governments worldwide to surveil and censor it, and many censorship programs have been put in place
in the last years. Due to lack of publicly available information, as well as the inherent risks of
performing active measurements, the research community is often limited in the analysis and understanding
of censorship practices. The October 2011 leak by the Telecomix hacktivist group of 600GB worth
of logs from 7 Blue Coat SG-9000 proxies (deployed by the Syrian authorities to monitor and filter
traffic of Syrian users) represents a unique opportunity to provide a snapshot of a real-world censorship
ecosystem and to understand the underlying technology. This paper presents the methodology and
the results of a measurement-based analysis of these logs. Our study uncovers a relatively stealthy
yet quite targeted filtering, compared to, e.g., that of China and Iran. We show that the proxies
filter traffic, relying on IP addresses to block access to entire subnets, on domains to block specific
websites, and on keywords and categories to target specific content. Instant messaging is heavily
censored, while filtering of social media is limited to specific pages. Finally, we show that Syrian
users try to evade censorship by using web/socks proxies, Tor, VPNs, and BitTorrent. To the best
of our knowledge, our work provides the first look into Internet filtering in Syria.
