We consider assignment policies that allocate resources to users, where both resources and users
are located on a one-dimensional line. First, we consider unidirectional assignment policies
that allocate resources only to users located to their left. We propose the Move to Right (MTR) policy,
which scans from left to right assigning nearest rightmost available resource to a user, and contrast
it to the Unidirectional Gale-Shapley (UGS) matching policy. While both these policies are optimal
among all unidirectional policies, we show that they are equivalent with respect to the expected
distance traveled by a request (request distance), although MTR is fairer. Moreover, we show that
when user and resource locations are modeled by statistical point processes, and resources are
allowed to satisfy more than one user, the spatial system under unidirectional policies can be mapped
into bulk service queuing systems, thus allowing the application of a plethora of queuing theory
results that yield closed form expressions. As we consider a case where different resources can
satisfy different numbers of users, we also generate new results for bulk service queues. We also
consider bidirectional policies where there are no directional restrictions on resource allocation
and develop an algorithm for computing the optimal assignment which is more efficient than known
algorithms in the literature when there are more resources than users. Finally, numerical evaluation
of performance of unidirectional and bidirectional allocation schemes yields design guidelines
beneficial for resource placement.
