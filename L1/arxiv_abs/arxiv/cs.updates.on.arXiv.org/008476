Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) is a popular clustering and dimension reduction method
by decomposing a non-negative matrix into the product of two lower dimension matrices composed
of basis vectors. In this paper, we propose semi-orthogonal NMF, a novel method that enforces one
of the matrices to be orthogonal with mixed signs. Our method preserves strict orthogonality by
implementing the Cayley transformation to force the solution path to be exactly on the Stiefel manifold,
as opposed to the approximated orthogonality solutions in existing literature. We apply a line
search update scheme along with an SVD-based initialization which produces a rapid convergence
of the algorithm compared to other existing approaches. In addition, we present formulations of
our method to incorporate both continuous and binary design matrices. Through various simulation
studies, we show that our model has an advantage over other NMF variations regarding the accuracy
of the factorization, rate of convergence, and the degree of orthogonality while being computationally
competitive. We also apply our method to a text mining application on classifying triage notes and
show the effectiveness of our model in increasing classification accuracy compared to the conventional
bag-of-words model and other alternative matrix factorization approaches. The proposed methods,
along with a variety of existing non-negative matrix factorization approaches, are implemented
in the R package `MatrixFact', which is available on GitHub.
