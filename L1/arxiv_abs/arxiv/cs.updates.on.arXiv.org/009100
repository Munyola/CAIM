We consider the problem of designing scalable, robust protocols for computing statistics about
sensitive data. Specifically, we look at how best to design differentially private protocols in
a distributed setting, where each user holds a private datum. The literature has mostly considered
two models: the "central" model, in which a trusted server collects users' data in the clear, which
allows greater accuracy; and the "local" model, in which users individually randomize their data,
and need not trust the server, but accuracy is limited. Attempts to achieve the accuracy of the central
model without a trusted server have so far focused on variants of cryptographic MPC, which limits
scalability. In this paper, we initiate the analytic study of a shuffled model for distributed differentially
private algorithms, which lies between the local and central models. This simple-to-implement
model, a special case of the ESA framework of [Bittau et al., '17], augments the local model with an
anonymous channel that randomly permutes a set of user-supplied messages. For sum queries, we show
that this model provides the power of the central model while avoiding the need to trust a central
server and the complexity of cryptographic secure function evaluation. More generally, we give
evidence that the power of the shuffled model lies strictly between those of the central and local
models: for a natural restriction of the model, we show that shuffled protocols for a widely studied
selection problem require exponentially higher sample complexity than do central-model protocols.
