The application of biomechanic and motor control models in the control of bidedal robots (humanoids,
and exoskeletons) has revealed limitations of our understanding of human locomotion. A recently
proposed model uses the potential energy for bipedal structures to model the bipedal dynamics,
and it allows to predict the system dynamics from its kinematics. This work proposes a task-space
planner for human-like straight locomotion that target application of in rehabilitation robotics
and computational neuroscience. The proposed architecture is based on the potential energy model
and employs locomotor strategies from human data as a reference for human behaviour. The model generates
Centre of Mass (CoM) trajectories, foot swing trajectories and the Base of Support (BoS) over time.
The data show that the proposed architecture can generate behaviour in line with human walking strategies
for both the CoM and the foot swing. Despite the CoM vertical trajectory being not as smooth as a human
trajectory, yet the proposed model significantly reduces the error in the estimation of the CoM
vertical trajectory compared to the inverted pendulum models. The proposed model is also able to
asses the stability based on the body kinematics embedding in currently used in the clinical practice.
However, the model also implies a shift in the interpretation of the spatiotemporal parameters
of the gait, which are now determined by the conditions for the equilibrium and not \textit{vice
versa}. In other words, locomotion is a dynamic reaching where the motor primitives are also determined
by gravity.
