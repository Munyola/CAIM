Visual instance search involves retrieving from a collection of images the ones that contain an
instance of a visual query. Systems designed for visual instance search face the major challenge
of scalability: a collection of a few million images used for instance search typically creates
a few billion features that must be indexed. Furthermore, as real image collections grow rapidly,
systems must also provide dynamicity, i.e., be able to handle on-line insertions while concurrently
serving retrieval operations. Durability, which is the ability to recover correctly from software
and hardware crashes, is the natural complement of dynamicity. Durability, however, has rarely
been integrated within scalable and dynamic high-dimensional indexing solutions. This article
addresses the issue of dynamicity and durability for scalable indexing of very large and rapidly
growing collections of local features for instance retrieval. By extending the NV-tree, a scalable
disk-based high-dimensional index, we show how to implement the ACID properties of transactions
which ensure both dynamicity and durability. We present a detailed performance evaluation of the
transactional NV-tree: (i) We show that the insertion throughput is excellent despite the overhead
for enforcing the ACID properties; (ii) We also show that this transactional index is truly scalable
using a standard image benchmark embedded in collections of up to 28.5 billion high-dimensional
vectors; the largest single-server evaluations reported in the literature.
