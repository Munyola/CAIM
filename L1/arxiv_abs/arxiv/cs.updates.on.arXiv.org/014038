This paper proposes a novel tariff scheme and a new optimization framework in order to address the
recovery of fixed investment costs in transmission network planning, particularly against rising
demand elasticity. At the moment, ex-post network tariffs are utilized in addition to congestion
revenues to fully recover network costs, which often leads to over/under fixed cost recovery, thus
increasing the investment risk. Furthermore, in the case of agents with elastic market curves,
ex-post tariffs can cause several inefficiencies, such as mistrustful bidding to exploit ex-post
schemes, imperfect information in applied costs and cleared quantities, and negative surplus
for marginal generators and consumers. These problems are exacerbated by the increasing price-elasticity
of demand, caused for example by the diffusion of demand response technologies. To address these
issues, we design a dynamic ex-ante tariff scheme that explicitly accounts for the effect of tariffs
in the longterm network planning problem and in the underlying market clearing process. Using linearization
techniques and a novel reformulation of the congestion rent, the long-term network planning problem
is reformulated as a single mixed-integer linear problem which returns the combined optimal values
of network expansion and associated tariffs, while accounting for price-elastic agents and lumpy
investments. The advantages of the proposed approach in terms of cost recovery, market equilibrium
and increased social welfare are discussed qualitatively and are validated in numerical case studies.
