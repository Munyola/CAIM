An image is not just a collection of objects, but rather a graph where each object is related to other
objects through spatial and semantic relations. Using relational reasoning modules, allowing
message passing between objects, can therefore improve object detection. Current schemes apply
such dedicated modules either on a specific layer of the bottom-up stream, or between already-detected
objects. We show that the relational process can be better modeled in a coarse to fine manner and present
a novel framework, applying a non-local module sequentially to increasing resolution feature-maps
along the top-down stream. In this way, the inner relational process can naturally pass information
from larger objects to smaller related ones. Applying the modules to fine feature-maps also allows
message passing between the small objects themselves, exploiting repetitions of instances from
of the same class. In practice, due to the expensive memory utilization of the non-local module,
it is unfeasible to apply the module as currently used to high-resolution feature-maps. We efficiently
redesigned the non local module, improved it in terms of memory and number of operations, allowing
it to be placed anywhere along the network. We also incorporated relative spatial information into
the module, in a manner that can be incorporated into our efficient implementation. We show the effectiveness
of our scheme by improving the results of detecting small objects on COCO by 1.5 AP over Faster RCNN
and by 1 AP over using non-local module on the bottom-up stream.
