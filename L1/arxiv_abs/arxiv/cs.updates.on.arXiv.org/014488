Circadian rhythms govern most essential biological processes in the human body; they influence
multiple biological activities including sleep, performance, mood, skin temperature, hormone
production, and nutrient absorption. The dim light melatonin onset (DLMO) is the current gold standard
for measuring human circadian phase (or timing). The collection of DLMO is expensive and time consuming
since multiple saliva or blood samples are required from nighttime studies in specialized environmental
conditions. In the past few years, several non-invasive approaches have been designed for estimating
DLMO values. These methods collect daily sampled data (e.g., sleep onset/offset times) or frequently
sampled data (e.g., light exposure, skin temperature, physical activity collected every minute)
to train learning models for estimating DLMO, therefore previous studies only leveraged one time
scale. In this paper, we propose a two-step framework for estimating DLMO using the data of both time
scales. The first step summarizes the data prior to the current day, while the second step combines
this summary with frequently sampled data of the current day. We evaluate several variants of moving
average model which input sleep timing data as the first step and recurrent neural network models
as the second step for estimating DLMO. The experimental results show that our two-step model with
two-time-scale features has statistically significantly lower root-mean-square errors than
the models that use either daily sampled data or frequently sampled data alone.
