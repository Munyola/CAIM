Time-implicit schemes are attractive since they allow numerical time steps that are much larger
than those permitted by the Courant-Friedrich-Lewy criterion characterizing time-explicit
methods. This advantage comes, however, with a cost: the solution of a system of nonlinear equations
is required at each time step. In this work, the nonlinear system results from the discretization
of the hydrodynamical equations with the Crank-Nicholson scheme. We compare the cost of different
methods, based on Newton-Raphson iterations, to solve this nonlinear system, and benchmark their
performances against time-explicit schemes. Since our general scientific objective is to model
stellar interiors, we use as test cases two realistic models for the convective envelope of a red
giant and a young Sun. Focusing on 2D simulations, we show that the best performances are obtained
with the quasi-Newton method proposed by Broyden. Another important concern is the accuracy of
implicit calculations. Based on the study of an idealized problem, namely the advection of a single
vortex by a uniform flow, we show that there are two aspects: i) the nonlinear solver has to be accurate
enough to resolve the truncation error of the numerical discretization, and ii) the time step has
be small enough to resolve the advection of eddies. We show that with these two conditions fulfilled,
our implicit methods exhibit similar accuracy to time-explicit schemes, which have lower values
for the time step and higher computational costs. Finally, we discuss in the conclusion the applicability
of these methods to fully implicit 3D calculations.
