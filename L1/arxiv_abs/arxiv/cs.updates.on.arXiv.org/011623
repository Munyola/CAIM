Blind image quality assessment (BIQA) aims to predict perceptual image quality scores without
access to reference images. State-of-the-art BIQA methods typically require subjects to score
a large number of images to train a robust model. However, subjective quality scores are imprecise,
biased, and inconsistent, and it is challenging to obtain a large scale database, or to extend existing
databases, because of the inconvenience of collecting images, training the subjects, conducting
subjective experiments, and realigning human quality evaluations. To combat these limitations,
this paper explores and exploits preference image pairs (PIPs) such as "the quality of image $I_a$
is better than that of image $I_b$" for training a robust BIQA model. The preference label, representing
the relative quality of two images, is generally precise and consistent, and is not sensitive to
image content, distortion type, or subject identity; such PIPs can be generated at very low cost.
The proposed BIQA method is one of learning to rank. We first formulate the problem of learning the
mapping from the image features to the preference label as one of classification. In particular,
we investigate the utilization of a multiple kernel learning algorithm based on group lasso (MKLGL)
to provide a solution. A simple but effective strategy to estimate perceptual image quality scores
is then presented. Experiments show that the proposed BIQA method is highly effective and achieves
comparable performance to state-of-the-art BIQA algorithms. Moreover, the proposed method can
be easily extended to new distortion categories.
