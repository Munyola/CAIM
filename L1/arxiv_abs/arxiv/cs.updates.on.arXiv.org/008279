We revisit the computation of probability of collision in the context of automotive collision avoidance
(the estimation of a potential collision is also referred to as conflict detection in other contexts).
After reviewing existing approaches to the definition and computation of a collision probability
we argue that the question "What is the probability of collision within the next three seconds?"
can be answered on the basis of a collision probability rate. Using results on level crossings for
vector stochastic processes we derive a general expression for the upper bound of the distribution
of the collision probability rate. This expression is valid for arbitrary prediction models including
process noise. We demonstrate in several examples that distributions obtained by large-scale
Monte-Carlo simulations obey this bound and in many cases approximately saturate the bound. We
derive an approximation for the distribution of the collision probability rate that can be computed
on an embedded platform. In order to efficiently sample this probability rate distribution for
determination of its characteristic shape an adaptive method to obtain the sampling points is proposed.
An upper bound of the probability of collision is then obtained by one-dimensional numerical integration
over the time period of interest. We also argue that temporal collision measures such as time-to-collision
should not be calculated as separate or even prerequisite quantities but that they are properties
of the distribution of the collision probability rate.
