Fog radio access network (Fog-RAN), which pushes the caching and computing capabilities to the
network edge, is capable of efficiently delivering contents to users by using carefully designed
caching placement and content replacement algorithms. In this paper, the transmission scheme
design and coding parameter optimization will be considered for coded caching in Fog-RAN, where
the reliability of content delivery, i.e., content outage probability, is used as the performance
metric. The problem will be formulated as a complicated multi-objective probabilistic combinatorial
optimization. A novel maximum b-matching approach will then be proposed to obtain the Pareto optimal
solution with fairness constraint. Based on the fast message passing approach, a distributed algorithm
with a low memory usage of O(M + N) is also proposed, where M is the number of users and N is the number
of Fog-APs. Although it is usually very difficult to derive the closed-form formulas for the optimal
solution, the approximation formulas of the content outage probability will also be obtained as
a function of coding parameters. The asymptotic optimal coding parameters can then be obtained
by defining and deriving the outage exponent region (OER) and diversity-multiplexing region (DMR).
Simulation results will illustrate the accuracy of the theoretical derivations, and verify the
outage performance of the proposed approach. Therefore, this paper not only proposes a practical
distributed Fog-AP selection algorithm for coded caching, but also provides a systematic way to
evaluate and optimize the performance of Fog-RANs.
