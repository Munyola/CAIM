DC loads (such as computers, data centres, electric vehicle chargers, and LED lamps) and dc distributed
energy resources (such as fuel cells, solar photovoltaics, and energy storages) are rapidly growing
in electric power systems, so dc systems are being introduced as emerging practical investment
solutions compared to traditional ac options. DC microgrids offer several advantages such as the
elimination of need for synchronizing generators and easier supply of dc loads. Hybrid microgrids
can benefit from the advantages of both ac and dc microgrid types. Moreover, there would be a huge
reduction in the number of required power converters which would enhance the microgrid efficiency
and reduce investment and operation costs. This paper introduces hybrid ac/dc microgrid as a viable
solution compared to individual ac or dc microgrids and focuses on its planning. The objective of
the hybrid microgrid planning is to minimize the microgrid total cost, including investment cost
of distributed energy resources (DERs) and converters, operation cost of DERs, the cost of energy
exchange with the utility grid, and the cost of unserved energy during the planning horizon. The
economic viability of the microgrid planning is investigated in this paper and it is shown how the
optimal DER generation mix, the type of feeders, as well as the point of connection of DERs to feeders
can be determined by updating the traditional ac microgrid planning model. Numerical simulations
on a test microgrid exhibit the merits of the proposed model.
