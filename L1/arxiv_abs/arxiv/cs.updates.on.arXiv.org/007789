In this paper, we analyze the inverse dynamics and control of a bacteria-inspired uniflagellar
robot in a fluid medium at low Reynolds number. Inspired by the mechanism behind the locomotion of
flagellated bacteria, we consider a robot comprised of a flagellum -- a flexible helical filament
-- attached to a spherical head. The flagellum rotates about the head at a controlled angular velocity
and generates a propulsive force that moves the robot forward. When the angular velocity exceeds
a threshold value, the hydrodynamic force exerted by the fluid can cause the soft flagellum to buckle,
characterized by a dramatic change in shape. In this computational study, a fluid-structure interaction
model that combines Discrete Elastic Rods (DER) algorithm with Lighthill's Slender Body Theory
(LSBT) is employed to simulate the locomotion and deformation of the robot. We demonstrate that
the robot can follow a prescribed path in three dimensional space by exploiting buckling of the flagellum.
The control scheme involves only a single (binary) scalar input -- the angular velocity of the flagellum.
By triggering the buckling instability at the right moment, the robot can follow an arbitrary path
in three dimensional space. We also show that the complexity of the dynamics of the helical filament
can be captured using a deep neural network, from which we identify the input-output functional
relationship between the control inputs and the trajectory of the robot. Furthermore, our study
underscores the potential role of buckling in the locomotion of natural bacteria.
