We present Heartbeats-2-Bits (H2B), which is a system for securely pairing wearable devices by
generating a shared secret key from the skin vibrations caused by heartbeat. This work is motivated
by potential power saving opportunity arising from the fact that heartbeat intervals can be detected
energy-efficiently using inexpensive and power-efficient piezo sensors, which obviates the
need to employ complex heartbeat monitors such as Electrocardiogram or Photoplethysmogram. Indeed,
our experiments show that piezo sensors can measure heartbeat intervals on many different body
locations including chest, wrist, waist, neck and ankle. Unfortunately, we also discover that
the heartbeat interval signal captured by piezo vibration sensors has low Signal-to-Noise Ratio
(SNR) because they are not designed as precision heartbeat monitors, which becomes the key challenge
for H2B. To overcome this problem, we first apply a quantile function-based quantization method
to fully extract the useful entropy from the noisy piezo measurements. We then propose a novel Compressive
Sensing-based reconciliation method to correct the high bit mismatch rates between the two independently
generated keys caused by low SNR. We prototype H2B using off-the-shelf piezo sensors and evaluate
its performance on a dataset collected from different body positions of 23 participants. Our results
show that H2B has an overwhelming pairing success rate of 95.6%. We also analyze and demonstrate
H2B's robustness against three types of attacks. Finally, our power measurements show that H2B
is very power-efficient.
