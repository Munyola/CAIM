Online trolling has raised serious concerns about manipulating public opinion and exacerbating
political divides among social media users. In this work, we analyse the role and behaviour of Russian
trolls on Twitter through the lens of the social theory inspired by Tarde's ancient theory of monadology
and its further development in Actor-Network Theory. Based on what the theory suggests, the social
role or identity of individuals should be defined based on the traces they leave behind, which we
define as a succession of timestamped items (e.g. tweet texts). To operationalise this, we develop
a novel variant of text distance metric, time-sensitive semantic edit distance, accounting for
temporal context across multiple traces. The novel metric allows us to classify roles of trolls
based on their traces, in this case tweets, against a reference set. Through experiments aiming
to identify the role of trolls into one of left-leaning, right-leaning, and news feed categories,
we show the effectiveness of the proposed metric to measure differences between tweets in a temporal
context. Through the qualitative analysis of tweet visualisation using the semantic edit distance,
we find: (1) cooperation between different types of trolls despite having different and distinguishable
roles; (2) complex and orchestrated interplay between left- and right-leaning trolls; (3) multiple
agendas of news feed trolls to promote social disturbance and make Western democracy more fractious;
and (4) a distinct shift of trolling strategy from before to after the 2016 US election.
