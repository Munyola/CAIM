In this paper, we take a closer look at data augmentation for images, and describe a simple procedure
called AutoAugment to search for improved data augmentation policies. Our key insight is to create
a search space of data augmentation policies, evaluating the quality of a particular policy directly
on the dataset of interest. In our implementation, we have designed a search space where a policy
consists of many sub-policies, one of which is randomly chosen for each image in each mini-batch.
A sub-policy consists of two operations, each operation being an image processing function such
as translation, rotation, or shearing, and the probabilities and magnitudes with which the functions
are applied. We use a search algorithm to find the best policy such that the neural network yields
the highest validation accuracy on a target dataset. Our method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy
on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, SVHN, and ImageNet (without additional data). On ImageNet, we attain a
Top-1 accuracy of 83.54%. On CIFAR-10, we achieve an error rate of 1.48%, which is 0.65% better than
the previous state-of-the-art. On reduced data settings, AutoAugment performs comparably to
semi-supervised methods without using any unlabeled examples. Finally, policies learned from
one dataset can be transferred to work well on other similar datasets. For example, the policy learned
on ImageNet allows us to achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on the fine grained visual classification
dataset Stanford Cars, without fine-tuning weights pre-trained on additional data.
