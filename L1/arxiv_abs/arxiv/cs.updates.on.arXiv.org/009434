Let $A \in \{0,1\}^{n \times n}$ be a matrix with $z$ zeroes and $u$ ones and $x$ be an $n$-dimensional
vector of formal variables over a semigroup $(S, \circ)$. How many semigroup operations are required
to compute the linear operator $Ax$? As we observe in this paper, this problem contains as a special
case the well-known range queries problem and has a rich variety of applications in such areas as
graph algorithms, functional programming, circuit complexity, and others. It is easy to compute
$Ax$ using $O(u)$ semigroup operations. The main question studied in this paper is: can $Ax$ be computed
using $O(z)$ semigroup operations? We prove that in general this is not possible: there exists a
matrix $A \in \{0,1\}^{n \times n}$ with exactly two zeroes in every row (hence $z=2n$) whose complexity
is $\Theta(n\alpha(n))$ where $\alpha(n)$ is the inverse Ackermann function. However, for the
case when the semigroup is commutative, we give a constructive proof of an $O(z)$ upper bound. This
implies that in commutative settings, complements of sparse matrices can be processed as efficiently
as sparse matrices (though the corresponding algorithms are more involved). Note that this covers
the cases of Boolean and tropical semirings that have numerous applications, e.g., in graph theory.
As a simple application of the presented linear-size construction, we show how to multiply two $n\times
n$ matrices over an arbitrary semiring in $O(n^2)$ time if one of these matrices is a 0/1-matrix with
$O(n)$ zeroes (i.e., a complement of a sparse matrix).
