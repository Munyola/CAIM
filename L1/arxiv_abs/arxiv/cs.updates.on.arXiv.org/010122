Given the intractability of large scale HIN, network embedding which learns low dimensional proximity-preserved
representations for nodes in the new space becomes a natural way to analyse HIN. However, two challenges
arise in HIN embedding. (1) Different HIN structures with different semantic meanings play different
roles in capturing relationships among nodes in HIN, how can we learn personalized preferences
over different meta-paths for each individual node in HIN? (2) With the number of large scale HIN
increasing dramatically in various web services, how can we update the embedding information of
new nodes in an efficient way? To tackle these challenges, we propose a Hierarchical Attentive Heterogeneous
information network Embedding (HAHE ) model which is capable of learning personalized meta-path
preferences for each node as well as updating the embedding information for each new node efficiently
with only its neighbor node information. The proposed HAHE model extracts the semantic relationships
among nodes in the semantic space based on different meta-paths and adopts a neighborhood attention
layer to conduct weighted aggregations of neighborhood structure features for each node, enabling
the embedding information of each new node to be updated efficiently. Besides, a meta-path attention
layer is also employed to learn the personalized meta-path preferences for each individual node.
Extensive experiments on several real-world datasets show that our proposed HAHE model significantly
outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of various evaluation metrics.
