Reliable and accurate prediction of time series plays a crucial role in maritime industry, such
as economic investment, transportation planning, port planning and design, etc. The dynamic growth
of maritime time series has the predominantly complex, nonlinear and non-stationary properties.
To guarantee high-quality prediction performance, we propose to first adopt the empirical mode
decomposition (EMD) and ensemble EMD (EEMD) methods to decompose the original time series into
high- and low-frequency components. The low-frequency components can be easily predicted directly
through traditional neural network (NN) methods. It is more difficult to predict high-frequency
components due to their properties of weak mathematical regularity. To take advantage of the inherent
self-similarities within high-frequency components, these components will be divided into several
continuous small (overlapping) segments. The grouped segments with high similarities are then
selected to form more proper training datasets for traditional NN methods. This regrouping strategy
can assist in enhancing the prediction accuracy of high-frequency components. The final prediction
result is obtained by integrating the predicted high- and low-frequency components. Our proposed
three-step prediction frameworks benefit from the time series decomposition and similar segments
grouping. Experiments on both port cargo throughput and vessel traffic flow have illustrated its
superior performance in terms of prediction accuracy and robustness.
