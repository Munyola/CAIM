The purpose of this study is to evaluate the performance of the OphtAI system for the automatic detection
of referable diabetic retinopathy (DR) and the automatic assessment of DR severity using color
fundus photography. OphtAI relies on ensembles of convolutional neural networks trained to recognize
eye laterality, detect referable DR and assess DR severity. The system can either process single
images or full examination records. To document the automatic diagnoses, accurate heatmaps are
generated. The system was developed and validated using a dataset of 763,848 images from 164,660
screening procedures from the OPHDIAT screening program. For comparison purposes, it was also
evaluated in the public Messidor-2 dataset. Referable DR can be detected with an area under the ROC
curve of AUC = 0.989 in the Messidor-2 dataset, using the University of Iowa's reference standard
(95% CI: 0.984-0.994). This is significantly better than the only AI system authorized by the FDA,
evaluated in the exact same conditions (AUC = 0.980). OphtAI can also detect vision-threatening
DR with an AUC of 0.997 (95% CI: 0.996-0.998) and proliferative DR with an AUC of 0.997 (95% CI: 0.995-0.999).
The system runs in 0.3 seconds using a graphics processing unit and less than 2 seconds without. OphtAI
is safer, faster and more comprehensive than the only AI system authorized by the FDA so far. Instant
DR diagnosis is now possible, which is expected to streamline DR screening and to give easy access
to DR screening to more diabetic patients.
