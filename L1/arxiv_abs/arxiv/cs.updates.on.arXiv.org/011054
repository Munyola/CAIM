The use of bibliometric indicators would simplify research assessments. The 2014 Research Excellence
Framework (REF) is a peer review assessment of UK universities, whose results can be taken as benchmarks
for bibliometric indicators. In this study we use the REF results to investigate whether the ep index
and a top percentile of most cited papers could substitute for peer review. The probability that
a random university's paper reaches a certain top percentile in the global distribution of papers
is a power of the ep index, which can be calculated from the citation-based distribution of university's
papers in global top percentiles. Making use of the ep index in each university and research area,
we calculated the ratios between the percentage of 4-star-rated outputs in REF and the percentages
of papers in global top percentiles. Then, we fixed the assessment percentile so that the mean ratio
between these two indicators across universities is 1.0. This method was applied to four units of
assessment in REF: Chemistry, Economics & Econometrics joined to Business & Management Studies,
and Physics. Some relevant deviations from the 1.0 ratio could be explained by the evaluation procedure
in REF or by the characteristics of the research field; other deviations need specific studies by
experts in the research area. The present results indicate that in many research areas the substitution
of a top percentile indicator for peer review is possible. However, this substitution cannot be
made straightforwardly; more research is needed to establish the conditions of the bibliometric
assessment.
