Traffic sign recognition is a very important computer vision task for a number of real-world applications
such as intelligent transportation surveillance and analysis. While deep neural networks have
been demonstrated in recent years to provide state-of-the-art performance traffic sign recognition,
a key challenge for enabling the widespread deployment of deep neural networks for embedded traffic
sign recognition is the high computational and memory requirements of such networks. As a consequence,
there are significant benefits in investigating compact deep neural network architectures for
traffic sign recognition that are better suited for embedded devices. In this paper, we introduce
$\mu$Net, a highly compact deep convolutional neural network for real-time embedded traffic sign
recognition based on macroarchitecture design principles as well as microarchitecture optimization
strategies. The resulting overall architecture of $\mu$Net is thus designed with as few parameters
and computations as possible while maintaining recognition performance. The resulting $\mu$Net
possesses a model size of just ~1MB and ~510,000 parameters (~27x fewer parameters than state-of-the-art)
while still achieving a human performance level top-1 accuracy of 98.9% on the German traffic sign
recognition benchmark. Furthermore, $\mu$Net requires just $\sim$10 million multiply-accumulate
operations to perform inference. These experimental results show that highly compact, optimized
deep neural network architectures can be designed for real-time traffic sign recognition that
are well-suited for embedded scenarios.
