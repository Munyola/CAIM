Traditional Input-Output Feedback Linearization (IOFL) requires full knowledge of system dynamics
and assumes no disturbance at the input channel and no system's uncertainties. In this paper, a model-free
Active Input-Output Feedback Linearization (AIOFL) technique based on an Improved Active Disturbance
Rejection Control (IADRC) paradigm is proposed to design feedback linearization control law for
a generalized nonlinear system with known relative degree. The Linearization Control Law(LCL)
is composed of a scaled generalized disturbance estimated by an Improved Nonlinear Extended State
Observer (INLESO) with saturation-like behavior and the nominal control law produced by an Improved
Nonlinear State Error Feedback (INLSEF). The proposed AIOFL cancels in real-time fashion the generalized
disturbances which represent all the unwanted dynamics, exogenous disturbances, and system uncertainties
and transforms the system into a chain of integrators up to the relative degree of the system, the
only information required about the nonlinear system. Stability analysis has been conducted based
on Lyapunov functions and revealed the convergence of the INLESO and the asymptotic stability of
the closed-loop system. Verification of the outcomes has been achieved by applying the proposed
AIOFL technique on the Flexible Joint Single Link Manipulator (SLFJM). The simulations results
validated the effectiveness of the proposed AIOFL tool based on IADRC as compared to the conventional
ADRC based AIOFL and the traditional IOFL techniques.
