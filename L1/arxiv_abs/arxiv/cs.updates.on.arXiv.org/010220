In robotic surgery, the surgeon controls robotic instruments using dedicated interfaces. One
critical limitation of current interfaces is that they are designed to be operated by only the hands.
This means that the surgeon can only control at most two robotic instruments at one time while many
interventions require three instruments. This paper introduces a novel four-degree-of-freedom
foot-machine interface which allows the surgeon to control a third robotic instrument using the
foot, giving the surgeon a "third hand". This interface is essentially a parallel-serial hybrid
mechanism with springs and force sensors. Unlike existing switch-based interfaces that can only
un-intuitively generate motion in discrete directions, this interface allows intuitive control
of a slave robotic arm in continuous directions and speeds, naturally matching the foot movements
with dynamic force & position feedbacks. An experiment with ten naive subjects was conducted to
test the system. In view of the significant variance of motion patterns between subjects, a subject-specific
mapping from foot movements to command outputs was developed using Independent Component Analysis
(ICA). Results showed that the ICA method could accurately identify subjects' foot motion patterns
and significantly improve the prediction accuracy of motion directions from 68% to 88% as compared
with the forward kinematics-based approach. This foot-machine interface can be applied for the
teleoperation of industrial/surgical robots independently or in coordination with hands in the
future.
