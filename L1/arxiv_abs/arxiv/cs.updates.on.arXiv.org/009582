This paper highlights the significance of the rotor dynamics in control design for small-scale
aerobatic helicopters, and proposes two singularity free robust attitude tracking controllers
based on the available states for feedback. 1. The first, employs the angular velocity and the flap
angle states (a variable that is not easy to measure) and uses a backstepping technique to design
a robust compensator (BRC) to \textbf{\textit{actively}} suppress the disturbance induced tracking
error. 2. The second exploits the inherent damping present in the helicopter dynamics leading to
a structure preserving, \textbf{\textit{passively}} robust controller (SPR), which is free
of angular velocity and flap angle feedback. The BRC controller is designed to be robust in the presence
of two types of uncertainties: structured and unstructured. The structured disturbance is due
to uncertainty in the rotor parameters, and the unstructured perturbation is modeled as an exogenous
torque acting on the fuselage. The performance of the controller is demonstrated in the presence
of both types of disturbances through numerical simulations. In contrast, the SPR tracking controller
is derived such that the tracking error dynamics inherits the natural damping characteristic of
the helicopter. The SPR controller is shown to be almost globally asymptotically stable and its
performance is evaluated experimentally by performing aggressive flip maneuvers. Throughout
the study, a nonlinear coupled rotor-fuselage helicopter model with first order flap dynamics
is used.
