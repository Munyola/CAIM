To reap the benefits of the Internet of Things (IoT), it is imperative to secure the system against
cyber attacks in order to enable mission critical and real-time applications. To this end, intrusion
detection systems (IDSs) have been widely used to detect anomalies caused by a cyber attacker in
IoT systems. However, due to the large-scale nature of the IoT, an IDS must operate in a distributed
manner with minimum dependence on a central controller. Moreover, in many scenarios such as health
and financial applications, the datasets are private and IoTDs may not intend to share such data.
To this end, in this paper, a distributed generative adversarial network (GAN) is proposed to provide
a fully distributed IDS for the IoT so as to detect anomalous behavior without reliance on any centralized
controller. In this architecture, every IoTD can monitor its own data as well as neighbor IoTDs to
detect internal and external attacks. In addition, the proposed distributed IDS does not require
sharing the datasets between the IoTDs, thus, it can be implemented in IoTs that preserve the privacy
of user data such as health monitoring systems or financial applications. It is shown analytically
that the proposed distributed GAN has higher accuracy of detecting intrusion compared to a standalone
IDS that has access to only a single IoTD dataset. Simulation results show that, the proposed distributed
GAN-based IDS has up to 20% higher accuracy, 25% higher precision, and 60% lower false positive rate
compared to a standalone GAN-based IDS.
