This paper presents an adaptive image sampling algorithm based on Deep Learning (DL). The adaptive
sampling mask generation network is jointly trained with an image inpainting network. The sampling
rate is controlled in the mask generation network, and a binarization strategy is investigated
to make the sampling mask binary. Besides the image sampling and reconstruction application, we
show that the proposed adaptive sampling algorithm is able to speed up raster scan processes such
as the X-Ray fluorescence (XRF) image scanning process. Recently XRF laboratory-based systems
have evolved to lightweight and portable instruments thanks to technological advancements in
both X-Ray generation and detection. However, the scanning time of an XRF image is usually long due
to the long exposures requires (e.g., $100 \mu s-1ms$ per point). We propose an XRF image inpainting
approach to address the issue of long scanning time, thus speeding up the scanning process while
still maintaining the possibility to reconstruct a high quality XRF image. The proposed adaptive
image sampling algorithm is applied to the RGB image of the scanning target to generate the sampling
mask. The XRF scanner is then driven according to the sampling mask to scan a subset of the total image
pixels. Finally, we inpaint the scanned XRF image by fusing the RGB image to reconstruct the full
scan XRF image. The experiments show that the proposed adaptive sampling algorithm is able to effectively
sample the image and achieve a better reconstruction accuracy than that of the existing methods.
