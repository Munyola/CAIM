A passive local eavesdropper can leverage Website Fingerprinting (WF) to deanonymize the web browsing
activity of Tor users. The value of timing information to WF has often been discounted in recent works
due to the volatility of low-level timing information. In this paper, we more carefully examine
the extent to which packet timing can be used to facilitate WF attacks. We propose a new set of timing-related
features based on burst-level characteristics, as well as evaluate the effectiveness of raw timing
information in a deep-learning-based WF attack. To summarize our findings: (i) we achieve 84.32%
accuracy on undefended Tor using only our new timing features; (ii) using directional timing, we
get 93.5% on WTF-PAD traffic, several points above the prior state-of-the-art; (iii) we get 66.70%
accuracy against onion sites using only timing data, higher than using only directional data; and
(iv) we get 0.98 precision and 0.92 recall on undefended Tor in the open-world setting using only
raw timing. These findings indicate that developers of WF defenses need to consider timing as a potential
fingerprint for sites and protect against its use by the attacker. Additionally, in our study of
timing, we implemented a prototype of the Walkie-Talkie (W-T) defense and collected a new W-T dataset,
on which we get accuracy results above 90%, far above the theoretical maximum accuracy for the defense
of 50%. We discuss the reasons for these findings and challenges in Walkie-Talkie that must be addressed
before it could be deployed.
