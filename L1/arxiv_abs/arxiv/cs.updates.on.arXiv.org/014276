Label manipulation attacks are a subclass of data poisoning attacks in adversarial machine learning
used against different applications, such as malware detection. These types of attacks represent
a serious threat to detection systems in environments having high noise rate or uncertainty, such
as complex networks and Internet of Thing (IoT). Recent work in the literature has suggested using
the $K$-Nearest Neighboring (KNN) algorithm to defend against such attacks. However, such an approach
can suffer from low to wrong detection accuracy. In this paper, we design an architecture to tackle
the Android malware detection problem in IoT systems. We develop an attack mechanism based on Silhouette
clustering method, modified for mobile Android platforms. We proposed two Convolutional Neural
Network (CNN)-type deep learning algorithms against this \emph{Silhouette Clustering-based
Label Flipping Attack (SCLFA)}. We show the effectiveness of these two defense algorithms - \emph{Label-based
Semi-supervised Defense (LSD)} and \emph{clustering-based Semi-supervised Defense (CSD)}
- in correcting labels being attacked. We evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms by
varying the various machine learning parameters on three Android datasets: Drebin, Contagio,
and Genome and three types of features: API, intent, and permission. Our evaluation shows that using
random forest feature selection and varying ratios of features can result in an improvement of up
to 19\% accuracy when compared with the state-of-the-art method in the literature.
