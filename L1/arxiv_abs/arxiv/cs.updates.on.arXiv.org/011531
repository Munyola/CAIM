In this paper, we consider bounded width circuits and nondeterministic circuits in three somewhat
new directions. In the first part of this paper, we mainly consider bounded width circuits. The main
purpose of this part is to prove that there is a Boolean function $f$ which cannot be computed by any
nondeterministic circuit of size $O(n)$ and width $o(n)$. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first result on the lower bound of (nonuniform) bounded width circuits computing an explicit Boolean
function, even for deterministic circuits. Actually, we prove a more generalized lower bound.
Our proof outline for the lower bound also provides a satisfiability algorithm for nondeterministic
bounded width circuits. In the second part of this paper, we consider the power of nondeterministic
circuits. We prove that there is a Boolean function $f$ such that the nondeterministic $U_2$-circuit
complexity of $f$ is at most $2n + o(n)$ and the deterministic $U_2$-circuit complexity of $f$ is
$3n - o(n)$. This is the first separation on the power of deterministic and nondeterministic circuits
for general circuits. In the third part of this paper, we show a relation between deterministic bounded
width circuits and nondeterministic bounded width circuits. As the main consequence, we prove
that $\mathsf{L/quasipoly} \supseteq \mathsf{NL/poly}$. As a corollary, we obtain that $\mathsf{L/quasipoly}
\supset \mathsf{NL}$. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first result on $\mathsf{L}$ with
large (more precisely, superpolynomial size) advice.
