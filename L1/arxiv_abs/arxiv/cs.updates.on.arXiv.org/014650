Currently, nearly four billion people live in urban areas. Since this trend is increasing, natural
disasters or terrorist attacks in such areas affect an increasing number of people. While information
and communication technology is crucial for the operation of urban infrastructures and the well-being
of its inhabitants, current technology is quite vulnerable to disruptions of various kinds. In
future smart cities, a more resilient urban infrastructure is imperative to handle the increasing
number of hazardous situations. We present a novel resilient communication approach based on smart
street lights as part of the public infrastructure. It supports people in their everyday life and
adapts its functionality to the challenges of emergency situations. Our approach relies on various
environmental sensors and in-situ processing for automatic situation assessment, and a range
of communication mechanisms (e.g., public WiFi hotspot functionality and mesh networking) for
maintaining a communication network. Furthermore, resilience is not only achieved based on infrastructure
deployed by a digital city's municipality, but also based on integrating citizens through software
that runs on their mobile devices (e.g., smartphones and tablets). Web-based zero-installation
and platform-agnostic apps can switch to device-to-device communication to continue benefiting
people even during a disaster situation. Our approach, featuring a covert channel for professional
responders and the zero-installation app, is evaluated through a prototype implementation based
on a commercially available street light.
