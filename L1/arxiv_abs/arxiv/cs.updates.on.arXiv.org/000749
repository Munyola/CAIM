There are logics where necessity is defined by means of a given identity connective: $\square\varphi
:= \varphi\equiv\top$ ($\top$ is a tautology). On the other hand, in many standard modal logics
the concept of propositional identity (PI) is given by strict equivalence (SE) $\square(\varphi\leftrightarrow\psi)$.
All these approaches to modality involve a principle that we call the Collapse Axiom (CA): "There
is only one necessary proposition." In this paper, we extend basic non-Fregean logic $SCI$ to a modal
logic without CA such that necessity and propositional identity are integrated as non-interdefinable
concepts, though PI refines SE. Also we add axioms for propositional quantifiers. We concentrate
on non-normal modal logic $S3$ which turns out to be the smallest Lewis system such that propositional
identity can be defined as strict equivalence. Our semantics relies on models of $SCI$. We show that
$SCI$-models and Boolean prealgebras are essentially the same objects. This associates non-Fregean
logic with research on hyperintensional semantics. Much more intensions than in standard semantics
of modal logic can be distinguished. PI coincides with SE iff the $SCI$-style models are Boolean
algebras and CA is valid. A representation result establishes a connection to Kit Fine's approach
to propositional quantifiers and also shows that we obtain \textit{conservative} extensions
of $S4$ and $S5$. Excluding the Barcan formula and further principles results in a system which is
still complete w.r.t. a more general denotational semantics and moreover is a conservative extension
of $S3$.
