The ability to achieve coordinated behavior -- engineered or emergent -- on networked systems has
attracted widespread interest over several fields. This has led to remarkable advances on the development
of a theoretical understanding of the conditions under which agents within a network can reach agreement
(consensus) or develop coordinated behaviors such as synchronization. However, fewer advances
have been made toward explaining another commonly observed phenomena in tightly-connected networks
systems: output responses of nodes in the networks are almost identical to each other despite heterogeneity
in their individual dynamics. In this paper, we leverage tools from high-dimensional probability
to provide an initial answer to this phenomena. More precisely, we show that for linear networks
of nodal random transfer functions, as the networks size and connectivity grows, every node in the
network follows the same response to an input or disturbance --irrespectively of the source of this
input. We term this behavior as \emph{dynamics concentration} as it stems from the fact that the
network transfer matrix uniformly converges in probability to a unique dynamic response -- i.e.,
it concentrates -- determined by the distribution of the random transfer function of each node.
We further discuss the implications of our analysis in the context of model reduction and robustness
and provide numerical evidence that similar phenomena occur in small deterministic networks over
a properly defined frequency band.
