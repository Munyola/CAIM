Predictions and predictive knowledge have seen recent success in improving not only robot control
but also other applications ranging from industrial process control to rehabilitation. A property
that makes these predictive approaches well suited for robotics is that they can be learned online
and incrementally through interaction with the environment. However, a remaining challenge for
many prediction-learning approaches is an appropriate choice of prediction-learning parameters,
especially parameters that control the magnitude of a learning machine's updates to its predictions
(the learning rate or step size). To begin to address this challenge, we examine the use of online
step-size adaptation using a sensor-rich robotic arm. Our method of choice, Temporal-Difference
Incremental Delta-Bar-Delta (TIDBD), learns and adapts step sizes on a feature level; importantly,
TIDBD allows step-size tuning and representation learning to occur at the same time. We show that
TIDBD is a practical alternative for classic Temporal-Difference (TD) learning via an extensive
parameter search. Both approaches perform comparably in terms of predicting future aspects of
a robotic data stream. Furthermore, the use of a step-size adaptation method like TIDBD appears
to allow a system to automatically detect and characterize common sensor failures in a robotic application.
Together, these results promise to improve the ability of robotic devices to learn from interactions
with their environments in a robust way, providing key capabilities for autonomous agents and robots.
