Previous papers have described a computational approach to System of Systems (SoS) development
using an Agent-Based Model (ABM). This paper describes the Fuzzy Decision Analysis used in the negotiation
between the SoS agent and a System agent in the ABM of an Acknowledged SoS development. An Acknowledged
SoS has by definition a limited influence on the development of the individual Systems. The individual
Systems have their own priorities, pressures, and agenda which may or may not align with the goals
of the SoS. The SoS has some funding and deadlines which can be used to negotiate with the individual
System in order to illicit the required capability from that System. The Fuzzy Decision Analysis
determines how the SoS agent will adjust the funding and deadlines for each of the Systems in order
to achieve the desired SoS architecture quality. The Fuzzy Decision Analysis has inputs of performance,
funding, and deadlines as well as weights for each capability. The performance, funding, and deadlines
are crisp values which are fuzzified. The fuzzified values are then used with a Fuzzy Inference Engine
to get the fuzzy outputs of funding adjustment and deadline adjustment which must then be defuzzified
before being passed to the System agent. The first contribution of this paper is the fuzzy decision
analysis that represents the negotiation between the SoS agent and the System agent. A second contribution
of this paper is the method of implementing the fuzzy decision analysis which provides a generalized
fuzzy decision analysis.
