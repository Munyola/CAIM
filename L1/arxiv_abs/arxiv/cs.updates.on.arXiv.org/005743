Delayed feedback plays a vital role in determining the qualitative dynamical properties of a platoon
of vehicles driving on a straight road. Motivated by the positive impact of Delayed Acceleration
Feedback (DAF) in various scenarios, in this paper, we incorporate DAF into the Classical Car-Following
Model (CCFM). We begin by deriving the Classical Car-Following Model with Delayed Acceleration
Feedback (CCFM-DAF). We then derive the necessary and sufficient condition for local stability
of the CCFM-DAF. Next, we show that the CCFM-DAF transits from the locally stable to the unstable
regime via a Hopf bifurcation; thus leading to the emergence of limit cycles in system dynamics.
We then propose a suitable linear transformation that enables us to analyze the local bifurcation
properties of the CCFM-DAF by studying the analogous properties of the CCFM. We also study the impact
of DAF on three important dynamical properties of the CCFM; namely, non-oscillatory convergence,
string stability and robust stability. Our analyses are complemented with a stability chart and
a bifurcation diagram. Our work reveals the following detrimental effects of DAF on the CCFM: (i)
reduction in the locally stable region, (ii) increase in the frequency of the emergent limit cycles,
(iii) decrease in the amplitude of the emergent limit cycles, (iv) destruction of the non-oscillatory
property, (vi) increased risk of string instability, and (vii) reduced resilience towards parametric
uncertainty. Thus, we report a practically-relevant application wherein DAF degrades the performance
in several metrics of interest.
