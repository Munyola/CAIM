Recently, steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP)-based brain-computer interface (BCI)
has attracted much attention due to its high information transfer rate (ITR) and increasing number
of targets. However, the performance of SSVEP-based methods in terms of accuracy and time length
required for target detection can be improved. We propose a new canonical correlation analysis
(CCA)-based method to integrate subject-specific models and subject-independent information
and enhance BCI performance. To optimize hyperparameters for CCA-based model of a specific subject,
we propose to use training data of other subjects. An ensemble version of the proposed method is also
developed and used for a fair comparison with ensemble task-related component analysis (TRCA).
A publicly available 35-subject SSVEP benchmark dataset is used to evaluate different methods.
The proposed method is compared with TRCA and extended CCA methods as reference methods. The performance
of the methods is evaluated using classification accuracy and ITR. Offline analysis results show
that the proposed method reaches highest ITR compared with TRCA and extended CCA. Also, the proposed
method significantly improves performance of extended CCA in all conditions and TRCA for time windows
greater than 0.3 s. In addition, the proposed method outperforms TRCA for low number of training
blocks and electrodes. This study illustrates that adding subject-independent information to
subject-specific models can improve the performance of SSVEP-based BCIs.
