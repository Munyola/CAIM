We present a novel data-driven nested optimization framework that addresses the problem of coupling
between plant and controller optimization. This optimization strategy is tailored towards instances
where a closed-form expression for the system dynamic response is unobtainable and simulations
or experiments are necessary. Specifically, Bayesian Optimization, which is a data-driven technique
for finding the optimum of an unknown and expensive-to-evaluate objective function, is employed
to solve a nested optimization problem. The underlying objective function is modeled by a Gaussian
Process (GP); then, Bayesian Optimization utilizes the predictive uncertainty information from
the GP to determine the best subsequent control or plant parameters. The proposed framework differs
from the majority of co-design literature where there exists a closed-form model of the system dynamics.
Furthermore, we utilize the idea of Batch Bayesian Optimization at the plant optimization level
to generate a set of plant designs at each iteration of the overall optimization process, recognizing
that there will exist economies of scale in running multiple experiments in each iteration of the
plant design process. We validate the proposed framework for a Buoyant Airborne Turbine (BAT).
We choose the horizontal stabilizer area, longitudinal center of mass relative to center of buoyancy
(plant parameters), and the pitch angle set-point (controller parameter) as our decision variables.
Our results demonstrate that these plant and control parameters converge to their respective optimal
values within only a few iterations.
