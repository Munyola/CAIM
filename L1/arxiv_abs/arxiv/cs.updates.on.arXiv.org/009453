We analyze the computational complexity of the many types of pencil-and-paper-style puzzles featured
in the 2016 puzzle video game The Witness. In all puzzles, the goal is to draw a simple path in a rectangular
grid graph from a start vertex to a destination vertex. The different puzzle types place different
constraints on the path: preventing some edges from being visited (broken edges); forcing some
edges or vertices to be visited (hexagons); forcing some cells to have certain numbers of incident
path edges (triangles); or forcing the regions formed by the path to be partially monochromatic
(squares), have exactly two special cells (stars), or be singly covered by given shapes (polyominoes)
and/or negatively counting shapes (antipolyominoes). We show that any one of these clue types (except
the first) is enough to make path finding NP-complete ("witnesses exist but are hard to find"), even
for rectangular boards. Furthermore, we show that a final clue type (antibody), which necessarily
"cancels" the effect of another clue in the same region, makes path finding $\Sigma_2$-complete
("witnesses do not exist"), even with a single antibody (combined with many anti/polyominoes),
and the problem gets no harder with many antibodies. On the positive side, we give a polynomial-time
algorithm for monomino clues, by reducing to hexagon clues on the boundary of the puzzle, even in
the presence of broken edges, and solving "subset Hamiltonian path" for terminals on the boundary
of an embedded planar graph in polynomial time.
