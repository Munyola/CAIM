Current artificial intelligence (AI) technology is mainly used in rational work such as computation
and logical analysis. How to make the machine as aesthetic and creative as humans has gradually gained
attention. This paper presents a creative game system (i.e., CreativeBioMan) for the first time.
It combines brain wave data and multimodal emotion data, and then uses an AI algorithm for intelligent
decision fusion, which can be used in artistic creation, aiming at separating the artist from repeated
labor creation. To imitate the process of humans' artistic creation, the creation process of the
algorithm is related to artists' previous artworks and their emotion. EEG data is used to analyze
the style of artists and then match them with a style from a data set of historical works. Then, universal
AI algorithms are combined with the unique creativity of each artist that evolve into a personalized
creation algorithm. According to the results of cloud emotion recognition, the color of the artworks
is corrected so that the artist's emotions are fully reflected in the works, and thus novel works
of art are created. This allows the machine to integrate the understanding of past art and emotions
with the ability to create new art forms, in the same manner as humans. This paper introduces the system
architecture of CreativeBioMan from two aspects: data collection of the brain and body wearable
devices, as well as the intelligent decision-making fusion of models. A Testbed platform is built
for an experiment and the creativity of the works produced by the system is analyzed.
