The upcoming 5G networks demand high-speed and high spectral-efficiency communications to keep
up with the proliferating traffic demands. To this end, Massive multiple-input multiple-output
(MIMO) techniques have gained significant traction owing to its ability to achieve these without
increasing bandwidth or density of base stations. The preexisting space-time block code (STBC)
designs cannot achieve a rate of more than 1 for more than two transmit antennas while preserving
the orthogonality and full diversity conditions. In this paper, we present Jagannath codes - a novel
complex modulation STBC, that achieves a very high rate of 2 for three and four transmit antennas.
The presented designs achieve full diversity and overcome the previously achieved rates with the
three and four antenna MIMO systems. We present a detailed account of the code construction of the
proposed designs, orthogonality and full diversity analysis, transceiver model and conditional
maximum likelihood (ML) decoding. In an effort to showcase the improvement achieved with the presented
designs, we compare the rates and delays of some of the known STBCs with the proposed designs. The
effective spectral efficiency and coding gain of the presented designs are compared to the Asymmetric
Coordinate Interleaved design (ACIOD) and Jafarkhani code. We presented an effective spectral
efficiency improvement by a factor of 2 with the proposed Jagannath codes. Owing to the full diversity
of the presented designs, we demonstrate significant coding gains (6 dB and 12 dB) with the proposed
designs.
