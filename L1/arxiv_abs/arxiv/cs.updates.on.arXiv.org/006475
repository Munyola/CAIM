Electric vehicles play a key role in the sustainability of the Smart Cities as they contribute to
the reduction of carbon emissions, the preservation of natural resources and the overall quality
of life of citizens. However, when the Smart Grid powers the charging of electric vehicles, high
energy costs and power peaks challenge system reliability with risks of blackouts. This is especially
the case when the Smart Grid has to moderate additional uncertainties such as the penetration of
renewable energy resources or energy market dynamics. In addition, social dynamics such as the
participation in demand-response programs, the discomfort experienced by an alternative suggested
usage of the electric vehicles and even the fairness in terms of how equally discomfort is experienced
among the participating citizens perplex even further the operation and regulation of the Smart
Grid. This paper introduces a fully decentralized and privacy-preserving learning mechanism
for charging control of electric vehicles that regulates three Smart Grid socio-technical aspects:
(i) reliability, (ii) discomfort and (iii) fairness. By exclusively using local knowledge, an
autonomous software agent generates energy demand plans for its vehicle that encode different
charging regimes for the battery. Agents interact to learn and make collective decisions of which
plan to execute so that power peaks and energy cost are reduced. The impact of improving reliability
on discomfort and fairness is empirically shown using real-world data under a varied participation
level of electric vehicles in the optimization process.
