We investigate three questions in Boolean Network Tomography, related to maximal vertex identifiability,
i.e. the maximal number of failing nodes simultaneously identifiable in a network. First, how to
characterize the identifiability of the network through structural measures of its topology;
second, how many monitors are needed and where to place them to maximize identifiability of failures;
third, which tradeoffs are there between the number of monitors and the maximal number of identifiable
failures. We first consider Line-of-Sight networks and we characterize the maximal identifiability
of such networks highlighting that vertex-connectivity plays a central role. Motivated by this
observation, we give a precise characterization of the maximal identifiability in terms of vertex-connectivity
for {\em any network}: using Menger's theorem, we prove that the maximal identifiability of any
network $G$ is always either $\kappa(G)-2$ or $\kappa(G)-1$, where $\kappa(G)$ is $G$'s vertex
connectivity. A consequence of this is a first algorithm based on the well-known Max-Flow problem
to decide where to place the monitors in {\em any network} in order to maximize identifiability.
Finally we initiate the study of maximal identifiability for random networks. We focus on two models:
the classical Erd\H{o}s-R\`enyi model, and that of Random Regular graphs. The framework proposed
in the paper allows a probabilistic analysis of the identifiability in random networks giving a
tradeoff between the number of monitors to place and the maximal identifiability.
