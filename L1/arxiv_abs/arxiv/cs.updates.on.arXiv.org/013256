Background: Agile methods are no longer restricted to small projects and co-located teams. The
last decade has seen the spread of agile into large scale, distributed and regulated domains. Many
case studies show successful agile adoption in GSD, however, taken as a whole, it remains unclear
how widespread this trend is, and what form the agile adoption takes in a global software development
(GSD) setting. Aims: Our objective is to gain a deeper understanding of how organisations adopt
agile development methods in distributed settings. Specifically we aim to plot the current development
process landscape in GSD. Method: We analyse industrial survey data from 33 different countries
collected as part of the project that explored the wider use of hybrid development approaches in
software development. We extract and analyse the results of 263 surveys completed by participants
involved in globally distributed projects. Results: In our sample, 72 of globally distributed
projects implement a mix of both agile and traditional approaches (termed `hybrid'). 25 of GSD organisations
are predominantly agile, with only very few (5) opting for traditional approaches. GSD projects
that used only agile methods tended to be very large. Conclusions: Globally Distributed Software
Development (and project size) is not a barrier to adopting agile practices. Yet, to facilitate
project coordination and general project management, many adopt traditional approaches, resulting
in a hybrid approach that follows defined rules.
