In this paper, we develop efficient decoders for non-binary low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes
using the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). We apply ADMM to two decoding problems.
The first problem is the linear programming (LP) decoding problem. In order to develop an efficient
algorithm, we focus on non-binary codes in fields of characteristic two. This allows us to use operations
in $\mathbb{F}_2$ to relax further the set of constraints into a form that has a factor graph representation.
Applying ADMM to the LP decoding problem yields two types of non-trivial sub-routines. The first
type of sub-routine requires solving an unconstrained quadratic program. We solve this problem
efficiently by leveraging new properties on constraints of the LP decoding problem. The second
type of sub-routine requires Euclidean projection onto polytopes that are studied in the literature,
and which can be solved efficiently using off-the-shelf techniques. These techniques scales linearly
with the dimension of the vector to project. ADMM LP decoding scales linearly with block length,
linearly with check degree, and quadratically with field size. The second problem we consider is
a penalized LP decoding problem. This problem is obtained by incorporating a penalty term into the
LP decoding objective. The ADMM algorithm for this problem requires Euclidean projection onto
a polytope formed from embeddings of the non-binary single parity-check code, which can be solved
by applying ADMM a second time. Empirically, this decoder significantly outperforms LP decoding
at low signal-to-noise ratios.
