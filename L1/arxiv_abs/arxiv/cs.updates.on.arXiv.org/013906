Energy efficiency is one of the primary concerns when designing large scale computing systems.
This makes reconfigurable hardware an attractive alternative to load-store architectures, as
it allows eliminating expensive control and data movement overheads in computations. In practice,
these devices are often not considered in the high-performance computing community, due to the
steep learning curve and low productivity of hardware design, and the lack of available library
support for fundamental operations. With the introduction of high-level synthesis (HLS) tools,
programming hardware has become more accessible, but optimizing for these architectures requires
factoring in new transformations and trade-offs between hardware resources and computational
performance. We present FBLAS, an open source implementation of BLAS for FPGAs. FBLAS is implemented
with HLS, enabling reusability, maintainability, and portability across FPGAs, and easy integration
with existing software and hardware codes. By using the work-depth model, we capture the space/time
trade-off of designing linear algebra circuits, allowing modules to be optimized within performance
or resource constraints. Module interfaces are designed to natively support streaming communication
across on-chip connections, allowing them to be composed to reduce off-chip communication. With
the methodologies used to design FBLAS, we hope to set a precedent for FPGA library design, and contribute
to the toolbox of customizable hardware components that is necessary for HPC codes to start productively
targeting reconfigurable platforms.
