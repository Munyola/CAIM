Correlation clustering is a fundamental combinatorial optimization problem arising in many contexts
and applications that has been the subject of dozens of papers in the literature. In this problem
we are given a general weighted graph where each edge is labeled positive or negative. The goal is
to obtain a partitioning (clustering) of the vertices that minimizes disagreements - weight of
negative edges trapped inside a cluster plus positive edges between different clusters. Most of
the papers on this topic mainly focus on minimizing total disagreement, a global objective for this
problem. In this paper, we study a cluster-wise objective function that asks to minimize the maximum
number of disagreements of each cluster, which we call min-max correlation clustering. The min-max
objective is a natural objective that respects the quality of every cluster. In this paper, we provide
the first nontrivial approximation algorithm for this problem achieving an $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{\log
n\cdot\max\{\log(|E^-|),\log(k)\}})$ approximation for general weighted graphs, where $|E^-|$
denotes the number of negative edges and $k$ is the number of clusters in the optimum solution. To
do so, we also obtain a corresponding result for multicut where we wish to find a multicut solution
while trying to minimize the total weight of cut edges on every component. The results are then further
improved to obtain (i) $\mathcal{O}(r^2)$-approximation for min-max correlation clustering
and min-max multicut for graphs that exclude $K_{r,r}$ minors (ii) a 14-approximation for the min-max
correlation clustering on complete graphs.
