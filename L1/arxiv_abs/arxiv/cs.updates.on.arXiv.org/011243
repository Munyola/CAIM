We present a Deep Neural Network (DNN) model for predicting electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities
in short-duration 12-lead ECG recordings. The analysis of the digital ECG obtained in a clinical
setting can provide a full evaluation of the cardiac electrical activity and have not been studied
in an end-to-end machine learning scenario. Using the database of the Telehealth Network of Minas
Gerais, under the scope of the CODE (Clinical Outcomes in Digital Electrocardiology) study, we
built a novel dataset with more than 2 million ECG tracings, orders of magnitude larger than those
used in previous studies. Moreover, our dataset is more realistic, as it consists of 12-lead ECGs
recorded during standard in-clinic exams. Using this data, we trained a residual neural network
with 9 convolutional layers to map ECG signals with a duration of 7 to 10 seconds into 6 different classes
of ECG abnormalities. High-performance measures were obtained for all ECG abnormalities, with
F1 scores above $80\%$ and specificity indexes over $99\%$. We compare the performance with cardiology
and emergency resident medical doctors as well as medical students and, considering the F1 score,
the DNN matches or outperforms the medical residents and students for all abnormalities. These
results indicate that end-to-end automatic ECG analysis based on DNNs, previously used only in
a single-lead setup, generalizes well to the 12-lead ECG. This is an important result in that it takes
this technology much closer to standard clinical practice.
