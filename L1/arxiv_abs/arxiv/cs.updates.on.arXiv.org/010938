High dimensional data often contain multiple facets, and several clustering patterns (views)
can co-exist under different feature subspaces. While multi-view clustering algorithms were
proposed, the uncertainty quantification remains difficult --- a particular challenge is in the
high complexity of estimating the cluster assignment probability under each view, or/and to efficiently
share information across views. In this article, we propose an empirical Bayes approach --- viewing
the similarity matrices generated over subspaces as rough first-stage estimates for co-assignment
probabilities, in its Kullback-Leibler neighborhood we obtain a refined low-rank soft cluster
graph, formed by the pairwise product of simplex coordinates. Interestingly, each simplex coordinate
directly encodes the cluster assignment uncertainty. For multi-view clustering, we equip each
similarity matrix with a mixed membership over a small number of latent views, leading to effective
dimension reduction. With a high model flexibility, the estimation can be succinctly re-parameterized
as a continuous optimization problem, hence enjoys gradient-based computation. Theory establishes
the connection of this model to random cluster graph under multiple views. Compared to single-view
clustering approaches, substantially more interpretable results are obtained when clustering
brains from human traumatic brain injury study, using high-dimensional gene expression data.
