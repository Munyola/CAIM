Owing to severe path loss and unreliable transmission over a long distance at higher frequency bands,
we investigate the problem of path selection and rate allocation for multi-hop self-backhaul millimeter
wave (mmWave) networks. Enabling multi-hop mmWave transmissions raises a potential issue of increased
latency, and thus, in this work we aim at addressing the fundamental questions: how to select the
best multi-hop paths and how to allocate rates over these paths subject to latency constraints?
In this regard, we propose a new system design, which exploits multiple antenna diversity, mmWave
bandwidth, and traffic splitting techniques to improve the downlink transmission. The studied
problem is cast as a network utility maximization, subject to an upper delay bound constraint, network
stability, and network dynamics. By leveraging stochastic optimization, the problem is decoupled
into: path selection and rate allocation sub-problems, whereby a framework which selects the best
paths is proposed using reinforcement learning techniques. Moreover, the rate allocation is a
nonconvex program, which is converted into a convex one by using the successive convex approximation
method. Via mathematical analysis, we provide a comprehensive performance analysis and convergence
proofs for the proposed solution. Numerical results show that our approach ensures reliable communication
with a guaranteed probability of up to $99.9999\%$, and reduces latency by $50.64\%$ and $92.9\%$
as compared to baseline models. Furthermore, the results showcase the key trade-off between latency
and network arrival rate.
