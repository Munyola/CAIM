Objective: Reproducibility is a core tenet of scientific research. A reproducible study is one
where the results can be recreated by different investigators in different circumstances using
the same methodology and materials. Unfortunately, reproducibility is not a standard to which
the majority of research is currently adherent. Methods: We objectively evaluated 300 trials in
the field of Obstetrics and Gynecology for fourteen indicators of reproducibility. These indicators
include availability of data, analysis scripts, pre-registration information, study protocols
and whether or not the study was available via Open Access. We also assessed the trials for financial
conflict of interest statements and source of funding. Results: Of the 300 trials in our sample,
208 contained empirical data that could be assessed for reproducibility. None of the trials in our
sample provided a link to their protocols or provided a statement on availability of materials.
None were replication studies. Just 10.58% provided a statement regarding their data availability,
while only 5.82% provided a statement on preregistration. 25.85% failed to report the presence
or absence of conflicts of interest and 54.08% did not state the origin of their funding. Conclusion:
Research in the field of Obstetrics and Gynecology is not consistently reproducible and frequently
lacks conflict of interest disclosure. Consequences of this could be far-reaching and include
increased research waste, widespread acceptance of misleading results and erroneous conclusions
guiding clinical decision-making.
