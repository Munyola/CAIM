{\em Interactive proof systems} (IP) are very powerful-languages they can accept form exactly
PSPACE. They represent also one of the very fundamental concepts of theoretical computing and a
model of computation by interactions. One of the key players in IP are verifiers. In the original
model of IP whose power is that of PSPACE, the only restriction on verifiers is that they work in randomized
polynomial time. Because of such key importance of IP, it is of large interest to find out how powerful
will IP be when verifiers are more restricted. So far this was explored for the case that verifiers
are {\em two-way probabilistic finite automata} (Dwork and Stockmayer, 1990) and {\em one-way
quantum finite automata} as well as {\em two-way quantum finite automata} (Nishimura and Yamakami,
2009). In this paper we explore the power of special type of IP in which verifiers uses {\em public
randomization}, namely so called {\em Arthur-Merlin proof systems} (AM), for the case that verifiers
are {\em two-way finite automata with quantum and classical states} (2QCFA) introduced by Ambainis
and Watrous in 2002 and the communications are classical. It is of interest to consider AM with such
"semi-quantum" verifiers because 2QCFA use only limited quantum resources. Our main result is
that such Quantum Arthur-Merlin proof systems (QAM(2QCFA) are asymptotically more powerful than
in the case verifiers are two-way probabilistic finite automata (AM(2PFA)) and that there is an
NP-complete language, modeling the 0-1 knapsack problem, that can be recognized by QAM(2QCFA).
