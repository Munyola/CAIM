Cascading failures in power systems exhibit non-local propagation patterns which make the analysis
and mitigation of failures difficult. In this work, we propose a distributed control framework
inspired by the recently proposed concepts of unified controller and network tree-partition that
offers strong guarantees in both the mitigation and localization of cascading failures in power
systems. In this framework, the transmission network is partitioned into several control areas
which are connected in a tree structure, and the unified controller is adopted by generators or controllable
loads for fast timescale disturbance response. After an initial failure, the proposed strategy
always prevents successive failures from happening, and regulates the system to the desired steady
state where the impact of initial failures are localized as much as possible. For extreme failures
that cannot be localized, the proposed framework has a configurable design, that progressively
involves and coordinates more control areas for failure mitigation and, as a last resort, imposes
minimal load shedding. We compare the proposed control framework with Automatic Generation Control
(AGC) on the IEEE 118-bus test system. Simulation results show that our novel framework greatly
improves the system robustness in terms of the N-1 security standard, and localizes the impact of
initial failures in majority of the load profiles that are examined. Moreover, the proposed framework
incurs significantly less load loss, if any, compared to AGC, in all of our case studies.
