Change detection has been a hotspot in remote sensing technology for a long time. With the increasing
availability of multi-temporal remote sensing images, numerous change detection algorithms
have been proposed. Among these methods, image transformation methods with feature extraction
and mapping could effectively highlight the changed information and thus has better change detection
performance. However, changes of multi-temporal images are usually complex, existing methods
are not effective enough. In recent years, deep network has shown its brilliant performance in many
fields including feature extraction and projection. Therefore, in this paper, based on deep network
and slow feature analysis (SFA) theory, we proposed a new change detection algorithm for multi-temporal
remotes sensing images called Deep Slow Feature Analysis (DSFA). In DSFA model, two symmetric deep
networks are utilized for projecting the input data of bi-temporal imagery. Then, the SFA module
is deployed to suppress the unchanged components and highlight the changed components of the transformed
features. The CVA pre-detection is employed to find unchanged pixels with high confidence as training
samples. Finally, the change intensity is calculated with chi-square distance and the changes
are determined by threshold algorithms. The experiments are performed on two real-world datasets
and a public hyperspectral dataset. The visual comparison and quantitative evaluation have both
shown that DSFA could outperform the other state-of-the-art algorithms, including other SFA-based
and deep learning methods.
