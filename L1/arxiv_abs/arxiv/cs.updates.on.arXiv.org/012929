The analyses relying on 3D point clouds are an utterly complex task, often involving million of points,
but also requiring computationally efficient algorithms because of many real-time applications;
e.g. autonomous vehicle. However, point clouds are intrinsically irregular and the points are
sparsely distributed in a non-Euclidean space, which normally requires point-wise processing
to achieve high performances. Although shared filter matrices and pooling layers in convolutional
neural networks (CNNs) are capable of reducing the dimensionality of the problem and extracting
high-level information simultaneously, grids and highly regular data format are required as input.
In order to balance model performance and complexity, we introduce a novel neural network architecture
exploiting local features from a manually subsampled point set. In our network, a recursive farthest
point sampling method is firstly applied to efficiently cover the entire point set. Successively,
we employ the k-nearest neighbours (knn) algorithm to gather local neighbourhood for each group
of the subsampled points. Finally, a multiple layer perceptron (MLP) is applied on the subsampled
points and edges that connect corresponding point and neighbours to extract local features. The
architecture has been tested for both shape classification and segmentation using the ModelNet40
and ShapeNet part datasets, in order to show that the network achieves the best trade-off in terms
of competitive performance when compared to other state-of-the-art algorithms.
