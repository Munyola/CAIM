The leisure and hospitality industry is one of the driving forces of the global economy. The widespread
adoption of new technologies in this industry over recent years has fundamentally reshaped the
way in which services are provided and received. However, there are still major challenges that
need to be addressed to ensure that this industry maintains a steady pace in adoption of future technologies.
In this paper, we identify these challenges and describe the problems they pose for guests and hospitality
service providers (HSP). As a means to overcome these challenges, we propose a novel fog-assisted
architecture which creates a sound technological framework with specialized guest-facing and
back-of-house (BoH) management systems geared towards improving guest experience, enhancing
business insight, and increasing revenue. The proposed architecture integrates cloud services
platform with Internet of things (IoT) devices at the edge of the network through intermediary fog
computing nodes to create an architectural paradigm with the benefits of both distributed computing
and centralized analytics. The layered structure of this architecture facilitates interoperability
between heterogeneous systems as well as resource sharing and cooperation between multiple deployments
and implementations. Moreover, the adaptability of this architecture promotes scalability making
it suitable for hotels of different caliber, and guarantees upgradability making it possible to
add new and improved hospitality services in the future.
