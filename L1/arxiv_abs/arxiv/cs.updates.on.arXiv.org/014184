We introduce Artifact-Based Rendering (ABR), a framework of tools, algorithms, and processes
that makes it possible to produce real, data-driven 3D scientific visualizations with a visual
language derived entirely from colors, lines, textures, and forms created using traditional physical
media or found in nature. A theory and process for ABR is presented to address three current needs:
(i) designing better visualizations by making it possible for non-programmers to rapidly design
and critique many alternative data-to-visual mappings; (ii) expanding the visual vocabulary
used in scientific visualizations to depict increasingly complex multivariate data; (iii) bringing
a more engaging, natural, and human-relatable handcrafted aesthetic to data visualization. New
tools and algorithms to support ABR include front-end applets for constructing artifact-based
colormaps, optimizing 3D scanned meshes for use in data visualization, and synthesizing textures
from artifacts. These are complemented by an interactive rendering engine with custom algorithms
and interfaces that demonstrate multiple new visual styles for depicting point, line, surface,
and volume data. A within-the-research-team design study provides early evidence of the shift
in visualization design processes that ABR is believed to enable when compared to traditional scientific
visualization systems. Qualitative user feedback on applications to climate science and brain
imaging support the utility of ABR for scientific discovery and public communication.
