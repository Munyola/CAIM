Traditional face alignment based on machine learning usually tracks the localizations of facial
landmarks employing a static model trained offline where all of the training data is available in
advance. When new training samples arrive, the static model must be retrained from scratch, which
is excessively time-consuming and memory-consuming. In many real-time applications, the training
data is obtained one by one or batch by batch. It results in that the static model limits its performance
on sequential images with extensive variations. Therefore, the most critical and challenging
aspect in this field is dynamically updating the tracker's models to enhance predictive and generalization
capabilities continuously. In order to address this question, we develop a fast and accurate online
learning algorithm for face alignment. Particularly, we incorporate on-line sequential extreme
learning machine into a parallel cascaded regression framework, coined incremental cascade regression(ICR).
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first incremental cascaded framework with the non-linear
regressor. One main advantage of ICR is that the tracker model can be fast updated in an incremental
way without the entire retraining process when a new input is incoming. Experimental results demonstrate
that the proposed ICR is more accurate and efficient on still or sequential images compared with
the recent state-of-the-art cascade approaches. Furthermore, the incremental learning proposed
in this paper can update the trained model in real time.
