It is well known that the P3P problem could have 1, 2, 3 and at most 4 positive solutions under different
configurations among its 3 control points and the position of the optical center. Since in any real
applications, the knowledge on the exact number of possible solutions is a prerequisite for selecting
the right one among all the possible solutions, the study on the phenomenon of multiple solutions
in the P3P problem has been an active topic . In this work, we provide some new geometric interpretations
on the multi-solution phenomenon in the P3P problem, our main results include: (1): The necessary
and sufficient condition for the P3P problem to have a pair of side-sharing solutions is the two optical
centers of the solutions both lie on one of the 3 vertical planes to the base plane of control points;
(2): The necessary and sufficient condition for the P3P problem to have a pair of point-sharing solutions
is the two optical centers of the solutions both lie on one of the 3 so-called skewed danger cylinders;(3):
If the P3P problem has other solutions in addition to a pair of side-sharing ( point-sharing) solutions,
these remaining solutions must be a point-sharing ( side-sharing ) pair. In a sense, the side-sharing
pair and the point-sharing pair are companion pairs. In sum, our results provide some new insights
into the nature of the multi-solution phenomenon in the P3P problem, in addition to their academic
value, they could also be used as some theoretical guidance for practitioners in real applications
to avoid occurrence of multiple solutions by properly arranging the control points.
