We study the problem of fair allocation of m indivisible items among n agents with additive valuations
using the popular notion of maximin share as our measure of fairness. The maximin share (MMS) of an
agent is the maximum she can guarantee herself if she is allowed to choose a partition of items into
n bundles (one for each agent), with the condition that all other agents get to choose a bundle before
her. An MMS allocation provides each agent a bundle worth at least her maximin share. While it is known
that such an allocation need not exist, a series of remarkable work provided 2/3 approximation algorithms
in which each agent receives a bundle worth at least 2/3 times her maximin share. Recently, in a groundbreaking
work, Ghodsi et al. showed the existence of 3/4 MMS allocation and a PTAS to find a 3/4-\epsilon MMS
allocation. Most of the previous work utilize intricate algorithms and require agents' approximate
MMS values, which are computationally expensive to obtain. We present a simple algorithm that obtains
a 3/4 MMS allocation and runs in \tilde{O}(n^5m) time. The idea is to start with a trivial upper bound
on the MMS values based on the average and greedily assign high-value items to agents. Then, try to
satisfy the remaining agents with remaining items using tentative assignment and bag-filling
procedures. If the MMS upper bounds are tight enough, then these procedures are guaranteed to succeed.
Otherwise, we update it for a certain agent and run the procedures again. We show that the bounds need
to be updated at most O(n^3) times.
