Internet video traffic has been been rapidly increasing and is further expected to increase with
the emerging 5G applications such as higher definition videos, IoT and augmented/virtual reality
applications. As end-users consume video in massive amounts and in an increasing number of ways,
the content distribution network (CDN) should be efficiently managed to improve the system efficiency.
The streaming service can include multiple caching tiers, at the distributed servers and the edge
routers, and efficient content management at these locations affect the quality of experience
(QoE) of the end users. In this paper, we propose a model for video streaming systems, typically composed
of a centralized origin server, several CDN sites, and edge-caches located closer to the end user.
We comprehensively consider different systems design factors including the limited caching space
at the CDN sites, allocation of CDN for a video request, choice of different ports (or paths) from
the CDN and the central storage, bandwidth allocation, the edge-cache capacity, and the caching
policy. We focus on minimizing a performance metric, stall duration tail probability (SDTP), and
present a novel and efficient algorithm accounting for the multiple design flexibilities. The
theoretical bounds with respect to the SDTP metric are also analyzed and presented. The implementation
on a virtualized cloud system managed by Openstack demonstrate that the proposed algorithms can
significantly improve the SDTP metric, compared to the baseline strategies.
