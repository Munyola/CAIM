Playing back vibrotactile signals through actuators is commonly used to simulate tactile feelings
of virtual textured surfaces. However, there is often a small mismatch between the simulated tactile
feelings and intended tactile feelings by tactile designers. Thus, a method of modulating the vibrotactile
perception is required. We focus on fine roughness perception and we propose a method using a pseudo-haptic
effect to modulate fine roughness perception of vibrotactile texture. Specifically, we visually
modify the pointer's position on the screen slightly, which indicates the touch position on textured
surfaces. We hypothesized that if users receive vibrational feedback watching the pointer visually
oscillating back/forth and left/right, users would believe the vibrotactile surfaces more uneven.
We also hypothesized that as the size of visual oscillation is getting larger, the amount of modification
of roughness perception of vibrotactile surfaces would be larger. We conducted user studies to
test the hypotheses. Results of first user study suggested that users felt vibrotactile texture
with our method rougher than they did without our method at a high probability.Results of second
user study suggested that users felt different roughness for vibrational texture in response to
the size of visual oscillation. These results confirmed our hypotheses and they suggested that
our method was effective. Also, the same effect could potentially be applied to the visual movement
of virtual hands or fingertips when users are interacting with virtual surfaces using their hands.
