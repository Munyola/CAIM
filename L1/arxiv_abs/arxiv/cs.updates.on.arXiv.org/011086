The study develops and tests a method that can gradually find a sweet spot between user experience
and visual intensity of website elements to maximise user conversion with minimal adverse effect.
In the first phase of the study, we develop the method. In the second stage, we test and evaluate the
method via an empirical study; also, an experiment was conducted within web interface with the gradual
intensity of visual elements.The findings reveal that negative response grows faster than conversion
when the visual intensity of the web interface is increased. However, a saturation point, where
there is coexistence between maximum conversion and minimum negative response, can be found. The
findings imply that efforts to attract user attention should be pursued with increased caution
and that a gradual approach presented in this study helps in finding a site-specific sweet-spot
for a level of visual intensity by incrementally adjusting the elements of the interface and tracking
the changes in user behaviour. Web marketing and advertising professionals often face the dilemma
of determining the optimal level of visual intensity of interface element. Excessive use of marketing
component and attention-grabbing visual elements can lead to an inferior user experience and consequent
user churn due to growing intrusiveness. At the same time, too little visual intensity can fail to
steer users. The present study provides a gradual approach which aids in finding a balance between
user experience and visual intensity, maximising user conversion and thus providing a practical
solution for the problem.
