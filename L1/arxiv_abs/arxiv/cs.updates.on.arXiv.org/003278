This paper is concerned with a compositional approach for constructing finite Markov decision
processes of interconnected discrete-time stochastic control systems. The proposed approach
leverages the interconnection topology and a notion of so-called stochastic storage functions
describing joint dissipativity-type properties of subsystems and their abstractions. In the
first part of the paper, we derive dissipativity-type compositional conditions for quantifying
the error between the interconnection of stochastic control subsystems and that of their abstractions.
In the second part of the paper, we propose an approach to construct finite Markov decision processes
together with their corresponding stochastic storage functions for classes of discrete-time
control systems satisfying some incremental passivablity property. Under this property, one
can construct finite Markov decision processes by a suitable discretization of the input and state
sets. Moreover, we show that for linear stochastic control systems, the aforementioned property
can be readily checked by some matrix inequality. We apply our proposed results to the temperature
regulation in a circular building by constructing compositionally a finite Markov decision process
of a network containing 200 rooms in which the compositionality condition does not require any constraint
on the number or gains of the subsystems. We employ the constructed finite Markov decision process
as a substitute to synthesize policies regulating the temperature in each room for a bounded time
horizon.
