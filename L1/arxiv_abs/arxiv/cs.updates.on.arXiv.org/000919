In the online setting, an algorithm receives a sequence of requests, and is expected to make an irrevocable
decision for each request based only on the observed history. We consider the following relaxation
of the online model: whereas in the traditional model, each request appears once and never returns,
we allow each request to return a specified number of times, and expect the algorithm to make a decision
only upon the last arrival. We mainly focus on the case where each request returns once. We examine
the secretary problem, a quintessential online problem: the problem of selecting the best secretary
when the secretaries are presented online according to a random permutation. We show that when each
secretary returns once, we can improve the competitive ratio from 1/e to 3/4, and also that no algorithm
can identify the best secretary with probability greater than 5/6. We further show that without
any knowledge about the number of secretaries or their arrival times, we can still hire the best secretary
with probability 2/3, in contrast to the impossibility of achieving a constant success probability
in the same setting of the classical secretary problem. We extend our results to the matroid secretary
problem, introduced by Babaioff et al. (2007), and show an algorithm that achieves a 2-approximation
to the maximal weighted basis in the returning online model. We show that this approximation factor
can be improved in special cases of the matroid secretary problem; in particular, we give a 16/9-competitive
algorithm for the returning edge-weighted bipartite matching problem.
