Complex social systems are composed of interconnected individuals whose interactions result
in group behaviors. Optimal control of a real-world complex system has many applications, including
road traffic management, epidemic prevention, and information dissemination. However, such
real-world complex system control is difficult to achieve because of high-dimensional and non-linear
system dynamics, and the exploding state and action spaces for the decision maker. Prior methods
can be divided into two categories: simulation-based and analytical approaches. Existing simulation
approaches have high-variance in Monte Carlo integration, and the analytical approaches suffer
from modeling inaccuracy. We adopted simulation modeling in specifying the complex dynamics of
a complex system, and developed analytical solutions for searching optimal strategies in a complex
network with high-dimensional state-action space. To capture the complex system dynamics, we
formulate the complex social network decision making problem as a discrete event decision process.
To address the curse of dimensionality and search in high-dimensional state action spaces in complex
systems, we reduce control of a complex system to variational inference and parameter learning,
introduce Bethe entropy approximation, and develop an expectation propagation algorithm. Our
proposed algorithm leads to higher system expected rewards, faster convergence, and lower variance
of value function in a real-world transportation scenario than state-of-the-art analytical and
sampling approaches.
