We propose a deep autoencoder with graph topology inference and filtering to achieve compact representations
of unorganized 3D point clouds in an unsupervised manner. The encoder of the proposed networks adopts
similar architectures as in PointNet, which is a well-acknowledged method for supervised learning
of 3D point clouds. The decoder of the proposed networks involves three novel modules: the folding
module, the graph-topology-inference module, and the graph-filtering module. The folding module
folds a canonical 2D lattice to the underlying surface of a 3D point cloud, achieving coarse reconstruction;
the graph-topology-inference module learns a graph topology to represent pairwise relationships
between 3D points; and the graph-filtering module designs graph filters based on the learnt graph
topology to obtain the refined reconstruction. We further provide theoretical analyses of the
proposed architecture. We provide an upper bound for the reconstruction loss and further show the
superiority of graph smoothness over spatial smoothness as a prior to model 3D point clouds. In the
experiments, we validate the proposed networks in three tasks, including reconstruction, visualization,
and classification. The experimental results show that (1) the proposed networks outperform the
state-of-the-art methods in various tasks, including reconstruction and transfer classification;
(2) a graph topology can be inferred as auxiliary information without specific supervision on graph
topology inference; and (3) graph filtering refines the reconstruction, leading to better performances.
