We propose a model of full propositional linear logic based on topological vector spaces. The essential
feature is that we consider partially ordered vector spaces, or, rather, positive cones in such
spaces. Thus we introduce a category whose objects are dual pairs of normed cones satisfying certain
specific completeness properties, such as existence of norm-bounded monotone suprema, and whose
morphisms are bounded (adjointable) positive maps. Norms allow us distinct interpretation of
dual additive connectives as product and coproduct; in this sense the model is nondegenerate. Also,
unlike the familiar case of probabilistic coherence spaces, there is no reference or need for preferred
basis; in this sense the model is invariant. Probabilistic coherence spaces form a full subcategory.
whose objects, seen as posets, are lattices. Thus we get a model fitting in the tradition of interpreting
linear logic in linear algebraic setting, which arguably is free from the drawbacks of its predecessors.
We choose the somewhat show-offy title "noncommutative coherence spaces", hinting of noncommutative
geometry, because the passage from probabilistic coherence spaces with their preferred bases
to general partially ordered cones seems analogous to the passage from commutative algebras of
functions on topological spaces to general, not necessarily commutative algebras. Also, natural
non-lattice examples of our spaces come from self-adjoint parts of noncommutative operator algebras.
Probabilistic coherence spaces then appear as a "commutative" subcategory.
