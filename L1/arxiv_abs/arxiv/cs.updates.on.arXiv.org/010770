In this paper, a novel varying order NURBS discretization method is proposed to enhance the performance
of isogeometric analysis within the framework of computational contact mechanics. The method
makes use of higher-order NURBS for contact integral evaluations. Lower-orders NURBS capable
of modelling complex geometries exactly are utilized for the bulk discretization. This unexplored
idea provides the possibility to refine the geometry through controllable order elevation strategy
for isogeometric analysis. To achieve this, a higher-order NURBS layer is used as the contact boundary
layer of the bodies. The NURBS layer is constructed using the surface refinement strategies such
that it is accompanied by a large number of additional degrees of freedom and matches with the bulk
parametrization. The validity of the presented isogeometric mortar contact formulation with
varying-order NURBS discretization is first examined through the contact patch test. The capabilities
and benefits of the proposed methodology are then demonstrated in detail using two-dimensional
frictionless and frictional contact problems, considering both small and large deformations.
It is shown that using the proposed method, accurate solutions can be achieved even with a coarse
mesh. It is also shown that the current method requires a considerably lower computational cost
compared to standard NURBS discretization while retaining robustness and stability. The simplicity
of the method lends itself to be conveniently embedded in an existing isogeometric contact code
after only a few minor modifications.
