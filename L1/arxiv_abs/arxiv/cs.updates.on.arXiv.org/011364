Label propagation aims to iteratively diffuse the label information from labeled examples to unlabeled
examples over a similarity graph. Current label propagation algorithms cannot consistently yield
satisfactory performance due to two reasons: one is the instability of single propagation method
in dealing with various practical data, and the other one is the improper propagation sequence ignoring
the labeling difficulties of different examples. To remedy above defects, this paper proposes
a novel propagation algorithm called hybrid diffusion under ensemble teaching (HyDEnT). Specifically,
HyDEnT integrates multiple propagation methods as base learners to fully exploit their individual
wisdom, which helps HyDEnT to be stable and obtain consistent encouraging results. More importantly,
HyDEnT conducts propagation under the guidance of an ensemble of teachers. That is to say, in every
propagation round the simplest curriculum examples are wisely designated by a teaching algorithm,
so that their labels can be reliably and accurately decided by the learners. To optimally choose
these simplest examples, every teacher in the ensemble should comprehensively consider the examples'
difficulties from its own viewpoint, as well as the common knowledge shared by all the teachers.
This is accomplished by a designed optimization problem, which can be efficiently solved via the
block coordinate descent method. Thanks to the efforts of the teachers, all the unlabeled examples
are logically propagated from simple to difficult, leading to better propagation quality of HyDEnT
than the existing methods.
