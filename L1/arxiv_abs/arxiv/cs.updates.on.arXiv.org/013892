This paper presents approaches to determine a network based pricing for 3D printing services in
the context of a two-sided manufacturing-as-a-service marketplace. The intent is to provide cost
analytics to enable service bureaus to better compete in the market by moving away from setting ad-hoc
and subjective prices. A data mining approach with machine learning methods is used to estimate
a price range based on the profile characteristics of 3D printing service suppliers. The model considers
factors such as supplier experience, supplier capabilities, customer reviews and ratings from
past orders, and scale of operations among others to estimate a price range for suppliers' services.
Data was gathered from existing marketplace websites, which was then used to train and test the model.
The model demonstrates an accuracy of 65% for US based suppliers and 59% for Europe based suppliers
to classify a supplier's 3D Printer listing in one of the seven price categories. The improvement
over baseline accuracy of 25% demonstrates that machine learning based methods are promising for
network based pricing in manufacturing marketplaces. Conventional methodologies for pricing
services through activity based costing are inefficient in strategically pricing 3D printing
service offering in a connected marketplace. As opposed to arbitrarily determining prices, this
work proposes an approach to determine prices through data mining methods to estimate competitive
prices. Such tools can be built into online marketplaces to help independent service bureaus to
determine service price rates.
