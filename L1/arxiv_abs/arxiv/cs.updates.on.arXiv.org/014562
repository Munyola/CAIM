Microsoft's internal big data analytics platform is comprised of hundreds of thousands of machines,
serving over half a million jobs daily, from thousands of users. The majority of these jobs are recurring
and are crucial for the company's operation. Although administrators spend significant effort
tuning system performance, some jobs inevitably experience slowdowns, i.e., their execution
time degrades over previous runs. Currently, the investigation of such slowdowns is a labor-intensive
and error-prone process, which costs Microsoft significant human and machine resources, and negatively
impacts several lines of businesses. In this work, we present Griffin, a system we built and have
deployed in production last year to automatically discover the root cause of job slowdowns. Existing
solutions either rely on labeled data (i.e., resolved incidents with labeled reasons for job slowdowns),
which is in most cases non-existent or non-trivial to acquire, or on time-series analysis of individual
metrics that do not target specific jobs holistically. In contrast, in Griffin we cast the problem
to a corresponding regression one that predicts the runtime of a job, and show how the relative contributions
of the features used to train our interpretable model can be exploited to rank the potential causes
of job slowdowns. Evaluated over historical incidents, we show that Griffin discovers slowdown
causes that are consistent with the ones validated by domain-expert engineers, in a fraction of
the time required by them.
