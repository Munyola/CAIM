Pedestrian behavior has much more complicated characteristics in a dense crowd and thus attracts
the widespread interest of scientists and engineers. However, even successful modeling approaches
such as pedestrian models based on particle systems are still not fully considered the perceptive
mechanism underlying collective pedestrian behavior. This paper extends a behavioral heuristics
based pedestrian model to an adaptive agent-based model, which explicitly considers the crowding
effect of neighboring individuals and perception anisotropy on the representation of a pedestrian
visual information. The adaptive agents with crowding perception are constructed to investigate
complex, self organized collective dynamics of pedestrian motion for bidirectional and unidirectional
flows. Simulation results show that the emergence of lane formation in pedestrian counter flow
can be well reproduced. To investigate this further, increasing view distance has a significant
effect on reducing the number of lanes, increasing lane width, and stabilizing the self organized
lanes. The paper also discusses phase transitions of fundamental diagrams of pedestrian crowds
with unidirectional flow. It is found that the heterogeneity of crowding perception in the population
has a remarkable impact on the flow quality, which results in the buildup of congestion and rapidly
decreases the efficiency of pedestrian flows. It also indicates that the concept of heterogeneity
may be used to explain the instability of phase transitions.
