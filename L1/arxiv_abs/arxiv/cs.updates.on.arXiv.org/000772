In contrast to today's IP-based host-oriented Internet architecture, Content-Centric Networking
(CCN) emphasizes content by making it directly addressable and routable. Named Data Networking
(NDN) is an instance of CCN designed as a candidate next-generation Internet architecture. By opportunistically
caching content within the network (in routers), NDN appears to be well-suited for large-scale
content distribution and for meeting the needs of increasingly mobile and bandwidth-hungry applications
that dominate today's Internet. One key feature of NDN is the requirement for each content object
to be digitally signed by its producer. Thus, NDN should be, in principle, immune to distributing
fake (aka "poisoned") content. However, in practice, this poses two challenges for detecting fake
content in NDN routers: (1) overhead due to signature verification and certificate chain traversal,
and (2) lack of trust context, i.e., what public key(s) is/are trusted to verify which content. Due
to these issues, NDN currently does not force routers to verify content signatures, which makes
the architecture susceptible to content poisoning attacks. This paper explores root causes of,
and some cures for, content poisoning attacks in NDN. In the process, it becomes apparent that meaningful
mitigation of content poisoning is contingent upon a trust management architecture, elements
of which we construct while carefully justifying specific design choices. This work represents
the initial effort towards comprehensive trust management for NDN.
