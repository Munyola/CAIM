Local Differential Privacy (LDP) is popularly used in practice for privacy-preserving data collection.
Although existing LDP protocols offer high data utility for large user populations (100,000 or
more users), they perform poorly in scenarios with small user populations (such as those in the cybersecurity
domain) and lack perturbation mechanisms that are effective for both ordinal and non-ordinal item
sequences while protecting sequence length and content simultaneously. In this paper, we address
the small user population problem by introducing the concept of Condensed Local Differential Privacy
(CLDP) as a specialization of LDP, and develop a suite of CLDP protocols that offer desirable statistical
utility while preserving privacy. Our protocols support different types of client data, ranging
from ordinal data types in finite metric spaces (numeric malware infection statistics), to non-ordinal
items (OS versions, transaction categories), and to sequences of ordinal and non-ordinal items.
Extensive experiments are conducted on multiple datasets, including datasets that are an order
of magnitude smaller than those used in existing approaches, which show that proposed CLDP protocols
yield higher utility compared to existing LDP protocols. Furthermore, case studies with Symantec
datasets demonstrate that our protocols outperform existing protocols in key cybersecurity-focused
tasks of detecting ransomware outbreaks, identifying targeted and vulnerable OSs, and inspecting
suspicious activities on infected machines.
