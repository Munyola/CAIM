Symbolic analysis of security exploits in smart contracts has demonstrated to be valuable for analyzing
predefined vulnerability properties. While some symbolic tools perform complex analysis steps
(which require predetermined invocation depth to search the execution paths), they employ fixed
definitions of these vulnerabilities. However, vulnerabilities evolve. The number of contracts
on blockchains like Ethereum has increased 176 fold since December 2015. If these symbolic tools
fail to update over time, they could allow entire classes of vulnerabilities to go undetected, leading
to unintended consequences. In this paper, we aim to have smart contracts that are less vulnerable
to a broad class of emerging threats. In particular, we propose a novel approach of sequential learning
of smart contract vulnerabilities using machine learning --- long-short term memory (LSTM) ---
that perpetually learns from an increasing number of contracts handled over time, leading to safer
smart contracts. Our experimental studies on approximately one million smart contracts for learning
revealed encouraging results. A detection accuracy of 97% on contract vulnerabilities has been
observed. In addition, our machine learning approach also correctly detected 76% of contract vulnerabilities
that would otherwise be deemed as false positive errors by a symbolic tool. Last but not least, the
proposed approach correctly identified a broader class of vulnerabilities when considering a
subset of 10,000 contracts that are sampled from unflagged contracts.
