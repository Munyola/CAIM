In modern taxi networks, large amounts of taxi occupancy status and location data are collected
from networked in-vehicle sensors in real-time. They provide knowledge of system models on passenger
demand and mobility patterns for efficient taxi dispatch and coordination strategies. Such approaches
face new challenges: how to deal with uncertainties of predicted customer demand while fulfilling
the system's performance requirements, including minimizing taxis' total idle mileage and maintaining
service fairness across the whole city; how to formulate a computationally tractable problem.
To address this problem, we develop a data-driven robust taxi dispatch framework to consider spatial-temporally
correlated demand uncertainties. The robust vehicle dispatch problem we formulate is concave
in the uncertain demand and convex in the decision variables. Uncertainty sets of random demand
vectors are constructed from data based on theories in hypothesis testing, and provide a desired
probabilistic guarantee level for the performance of robust taxi dispatch solutions. We prove
equivalent computationally tractable forms of the robust dispatch problem using the minimax theorem
and strong duality. Evaluations on four years of taxi trip data for New York City show that by selecting
a probabilistic guarantee level at 75%, the average demand-supply ratio error is reduced by 31.7%,
and the average total idle driving distance is reduced by 10.13% or about 20 million miles annually,
compared with non-robust dispatch solutions.
