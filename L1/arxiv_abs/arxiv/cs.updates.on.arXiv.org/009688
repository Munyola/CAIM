Underwater image enhancement is an important low-level vision task with many applications, and
numerous algorithms have been proposed in recent years. Despite the demonstrated success, these
results are often generated based on different assumptions using different datasets and metrics.
In this paper, we propose a large-scale Realistic Underwater Image Enhancement (RUIE) dataset,
in which all degraded images are divided into multiple sub-datasets according to natural underwater
image quality evaluation metric and the degree of color deviation. Compared with exiting testing
or training sets of realistic underwater scenes, the RUIE dataset contains three sub-datasets,
which are specifically selected and classified for the experiment of non-reference image quality
evaluation, color deviation and task-driven detection. Based on RUIE, we conduct extensive and
systematic experiments to evaluate the effectiveness and limitations of various algorithms,
on images with hierarchical classification of degradation. Our evaluation and analysis demonstrate
the performance and limitations of state-of-the-art algorithms. The findings from these experiments
not only confirm what is commonly believed, but also suggest new research directions. More importantly,
we recognize that underwater image enhancement in practice usually serves as the preprocessing
step for mid-level and high-level vision tasks. We thus propose to exploit the object detection
performance on the enhanced images as a brand-new `task-specific' evaluation criterion for underwater
image enhancement algorithms.
