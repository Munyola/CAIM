Most of the current game-theoretic demand-side management methods focus primarily on the scheduling
of home appliances, and the related numerical experiments are analyzed under various scenarios
to achieve the corresponding Nash-equilibrium (NE) and optimal results. However, not much work
is conducted for academic or commercial buildings. The methods for optimizing academic-buildings
are distinct from the optimal methods for home appliances. In my study, we address a novel methodology
to control the operation of heating, ventilation, and air conditioning system (HVAC). With the
development of Artificial Intelligence and computer technologies, reinforcement learning (RL)
can be implemented in multiple realistic scenarios and help people to solve thousands of real-world
problems. Reinforcement Learning, which is considered as the art of future AI, builds the bridge
between agents and environments through Markov Decision Chain or Neural Network and has seldom
been used in power system. The art of RL is that once the simulator for a specific environment is built,
the algorithm can keep learning from the environment. Therefore, RL is capable of dealing with constantly
changing simulator inputs such as power demand, the condition of power system and outdoor temperature,
etc. Compared with the existing distribution power system planning mechanisms and the related
game theoretical methodologies, our proposed algorithm can plan and optimize the hourly energy
usage, and have the ability to corporate with even shorter time window if needed.
