Quantitative extensions of parity games have recently attracted significant interest. These
extensions include parity games with energy and payoff conditions as well as finitary parity games
and their generalization to parity games with costs. Finitary parity games enjoy a special status
among these extensions, as they offer a native combination of the qualitative and quantitative
aspects in infinite games: The quantitative aspect of finitary parity games is a quality measure
for the qualitative aspect, as it measures the limit superior of the time it takes to answer an odd
color by a larger even one. Finitary parity games have been extended to parity games with costs, where
each transition is labeled with a nonnegative weight that reflects the costs incurred by taking
it. We lift this restriction and consider parity games with costs with arbitrary integer weights.
We show that solving such games is in NP $\cap$ coNP, the signature complexity for games of this type.
We also show that the protagonist has finite-state winning strategies, and provide tight pseudo-polynomial
bounds for the memory he needs to win the game. Naturally, the antagonist may need infinite memory
to win. Moreover, we present tight bounds on the quality of winning strategies for the protagonist.
Furthermore, we investigate the problem of determining, for a given threshold $b$, whether the
protagonist has a strategy of quality at most $b$ and show this problem to be EXPTIME-complete. The
protagonist inherits the necessity of exponential memory for implementing such strategies from
the special case of finitary parity games.
