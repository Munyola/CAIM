It is well-known that the problem to solve equations in virtually free groups can be reduced to the
problem to solve twisted word equations with regular constraints over free monoids with involution.
In a first part of the paper we prove that the set of all solutions of such a twisted word equation is
an EDT0L language and that the specification of that EDT0L language can be computed in PSPACE. (We
give a more precise bound in the paper.) Within the same complexity bound we can decide whether the
solution set is empty, finite, or infinite. No PSPACE-algorithm, actually no concrete complexity
bound was known for deciding emptiness before. Decidability of finiteness was considered to be
an open problem. In the second part we apply the results to the solution set of equations with rational
constraints in finitely generated virtually free groups. For each such group we obtain the same
results as above for the set of solutions in standard normal forms with respect to some natural set
of generators. In particular, for a fixed group we can decide in PSPACE whether the solution set is
empty, finite, or infinite. Our results generalize the work by Lohrey and S\'enizergues (ICALP
2006) and Dahmani and Guirardel (J. of Topology 2010) with respect to both complexity and expressive
power. Neither paper gave any concrete complexity bound and the results in these papers are stated
subsets of solutions only, whereas our results concern all solutions. Moreover, we give a formal
language characterization of the full solution set as an EDT0L language.
