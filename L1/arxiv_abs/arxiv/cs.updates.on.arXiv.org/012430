The control of complex systems is of critical importance in many branches of science, engineering,
and industry. Controlling an unsteady fluid flow is particularly important, as flow control is
a key enabler for technologies in energy (e.g., wind, tidal, and combustion), transportation (e.g.,
planes, trains, and automobiles), security (e.g., tracking airborne contamination), and health
(e.g., artificial hearts and artificial respiration). However, the high-dimensional, nonlinear,
and multi-scale dynamics make real-time feedback control infeasible. Fortunately, these high-dimensional
systems exhibit dominant, low-dimensional patterns of activity that can be exploited for effective
control in the sense that knowledge of the entire state of a system is not required. Advances in machine
learning have the potential to revolutionize flow control given its ability to extract principled,
low-rank feature spaces characterizing such complex systems. We present a novel deep learning
model predictive control (DeepMPC) framework that exploits low-rank features of the flow in order
to achieve considerable improvements to control performance. Instead of predicting the entire
fluid state, we use a recurrent neural network (RNN) to accurately predict the control relevant
quantities of the system. The RNN is then embedded into a MPC framework to construct a feedback loop,
and incoming sensor data is used to perform online updates to improve prediction accuracy. The results
are validated using varying fluid flow examples of increasing complexity.
