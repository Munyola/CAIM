Developing classification algorithms that are fair with respect to sensitive attributes of the
data has become an important problem due to the growing deployment of classification algorithms
in various social contexts. Several recent works have focused on fairness with respect to a specific
metric, modeled the corresponding fair classification problem as a constrained optimization
problem, and developed tailored algorithms to solve them. Despite this, there still remain important
metrics for which we do not have fair classifiers and many of the aforementioned algorithms do not
come with theoretical guarantees; perhaps because the resulting optimization problem is non-convex.
The main contribution of this paper is a new meta-algorithm for classification that takes as input
a large class of fairness constraints, with respect to multiple non-disjoint sensitive attributes,
and which comes with provable guarantees. This is achieved by first developing a meta-algorithm
for a large family of classification problems with convex constraints, and then showing that classification
problems with general types of fairness constraints can be reduced to those in this family. We present
empirical results that show that our algorithm can achieve near-perfect fairness with respect
to various fairness metrics, and that the loss in accuracy due to the imposed fairness constraints
is often small. Overall, this work unifies several prior works on fair classification, presents
a practical algorithm with theoretical guarantees, and can handle fairness metrics that were previously
not possible.
