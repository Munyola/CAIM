Over the past years, literature has shown that attacks exploiting the microarchitecture of modern
processors pose a serious threat to the privacy of mobile phone users. This is because applications
leave distinct footprints in the processor, which can be used by malware to infer user activities.
In this work, we show that these inference attacks are considerably more practical when combined
with advanced AI techniques. In particular, we focus on profiling the activity in the last-level
cache (LLC) of ARM processors. We employ a simple Prime+Probe based monitoring technique to obtain
cache traces, which we classify with Deep Learning methods including Convolutional Neural Networks.
We demonstrate our approach on an off-the-shelf Android phone by launching a successful attack
from an unprivileged, zeropermission App in well under a minute. The App thereby detects running
applications with an accuracy of 98% and reveals opened websites and streaming videos by monitoring
the LLC for at most 6 seconds. This is possible, since Deep Learning compensates measurement disturbances
stemming from the inherently noisy LLC monitoring and unfavorable cache characteristics such
as random line replacement policies. In summary, our results show that thanks to advanced AI techniques,
inference attacks are becoming alarmingly easy to implement and execute in practice. This once
more calls for countermeasures that confine microarchitectural leakage and protect mobile phone
applications, especially those valuing the privacy of their users.
