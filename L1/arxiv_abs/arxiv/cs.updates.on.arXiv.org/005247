As a generalization of the use of graphs to describe pairwise interactions, simplicial complexes
can be used to model higher-order interactions between three or more objects in complex systems.
There has been a recent surge in activity for the development of data analysis methods applicable
to simplicial complexes, including techniques based on computational topology, higher-order
random processes, generalized Cheeger inequalities, isoperimetric inequalities, and spectral
methods. In particular, spectral learning methods (e.g. label propagation and clustering) that
directly operate on simplicial complexes represent a new direction emerging from the confluence
of computational topology and machine learning. To apply spectral methods in learning to massive
datasets modeled as simplicial complexes, we sparsify simplicial complexes, while preserving
the spectrum of the associated Laplacian operators. We show that the theory of Spielman and Srivastava
for the sparsification of graphs extends to simplicial complexes via the up Laplacian. In particular,
we introduce a generalized effective resistance for simplexes, provide an algorithm for sparsifying
simplicial complexes at a fixed dimension, and give a specific version of the generalized Cheeger
inequality for weighted simplicial complexes. Finally, we introduce higher-order generalizations
of spectral clustering and label propagation for simplicial complexes and demonstrate via experiments
the utility of the proposed spectral sparsification method for these applications.
