Relative efficiency (RE), the Pitman asymptotic relative efficiency (ARE) and efficacy are important
relative performance measures of signal detection techniques. These measures allow comparing
two detectors in terms of the relative sample sizes they require to achieve the same prescribed level
of false alarm and detection probabilities. While the finite-sample-size measure RE is useful
to analyze the small sample behavior of detectors, in practice it is difficult to compute. In the
limit as the signal strength approaches zero at an appropriate rate, the RE converges to an asymptotic
limit only for very large sample sizes. This limiting ratio of the number of samples is the ARE, which
lends analytical tractability, but does not provide insights into the finite sample behavior of
detectors which is important for practical applications. This led researchers to study the convergence
of RE to ARE, and has been well-reported for the problem of constant signal detection in additive,
independent, and identically distributed noise. When the signal to be detected is random ({\ie},
unknown), such a convergence analysis is lacking in the literature and is the focus of this paper.
A relationship between RE and ARE for random signal detection is established. We use the higher-order
terms in the Taylor series expansion of the mean of the test statistic under the alternative hypothesis
to derive this formula. We present preliminary remarks on the convergence of RE to ARE for random
signals in comparison to that for constant signal detection.
