Compared to rigid actuators, Series Elastic Actuators (SEAs) offer a potential reduction of motor
energy consumption and peak power, though these benefits are highly dependent on the design of the
torque-elongation profile of the elastic element. In the case of linear springs, natural dynamics
is a traditional method for this design, but it has two major limitations: arbitrary load trajectories
are difficult or impossible to analyze and it does not consider actuator constraints. Parametric
optimization is also a popular design method that addresses these limitations, but solutions are
only optimal within the space of the parameters. To overcome these limitations, we propose a non-parametric
convex optimization program for the design of the nonlinear elastic element that minimizes energy
consumption and peak power for an arbitrary periodic reference trajectory. To obtain convexity,
we introduce a convex approximation to the expression of peak power; energy consumption is shown
to be convex without approximation. The combination of peak power and energy consumption in the
cost function leads to a multiobjective convex optimization framework that comprises the main
contribution of this paper. As a case study, we recover the elongation-torque profile of a cubic
spring, given its natural oscillation as the reference load. We then design nonlinear SEAs for an
ankle prosthesis that minimize energy consumption and peak power for different trajectories and
extend the range of achievable tasks when subject to actuator constraints.
