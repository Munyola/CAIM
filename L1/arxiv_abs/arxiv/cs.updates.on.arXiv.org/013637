The practical NAND flash memory suffers from various non-stationary noises that are difficult
to be predicted. Furthermore, the data retention noise induced channel offset is unknown during
the readback process. This severely affects the data recovery from the memory cell. In this paper,
we first propose a novel recurrent neural network (RNN)-based detector to effectively detect the
data symbols stored in the multi-level-cell (MLC) flash memory without any prior knowledge of the
channel. However, compared with the conventional threshold detector, the proposed RNN detector
introduces much longer read latency and more power consumption. To tackle this problem, we further
propose an RNN-aided (RNNA) dynamic threshold detector, whose detection thresholds can be derived
based on the outputs of the RNN detector. We thus only need to activate the RNN detector periodically
when the system is idle. Moreover, to enable soft-decision decoding of error-correction codes,
we first show how to obtain more read thresholds based on the hard-decision read thresholds derived
from the RNN detector. We then propose integer-based reliability mappings based on the designed
read thresholds, which can generate the soft information of the channel. Finally, we propose to
apply density evolution (DE) combined with differential evolution algorithm to optimize the read
thresholds for LDPC coded flash memory channels. Computer simulation results demonstrate the
effectiveness of our RNNA dynamic read thresholds design, for both the uncoded and LDPC-coded flash
memory channels, without any prior knowledge of the channel.
