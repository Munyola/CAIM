This work presents algorithms for the efficient implementation of discontinuous Galerkin methods
with explicit time stepping for acoustic wave propagation on unstructured meshes of quadrilaterals
or hexahedra. A crucial step towards efficiency is to evaluate operators in a matrix-free way with
sum-factorization kernels. The method allows for general curved geometries and variable coefficients.
Temporal discretization is carried out by low-storage explicit Runge-Kutta schemes and the arbitrary
derivative (ADER) method. For ADER, we propose a flexible basis change approach that combines cheap
face integrals with cell evaluation using collocated nodes and quadrature points. Additionally,
a degree reduction for the optimized cell evaluation is presented to decrease the computational
cost when evaluating higher order spatial derivatives as required in ADER time stepping. We analyze
and compare the performance of state-of-the-art Runge-Kutta schemes and ADER time stepping with
the proposed optimizations. ADER involves fewer operations and additionally reaches higher throughput
by higher arithmetic intensities and hence decreases the required computational time significantly.
Comparison of Runge-Kutta and ADER at their respective CFL stability limit renders ADER especially
beneficial for higher orders when the Butcher barrier implies an overproportional amount of stages.
Moreover, vector updates in explicit Runge--Kutta schemes are shown to take a substantial amount
of the computational time due to their memory intensity.
