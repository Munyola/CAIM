Since Internet is so popular and prevailing in human life, countering cyber threats, especially
attack detection, is a challenging area of research in the field of cyber security. Intrusion detection
systems (IDSs) are essential entities in a network topology aiming to safeguard the integrity and
availability of sensitive assets in the protected systems. Although many supervised and unsupervised
learning approaches from the field of machine learning and pattern recognition have been used to
increase the efficacy of IDSs, it is still a problem to deal with lots of redundant and irrelevant
features in high-dimension datasets for network anomaly detection. To this end, we propose a novel
methodology combining the benefits of correlation-based feature selection(CFS) and bat algorithm(BA)
with an ensemble classifier based on C4.5, Random Forest(RF), and Forest by Penalizing Attributes(Forest
PA), which can be able to classify both common and rare types of attacks with high accuracy and efficiency.
The experimental results, using a novel intrusion detection dataset, namely CIC-IDS2017, reveal
that our CFS-BA-Ensemble method is able to contribute more critical features and significantly
outperforms individual approaches, achieving high accuracy and low false alarm rate. Moreover,
compared with the majority of the existing state-of-the-art and legacy techniques, our approach
exhibits better performance under several classification metrics in the context of classification
accuracy, f-measure, attack detection rate, and false alarm rate.
