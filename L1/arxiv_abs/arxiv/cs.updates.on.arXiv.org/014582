Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is one of the best medical imaging modalities as it offers excellent
spatial resolution and soft-tissue contrast. But, the usage of MRI is limited by its slow acquisition
time, which makes it expensive and causes patient discomfort. In order to accelerate the acquisition,
multiple deep learning networks have been proposed. Recently, Generative Adversarial Networks
(GANs) have shown promising results in MRI reconstruction. The drawback with the proposed GAN based
methods is it does not incorporate the prior information about the end goal which could help in better
reconstruction. For instance, in the case of cardiac MRI, the physician would be interested in the
heart region which is of diagnostic relevance while excluding the peripheral regions. In this work,
we show that incorporating prior information about a region of interest in the model would offer
better performance. Thereby, we propose a novel GAN based architecture, Reconstruction Global-Local
GAN (Recon-GLGAN) for MRI reconstruction. The proposed model contains a generator and a context
discriminator which incorporates global and local contextual information from images. Our model
offers significant performance improvement over the baseline models. Our experiments show that
the concept of a context discriminator can be extended to existing GAN based reconstruction models
to offer better performance. We also demonstrate that the reconstructions from the proposed method
give segmentation results similar to fully sampled images.
