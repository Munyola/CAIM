Effective and real-time eyeblink detection is of wide-range applications, such as deception detection,
drive fatigue detection, face anti-spoofing, etc. Although numerous of efforts have already been
paid, most of them focus on addressing the eyeblink detection problem under the constrained indoor
conditions with the relative consistent subject and environment setup. Nevertheless, towards
the practical applications eyeblink detection in the wild is more required, and of greater challenges.
However, to our knowledge this has not been well studied before. In this paper, we shed the light to
this research topic. A labelled eyeblink in the wild dataset (i.e., HUST-LEBW) of 673 eyeblink video
samples (i.e., 381 positives, and 292 negatives) is first established by us. These samples are captured
from the unconstrained movies, with the dramatic variation on human attribute, human pose, illumination
condition, imaging configuration, etc. Then, we formulate eyeblink detection task as a spatial-temporal
pattern recognition problem. After locating and tracking human eye using SeetaFace engine and
KCF tracker respectively, a modified LSTM model able to capture the multi-scale temporal information
is proposed to execute eyeblink verification. A feature extraction approach that reveals appearance
and motion characteristics simultaneously is also proposed. The experiments on HUST-LEBW reveal
the superiority and efficiency of our approach. It also verifies that, the existing eyeblink detection
methods cannot achieve satisfactory performance in the wild.
