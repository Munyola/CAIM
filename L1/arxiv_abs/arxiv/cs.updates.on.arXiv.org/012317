The creation of social ties is largely determined by the entangled effects of people's similarities
in terms of individual characters and friends. However, feature and structural characters of people
usually appear to be correlated, making it difficult to determine which has greater responsibility
in the formation of the emergent network structure. We propose \emph{AN2VEC}, a node embedding
method which ultimately aims at disentangling the information shared by the structure of a network
and the features of its nodes. Building on the recent developments of Graph Convolutional Networks
(GCN), we develop a multitask GCN Variational Autoencoder where different dimensions of the generated
embeddings can be dedicated to encoding feature information, network structure, and shared feature-network
information. We explore the interaction between these disentangled characters by comparing the
embedding reconstruction performance to a baseline case where no shared information is extracted.
We use synthetic datasets with different levels of interdependency between feature and network
characters and show (i) that shallow embeddings relying on shared information perform better than
the corresponding reference with unshared information, (ii) that this performance gap increases
with the correlation between network and feature structure, and (iii) that our embedding is able
to capture joint information of structure and features. Our method can be relevant for the analysis
and prediction of any featured network structure ranging from online social systems to network
medicine.
