Information coding by precise timing of spikes can be faster and more energy-efficient than traditional
rate coding. However, spike-timing codes are often brittle, which has limited their use in theoretical
neuroscience and computing applications. Here, we propose a novel type of attractor neural network
in complex state space, and show how it can be leveraged to construct spiking neural networks with
robust computational properties through a phase-to-timing mapping. Building on Hebbian neural
associative memories, like Hopfield networks, we first propose threshold phasor associative
memory (TPAM) networks. Complex phasor patterns whose components can assume continuous-valued
phase angles and binary magnitudes can be stored and retrieved as stable fixed points in the network
dynamics. TPAM achieves high memory capacity when storing sparse phasor patterns, and we derive
the energy function that governs its fixed point attractor dynamics. Second, through simulation
experiments we show how the complex algebraic computations in TPAM can be approximated by a biologically
plausible network of integrate-and-fire neurons with synaptic delays and recurrently connected
inhibitory interneurons. The fixed points of TPAM in the complex domain are commensurate with stable
periodic states of precisely timed spiking activity that are robust to perturbation. The link established
between rhythmic firing patterns and complex attractor dynamics has implications for the interpretation
of spike patterns seen in neuroscience, and can serve as a framework for computation in emerging
neuromorphic devices.
