Two line-based fracture detection scheme are developed and discussed, namely Standard line-based
fracture detection and Adaptive Differential Parameter Optimized (ADPO) line-based fracture
detection. The purpose for the two line-based fracture detection schemes is to detect fractured
lines from X-ray images using extracted features based on recognised patterns to differentiate
fractured lines from non-fractured lines. The difference between the two schemes is the detection
of detailed lines. The ADPO scheme optimizes the parameters of the Probabilistic Hough Transform,
such that granule lines within the fractured regions are detected, whereas the Standard scheme
is unable to detect them. The lines are detected using the Probabilistic Hough Function, in which
the detected lines are a representation of the image edge objects. The lines are given in the form
of points, (x,y), which includes the starting and ending point. Based on the given line points, 13
features are extracted from each line, as a summary of line information. These features are used
for fracture and non-fracture classification of the detected lines. The classification is carried
out by the Artificial Neural Network (ANN). There are two evaluations that are employed to evaluate
both the entirety of the system and the ANN. The Standard Scheme is capable of achieving an average
accuracy of 74.25%, whilst the ADPO scheme achieved an average accuracy of 74.4%. The ADPO scheme
is opted for over the Standard scheme, however it can be further improved with detected contours
and its extracted features.
