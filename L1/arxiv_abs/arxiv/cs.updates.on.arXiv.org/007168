We prove that the Weihrauch lattice can be transformed into a Brouwer algebra by the consecutive
application of two closure operators in the appropriate order: first completion and then parallelization.
The closure operator of completion is a new closure operator that we introduce. It transforms any
problem into a total problem on the completion of the respective types, where we allow any value outside
of the original domain of the problem. This closure operator is of interest by itself, as it generates
a total version of Weihrauch reducibility that is defined like the usual version of Weihrauch reducibility,
but in terms of total realizers. From a logical perspective completion can be seen as a way to make
problems independent of their premises. Alongside with the completion operator and total Weihrauch
reducibility we need to study precomplete representations that are required to describe these
concepts. In order to show that the parallelized total Weihrauch lattice forms a Brouwer algebra,
we introduce a new multiplicative version of an implication. While the parallelized total Weihrauch
lattice forms a Brouwer algebra with this implication, the total Weihrauch lattice fails to be a
model of intuitionistic linear logic in two different ways. In order to pinpoint the algebraic reasons
for this failure, we introduce the concept of a Weihrauch algebra that allows us to formulate the
failure in precise and neat terms. Finally, we show that the Medvedev Brouwer algebra can be embedded
into our Brouwer algebra, which also implies that the theory of our Brouwer algebra is Jankov logic.
