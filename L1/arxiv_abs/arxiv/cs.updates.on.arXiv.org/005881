Centrality is a fundamental building block in network analysis. Existing centrality measures
focus on the network topology without considering nodal characteristics. However, this ignorance
is perilous if the cascade payoff does not grow monotonically with the size of the cascade. In this
paper, we propose a new centrality measure, Cascade Centrality, which integrates network position,
the diffusion process, and nodal characteristics. It nests and spans the gap between degree, eigenvector,
Katz, and diffusion centrality. Interestingly, when $p\lambda_1 > 1$, eigenvector, Katz and diffusion
centrality all collapse to Cascade Centrality with a scaling factor determined by the distribution
of eigenvector and the nodal influence vector. Furthermore, the presence of homophily in social
networks enables the de-noising of real-world observations. Therefore, we propose a unified framework
to simultaneously learn the actual nodal influence vector and network structure with an iterative
learning algorithm. Experiments on synthetic and real data show that Cascade Centrality outperforms
existing centrality measures in generating cascade payoffs. Moreover, with the proposed algorithm,
the de-noised centrality measure is more correlated with the actual Cascade Centrality than merely
computing from the observations. Cascade Centrality can capture more complex behaviors and processes
in the network and has significant implications for theoretical studies in influence maximization
and practical applications in viral marketing and political campaign.
