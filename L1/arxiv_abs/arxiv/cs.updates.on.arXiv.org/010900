Developing a robust algorithm for automatic individual tree crown (ITC) detection from laser scanning
datasets is important for tracking the responses of trees to anthropogenic change. Such approaches
allow the size, growth and mortality of individual trees to be measured, enabling forest carbon
stocks and dynamics to be tracked and understood. Many algorithms exist for structurally simple
forests including coniferous forests and plantations. Finding a robust solution for structurally
complex, species-rich tropical forests remains a challenge; existing segmentation algorithms
often perform less well than simple area-based approaches when estimating plot-level biomass.
Here we describe a Multi-Class Graph Cut (MCGC) approach to tree crown delineation. This uses local
three-dimensional geometry and density information, alongside knowledge of crown allometries,
to segment individual tree crowns from LiDAR point clouds. Our approach robustly identifies trees
in the top and intermediate layers of the canopy, but cannot recognise small trees. From these three-dimensional
crowns, we are able to measure individual tree biomass. Comparing these estimates to those from
permanent inventory plots, our algorithm is able to produce robust estimates of hectare-scale
carbon density, demonstrating the power of ITC approaches in monitoring forests. The flexibility
of our method to add additional dimensions of information, such as spectral reflectance, make this
approach an obvious avenue for future development and extension to other sources of three-dimensional
data, such as structure from motion datasets.
