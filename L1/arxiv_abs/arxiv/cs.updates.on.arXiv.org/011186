Age synthesis is a challenging task due to the complicated and non-linear transformation in human
aging process. Aging information is usually reflected in local facial parts, such as wrinkles at
the eye corners. However, these local facial parts contribute less in previous GAN based methods
for age synthesis. To address this issue, we propose a Wavelet-domain Global and Local Consistent
Age Generative Adversarial Network (WaveletGLCA-GAN), in which one global specific network and
three local specific networks are integrated together to capture both global topology information
and local texture details of human faces. Different from the most existing methods that modeling
age synthesis in image-domain, we adopt wavelet transform to depict the textual information in
frequency-domain. %Moreover, to achieve accurate age generation under the premise of preserving
the identity information, age estimation network and face verification network are employed.
Moreover, five types of losses are adopted: 1) adversarial loss aims to generate realistic wavelets;
2) identity preserving loss aims to better preserve identity information; 3) age preserving loss
aims to enhance the accuracy of age synthesis; 4) pixel-wise loss aims to preserve the background
information of the input face; 5) the total variation regularization aims to remove ghosting artifacts.
Our method is evaluated on three face aging datasets, including CACD2000, Morph and FG-NET. Qualitative
and quantitative experiments show the superiority of the proposed method over other state-of-the-arts.
