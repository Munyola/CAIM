The advancement of simulation-assisted robot programming, automation of high-tolerance assembly
operations, and improvement of real-world performance engender a need for positionally accurate
robots. Despite tight machining tolerances, good mechanical design, and careful assembly, robotic
arms typically exhibit average Cartesian positioning errors of several millimeters. Fortunately,
the vast majority of this error can be removed in software by proper calibration of the so-called
"zero-offsets" of a robot's joints. This research developed an automated, inexpensive, highly
portable, in situ calibration method that fine tunes these kinematic parameters, thereby, improving
a robot's average positioning accuracy four-fold throughout its workspace. In particular, a prospective
low-cost motion capture system and a benchmark laser tracker were used as reference sensors for
robot calibration. Bayesian inference produced optimized zero-offset parameters alongside
their uncertainty for data from both reference sensors. Relative and absolute accuracy metrics
were proposed and applied for quantifying robot positioning accuracy. Uncertainty analysis of
a validated, probabilistic robot model quantified the absolute positioning accuracy throughout
its entire workspace. Altogether, three measures of accuracy conclusively revealed multi-fold
improvement in the positioning accuracy of the robotic arm. Bayesian inference on motion capture
data yielded zero-offsets and accuracy calculations comparable to those derived from laser tracker
data, ultimately proving this method's viability towards robot calibration.
