SinaWeibo, a hybrid of Twitter and Facebook, has become one of the most popular Chinese microblogging
website. Every day, more than 100 million weibos (i.e. microblogs), including news, pictures,
videos and communications with online friends are created on SinaWeibo. The spread and resonance
of their opinions are tremendously influential, having significantly affected and even changed
the processes of quite a few hot events. In this paper, we select 21 hot events which were widely and
heatedly discussed on SinaWeibo in 2011, and analyze their diffusion characteristics. Our main
findings are as follows. (i) The average reposting proportion of hot events in SinaWeibo (70%) is
much higher than that of hot topics in Twitter (less than 31%). (ii) The average proportion of male
users involved in hot events (66%) is much higher than the overall proportion of male users in SinaWeibo
(57%). (iii) For each of the 21 events, picture containing original weibos are more likely to be reposted,
while those with URLs are less likely. (iv) For each of the 21 events, the proportion of verified users
in all the original weibos is significantly higher than in reposting weibos. So is the proportion
of male users. (v) For each of the 21 events, original weibos posted by verified users are more likely
to be reposted, while the gender factor affects very little on the likelihood of being reposted.
