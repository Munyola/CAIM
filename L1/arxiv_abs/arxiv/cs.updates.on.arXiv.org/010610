Public blockchains such as Ethereum and Bitcoin provide transparency and accountability, and
have strong non-repudiation properties, but fall far short of enterprise privacy requirements
for business processes. Consequently consortiums are exploring private blockchains to keep their
membership and transactions private. However, private blockchains do not provide adequate protection
against potential collusion by consortium members to revert the state of the blockchain. To countenance
this, the private blockchain state may be "pinned" to a tamper resistant public blockchain. Existing
solutions offering pinning to the public blockchain would reveal the transaction rate of the private
blockchain, and do not provide a mechanism to contest the validity of a pin. Moreover, they require
that all transactions and members of the private blockchain be revealed. These challenges are hampering
the wider adoption of private blockchain technology. We describe the primary author's `Anonymous
State Pinning approach', which overcomes these limitations and present a security proof to demonstrate
pins can be challenged without compromising these properties. We perform a gas cost analysis of
the implementation to estimate the operating cost of this technology, which shows that pinning
a private blockchain at the rate of one pin per hour would cost US$508 per year. A hierarchical pinning
approach is proposed which would allow many private blockchains to pin to a management blockchain
which would then pin to Ethereum MainNet. This approach saves money, but at the cost of increased
finality times.
