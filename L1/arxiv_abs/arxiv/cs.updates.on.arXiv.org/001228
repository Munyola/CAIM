We design a class of mechanisms called monotone aggregation mechanisms that enable a group of buyers
with private utilities to collectively purchase a divisible resource that they intend to share.
We assume that the resource is being sold in a deterministic truthful auction which solicits bids
for the entire resource. Our mechanism then truthfully elicits utility functions from the buyers,
prescribes a joint bid, and prescribes a division of the payment and the resource in the event that
they win the resource in the auction. This mechanism is group-rational, which means that if there
is a buyer in the group who can afford to individually pay for the entire resource on his own, then the
group buys the resource in the outcome of the mechanism. Further, this mechanism satisfies a popular
notion of collusion-resistance known as group-strategyproofness. We give two explicit characterizations
of this generic class for the naturally occurring case where the utility functions of the buyers
are non-decreasing and concave. We finally consider the case where the resource is not divisible,
but is of the type where each buyer has a utility value for having access to the resource, and once this
resource is bought then no buyer in the group can be excluded from enjoying it. We propose a class of
collective purchasing mechanisms that satisfy this non-excludability requirement. Assuming
that the resource is being sold in a truthful auction (not necessarily deterministic), we show that
this mechanism is group-strategyproof.
