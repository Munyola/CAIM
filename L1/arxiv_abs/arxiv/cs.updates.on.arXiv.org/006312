Disturbance noises are always bounded in a practical system, while fusion estimation is to best
utilize multiple sensor data containing noises for the purpose of estimating a quantity--a parameter
or process. However, few results are focused on the information fusion estimation problem under
bounded noises. In this paper, we study the distributed fusion estimation problem for linear time-varying
systems and nonlinear systems with bounded noises, where the addressed noises do not provide any
statistical information, and is unknown but bounded. When considering linear time-varying fusion
systems with bounded noises, a new local Kalman-like estimator is designed such that the square
error of the estimator is bounded as time goes to $\infty$. A novel constructive method is proposed
to find an upper bound of fusion estimation error, then a convex optimization problem on the design
of an optimal weighting fusion criterion is established in terms of linear matrix inequalities,
which can be solved by standard software packages. Furthermore, according to the design method
of linear time-varying fusion systems, each local nonlinear estimator is derived for nonlinear
systems with bounded noises by using Taylor series expansion, and a corresponding distributed
fusion criterion is obtained by solving a convex optimization problem. Moreover, a stability condition
is also derived for the designed nonlinear estimator. Finally, target tracking system and localization
of a mobile robot are given to show the advantages and effectiveness of the proposed methods.
