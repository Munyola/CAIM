Deep learning is one of the new and important branches in machine learning. Deep learning refers
to a set of algorithms that solve various problems such as images and texts by using various machine
learning algorithms in multi-layer neural networks. Deep learning can be classified as a neural
network from the general category, but there are many changes in the concrete realization. At the
core of deep learning is feature learning, which is designed to obtain hierarchical information
through hierarchical networks, so as to solve the important problems that previously required
artificial design features. Deep Learning is a framework that contains several important algorithms.
For different applications (images, voice, text), you need to use different network models to achieve
better results. With the development of deep learning and the introduction of deep convolutional
neural networks, the accuracy and speed of face recognition have made great strides. However, as
we said above, the results from different networks and models are very different. In this paper,
facial features are extracted by merging and comparing multiple models, and then a deep neural network
is constructed to train and construct the combined features. In this way, the advantages of multiple
models can be combined to mention the recognition accuracy. After getting a model with high accuracy,
we build a product model. This article compares the pure-client model with the server-client model,
analyzes the pros and cons of the two models, and analyzes the various commercial products that are
required for the server-client model.
