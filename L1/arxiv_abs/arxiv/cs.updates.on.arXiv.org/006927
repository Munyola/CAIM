The increasing number of distributed generators connected to distribution grids requires a reliable
monitoring of distribution grids. Economic considerations prevent a full observation of distribution
grids with direct measurements. First approaches using artificial neural networks (ANN) for monitoring
distribution grids with a limited amount of measurements exist. These approaches, however, are
limited to static topologies, only estimate voltage magnitudes, do not work properly when confronted
with a high amount of distributed generation and often yield inaccurate results. These strong limitations
have prevented a true applicability of ANN for distribution system monitoring. We propose a new
ANN-based scheme overcoming the limitations of existing approaches. Our scheme can cope with a
very low amount of measurements, far less than is traditionally required by the state-of-the-art
weighted least squares state estimation (WLS SE). It can estimate both voltage magnitudes and line
loadings with high precision and includes different switching states as inputs. Our contribution
includes a method to generate useful training data by using a scenario generator and a number of hyperparameters
that define the ANN architecture. Both can be used for different power grids even with the high amount
of distributed generation. Simulations performed with an elaborate evaluation approach on a real
and benchmark grid demonstrate that the proposed ANN scheme clearly outperforms state-of-the-art
ANN schemes and WLS SE under normal operating conditions and different situations such as gross
measurement errors.
