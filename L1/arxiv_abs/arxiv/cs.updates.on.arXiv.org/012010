We describe the first self-indexes able to count and locate pattern occurrences in optimal time
within a space bounded by the size of the most popular dictionary compressors. To achieve this result
we combine several recent findings, including \emph{string attractors} --- new combinatorial
objects encompassing most known compressibility measures for highly repetitive texts ---, and
grammars based on \emph{locally-consistent parsing}. More in detail, let $\gamma$ be the size
of the smallest attractor for a text $T$ of length $n$. The measure $\gamma$ is an (asymptotic) lower
bound to the size of dictionary compressors based on Lempel-Ziv, context-free grammars, and many
others. The smallest known text representations in terms of attractors use space $O(\gamma\log(n/\gamma))$,
and our lightest indexes work within the same asymptotic space. Let $\epsilon>0$ be a suitably small
constant fixed at construction time, $m$ be the pattern length, and $occ$ be the number of its text
occurrences. Our index counts pattern occurrences in $O(m+\log^{2+\epsilon}n)$ time, and locates
them in $O(m+(occ+1)\log^\epsilon n)$ time. These bounds already beat all state-of-the art dictionary-compressed
indexes, both in time and space. Further, by increasing the space to $O(\gamma\log(n/\gamma)\log^\epsilon
n)$, we reduce the locating time to the optimal $O(m+occ)$, and within $O(\gamma\log(n/\gamma)\log
n)$ space we can also count in optimal $O(m)$ time. All our indexes can be constructed in $O(n)$ space
and $O(n\log n)$ expected time. As a byproduct of independent interest...
