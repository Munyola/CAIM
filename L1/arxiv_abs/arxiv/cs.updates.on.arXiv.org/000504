Partial model checking was proposed by Andersen in 1995 to verify a temporal logic formula compositionally
on a composition of processes. It consists in incrementally incorporating into the formula the
behavioural information taken from one process - an operation called quotienting - to obtain a new
formula that can be verified on a smaller composition from which the incorporated process has been
removed. Simplifications of the formula must be applied at each step, so as to maintain the formula
at a tractable size. In this paper, we revisit partial model checking. First, we extend quotienting
to the network of labelled transition systems model, which subsumes most parallel composition
operators, including m-among-n synchronisation and parallel composition using synchronisation
interfaces, available in the ELOTOS standard. Second, we reformulate quotienting in terms of a
simple synchronous product between a graph representation of the formula (called formula graph)
and a process, thus enabling quotienting to be implemented efficiently and easily, by reusing existing
tools dedicated to graph compositions. Third, we propose simplifications of the formula as a combination
of bisimulations and reductions using Boolean equation systems applied directly to the formula
graph, thus enabling formula simplifications also to be implemented efficiently. Finally, we
describe an implementation in the CADP (Construction and Analysis of Distributed Processes) toolbox
and present some experimental results in which partial model checking uses hundreds of times less
memory than on-the-fly model checking.
