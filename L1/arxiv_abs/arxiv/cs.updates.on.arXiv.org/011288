Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have gained a remarkable success on many real-world problems
in recent years. However, the performance of CNNs is highly relied on their architectures. For some
state-of-the-art CNNs, their architectures are hand-crafted with expertise in both CNNs and the
investigated problems. To this end, it is difficult for researchers, who have no extended expertise
in CNNs, to explore CNNs for their own problems of interest. In this paper, we propose an automatic
architecture design method for CNNs by using genetic algorithms, which is capable of discovering
a promising architecture of a CNN on handling image classification tasks. The proposed algorithm
does not need any pre-processing before it works, nor any post-processing on the discovered CNN,
which means it is completely automatic. The proposed algorithm is validated on widely used benchmark
datasets, by comparing to the state-of-the-art peer competitors covering eight manually designed
CNNs, four semi-automatically designed CNNs and additional four automatically designed CNNs.
The experimental results indicate that the proposed algorithm achieves the best classification
accuracy consistently among manually and automatically designed CNNs. Furthermore, the proposed
algorithm also shows the competitive classification accuracy to the semi-automatic peer competitors,
while reducing 10 times of the parameters. In addition, on the average the proposed algorithm takes
only one percentage of computational resource compared to that of all the other architecture discovering
algorithms.
