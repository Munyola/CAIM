Over the past two decades, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), more commonly known as drones, have
gained a lot of attention, and are rapidly becoming ubiquitous because of their diverse applications
such as surveillance, disaster management, pollution monitoring, film-making, and military
reconnaissance. However, incidents such as fatal system failures, malicious attacks, and disastrous
misuses have raised concerns in the recent past. Security and viability concerns in drone-based
applications are growing at an alarming rate. Besides, UAV networks (UAVNets) are distinctive
from other ad-hoc networks. Therefore, it is necessary to address these issues to ensure proper
functioning of these UAVs while keeping their uniqueness in mind. Furthermore, adequate security
and functionality require the consideration of many parameters that may include an accurate cognizance
of the working mechanism of vehicles, geographical and weather conditions, and UAVNet communication.
This is achievable by creating a simulator that includes these aspects. A performance evaluation
through relevant drone simulator becomes indispensable procedure to test features, configurations,
and designs to demonstrate superiority to comparative schemes and suitability. Thus, it becomes
of paramount importance to establish the credibility of simulation results by investigating the
merits and limitations of each simulator prior to selection. Based on this motivation, we present
a comprehensive survey of current drone simulators. In addition, open research issues and research
challenges are discussed and presented.
