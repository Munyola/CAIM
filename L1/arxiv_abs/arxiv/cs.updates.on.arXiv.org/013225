In this paper, we study the back-end of simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) problem in
deforming environment, where robot localizes itself and tracks multiple non-rigid soft surface
using its onboard sensor measurements. An elaborate analysis is conducted on conventional deformation
modelling method, Embedded Deformation (ED) graph. We demonstrate and prove that the ED graph widely
used in such scenarios is unobservable and leads to multiple solutions unless suitable priors are
provided. Example as well as theoretical prove are provided to show the ambiguity of ED graph and
camera pose. In modelling non-rigid scenario with ED graph, motion priors of the deforming environment
is essential to separate robot pose and deforming environment. The conclusion can be extrapolated
to any free form deformation formulation. In solving the observability, this research proposes
a preliminary deformable SLAM approach to estimate robot pose in complex environments that exhibits
regular motion. A strategy that approximates deformed shape using a linear combination of several
previous shapes is proposed to avoid the ambiguity in robot movement and rigid and non-rigid motions
of the environment. Fisher information matrix rank analysis with a base case is discussed to prove
the effectiveness. Moreover, the proposed algorithm is validated extensively on Monte Carlo simulations
and real experiments. It is demonstrated that the new algorithm significantly outperforms conventional
rigid SLAM and ED based SLAM especially in scenarios where there is large deformation.
