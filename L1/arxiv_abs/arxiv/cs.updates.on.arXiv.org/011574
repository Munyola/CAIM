Binary stochastic neurons (BSN's) form an integral part of many machine learning algorithms, motivating
the development of hardware accelerators for this complex function. It has been recognized that
hardware BSN's can be implemented using low barrier magnets (LBM's) by minimally modifying present-day
magnetoresistive random access memory (MRAM) devices. A crucial parameter that determines the
response of these LBM based BSN designs is the \emph{correlation time} of magnetization, $\tau_c$.
In this letter, we show that for magnets with low energy barriers ($\Delta \approx k_BT$ and below),
circular disk magnets with in-plane magnetic anisotropy (IMA) lead to $\tau_c$ values that are
two orders of magnitude smaller compared to $\tau_c$ for magnets having perpendicular magnetic
anisotropy (PMA) and provide analytical descriptions. We show that this striking difference in
$\tau_c$ is due to a precession-like fluctuation mechanism that is enabled by the large demagnetization
field in IMA magnets. We provide a detailed energy-delay performance evaluation of previously
proposed BSN designs based on Spin-Orbit-Torque (SOT) MRAM and Spin-Transfer-Torque (STT) MRAM
employing low barrier circular IMA magnets by SPICE simulations. The designs exhibit sub-ns response
times leading to energy requirements of $\sim$a few fJ to evaluate the BSN function, orders of magnitude
lower than digital CMOS implementations with a much larger footprint. While modern MRAM technology
is based on PMA magnets, results in this paper suggest that low barrier circular IMA magnets may be
more suitable for this application.
