Network alignment aims at inferring a set of anchor links matching the shared entities between different
information networks, which has become a prerequisite step for effective fusion of multiple information
networks. In this paper, we will study the network alignment problem to fuse online social networks
specifically. Social network alignment is extremely challenging to address due to several reasons,
i.e., lack of training data, network heterogeneity and one-to-one constraint. Existing network
alignment works usually require a large number of training data, but such a demand can hardly be met
in applications, as manual anchor link labeling is extremely expensive. Significantly different
from other homogeneous network alignment works, information in online social networks is usually
of heterogeneous categories, the incorporation of which in model building is not an easy task. Furthermore,
the one-to-one cardinality constraint on anchor links renders their inference process intertwistingly
correlated. To resolve these three challenges, a novel network alignment model, namely ActiveIter,
is introduced in this paper. ActiveIter defines a set of inter-network meta diagrams for anchor
link feature extraction, adopts active learning for effective label query and uses greedy link
selection for anchor link cardinality filtering. Extensive experiments are conducted on real-world
aligned networks datasets, and the experimental results have demonstrated the effectiveness
of ActiveIter compared with other state-of-the-art baseline methods.
