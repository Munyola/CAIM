Objective: Numerous glucose prediction algorithm have been proposed to empower type 1 diabetes
(T1D) management. Most of these algorithms only account for input such as glucose, insulin and carbohydrate,
which limits their performance. Here, we present a novel glucose prediction algorithm which, in
addition to standard inputs, accounts for meal absorption and physical exercise information to
enhance prediction accuracy. Methods: a compartmental model of glucose-insulin dynamics combined
with a deconvolution technique for state estimation is employed for glucose prediction. In silico
data corresponding from the 10 adult subjects of UVa-Padova simulator, and clinical data from 10
adults with T1D were used. Finally, a comparison against a validated glucose prediction algorithm
based on a latent variable with exogenous input (LVX) model is provided. Results: For a prediction
horizon of 60 minutes, accounting for meal absorption and physical exercise improved glucose forecasting
accuracy. In particular, root mean square error (mg/dL) went from 26.68 to 23.89, p<0.001 (in silico
data); and from 37.02 to 35.96, p<0.001 (clinical data - only meal information). Such improvement
in accuracy was translated into significant improvements on hypoglycaemia and hyperglycaemia
prediction. Finally, the performance of the proposed algorithm is statistically superior to that
of the LVX algorithm (26.68 vs. 32.80, p<0.001 (in silico data); 37.02 vs. 49.17, p<0.01 (clinical
data). Conclusion: Taking into account meal absorption and physical exercise information improves
glucose prediction accuracy.
