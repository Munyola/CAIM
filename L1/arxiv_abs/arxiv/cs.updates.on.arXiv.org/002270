The problem of unicity and reidentifiability of records in large-scale databases has been studied
in different contexts and approaches, with focus on preserving privacy or matching records from
different data sources. With an increasing number of service providers nowadays routinely collecting
location traces of their users on unprecedented scales, there is a pronounced interest in the possibility
of matching records and datasets based on spatial trajectories. Extending previous work on reidentifiability
of spatial data and trajectory matching, we now present the first large-scale analysis of user matchability
in real mobility datasets on realistic scales, i.e.~among two datasets that consist of several
million people's mobility traces for a one week interval each. We extract the relevant statistical
properties which influence the matching process and provide an estimate on a performance of matching
and thus the matchability of users. We derive that for individuals with typical activity in the transportation
system (those making 3-4 trips per day on average), a matching algorithm based on the co-occurrence
of their activities is expected to achieve a 16.8% success rate based only on a one-week long observation
of their mobility traces. Extrapolating for longer time intervals, we expect a success rate of over
55% after four week long observations. We further evaluate different scenarios of data collection
frequency, giving estimates of matchability over time in several realastic cases of mobility datasets.
