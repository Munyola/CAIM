This paper is focused on the task of searching for a specific vehicle that appeared in the surveillance
networks. Existing methods usually assume the vehicle images are well cropped from the surveillance
videos, then use visual attributes, like colors and types, or license plate numbers to match the
target vehicle in the image set. However, a complete vehicle search system should consider the problems
of vehicle detection, representation, indexing, storage, matching, and so on. Besides, attribute-based
search cannot accurately find the same vehicle due to intra-instance changes in different cameras
and the extremely uncertain environment. Moreover, the license plates may be misrecognized in
surveillance scenes due to the low resolution and noise. In this paper, a Progressive Vehicle Search
System, named as PVSS, is designed to solve the above problems. PVSS is constituted of three modules:
the crawler, the indexer, and the searcher. The vehicle crawler aims to detect and track vehicles
in surveillance videos and transfer the captured vehicle images, metadata and contextual information
to the server or cloud. Then multi-grained attributes, such as the visual features and license plate
fingerprints, are extracted and indexed by the vehicle indexer. At last, a query triplet with an
input vehicle image, the time range, and the spatial scope is taken as the input by the vehicle searcher.
The target vehicle will be searched in the database by a progressive process. Extensive experiments
on the public dataset from a real surveillance network validate the effectiveness of the PVSS.
