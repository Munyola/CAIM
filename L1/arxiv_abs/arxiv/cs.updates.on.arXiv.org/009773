Purpose: The facial recess is a delicate structure that must be protected in minimally invasive
cochlear implant surgery. Current research estimates the drill trajectory by using endoscopy
of the unique mastoid patterns. However, missing depth information limits available features
for a registration to preoperative CT data. Therefore, this paper evaluates OCT for enhanced imaging
of drill holes in mastoid bone and compares OCT data to original endoscopic images. Methods: A catheter-based
OCT probe is inserted into a drill trajectory of a mastoid phantom in a translation-rotation manner
to acquire the inner surface state. The images are undistorted and stitched to create volumentric
data of the drill hole. The mastoid cell pattern is segmented automatically and compared to ground
truth. Results: The mastoid pattern segmented on images acquired with OCT show a similarity of J
= 73.6 % to ground truth based on endoscopic images and measured with the Jaccard metric. Leveraged
by additional depth information, automated segmentation tends to be more robust and fail-safe
compared to endoscopic images. Conclusion: The feasibility of using a clinically approved OCT
probe for imaging the drill hole in cochlear implantation is shown. The resulting volumentric images
provide additional information on the shape of caveties in the bone structure, which will be useful
for image-to-patient registration and to estimate the drill trajectory. This will be another step
towards safe minimally invasive cochlear implantation.
