We propose to improve unconditional Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) by training the self-supervised
learning with the adversarial process. In particular, we apply self-supervised learning via the
geometric transformation on input images and assign the pseudo-labels to these transformed images.
(i) In addition to the GAN task, which distinguishes data (real) versus generated (fake) samples,
we train the discriminator to predict the correct pseudo-labels of real transformed samples (classification
task). Importantly, we find out that simultaneously training the discriminator to classify the
fake class from the pseudo-classes of real samples for the classification task will improve the
discriminator and subsequently lead better guides to train generator. (ii) The generator is trained
by attempting to confuse the discriminator for not only the GAN task but also the classification
task. For the classification task, the generator tries to confuse the discriminator recognizing
the transformation of its output as one of the real transformed classes. Especially, we exploit
that when the generator creates samples that result in a similar loss (via cross-entropy) as that
of the real ones, the training is more stable and the generator distribution tends to match better
the data distribution. When integrating our techniques into a state-of-the-art Auto-Encoder
(AE) based-GAN model, they help to significantly boost the model's performance and also establish
new state-of-the-art Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) scores in the literature of unconditional
GAN for CIFAR-10 and STL-10 datasets.
