Ethereum has become a widely used platform to enable secure, Blockchain-based financial and business
transactions. However, a major concern in Ethereum is the security of its smart contracts. Many
identified bugs and vulnerabilities in smart contracts not only present challenges to maintenance
of blockchain, but also lead to serious financial loses. There is a significant need to better assist
developers in checking smart contracts and ensuring their reliability.In this paper, we propose
a web service tool, named SmartEmbed, which can help Solidity developers to find repetitive contract
code and clone-related bugs in smart contracts. Our tool is based on code embeddings and similarity
checking techniques. By comparing the similarities among the code embedding vectors for existing
solidity code in the Ethereum blockchain and known bugs, we are able to efficiently identify code
clones and clone-related bugs for any solidity code given by users, which can help to improve the
users' confidence in the reliability of their code. In addition to the uses by individual developers,
SmartEmbed can also be applied to studies of smart contracts in a large scale. When applied to more
than 22K solidity contracts collected from the Ethereum blockchain, we found that the clone ratio
of solidity code is close to 90\%, much higher than traditional software, and 194 clone-related
bugs can be identified efficiently and accurately based on our small bug database with a precision
of 96\%. SmartEmbed can be accessed at \url{this http URL}. A demo video of SmartEmbed is at \url{https://youtu.be/o9ylyOpYFq8}
