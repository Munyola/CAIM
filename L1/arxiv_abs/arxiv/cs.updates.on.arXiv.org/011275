As one of the classic models that describe the belief dynamics over social networks, non-Bayesian
social learning model assumes that members in the network are possessing accurate signal knowledge
through the process of Bayesian inference. In order to make the non-Bayesian social learning model
more applicable to human and animal societies, this paper extended this model by assuming existence
of private signal structure bias: each social member in each time step uses an imperfect signal knowledge
to form its Bayesian part belief, then incorporates its neighbors' beliefs into this Bayesian part
belief to form a new belief report. First, we investigated the intrinsic learning ability of an isolated
agent and deduced the conditions that the signal structure needs to satisfy for this isolated agent
to make an eventually correct decision. According to these conditions, agents' signal structures
were further divided into three different types, "conservative", "radical", and "negative".
Then we switched the context from isolated agents to a connected network, our propositions and simulations
show the "conservative" agents is the dominant force for the social network to learn the real state,
while the other two types might prevent the network from successful learning. Although fragilities
do exist in non-Bayesian social learning mechanism, "be more conservative" and "avoid overconfidence"
could be effective strategies for each agent in the real social networks to collectively improve
social learning processes and results.
