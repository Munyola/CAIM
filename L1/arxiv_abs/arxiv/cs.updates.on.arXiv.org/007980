Byzantine agreement (BA) has always been a classical distributed systems abstraction. About a
decade ago, decentralized cryptocurrency and smart contract started to gain popularity, inspiring
us to study the agreement problem in large-scale decentralized networks. In such decentralized
systems, protocol messages are {\it multicast} over a peer-to-peer network to all consensus nodes
(as opposed to a point-to-point network with pairwise channels). In this paper, we consider BA protocols
suitable for such large-scale settings --- specifically, protocols that make use of only {\it a
small number of multicast messages} to reach agreement. We say that a BA protocol achieves $C$ multicast
complexity if only $C$ number of nodes need to speak (i.e., multicast messages) during the entire
protocol. In this paper, we show new feasibility and infeasibility results regarding communication
efficient BA protocols in the multicast model. First, we prove that under a plain authenticated
channels model without any setup assumptions, BA protocols with sublinear (in the number of nodes)
multicast complexity is impossible in the presence of an adaptive adversary, even when 99\% of the
nodes are honest. We then show that this infeasibility can be circumvented assuming a public-key
infrastructure and standard cryptographic assumptions (and without relying on the ability of
honest nodes to securely erase secret data from memory). Specifically, we construct adaptively
secure BA protocols with sublinear multicast complexity for either a {\it synchronous} or a {\it
partially synchronous} network.
