Using the keyboard LEDs to send data optically was proposed in 2002 by Loughry and Umphress [1] (Appendix
A). In this paper we extensively explore this threat in the context of a modern cyber-attack with
current hardware and optical equipment. In this type of attack, an advanced persistent threat (APT)
uses the keyboard LEDs (Caps-Lock, Num-Lock and Scroll-Lock) to encode information and exfiltrate
data from airgapped computers optically. Notably, this exfiltration channel is not monitored
by existing data leakage prevention (DLP) systems. We examine this attack and its boundaries for
today's keyboards with USB controllers and sensitive optical sensors. We also introduce smartphone
and smartwatch cameras as components of malicious insider and 'evil maid' attacks. We provide the
necessary scientific background on optical communication and the characteristics of modern USB
keyboards at the hardware and software level, and present a transmission protocol and modulation
schemes. We implement the exfiltration malware, discuss its design and implementation issues,
and evaluate it with different types of keyboards. We also test various receivers, including light
sensors, remote cameras, 'extreme' cameras, security cameras, and smartphone cameras. Our experiment
shows that data can be leaked from air-gapped computers via the keyboard LEDs at a maximum bit rate
of 3000 bit/sec per LED given a light sensor as a receiver, and more than 120 bit/sec if smartphones
are used. The attack doesn't require any modification of the keyboard at hardware or firmware levels.
