High solar Photovoltaic (PV) penetration on distribution systems can cause over-voltage problems.
To this end, an Optimal Tap Control (OTC) method is proposed to regulate On-Load Tap Changers (OLTCs)
by minimizing the maximum deviation of the voltage profile from 1~p.u. on the entire feeder. A secondary
objective is to reduce the number of tap operations (TOs), which is implemented for the optimization
horizon based on voltage forecasts derived from high resolution PV generation forecasts. A linearization
technique is applied to make the optimization problem convex and able to be solved at operational
timescales. Simulations on a PC show the solution time for one time step is only 1.1~s for a large feeder
with 4 OLTCs and 1623 buses. OTC results are compared against existing methods through simulations
on two feeders in the Californian network. OTC is firstly compared against an advanced rule-based
Voltage Level Control (VLC) method. OTC and VLC achieve the same reduction of voltage violations,
but unlike VLC, OTC is capable of coordinating multiple OLTCs. Scalability to multiple OLTCs is
therefore demonstrated against a basic conventional rule-based control method called Autonomous
Tap Control (ATC). Comparing to ATC, the test feeder under control of OTC can accommodate around
67\% more PV without over-voltage issues. Though a side effect of OTC is an increase in tap operations,
the secondary objective functionally balances operations between all OLTCs such that impacts
on their lifetime and maintenance are minimized.
