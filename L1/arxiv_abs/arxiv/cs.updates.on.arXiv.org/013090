In recent years, malicious information had an explosive growth in social media, with serious social
and political backlashes. Recent important studies, featuring large-scale analyses, have produced
deeper knowledge about this phenomenon, showing that disinformation spreads faster, deeper and
more broadly than the truth on social media, where bots and echo chambers play an important role in
diffusion networks. Following these directions, we explore the possibility of classifying news
articles circulating on social media based exclusively on a topological analysis of their diffusion
networks. To this aim we collected a large dataset of networks on Twitter pertaining to news articles
published on two distinct classes of sources, namely outlets that convey mainstream, reliable
and objective information and those that fabricate and disseminate various kinds of disinformation
stories. We carried out an extensive comparison of these networks using several alignment-free
approaches including basic network properties, centrality measures distributions, and network
distances. We accordingly evaluated to what extent these features allow to discriminate between
the networks associated to the aforementioned news domains. Our results highlight that the communities
of users spreading mainstream rather than disinformation news tend to shape diffusion networks
with subtle yet systematic differences. This opens the way to promptly and correctly identifying
disinformation on social media by solely inspecting the resulting diffusion networks.
