Enabling users to move to different geographical locations within a network and still be able to
maintain their connectivity and most essentially, continuity of service, is what makes any wireless
network ubiquitous. Whilst challenging, modern day wireless networks, such as 3GPP-LTE, provision
satisfactory mobility management (MM) performance. However, it is estimated that the number of
mobile subscriptions will touch 9 billion and the amount of data traffic will expand by 10 times by
2021. To cope with such an exponential increase in cellular traffic and users alongside a burgeoning
demand for higher Quality of Service (QoS), the 5G networks are expected to be highly dense and heterogeneous.
This will severely challenge the existing MM solutions and ultimately render them ineffective
as they will not be able to provide the required reliability, flexibility, and scalability. Consequently,
to serve the 5G networks, a new perspective to MM is required. Hence, in this article we present a novel
discussion of the functional requirements from MM strategies for 5G networks. We then provide a
detailed assessment of whether the existing mechanisms conceived by standardization bodies such
as IEEE, IETF, 3GPP (including the newly defined 5G standards) and ITU, and current research efforts
meet these requirements. Next, in cognizance of these prior discussions, we present a study detailing
the research challenges that exist in the design and implementation of MM strategies for 5G networks.
Lastly, we chart out the potential 5G MM solutions and the associated capabilities they offer.
