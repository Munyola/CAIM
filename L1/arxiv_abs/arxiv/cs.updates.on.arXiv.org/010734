Glioblastoma is a highly invasive brain tumor, whose cells infiltrate surrounding normal brain
tissue beyond the lesion outlines visible in the current medical scans. These infiltrative cells
are treated mainly by radiotherapy. Existing radiotherapy plans for brain tumors derive from population
studies and scarcely account for patient-specific conditions. Here we provide a Bayesian machine
learning framework for the rational design of improved, personalized radiotherapy plans using
mathematical modeling and patient multimodal medical scans. Our method, for the first time, integrates
complementary information from high resolution MRI scans and highly specific FET-PET metabolic
maps to infer tumor cell density in glioblastoma patients. The Bayesian framework quantifies imaging
and modeling uncertainties and predicts patient-specific tumor cell density with confidence
intervals. The proposed methodology relies only on data acquired at a single time point and thus
is applicable to standard clinical settings. An initial clinical population study shows that the
radiotherapy plans generated from the inferred tumor cell infiltration maps spare more healthy
tissue thereby reducing radiation toxicity while yielding comparable accuracy with standard
radiotherapy protocols. Moreover, the inferred regions of high tumor cell densities coincide
with the tumor radioresistant areas, providing guidance for personalized dose-escalation. The
proposed integration of multimodal scans and mathematical modeling provides a robust, non-invasive
tool to assist personalized radiotherapy design.
