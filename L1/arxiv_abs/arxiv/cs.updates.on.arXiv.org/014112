Segmentation is a critical step in medical image analysis. Fully Convolutional Networks (FCNs)
have emerged as powerful segmentation models achieving state-of-the-art results in various medical
image datasets. Network architectures are usually designed manually for a specific segmentation
task so applying them to other medical datasets requires extensive experience and time. Moreover,
the segmentation requires handling large volumetric data that results in big and complex architectures.
Recently, methods that automatically design neural networks for medical image segmentation have
been presented; however, most approaches either do not fully consider volumetric information
or do not optimize the size of the network. In this paper, we propose a novel self-adaptive 2D-3D ensemble
of FCNs for medical image segmentation that incorporates volumetric information and optimizes
both the model's performance and size. The model is composed of an ensemble of a 2D FCN that extracts
intra-slice information, and a 3D FCN that exploits inter-slice information. The architectures
of the 2D and 3D FCNs are automatically adapted to a medical image dataset using a multiobjective
evolutionary based algorithm that minimizes both the segmentation error and number of parameters
in the network. The proposed 2D-3D FCN ensemble was tested on the task of prostate segmentation on
the image dataset from the PROMISE12 Grand Challenge. The resulting network is ranked in the top
10 submissions, surpassing the performance of other automatically-designed architectures while
being considerably smaller in size.
