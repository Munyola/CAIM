${\cal H}^2$-matrix constitutes a general mathematical framework for efficient computation
of both partial-differential-equation and integral-equation-based operators. Existing linear-complexity
${\cal H}^2$ matrix-matrix product (MMP) algorithm lacks explicit accuracy control, while controlling
accuracy without compromising linear complexity is challenging. In this paper, we develop an accuracy
controlled ${\cal H}^2$ matrix-matrix product algorithm by instantaneously changing the cluster
bases during the matrix product computation based on prescribed accuracy. Meanwhile, we retain
the computational complexity of the overall algorithm to be linear. Different from the existing
${\cal H}^2$ matrix-matrix product algorithm where formatted multiplications are performed
using the original cluster bases, in the proposed algorithm, all additions and multiplications
are either exact or computed based on prescribed accuracy. Furthermore, the original ${\cal H}^2$-matrix
structure is preserved in the matrix product. While achieving optimal complexity for constant-rank
matrices, the computational complexity of the proposed algorithm is also minimized for variable-rank
${\cal H}^2$-matrices. The proposed work serves as a fundamental arithmetic in the development
of fast solvers for large-scale electromagnetic analysis. Applications to both large-scale capacitance
extraction and electromagnetic scattering problems involving millions of unknowns on a single
core have demonstrated the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed algorithm.
