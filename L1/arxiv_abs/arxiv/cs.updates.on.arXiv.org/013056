Support vector regression (SVR) has been widely used to reduce the high computational cost of computer
simulation. SVR assumes the input parameters have equal sample sizes, but unequal sample sizes
are often encountered in engineering practices. To solve this issue, a new prediction approach
based on SVR, namely as high-low-level SVR approach (HL-SVR) is proposed for data modeling of input
parameters of unequal sample sizes in this paper. The proposed approach is consisted of low-level
SVR models for the input parameters of larger sample sizes and high-level SVR model for the input
parameters of smaller sample sizes. For each training point of the input parameters of smaller sample
sizes, one low-level SVR model is built based on its corresponding input parameters of larger sample
sizes and their responses of interest. The high-level SVR model is built based on the obtained responses
from the low-level SVR models and the input parameters of smaller sample sizes. Several numerical
examples are used to validate the performance of HL-SVR. The experimental results indicate that
HL-SVR can produce more accurate prediction results than conventional SVR. The proposed approach
is applied on the stress analysis of dental implant, which the structural parameters have massive
samples but the material of implant can only be selected from several Ti and its alloys. The prediction
performance of the proposed approach is much better than the conventional SVR. The proposed approach
can be used for the design, optimization and analysis of engineering systems with input parameters
of unequal sample sizes.
