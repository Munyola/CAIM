For $0 \leq \alpha \leq 1/2$, we show an algorithm that does the following. Given appropriate preprocessing
$P(\mathcal{L})$ consisting of $N_\alpha := 2^{O(n^{1-2\alpha} + \log n)}$ vectors in some lattice
$\mathcal{L} \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ and a target vector $\boldsymbol{t}\in \mathbb{R}^n$, the
algorithm finds $\boldsymbol{y} \in \mathcal{L}$ such that $\|\boldsymbol{y}- \boldsymbol{t}\|
\leq n^{1/2 + \alpha} \eta(\mathcal{L})$ in time $\mathrm{poly}(n) \cdot N_\alpha$, where $\eta(\mathcal{L})$
is the smoothing parameter of the lattice. The algorithm itself is very simple and was originally
studied by Doulgerakis, Laarhoven, and de Weger (to appear in PQCrypto, 2019), who proved its correctness
under certain reasonable heuristic assumptions on the preprocessing $P(\mathcal{L})$ and target
$\boldsymbol{t}$. Our primary contribution is a choice of preprocessing that allows us to prove
correctness without any heuristic assumptions. Our main motivation for studying this is the recent
breakthrough algorithm for IdealSVP due to Hanrot, Pellet--Mary, and Stehl\'e (to appear in Eurocrypt,
2019), which uses the DLW algorithm as a key subprocedure. In particular, our result implies that
the HPS IdealSVP algorithm can be made to work with fewer heuristic assumptions. Our only technical
tool is the discrete Gaussian distribution over $\mathcal{L}$, and in particular, a lemma showing
that the one-dimensional projections of this distribution behave very similarly to the continuous
Gaussian. This lemma might be of independent interest.
