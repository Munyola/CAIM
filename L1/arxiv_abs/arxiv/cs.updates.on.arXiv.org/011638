Background and Purpose: A current algorithm to obtain a synthetic myelin volume fraction map (SyMVF)
from rapid simultaneous relaxometry imaging (RSRI) has a potential problem, that it does not incorporate
information from surrounding pixels. The purpose of this study was to develop a method that utilizes
a convolutional neural network (CNN) to overcome this problem. Methods: RSRI and magnetization
transfer images from 20 healthy volunteers were included. A CNN was trained to reconstruct RSRI-related
metric maps into a myelin volume-related index (generated myelin volume index: GenMVI) map using
the myelin volume index map calculated from magnetization transfer images (MTMVI) as reference.
The SyMVF and GenMVI maps were statistically compared by testing how well they correlated with the
MTMVI map. The correlations were evaluated based on: (i) averaged values obtained from 164 atlas-based
ROIs, and (ii) pixel-based comparison for ROIs defined in four different tissue types (cortical
and subcortical gray matter, white matter, and whole brain). Results: For atlas-based ROIs, the
overall correlation with the MTMVI map was higher for the GenMVI map than for the SyMVF map. In the
pixel-based comparison, correlation with the MTMVI map was stronger for the GenMVI map than for
the SyMVF map, and the difference in the distribution for the volunteers was significant (Wilcoxon
sign-rank test, P<.001) in all tissue types. Conclusion: The proposed method is useful, as it can
incorporate more specific information about local tissue properties than the existing method.
