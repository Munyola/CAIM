Query expansion (QE) is a well known technique to enhance the effectiveness of information retrieval
(IR). QE reformulates the initial query by adding similar terms that helps in retrieving more relevant
results. Several approaches have been proposed with remarkable outcome, but they are not evenly
favorable for all types of queries. One of the main reasons for this is the use of the same data source
while expanding both the individual and the phrase query terms. As a result, the holistic relationship
among the query terms is not well captured. To address this issue, we have selected separate data
sources for individual and phrase terms. Specifically, we have used WordNet for expanding individual
terms and Wikipedia for expanding phrase terms. We have also proposed novel schemes for weighting
expanded terms: inlink score (for terms extracted from Wikipedia) and a tfidf based scheme (for
terms extracted from WordNet). In the proposed Wikipedia WordNet based QE technique (WWQE), we
weigh the expansion terms twice: first, they are scored by the weighting scheme individually, and
then, the weighting scheme scores the selected expansion terms in relation to the entire query using
correlation score. The experimental results show that the proposed approach successfully combines
Wikipedia and WordNet as demonstrated through a better performance on standard evaluation metrics
on FIRE dataset. The proposed WWQE approach is also suitable with other standard weighting models
for improving the effectiveness of IR.
