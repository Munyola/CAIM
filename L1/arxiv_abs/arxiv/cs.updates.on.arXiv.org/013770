In this paper we investigate the problem of simultaneously allocating orders and mobile storage
racks to pickers. Here storage racks are allocated to pickers to enable them to pick all of the products
for the orders that have been allocated to them. In situations of this type the pickers remain at fixed
locations and racks are brought to them by robots, e.g.~as in Amazon fulfilment centres that use
Kiva robots. We also consider the problem of sequencing the racks for presentation to each picker
to assist in order picking. Problems of the type considered here arise in facilities operating as
robotic mobile fulfilment systems. We present a formulation of the problem of allocating orders
and racks to pickers as an integer program and discuss the complexity of the problem. We present two
heuristics (matheuristics) for the problem, one using partial integer optimisation, that are
directly based upon our formulation. We consider the problem of how to sequence the racks for presentation
at each individual picker and formulate this problem as an integer program, both when no rack revisits
to the picker are allowed and when rack revisits are allowed. We prove that, subject to certain conditions
being satisfied, a feasible rack sequence for all orders can be produced by focusing on just a subset
of the orders to be dealt with by the picker. Computational results are presented, both for order
and rack allocation, and for rack sequencing, for randomly generated test problems (that are made
publicly available) involving up to 500 products, 100 orders, 100 racks and 10 pickers.
