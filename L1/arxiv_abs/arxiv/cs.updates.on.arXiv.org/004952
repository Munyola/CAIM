Bitcoin cryptocurrency system enables users to transact securely and pseudo-anonymously by using
an arbitrary number of aliases (Bitcoin addresses). Cybercriminals exploit these characteristics
to commit immutable and presumably untraceable monetary fraud, especially via ransomware; a type
of malware that encrypts files of the infected system and demands ransom for decryption. In this
paper, we present our comprehensive study on all recent ransomware and report the economic impact
of such ransomware from the Bitcoin payment perspective. To this end, we present a lightweight framework
to identify, collect, and analyze Bitcoin addresses managed by the same user or group of users (cybercriminals,
in our case) and a novel approach for classifying a payment as ransom. To verify the correctness of
our approach, we compared our findings on CryptoLocker ransomware with the results presented in
the literature. And, we found that our results align with the results presented in the previous works
except for the final valuation in USD. Our aim was to accurately measure the USD worth of these payments.
Hence, we used the average Bitcoin price on the day of each ransom payment whereas the authors of the
previous studies used the Bitcoin price on the day of their evaluation. Furthermore, for each investigated
ransomware, we provide a holistic view of its genesis, development, the process of infection and
execution, and characteristic of ransom demands. Finally, we also release our dataset for future
investigations in this direction of research.
