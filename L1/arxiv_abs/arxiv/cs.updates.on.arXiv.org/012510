For any fixed graph $G$, the subgraph isomorphism problem asks whether an $n$-vertex input graph
has a subgraph isomorphic to $G$. A well-known algorithm of Alon, Yuster and Zwick (1995) efficiently
reduces this to the "colored" version of the problem, denoted $G$-$\mathsf{SUB}$, and then solves
$G$-$\mathsf{SUB}$ in time $O(n^{tw(G)+1})$ where $tw(G)$ is the treewidth of $G$. Marx (2010)
conjectured that $G$-$\mathsf{SUB}$ requires time $\Omega(n^{\mathrm{const}\cdot tw(G)})$
and, assuming the Exponential Time Hypothesis is true, proved a lower bound of $\Omega(n^{\mathrm{const}\cdot
emb(G)})$ for a certain graph parameter $emb(G) = \Omega(tw(G)/\log tw(G))$. With respect to the
size of $\mathrm{AC}^0$ circuits solving $G$-$\mathsf{SUB}$, Li, Razborov and Rossman (2017)
proved an unconditional average-case lower bound of $\Omega(n^{\kappa(G)})$ for a different
graph parameter $\kappa(G) = \Omega(tw(G)/\log tw(G))$. Our contributions are as follows. First,
we show that $emb(G)$ is at most $O(\kappa(G))$ for all graphs $G$. Next, we show that $\kappa(G)$
can be asymptotically less than $tw(G)$; for example if $G$ is a hypercube, then $\kappa(G)$ is $\Theta\left(tw(G)/\sqrt{\log
tw(G)}\right)$. Finally, we construct $\mathrm{AC}^0$ circuits of size $O(n^{\kappa(G)+\mathrm{const}})$
that solve $G$-$\mathsf{SUB}$ in the average case, on a variety of product distributions. This
improves an $O(n^{2\kappa(G)+\mathrm{const}})$ upper bound of Li et al, and shows that the average-case
complexity of $G$-$\mathsf{SUB}$ is $n^{o(tw(G))}$ for certain families of graphs $G$ such as
hypercubes.
