Blockchains are turning into decentralized computing platforms and are getting worldwide recognition
for their unique advantages. There is an emerging trend beyond payments that blockchains could
enable a new breed of decentralized applications, and serve as the foundation for Internet's security
infrastructure. The immutable nature of the blockchain makes it a winner on security and transparency;
it is nearly inconceivable for ledgers to be altered in a way not instantly clear to every single user
involved. However, most blockchains fall short in privacy aspects, particularly in data protection.
Garlic Routing and Onion Routing are two of major Privacy Enhancing Techniques (PETs) which are
popular for anonymization and security. Garlic Routing is a methodology using by I2P Anonymous
Network to hide the identity of sender and receiver of data packets by bundling multiple messages
into a layered encryption structure. The Onion Routing attempts to provide lowlatency Internet-based
connections that resist traffic analysis, deanonymization attack, eavesdropping, and other
attacks both by outsiders (e.g. Internet routers) and insiders (Onion Routing servers themselves).
As there are a few controversies over the rate of resistance of these two techniques to privacy attacks,
we propose a PET-Enabled Sidechain (PETES) as a new privacy enhancing technique by integrating
Garlic Routing and Onion Routing into a Garlic Onion Routing (GOR) framework suitable to the structure
of blockchains. The preliminary proposed GOR aims to improve the privacy of transactions in blockchains
via PETES structure.
