Determinantal Point Processes (DPPs) were introduced by Macchi as a model for repulsive (fermionic)
particle distributions. But their recent popularization is largely due to their usefulness for
encouraging diversity in the final stage of a recommender system. The standard sampling scheme
for finite DPPs is a spectral decomposition followed by an equivalent of a randomly diagonally-pivoted
Cholesky factorization of an orthogonal projection, which is only applicable to Hermitian kernels
and has an expensive setup cost. Researchers have begun to connect DPP sampling to $LDL^H$ factorizations
as a means of avoiding the initial spectral decomposition, but existing approaches have only outperformed
the spectral decomposition approach in special circumstances, where the number of kept modes is
a small percentage of the ground set size. This article proves that trivial modifications of $LU$
and $LDL^H$ factorizations yield efficient direct sampling schemes for non-Hermitian and Hermitian
DPP kernels, respectively. Further, it is experimentally shown that even dynamically-scheduled,
shared-memory parallelizations of high-performance dense and sparse-direct factorizations
can be trivially modified to yield DPP sampling schemes with essentially identical performance.
