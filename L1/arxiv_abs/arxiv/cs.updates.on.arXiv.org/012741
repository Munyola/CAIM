We study combinatorial auctions with interdependent valuations. In such settings, each agent
$i$ has a private signal $s_i$ that captures her private information, and the valuation function
of every agent depends on the entire signal profile, ${\bf s}=(s_1,\ldots,s_n)$. The literature
in economics shows that the interdependent model gives rise to strong impossibility results, and
identifies assumptions under which optimal solutions can be attained. The computer science literature
provides approximation results for simple single-parameter settings (mostly single item auctions,
or matroid feasibility constraints). Both bodies of literature focus largely on valuations satisfying
a technical condition termed {\em single crossing} (or variants thereof). We consider the class
of {\em submodular over signals} (SOS) valuations (without imposing any single-crossing type
assumption), and provide the first welfare approximation guarantees for multi-dimensional combinatorial
auctions, achieved by universally ex-post IC-IR mechanisms. Our main results are: $(i)$ 4-approximation
for any single-parameter downward-closed setting with single-dimensional signals and SOS valuations;
$(ii)$ 4-approximation for any combinatorial auction with multi-dimensional signals and {\em
separable}-SOS valuations; and $(iii)$ $(k+3)$- and $(2\log(k)+4)$-approximation for any combinatorial
auction with single-dimensional signals, with $k$-sized signal space, for SOS and strong-SOS
valuations, respectively. All of our results extend to a parameterized version of SOS, $d$-SOS,
while losing a factor that depends on $d$.
