Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is being increasingly utilized to assess, diagnose, and plan
treatment for a variety of diseases. The ability to visualize tissue in varied contrasts in the form
of MR pulse sequences in a single scan provides valuable insights to physicians, as well as enabling
automated systems performing downstream analysis. However many issues like prohibitive scan
time, image corruption, different acquisition protocols, or allergies to certain contrast materials
may hinder the process of acquiring multiple sequences for a patient. This poses challenges to both
physicians and automated systems since complementary information provided by the missing sequences
is lost. In this paper, we propose a variant of generative adversarial network (GAN) capable of leveraging
redundant information contained within multiple available sequences in order to generate one
or more missing sequences for a patient scan. The proposed network is designed as a multi-input,
multi-output network which combines information from all the available pulse sequences, implicitly
infers which sequences are missing, and synthesizes the missing ones in a single forward pass. We
demonstrate and validate our method on two brain MRI datasets each with four sequences, and show
the applicability of the proposed method in simultaneously synthesizing all missing sequences
in any possible scenario where either one, two, or three of the four sequences may be missing. We compare
our approach with competing unimodal and multi-modal methods, and show that we outperform both
quantitatively and qualitatively.
