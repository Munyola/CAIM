With the growing integration of location based services (LBS) such as GPS in mobile devices, indoor
position systems (IPS) have become an important role for research. There are several IPS methods
such as AOA, TOA, TDOA, which use trilateration for indoor location estimation but are generally
based on line-of-sight. Other methods rely on classification such as fingerprinting which uses
WLAN indoor signals. This paper re-examines the classical WLAN fingerprinting accuracy which
uses received signal strength (RSS) measurements by introducing channel estimates for improvements
in the classification of indoor locations. The purpose of this paper is to improve existing classification
algorithms used in fingerprinting by introducing channel estimates when there are a low number
of APs available. The channel impulse response, or in this case the channel estimation from the receiver,
should characterize a complex indoor area which usually has multipath, thus providing a unique
signature for each location which proves useful for better pattern recognition. In this experiment,
channel estimates are extracted from a Software-Defined Radio (SDR) environment, thus exploiting
the benefits of SDR from a NI-USRP model and LabVIEW software. Measurements are taken from a known
building, and several scenarios with one and two access points (APs) are used in this experiment.
Also, three granularities in distance between locations are analyzed. A Support Vector Machine
(SVM) is used as the algorithm for pattern recognition of different locations based on the samples
taken from RSS and channel estimation coefficients.
