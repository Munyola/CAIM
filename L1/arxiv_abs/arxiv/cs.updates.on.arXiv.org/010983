Measures of node centrality that describe the importance of a node within a network are crucial for
understanding the behavior of social networks and graphs. In this paper, we address the problems
of distributed estimation and control of node centrality in undirected graphs with asymmetric
weight values. In particular, we focus our attention on $\alpha$-centrality, which can be seen
as a generalization of eigenvector centrality, particularly suitable for graphs with asymmetric
interactions. In this setting, our contribution is twofold: first we derive a distributed protocol
where agents can locally compute their $\alpha$-centrality index by means of local interactions;
then, we focus our attention on the problem of controlling the weight matrix of the graph in such a
way that the network reaches a desired $\alpha$-centrality vector. The interest of our solution
lies in obtaining the control objective with minimum changes in the original influence matrix.
Moreover, with our algorithm every agent is able to reach the desired value locally and in finite-time.
The two algorithms are then applied to two problems of interest in real life. The estimation method
is used together with a consensus algorithm to achieve a consensus value weighted by the influence
of each node in the network. The control algorithm is exploited to protect the most valuable nodes
in a network against a targeted attack, by making every node in the network equally important in terms
of {\alpha}-centrality. Simulations results are provided to corroborate the theoretical findings.
