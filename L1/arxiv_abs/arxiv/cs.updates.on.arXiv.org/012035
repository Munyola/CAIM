Occlusion and pose variations, which can change facial appearance significantly, are two major
obstacles for automatic Facial Expression Recognition (FER). Though automatic FER has made substantial
progresses in the past few decades, occlusion-robust and pose-invariant issues of FER have received
relatively less attention, especially in real-world scenarios. This paper addresses the real-world
pose and occlusion robust FER problem with three-fold contributions. First, to stimulate the research
of FER under real-world occlusions and variant poses, we build several in-the-wild facial expression
datasets with manual annotations for the community. Second, we propose a novel Region Attention
Network (RAN), to adaptively capture the importance of facial regions for occlusion and pose variant
FER. The RAN aggregates and embeds varied number of region features produced by a backbone convolutional
neural network into a compact fixed-length representation. Last, inspired by the fact that facial
expressions are mainly defined by facial action units, we propose a region biased loss to encourage
high attention weights for the most important regions. We validate our RAN and region biased loss
on both our built test datasets and four popular datasets: FERPlus, AffectNet, RAF-DB, and SFEW.
Extensive experiments show that our RAN and region biased loss largely improve the performance
of FER with occlusion and variant pose. Our method also achieves state-of-the-art results on FERPlus,
AffectNet, RAF-DB, and SFEW. Code and the collected test data will be publicly available.
