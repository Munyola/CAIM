Community detection plays an important role in social networks, since it can help to naturally divide
the network into smaller parts so as to simply network analysis. However, on the other hand, it arises
the concern that individual information may be over-mined, and the concept community deception
thus is proposed to protect individual privacy on social networks. Here, we introduce and formalize
the problem of community detection attack and develop efficient strategies to attack community
detection algorithms by rewiring a small number of connections, leading to individual privacy
protection. In particular, we first give two heuristic attack strategies, i.e., Community Detection
Attack (CDA) and Degree Based Attack (DBA), as baselines, utilizing the information of detected
community structure and node degree, respectively. And then we propose a Genetic Algorithm (GA)
based Q-Attack, where the modularity Q is used to design the fitness function. We launch community
detection attack based on the above three strategies against three modularity based community
detection algorithms on two social networks. By comparison, our Q-Attack method achieves much
better attack effects than CDA and DBA, in terms of the larger reduction of both modularity Q and Normalized
Mutual Information (NMI). Besides, we find that the adversarial networks obtained by Q-Attack
on a specific community detection algorithm can be still effective on others, no matter whether
they are modularity based or not, indicating its strong transferability.
