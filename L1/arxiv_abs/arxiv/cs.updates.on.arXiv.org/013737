Formal Languages and Automata Theory are important foundational topics in Computer Science. Their
rigorous and formal characteristics make their learning them demanding. An important support
for the assimilation of concepts is the possibility of interactively visualizing concrete examples
of these computational models, facilitating understanding them. The tools available are neither
complete nor fully support the interactive aspect. This project aims at the development of an interactive
web tool in Portuguese to help in an assisted and intuitive way to understand the concepts and algorithms
in question, seeing them work step-by-step, through typical examples preloaded or built by the
user (an original aspect of our platform). The tool should therefore enable the creation and edition
of an automata, as well as execute the relevant classical algorithms such as word acceptance, model
conversions, etc. It is also intended to visualize not only the process of construction of the automaton,
but also all the steps of applying the given algorithm. This tool uses the Ocsigen Framework because
it provides the development of complete and interactive web tools written in OCaml, a functional
language with a strong type checking system and therefore perfect for a web page without errors.
Ocsigen was also chosen because it allows the creation of dynamic pages with a singular client-server
system. This article presents the first phase of the development of the project. It is already possible
to create automata, check the nature of its states and verify step-by-step (with undo) the acceptance
of a word.
