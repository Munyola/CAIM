Accurate segmentation of the left ventricle myocardium in cardiac CT angiography (CCTA) is essential
for e.g. the assessment of myocardial perfusion. Automatic deep learning methods for segmentation
in CCTA might suffer from differences in contrast-agent attenuation between training and test
data due to non-standardized contrast administration protocols and varying cardiac output. We
propose augmentation of the training data with virtual mono-energetic reconstructions from a
spectral CT scanner which show different attenuation levels of the contrast agent. We compare this
to an augmentation by linear scaling of all intensity values, and combine both types of augmentation.
We train a 3D fully convolutional network (FCN) with 10 conventional CCTA images and corresponding
virtual mono-energetic reconstructions acquired on a spectral CT scanner, and evaluate on 40 CCTA
scans acquired on a conventional CT scanner. We show that training with data augmentation using
virtual mono-energetic images improves upon training with only conventional images (Dice similarity
coefficient (DSC) 0.895 $\pm$ 0.039 vs. 0.846 $\pm$ 0.125). In comparison, training with data augmentation
using linear scaling improves the DSC to 0.890 $\pm$ 0.039. Moreover, combining the results of both
augmentation methods leads to a DSC of 0.901 $\pm$ 0.036, showing that both augmentations lead to
different local improvements of the segmentations. Our results indicate that virtual mono-energetic
images improve the generalization of an FCN used for myocardium segmentation in CCTA images.
