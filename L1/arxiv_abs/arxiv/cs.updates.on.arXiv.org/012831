CT perfusion (CTP) has been used to triage ischemic stroke patients in the early stage, because of
its speed, availability, and lack of contraindications. Perfusion parameters including cerebral
blood volume (CBV), cerebral blood flow (CBF), mean transit time (MTT) and time of peak (Tmax) could
also be computed from CTP data. However, CTP data or the perfusion parameters, are ambiguous to locate
the infarct core or tissue at risk (penumbra), which is normally confirmed by the follow-up Diffusion
Weighted Imaging (DWI) or perfusion diffusion mismatch. In this paper, we propose a novel generative
modelbased segmentation framework composed of an extractor, a generator and a segmentor for ischemic
stroke lesion segmentation. First, an extractor is used to directly extract the representative
feature images from the CTP feature images. Second, a generator is used to generate the clinical
relevant DWI images using the output from the extractor and perfusion parameters. Finally, the
segmentor is used to precisely segment the ischemic stroke lesion using the generated DWI from the
generator. Meanwhile, a novel pixel-region loss function, generalized dice combined with weighted
cross entropy, is used to handle data unbalance problem which is commonly encountered in medical
image segmentation. All networks are trained end-to-end from scratch using the 2018 Ischemic Stroke
Lesion Segmentation Challenge (ISLES) dataset and our method won the first place in the 2018 ischemic
stroke lesions segmentation challenge in the test stage.
