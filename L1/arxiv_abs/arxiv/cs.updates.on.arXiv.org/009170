When government agencies, research institutes, industries release individual-level data for
research and public use, the data is often perturbed in certain ways to provide some level of privacy
protection. The recently developed differentially private data synthesis (DIPS) methods are
built upon the concept of differential privacy and provides a strong mathematical privacy guarantee
while aiming to maintain the statistical utility of the released sanitized data. We introduce a
new DIPS algorithm, CIPHER, which generates differential private individual-level data from
a set of low-dimensional histograms via solving a set of linear equations with the Tikhonov ($l_2$)
regularization. CIPHER is conceptually very simple and requires nothing than decomposing joint
probabilities via basic provability rules to construct the equation set and subsequently solving
linear equations. CIPHER also has the ability to automatically "correct" for the inconsistency
arising from the differential private sanitization among the histograms that share at least one
common attributes. We compare CIPHER with the MWEM (multiplicative weighting via exponential
mechanism) and the full-dimensional histogram (FDH) sanitization through simulation and case
studies. The results demonstrate that CIPHER made significance improvements over MWEM in statistical
inferences, both of which aim to generate differentially private synthetic individual-level
data from a set of low-dimensional histograms. CIPHER also delivered similar performance as the
FDH sanitation for most of the examined privacy budget range.
