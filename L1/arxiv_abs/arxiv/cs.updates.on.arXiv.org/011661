In this paper, we study distributed graph algorithms in networks in which the nodes have a limited
communication capacity. Many distributed systems are built on top of an underlying networking
infrastructure, for example by using a virtual communication topology known as an overlay network.
Although this underlying network might allow each node to directly communicate with a large number
of other nodes, the amount of communication that a node can perform in a fixed amount of time is typically
much more limited. We introduce the Node-Capacitated Clique model as an abstract communication
model, which allows us to study the effect of nodes having limited communication capacity on the
complexity of distributed graph computations. In this model, the $n$ nodes of a network are connected
as a clique and communicate in synchronous rounds. In each round, every node can exchange messages
of $O(\log n)$ bits with at most $O(\log n)$ other nodes. When solving a graph problem, the input graph
$G$ is defined on the same set of $n$ nodes, where each node knows which other nodes are its neighbors
in $G$. To initiate research on the Node-Capacitated Clique model, we present distributed algorithms
for the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST), BFS Tree, Maximal Independent Set, Maximal Matching, and Vertex
Coloring problems. We show that even with only $O(\log n)$ concurrent interactions per node, the
MST problem can still be solved in polylogarithmic time. In all other cases, the runtime of our algorithms
depends linearly on the arboricity of $G$, which is a constant for many important graph families
such as planar graphs.
