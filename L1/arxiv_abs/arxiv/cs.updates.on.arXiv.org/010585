This paper tackles the problem of millimeter-Wave (mmWave) channel estimation in massive MIMO
communication systems. A new Bayes-optimal channel estimator is derived using recent advances
in the approximate belief propagation (BP) Bayesian inference paradigm. By leveraging the inherent
sparsity of the mmWave MIMO channel in the angular domain, we recast the underlying channel estimation
problem into that of reconstructing a compressible signal from a set of noisy linear measurements.
Then, the generalized approximate message passing (GAMP) algorithm is used to find the entries
of the unknown mmWave MIMO channel matrix. Unlike all the existing works on the same topic, we model
the angular-domain channel coefficients by Laplacian distributed random variables. Further,
we establish the closed-form expressions for the various statistical quantities that need to be
updated iteratively by GAMP. To render the proposed algorithm fully automated, we also develop
an expectation-maximization (EM) based procedure that can be easily embedded within GAMP's iteration
loop in order to learn all the unknown parameters of the underlying Bayesian inference problem.
Computer simulations show that the proposed combined EM-GAMP algorithm under a Laplacian prior
exhibits improvements both in terms of channel estimation accuracy, achievable rate, and computational
complexity as compared to the Gaussian mixture prior that has been advocated in the recent literature.
In addition, it is found that the Laplacian prior speeds up the convergence time of GAMP over the entire
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) range.
