In this work, we consider a new type of Fourier-like representation of Boolean function $f\colon\{+1,-1\}^n\to\{+1,-1\}$
\[ f(x) = \cos\left(\pi\sum_{S\subseteq[n]}\phi_S \prod_{i\in S} x_i\right). \] This representation,
which we call the periodic Fourier representation, of Boolean function is closely related to a certain
type of multipartite Bell inequalities and non-adaptive measurement-based quantum computation
with linear side-processing ($\mathrm{NMQC}_\oplus$). The minimum number of non-zero coefficients
in the above representation, which we call the periodic Fourier sparsity, is equal to the required
number of qubits for the exact computation of $f$ by $\mathrm{NMQC}_\oplus$. Periodic Fourier
representations are not unique, and can be directly obtained both from the Fourier representation
and the $\mathbb{F}_2$-polynomial representation. In this work, we first show that Boolean functions
related to $\mathbb{Z}/4\mathbb{Z}$-polynomial have small periodic Fourier sparsities. Second,
we show that the periodic Fourier sparsity is at least $2^{\mathrm{deg}_{\mathbb{F}_2}(f)}-1$,
which means that $\mathrm{NMQC}_\oplus$ efficiently computes a Boolean function $f$ if and only
if $\mathbb{F}_2$-degree of $f$ is small. Furthermore, we show that any symmetric Boolean function,
e.g., $\mathsf{AND}_n$, $\mathsf{Mod}^3_n$, $\mathsf{Maj}_n$, etc, can be exactly computed
by depth-2 $\mathrm{NMQC}_\oplus$ using a polynomial number of qubits, that implies exponential
gaps between $\mathrm{NMQC}_\oplus$ and depth-2 $\mathrm{NMQC}_\oplus$.
