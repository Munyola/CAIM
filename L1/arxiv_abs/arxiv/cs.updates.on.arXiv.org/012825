Opinion mining in outdoor images posted by users during day-to-day or leisure activities, for example,
can provide valuable information to better understand urban areas. In this work, we propose a framework
to classify the sentiment of outdoor images shared by users on social networks. We compare the performance
of state-of-the-art ConvNet architectures, namely, VGG-16, Resnet50, and InceptionV3, as well
as one specifically designed for sentiment analysis. The combination of such classifiers, a strategy
known as ensemble, is also considered. We also use different experimental setups to evaluate how
the merging of deep features and semantic information derived from the scene attributes can improve
classification performance. The evaluation explores a novel dataset, namely OutdoorSent, of
geolocalized urban outdoor images extracted from Instagram related to three sentiment polarities
(positive, negative, and neutral), as well as another dataset publicly available (DeepSent).
We observe that the incorporation of knowledge related to semantics features tend to improve the
accuracy of low-complex ConvNet architectures. Furthermore, we also demonstrated the applicability
of our results in the city of Chicago, United States, showing that they can help to understand the
subjective characteristics of different areas of the city. For instance, particular areas of the
city tend to concentrate more images of a specific class of sentiment. The ConvNet architectures,
trained models, and the proposed outdoor image dataset will be publicly available at this http URL
