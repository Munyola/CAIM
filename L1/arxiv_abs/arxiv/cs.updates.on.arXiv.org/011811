In the French flag problem, initially uncolored cells on a grid must differentiate to become blue,
white or red. The goal is for the cells to color the grid as a French flag, i.e., a three-colored triband,
in a distributed manner. To solve a generalized version of the problem in a distributed computational
setting, we consider two models: a biologically-inspired version that relies on morphogens (diffusing
proteins acting as chemical signals) and a more abstract version based on reliable message passing
between cellular agents. Much of developmental biology research has focused on concentration-based
approaches using morphogens, since morphogen gradients are thought to be an underlying mechanism
in tissue patterning. We show that both our model types easily achieve a French ribbon - a French flag
in the 1D case. However, extending the ribbon to the 2D flag in the concentration model is somewhat
difficult unless each agent has additional positional information. Assuming that cells are are
identical, it is impossible to achieve a French flag or even a close approximation. In contrast,
using a message-based approach in the 2D case only requires assuming that agents can be represented
as constant size state machines. We hope that our insights may lay some groundwork for what kind of
message passing abstractions or guarantees, if any, may be useful in analogy to cells communicating
at long and short distances to solve patterning problems. In addition, we hope that our models and
findings may be of interest in the design of nano-robots.
