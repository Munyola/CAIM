The downlink coordinated multipoint (CoMP) transmission system with non-orthogonal multiple
access (NOMA) is presented to enhance downlink capacity. Since perfect knowledge of a channel is
not always available in practice, imperfect channel state information (CSI) needs to be considered
in downlink CoMP with NOMA. In this paper, imperfect CSI is modeled with channel estimation error,
where a priori of variance of the error estimation is known. Instead of a specific number of coordinated
base stations (BSs), a downlink CoMP NOMA with $B$ coordinated BSs is proposed. Further, the ergodic
capacity of the cell-center user (CCU), and the cell-edge user (CEU), as well as their sum capacity
are analyzed, derived as closed forms, and validated by simulations in both perfect CSI and imperfect
CSI with channel estimation error. The result shows that CoMP NOMA outperforms the CoMP orthogonal
multiple access (OMA) capacity, where channel estimation error degrades the performance of both
CoMP NOMA and CoMP OMA. In CoMP NOMA, it is noted that the impact of channel estimation error is less
significant at CEU compared to that at CCU, due to the utilization of the incoming signals from all
the coordinated BSs. Additionally, by exploiting non-orthogonal channel, the sum capacity of
CoMP NOMA still can be improved with an increase in coordinated BSs. It is also demonstrated that
CEU needs to be allocated with much higher power than CCU to maintain their capacity simultaneously.
Finally, the performance analysis is successfully validated through the close accordance between
the analytical and simulation results.
