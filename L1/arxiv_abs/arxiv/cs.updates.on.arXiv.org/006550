Fuzzing is an automated application vulnerability detection method. For genetic algorithm-based
fuzzing, it can mutate the seed files provided by users to obtain a number of inputs, which are then
used to test the objective application in order to trigger potential crashes. As shown in existing
literature, the seed file selection is crucial for the efficiency of fuzzing. However, current
seed selection strategies do not seem to be better than randomly picking seed files. Therefore,
in this paper, we propose a novel and generic system, named SmartSeed, to generate seed files towards
efficient fuzzing. Specifically, SmartSeed is designed based on a machine learning model to learn
and generate high-value binary seeds. We evaluate SmartSeed along with American Fuzzy Lop (AFL)
on 12 open-source applications with the input formats of mp3, bmp or flv. We also combine SmartSeed
with different fuzzing tools to examine its compatibility. From extensive experiments, we find
that SmartSeed has the following advantages: First, it only requires tens of seconds to generate
sufficient high-value seeds. Second, it can generate seeds with multiple kinds of input formats
and significantly improves the fuzzing performance for most applications with the same input format.
Third, SmartSeed is compatible to different fuzzing tools. In total, our system discovers more
than twice unique crashes and 5,040 extra unique paths than the existing best seed selection strategy
for the evaluated 12 applications. From the crashes found by SmartSeed, we discover 16 new vulnerabilities
and have received their CVE IDs.
