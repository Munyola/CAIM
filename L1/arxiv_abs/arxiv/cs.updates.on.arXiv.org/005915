In our previous work we have shown that resistive cross point devices, so called Resistive Processing
Unit (RPU) devices, can provide significant power and speed benefits when training deep fully connected
networks as well as convolutional neural networks. In this work, we further extend the RPU concept
for training recurrent neural networks (RNNs) namely LSTMs. We show that the mapping of recurrent
layers is very similar to the mapping of fully connected layers and therefore the RPU concept can
potentially provide large acceleration factors for RNNs as well. In addition, we study the effect
of various device imperfections and system parameters on training performance. Symmetry of updates
becomes even more crucial for RNNs; already a few percent asymmetry results in an increase in the
test error compared to the ideal case trained with floating point numbers. Furthermore, the input
signal resolution to device arrays needs to be at least 7 bits for successful training. However,
we show that a stochastic rounding scheme can reduce the input signal resolution back to 5 bits. Further,
we find that RPU device variations and hardware noise are enough to mitigate overfitting, so that
there is less need for using dropout. We note that the models trained here are roughly 1500 times larger
than the fully connected network trained on MNIST dataset in terms of the total number of multiplication
and summation operations performed per epoch. Thus, here we attempt to study the validity of the
RPU approach for large scale networks.
