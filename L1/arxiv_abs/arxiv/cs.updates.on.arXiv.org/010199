Today, many public or private institutions provide professional food service for personnels working
in their own organizations. Regarding the planning of the said service, there are some obstacles
due to the fact that the number of the personnel working in the institutions is generally high and
the personnel are out of the institution due to personal or institutional reasons. Because of this,
it is difficult to determine the daily food demand, and this causes cost, time and labor loss for the
institutions. Statistical or heuristic methods are used to remove or at least minimize these losses.
In this study, an artificial intelligence model was proposed, which estimates the daily food demand
quantity using artificial neural networks for businesses. The data are obtained from a refectory
database of a private institution with a capacity of 110 people serving daily meals and serving at
different levels, covering the last two years (2016-2018). The model was created using the MATLAB
package program. The performance of the model was determinde by the Regression values, the Mean
Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) and the Mean Squared Error (MSE). In the training of the ANN model,
feed forward back propagation network architecture is used. The best model obtained as a result
of the experiments is a multi-layer (8-10-10-1) structure with a training R ratio of 0,9948, a testing
R ratio of 0,9830 and an error rate of 0,003783, respectively. Experimental results demonstrated
that the model has low error rate, high performance and positive effect of using artificial neural
networks for demand estimating.
