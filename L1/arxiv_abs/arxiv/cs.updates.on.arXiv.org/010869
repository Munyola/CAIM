Bandwidth hungry video content has become the dominant contributor to the data traffic world over.
Cellular networks are constantly evolving to meet the growing traffic demands. Over the past few
years, wireless multicast has been garnering a lot of attention as a means of efficient resource
utilization. Multicast transmission lets spectral resources to be shared between users streaming
the same content. Even though multicast transmission allows to serve multiple users on the same
resources, in order to serve all these users successfully, the base station cannot transmit the
content at a rate greater than that decodable by the user with the worst channel conditions. In this
paper, we propose a way to overcome this bottleneck. Video streaming services can sustain a certain
amount of packet loss without any significant degradation in the quality experienced by the users.
We leverage this loss tolerant nature of video streaming applications to improve the performance
of multicast video services in LTE and 5G. We convert the problem of resource allocation for loss
tolerant multicasting into the problem of stabilizing a queueing system. We then propose two throughput
optimal Maximum Weight (MW) policies that successfully stabilize the constructed queueing system.
However, brute force implementation of MW policies is mostly NP-hard. To overcome this, we propose
a maximum weight bipartite matching approach that results in a polynomial time implementation
of the proposed policies. We also evaluate the performance of our policies via extensive simulations.
