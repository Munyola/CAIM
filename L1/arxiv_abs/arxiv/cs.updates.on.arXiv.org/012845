Brakerski showed that linearly decryptable fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) schemes cannot
be secure in the chosen plaintext attack (CPA) model. In this paper, we show that linearly decryptable
FHE schemes cannot be secure even in the ciphertext only security model. Then we consider the maximum
security that a linearly decryptable FHE scheme could achieve. This paper designs fully homomorphic
symmetric key encryption (FHE) schemes without bootstrapping (that is, noise-free FHE schemes).
The proposed FHE schemes are based on quaternion/octonion algebra and Jordan algebra over finite
rings Z_n and are secure in the weak ciphertext-only security model assuming the hardness of solving
multivariate quadratic equation systems and solving univariate high degree polynomial equation
systems in Z_n. It is up to our knowledge that this is the first noise-free FHE scheme that has ever
been designed with a security proof (even in the weak ciphertext-only security model). It is argued
that the weak ciphertext-only security model is sufficient for various applications such as privacy
preserving computation in cloud. As an example, the proposed FHE schemes are used to construct obfuscated
programs. This example could be further used to show that the scheme presented in this paper could
be combined with existing FHE schemes with bootstrapping to obtain more efficient FHE schemes with
bootstrapping in the fully CPA model. At the end of the paper, we point out the insecurity of several
recently proposed noise-free FHE schemes.
