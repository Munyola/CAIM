The enormous efforts spent on collecting naturalistic driving data in the recent years has resulted
in an expansion of publicly available traffic datasets, which has the potential to assist the development
of the self-driving vehicles. However, we found that many of the attempts to utilize these datasets
have failed in practice due to a lack of usability concern from the organizations that host these
collected data. For example, extracting data associated with certain critical conditions from
naturalistic driving data organized in chronological order may not be convenient for a vehicle
engineer that doesn't have big data analytics experiences. To address the general usability challenges
of these publicly available traffic datasets, we propose TrafficNet, a large-scale and extensible
library of naturalistic driving scenarios, aiming at bridging the gap between research datasets
and practically usable information for vehicle engineers and researchers. The proposed web-based
driving scenario database preprocesses massive raw traffic data collected in chronological order
into an organized scenario-based dataset by applying a set of categorization algorithms to label
the naturalistic driving data with six different critical driving scenarios. TrafficNet opens
not only the scenario library but also the source code of these categorization methods to the public,
which will foster more sophisticated and accurate scenario-based categorization algorithms
to advance the intelligent transportation research. The source code and the scenario database
can be accessed at https://github.com/TrafficNet.
