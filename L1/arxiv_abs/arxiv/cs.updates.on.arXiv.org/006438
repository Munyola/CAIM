Modern applications significantly enhance user experience by adapting to each user's individual
condition and/or preferences. While this adaptation can greatly improve a user's experience or
be essential for the application to work, the exposure of user data to the application presents a
significant privacy threat to the users\textemdash even when the traces are anonymized (since
the statistical matching of an anonymized trace to prior user behavior can identify a user and their
habits). Because of the current and growing algorithmic and computational capabilities of adversaries,
provable privacy guarantees as a function of the degree of anonymization and obfuscation of the
traces are necessary. Our previous work has established the requirements on anonymization and
obfuscation in the case that data traces are independent between users. However, the data traces
of different users will be dependent in many applications, and an adversary can potentially exploit
such. In this paper, we consider the impact of correlation between user traces on their privacy.
First, we demonstrate that the adversary can readily identify the association graph, revealing
which user data traces are correlated. Next, we demonstrate that the adversary can use this association
graph to break user privacy with significantly shorter traces than in the case of independent users,
and that obfuscating data traces independently across users is often insufficient to remedy such
leakage. Finally, we discuss how users can employ data trace dependency to improve privacy by performing
better obfuscation.
