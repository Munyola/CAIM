Computation of the spherical harmonic rotation coefficients or elements of Wigner's d-matrix
is important in a number of quantum mechanics and mathematical physics applications. Particularly,
this is important for the Fast Multipole Methods in three dimensions for the Helmholtz, Laplace
and related equations, if rotation-based decomposition of translation operators are used. In
these and related problems related to representation of functions on a sphere via spherical harmonic
expansions computation of the rotation coefficients of large degree $n$ (of the order of thousands
and more) may be necessary. Existing algorithms for their computation, based on recursions, are
usually unstable, and do not extend to $n$. We develop a new recursion and study its behavior for large
degrees, via computational and asymptotic analyses. Stability of this recursion was studied based
on a novel application of the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy condition and the von Neumann method for
stability of finite-difference schemes for solution of PDEs. A recursive algorithm of minimal
complexity $O\left(n^{2}\right)$ for degree $n$ and FFT-based algorithms of complexity $O\left(n^{2}\log
n\right) $ suitable for computation of rotation coefficients of large degrees are proposed, studied
numerically, and cross-validated. It is shown that the latter algorithm can be used for $n\lesssim
10^{3}$ in double precision, while the former algorithm was tested for large $n$ (up to $10^{4}$
in our experiments) and demonstrated better performance and accuracy compared to the FFT-based
algorithm.
