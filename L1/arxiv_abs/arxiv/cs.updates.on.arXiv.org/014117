Internet of Things (IoT) systems in general consist of a lot of devices with massive connectivity.
Those devices are usually constrained with limited energy supply and can only operate at low power
and low rate. In this paper, we investigate a cellular-based IoT system combined with energy harvesting
and NOMA. We consider all base stations (BS) and IoT devices follow the Poisson Point Process (PPP)
distribution in a given area. The unit time slot is divided into two phases, energy harvesting phase
in downlink (DL) and data transmission phase in uplink (uplink). That is, IoT devices will first
harvest energy from all BS transmissions and then use the harvested energy to do the NOMA information
transmission. We define an energy harvesting circle within which all IoT devices can harvest enough
energy for NOMA transmission. The design objective is to maximize the total throughput in uplink
within the circle by varying the duration T of energy harvesting phase. In our work, we also consider
the inter-cell interference in the throughput calculation. The analysis of Probability Mass Function
(PMF) for IoT devices in the energy harvesting circle is also compared with simulation results.
It is shown that the BS density needs to be carefully set so that the IoT devices in the energy harvesting
circle receive relatively smaller interference and energy circles overlap only with a small probability.
Our simulations show that there exists an optimal T to achieve the maximum throughput. When the BSs
are densely deployed consequently the total throughput will decrease because of the interference.
