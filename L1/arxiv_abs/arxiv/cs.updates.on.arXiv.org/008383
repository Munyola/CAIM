Modern websites include various types of third-party content such as JavaScript, images, stylesheets,
and Flash objects in order to create interactive user interfaces. In addition to explicit inclusion
of third-party content by website publishers, ISPs and browser extensions are hijacking web browsing
sessions with increasing frequency to inject third-party content (e.g., ads). However, third-party
content can also introduce security risks to users of these websites, unbeknownst to both website
operators and users. Because of the often highly dynamic nature of these inclusions as well as the
use of advanced cloaking techniques in contemporary malware, it is exceedingly difficult to preemptively
recognize and block inclusions of malicious third-party content before it has the chance to attack
the user's system. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to achieving the goal of preemptive
blocking of malicious third-party content inclusion through an analysis of inclusion sequences
on the Web. We implemented our approach, called Excision, as a set of modifications to the Chromium
browser that protects users from malicious inclusions while web pages load. Our analysis suggests
that by adopting our in-browser approach, users can avoid a significant portion of malicious third-party
content on the Web. Our evaluation shows that Excision effectively identifies malicious content
while introducing a low false positive rate. Our experiments also demonstrate that our approach
does not negatively impact a user's browsing experience when browsing popular websites drawn from
the Alexa Top 500.
