We introduce a new approach that allows to analyze the performance of a wireless link under Hoyt (Nakagami-q)
fading in a very simple way. By exploiting the close relationship between the Hoyt distribution
and the Rice Ie-function, we demonstrate that the squared Hoyt distribution can be constructed
from a conditional exponential distribution. As a consequence, many performance metrics for Hoyt
fading can be calculated by leveraging well-known results for Rayleigh fading by just performing
a finite-range integral. We use this framework to obtain new results for some information and communication-theoretic
metrics in Hoyt fading channels: When analyzing the secrecy capacity of wireless Hoyt fading links
we show that the outage secrecy capacity is mainly dominated by the distribution of the SNR at Bob;
conversely, it becomes independent of the distribution of the SNR at Eve for sufficiently large
values of the average SNR at Bob. Then, we investigate the outage probability in Hoyt fading channels
in the presence of background noise and arbitrarily distributed interference; we observe how the
distribution of the interference impacts the outage probability for low and medium values of the
SINR, while it is the distribution of the desired link which has a dominant effect for large values
of the SINR. Finally, when studying the channel capacity for different transmission policies,
we observe that the capacity loss compared to Rayleigh fading is under 0.15 bps/Hz for $q>0.5$
when using optimum power and rate adaptation, or optimum rate adaptation with constant power.
