Cybersecurity and privacy are of the utmost importance for safe, reliable operation of the electric
grid. It is well known that the increased connectivity/interoperability between all stakeholders
(e.g., utilities, suppliers, and consumers) will enable personal information collection. Significant
advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) deployment and demand response (DR) programs across the
country, while enable enhanced automation, also generate energy data on individual consumers
that can potentially be used for exploiting privacy. Inspired by existing works which consider
DR, battery-based perturbation, and differential privacy noise adding, we novelly consider the
aggregator (cluster) level privacy issue in the DR framework of solar photovoltaic (PV) generation
following. Different from most of the existing works which mainly rely on the charging/discharging
scheduling of rechargeable batteries, we utilize controllable building loads to serve as virtual
storage devices to absorb a large portion of the PV generation while delicately keeping desired
noisy terms to satisfy the differential privacy for the raw load profiles at the aggregator level.
This not only ensures differential privacy, but also improves the DR efficiency in load following
since part of the noisy signal in solar PV generation has been filtered out. In particular, a mixed
integer quadratic optimization problem is formulated to optimally dispatch a population of on/off
controllable loads to achieve this privacy preserving DR service.
