In the field of swarm robotics, the design and implementation of spatial density control laws has
received much attention, with less emphasis being placed on performance evaluation. This work
fills that gap by introducing an error metric that provides a quantitative measure of coverage for
use with any control scheme. The proposed error metric is continuously sensitive to changes in the
swarm distribution, unlike commonly used discretization methods. We analyze the theoretical
and computational properties of the error metric and propose two benchmarks to which error metric
values can be compared. The first uses the realizable extrema of the error metric to compute the relative
error of an observed swarm distribution. We also show that the error metric extrema can be used to
help choose the swarm size and effective radius of each robot required to achieve a desired level
of coverage. The second benchmark compares the observed distribution of error metric values to
the probability density function of the error metric when robot positions are randomly sampled
from the target distribution. We demonstrate the utility of this benchmark in assessing the performance
of stochastic control algorithms. We prove that the error metric obeys a central limit theorem,
develop a streamlined method for performing computations, and place the standard statistical
tests used here on a firm theoretical footing. We provide rigorous theoretical development, computational
methodologies, numerical examples, and MATLAB code for both benchmarks.
