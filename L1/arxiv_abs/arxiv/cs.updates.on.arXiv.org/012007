We consider a distributed secret sharing system that consists of a dealer, $n$ storage nodes, and
$m$ users. Each user is given access to a certain subset of storage nodes, where it can download the
stored data. The dealer wants to securely convey a specific secret $s_j$ to user $j$ via storage nodes,
for $j=1,2,\dots,m$, in such a way that no user gets any information about other users' secrets in
an information-theoretic sense. To this end, the dealer encodes secrets into several secret shares
and loads them into the storage nodes. Given a certain number of storage nodes we find the maximum
number of users that can be served in such systems and construct schemes that achieve this. We further
define two major properties for such distributed secret sharing systems; \emph{communication
complexity} is defined as the total amount of data that users need to download in order to reconstruct
their secrets; and \emph{storage overhead} is defined as the total size of data loaded by the dealer
into the storage nodes normalized by the total size of secrets. Lower bounds on minimum communication
complexity and storage overhead are characterized given any $n$ and $m$. Furthermore, we construct
distributed secret sharing protocols, under certain conditions on the system parameters, that
simultaneously attain these lower bounds, thereby providing schemes that are optimal in terms
of both the communication complexity and the storage overhead. It is shown how to modify the proposed
protocols in order to construct schemes with \emph{balanced} storage load and communication complexity.
