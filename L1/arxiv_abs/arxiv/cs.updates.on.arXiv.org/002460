For a set $A$ of $n$ people and a set $B$ of $m$ items, with each person having a preference list that
ranks some items in order of preference, we consider the problem of matching every person with a unique
item. A matching $M$ is called \textit{popular} if for any other matching $M'$, the number of people
who prefer $M$ to $M'$ is not less than the number of those who prefer $M'$ to $M$. For given $n$ and $m$,
consider the probability of existence of a popular matching when each person's preference list
is independently and uniformly generated at random. Previously, Mahdian showed that in the case
that people's preference lists are \textit{strict} (containing no ties) and \textit{complete}
(containing all items in $B$), if $\alpha = m/n > \alpha_*$, where $\alpha_* \approx 1.42$ is the
root of equation $x^2 = e^{1/x}$, then a popular matching exists with probability $1-o(1)$; and
if $\alpha < \alpha_*$, then a popular matching exists with probability $o(1)$. The point $\alpha_*$
can be regarded as a transition point, at which the probability rises from asymptotically zero to
asymptotically one. In this paper, we investigate transition points in more general cases when
people's preference lists are not complete. In particular, we show that in the case that each person
has a preference list of length $k$, if $\alpha > \alpha_k$, where $\alpha_k \geq 1$ is the root of
equation $x e^{-1/2x} = 1-(1-e^{-1/x})^{k-1}$, then a popular matching exists with probability
$1-o(1)$; and if $\alpha < \alpha_k$, then a popular matching exists with probability $o(1)$.
