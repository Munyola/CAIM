The rapid growth of data in velocity, volume, value, variety, and veracity has enabled exciting
new opportunities and presented big challenges for businesses of all types. Recently, there has
been considerable interest in developing systems for processing continuous data streams with
the increasing need for real-time analytics for decision support in the business, healthcare,
manufacturing, and security. The analytics of streaming data usually relies on the output of offline
analytics on static or archived data. However, businesses and organizations like our industry
partner Gnowit, strive to provide their customers with real time market information and continuously
look for a unified analytics framework that can integrate both streaming and offline analytics
in a seamless fashion to extract knowledge from large volumes of hybrid streaming data. We present
our study on designing a multilevel streaming text data analytics framework by comparing leading
edge scalable open-source, distributed, and in-memory technologies. We demonstrate the functionality
of the framework for a use case of multilevel text analytics using deep learning for language understanding
and sentiment analysis including data indexing and query processing. Our framework combines Spark
streaming for real time text processing, the Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) deep learning model for
higher level sentiment analysis, and other tools for SQL-based analytical processing to provide
a scalable solution for multilevel streaming text analytics.
