Cloud providers usually offer diverse types of hardware for their users. Customers exploit this
option to deploy cloud instances featuring GPUs, FPGAs, architectures other than x86 (e.g., ARM,
IBM Power8), or featuring certain specific extensions (e.g, Intel SGX). We consider in this work
the instances used by customers to deploy containers, nowadays the de facto standard for micro-services,
or to execute computing tasks. In doing so, the underlying container orchestrator (e.g., Kubernetes)
should be designed so as to take into account and exploit this hardware diversity. In addition, besides
the feature range provided by different machines, there is an often overlooked diversity in the
energy requirements introduced by hardware heterogeneity, which is simply ignored by default
container orchestrator's placement strategies. We introduce HEATS, a new task-oriented and energy-aware
orchestrator for containerized applications targeting heterogeneous clusters. HEATS allows
customers to trade performance vs. energy requirements. Our system first learns the performance
and energy features of the physical hosts. Then, it monitors the execution of tasks on the hosts and
opportunistically migrates them onto different cluster nodes to match the customer-required
deployment trade-offs. Our HEATS prototype is implemented within Google's Kubernetes. The evaluation
with synthetic traces in our cluster indicate that our approach can yield considerable energy savings
(up to 8.5%) and only marginally affect the overall runtime of deployed tasks (by at most 7%). HEATS
is released as open-source.
