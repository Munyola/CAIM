Analyzing contention for resources in a cluster computing environment accurately is critical
in order to understand the performance interferences faced by a query due to concurrent query executions,
and to better manage the workload in the cluster. Today no tools exist to help an admin perform a deep
analysis of resource contentions taking into account the complex interactions among different
queries, their stages, and tasks in a shared cluster. In this paper, we present ProtoXplore - a Proto
or first system to eXplore the interactions between concurrent queries in a shared cluster. We construct
a multi-level directed acyclic graph called ProtoGraph to formally capture different types of
explanations that link the performance of concurrent queries. In particular, (a) we designate
the components of a query's lost (wait) time as Immediate Explanations towards its observed performance,
(b) represent the rate of contention per machine as Deep Explanations, and (c) assign responsibility
to concurrent queries through Blame Explanations. We develop new metrics to accurately quantify
the impact and distribute the blame among concurrent queries. We perform an extensive experimental
evaluation using ProtoXplore to analyze the query interactions of TPCDS queries on Apache Spark
using microbenchmarks illustrating the effectiveness of our approach, and illustrate how the
output from ProtoXplore can be used by alternate scheduling and task placement strategies to help
improve the performance of affected queries in recurring executions.
