Recent work suggests that people are not solely motivated by the economic consequences of the available
actions, but they also have moral preferences for "doing the right thing", independently of its
economic consequences. However, it remains unclear in what situations moral preferences can be
activated by simply changing the framing of a decision problem. For example, earlier work proposed
that moral preferences can account for framing effects in the Dictator game. However, more recent
work has casted doubts on the very existence of framing effects in this game. Here we shed light on
this point with two experiments. In Study 1 ($N=567$) we implement an extreme Dictator game in which
dictators either get \$0.50 and another person gets nothing, or the opposite (i.e., the other person
gets \$0.50 and the dictator gets nothing). We experimentally manipulate the words describing
the available actions using six words, from very negative (e.g., stealing) to very positive (e.g.,
donating) connotations. As we predicted, we find that the rate of pro-sociality is affected by the
words used to describe the available actions. In Study 2 ($N=413$, pre-registered) we collect the
self-reported moral judgment and feeling associated to each of the six words used in Study 1. We show
that these moral judgments and feelings can explain the framing effects in Study 1. In sum, we find
that changing only one word in the instructions of an extreme Dictator game can alter people's behavior,
and that behavioral changes can be explained using moral judgments and feelings associated to these
words.
