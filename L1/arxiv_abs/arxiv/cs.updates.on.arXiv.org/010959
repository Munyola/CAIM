Unit commitment and load dispatch problems are important and complex problems in power system operations
that have being traditionally solved separately. In this paper, both problems are solved together
without approximations or simplifications. In fact, the problem solved has a massive amount of
grid-connected photovoltaic units, four pump-storage hydro plants as energy storage units and
ten thermal power plants, each with its own set of operation requirements that need to be satisfied.
To face such a complex constrained optimization problem an adaptive repair method is proposed.
By including a given repair method itself as a parameter to be optimized, the proposed adaptive repair
method avoid any bias in repair choices. Moreover, this results in a repair method that adapt to the
problem and will improve together with the solution during optimization. Experiments are conducted
revealing that the proposed method is capable of surpassing exact method solutions on a simplified
version of the problem with approximations as well as solve the otherwise intractable complete
problem without simplifications. Moreover, since the proposed approach can be applied to other
problems in general and it may not be obvious how to choose the constraint handling for a certain constraint,
a guideline is provided explaining the reasoning behind. Thus, this paper open further possibilities
to deal with the ever changing types of generation units and other similarly complex operation/schedule
optimization problems with many difficult constraints.
