With a view towards understanding why undesirable outcomes often arise in ICT projects, we draw
attention to three aspects in this essay. First, we present several examples to show that incorporating
an ethical framework in the design of an ICT system is not sufficient in itself, and that ethics need
to guide the deployment and ongoing management of the projects as well. We present a framework that
brings together the objectives, design, and deployment management of ICT projects as being shaped
by a common underlying ethical system. Second, we argue that power-based equality should be incorporated
as a key underlying ethical value in ICT projects, to ensure that the project does not reinforce inequalities
in power relationships between the actors directly or indirectly associated with the project.
We present a method to model ICT projects to make legible its influence on the power relationships
between various actors in the ecosystem. Third, we discuss that the ethical values underlying any
ICT project ultimately need to be upheld by the project teams, where certain factors like political
ideologies or dispersed teams may affect the rigour with which these ethical values are followed.
These three aspects of having an ethical underpinning to the design and management of ICT projects,
the need for having a power-based equality principle for ICT projects, and the importance of socialization
of the project teams, needs increasing attention in today's age of ICT platforms where millions
and billions of users interact on the same platform but which are managed by only a few people.
