Since it takes time and effort to put a new product or service on the market, one would like to predict
whether it will be a success. In general this is not possible, but it is possible to follow best practices
in order to maximise the chance of success. A smart contract is intended to encode business logic
and is therefore at the heart of every new business on the Ethereum blockchain. We have investigated
how to measure the success of smart contracts, and whether successful smart contracts have characteristics
that less successful smart contracts lack. The appearance of a smart contract on a listing website
such as Etherscan or StateoftheDapps is such a characteristic. In this paper, we present a three-pronged
analysis of the relative success of listed smart contracts. First, we have used statistical analysis
on the publicly visible transaction history of the Ethereum blockchain to determine that listed
contracts are significantly more successful than their unlisted counterparts. Next, we have conducted
a survey among more than 200 developers via an anonymous online survey about their experience with
the listing process. A significant majority of respondents do not believe that listing a contract
itself contributes to its success, but they believe that the extra attention that is typically paid
in tandem with the listing process does contribute. Finally, based on the respondents' answers,
we have drafted 10 recommendations for developers and validated them by submitting them to an international
panel of experts.
