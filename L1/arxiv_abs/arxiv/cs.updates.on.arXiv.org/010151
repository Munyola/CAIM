Software defined networking (SDN) promises unprecedented flexibility and ease of network operations.
While flexibility is an important factor when leveraging advantages of a new technology, critical
infrastructure networks also have stringent requirements on network robustness and control plane
delays. Robustness in the SDN control plane is realized by deploying multiple distributed controllers,
formed into clusters for durability and fast-failover purposes. However, the effect of the controller
clustering on the total system response time is not well investigated in current literature. Hence,
in this work we provide a detailed analytical study of the distributed consensus algorithm RAFT,
implemented in OpenDaylight and ONOS SDN controller platforms. In those controllers, RAFT implements
the data-store replication, leader election after controller failures and controller state recovery
on successful repairs. To evaluate its performance, we introduce a framework for numerical analysis
of various SDN cluster organizations w.r.t. their response time and availability metrics. We use
Stochastic Activity Networks for modeling the RAFT operations, failure injection and cluster
recovery processes, and using real-world experiments, we collect the rate parameters to provide
realistic inputs for a representative cluster recovery model. We also show how a fast rejuvenation
mechanism for the treatment of failures induced by software errors can minimize the total response
time experienced by the controller clients, while guaranteeing a higher system availability in
the long-term.
