Probabilistic inversion within a multiple-point statistics framework is still computationally
prohibitive for large-scale problems. To partly address this, we introduce and evaluate a new training-image
based simulation and inversion approach for complex geologic media. Our approach relies on a deep
neural network of the spatial generative adversarial network (SGAN) type. After training using
a training image (TI), our proposed SGAN can quickly generate 2D and 3D unconditional realizations.
A key feature of our SGAN is that it defines a (very) low-dimensional parameterization, thereby
allowing for efficient probabilistic (or deterministic) inversion using state-of-the-art Markov
chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. A series of 2D and 3D categorical TIs is first used to analyze the
performance of our SGAN for unconditional simulation. The speed at which realizations are generated
makes it especially useful for simulating over large grids and/or from a complex multi-categorical
TI. Subsequently, synthetic inversion case studies involving 2D steady-state flow and 3D transient
hydraulic tomography are used to illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed SGAN-based probabilistic
inversion. For the 2D case, the inversion rapidly explores the posterior model distribution. For
the 3D case, the inversion recovers model realizations that fit the data close to the target level
and visually resemble the true model well. Future work will focus on the inclusion of direct conditioning
data and application to continuous TIs.
