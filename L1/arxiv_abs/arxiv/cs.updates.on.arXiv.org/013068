The emulation task of a nonlinear autoregressive moving average model, i.e., the NARMA10 task,
has been widely used as a benchmark task for recurrent neural networks, especially in reservoir
computing. However, the type and quantity of computational capabilities required to emulate the
NARMA10 model remain unclear, and, to date, the NARMA10 task has been utilized blindly. Therefore,
in this study, we have investigated the properties of the NARMA10 model from a dynamical system perspective.
We revealed its bifurcation structure and basin of attraction, as well as the system's Lyapunov
spectra. Furthermore, we have analyzed the computational capabilities required to emulate the
NARMA10 model by decomposing it into multiple combinations of orthogonal nonlinear polynomials
using Legendre polynomials, and we directly evaluated its information processing capacity together
with its dependences on some system parameters. The result demonstrates that the NARMA10 model
contains an unstable region in the phase space that makes the system diverge according to the selection
of the input range and initial conditions. Furthermore, the information processing capacity of
the model varies according to the input range. These properties prevent safe application of this
model and fair comparisons among experiments, which are unfavorable for a benchmark task. As a result,
we propose a benchmark model that can clearly evaluate equivalent computational capacity using
NARMA10. Compared to the original NARMA10 model, the proposed model is highly stable and robust
against the input range settings.
