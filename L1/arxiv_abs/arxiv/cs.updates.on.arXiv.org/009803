In this work, we propose a new data visualization and clustering technique for discovering discriminative
structures in high-dimensional data. This technique, referred to as cPCA++, utilizes the fact
that the interesting features of a "target" dataset may be obscured by high variance components
during traditional PCA. By analyzing what is referred to as a "background" dataset (i.e., one that
exhibits the high variance principal components but not the interesting structures), our technique
is capable of efficiently highlighting the structure that is unique to the "target" dataset. Similar
to another recently proposed algorithm called "contrastive PCA" (cPCA), the proposed cPCA++ method
identifies important dataset specific patterns that are not detected by traditional PCA in a wide
variety of settings. However, the proposed cPCA++ method is significantly more efficient than
cPCA, because it does not require the parameter sweep in the latter approach. We applied the cPCA++
method to the problem of image splicing localization. In this application, we utilize authentic
edges as the background dataset and the spliced edges as the target dataset. The proposed method
is significantly more efficient than state-of-the-art methods, as the former does not require
iterative updates of filter weights via stochastic gradient descent and backpropagation, nor
the training of a classifier. Furthermore, the cPCA++ method is shown to provide performance scores
comparable to the state-of-the-art Multi-task Fully Convolutional Network (MFCN).
