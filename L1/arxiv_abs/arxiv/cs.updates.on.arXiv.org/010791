Recently, edge caching and multicasting arise as two promising technologies to support high-data-rate
and low-latency delivery in wireless communication networks. In this paper, we design three transmission
schemes aiming to minimize the delivery latency for cache-enabled multigroup multicasting networks.
In particular, full caching bulk transmission scheme is first designed as a performance benchmark
for the ideal situation where the caching capability of each enhanced remote radio head (eRRH) is
sufficient large to cache all files. For the practical situation where the caching capability of
each eRRH is limited, we further design two transmission schemes, namely partial caching bulk transmission
(PCBT) and partial caching pipelined transmission (PCPT) schemes. In the PCBT scheme, eRRHs first
fetch the uncached requested files from the baseband unit (BBU) and then all requested files are
simultaneously transmitted to the users. In the PCPT scheme, eRRHs first transmit the cached requested
files while fetching the uncached requested files from the BBU. Then, the remaining cached requested
files and fetched uncached requested files are simultaneously transmitted to the users. The design
goal of the three transmission schemes is to minimize the delivery latency, subject to some practical
constraints. Efficient algorithms are developed for the low-latency cloud-edge coordinated
transmission strategies. Numerical results are provided to evaluate the performance of the proposed
transmission schemes and show that the PCPT scheme outperforms the PCBT scheme in terms of the delivery
latency criterion.
