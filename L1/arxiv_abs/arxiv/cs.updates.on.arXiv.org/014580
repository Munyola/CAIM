Monitoring gas turbine combustors health, in particular, early detecting abnormal behaviors
and incipient faults, is critical in ensuring gas turbines operating efficiently and in preventing
costly unplanned maintenance. One popular means of detecting combustor abnormalities is through
continuously monitoring exhaust gas temperature profiles. Over the years many anomaly detection
technologies have been explored for detecting combustor faults, however, the performance (detection
rate) of anomaly detection solutions fielded is still inadequate. Advanced technologies that
can improve detection performance are in great need. Aiming for improving anomaly detection performance,
in this paper we introduce recently-developed deep learning (DL) in machine learning into the combustors
anomaly detection application. Specifically, we use deep learning to hierarchically learn features
from the sensor measurements of exhaust gas temperatures. And we then use the learned features as
the input to a neural network classifier for performing combustor anomaly detection. Since such
deep learned features potentially better capture complex relations among all sensor measurements
and the underlying combustor behavior than handcrafted features do, we expect the learned features
can lead to a more accurate and robust anomaly detection. Using the data collected from a real-world
gas turbine combustion system, we demonstrated that the proposed deep learning based anomaly detection
significantly indeed improved combustor anomaly detection performance.
