Model predictive control (MPC) has become one of the well-established modern control methods for
three-phase inverters with an output LC filter, where a high-quality voltage with low total harmonic
distortion (THD) is needed. Though it is an intuitive controller easy to understand and implement,
it has the significant disadvantage of requiring a large number of online calculations for solving
the optimization problem. On the other hand, the application of model-free approaches such as artificial
neural network-based (ANN-based) approaches is currently growing rapidly in the area of power
electronics and drives. This paper presents a new control scheme for a two-level converter based
on combining MPC with feed-forward ANN, with the aim of getting lower THD and improving the steady
and dynamic performance of the system for different types of loads. First, MPC is used, as an expert,
in the training phase to generate data required for training the proposed neural network. Then,
once the neural network is fine-tuned, it can be successfully used online for voltage tracking purpose,
without the need of using MPC. The proposed ANN-based control strategy is validated through simulation,
using MATLAB/Simulink tools, taking into account different loads conditions. Moreover, the performance
of the ANN-based controller is evaluated, on several samples of linear and non-linear loads under
various operating conditions, and compared to that of MPC, demonstrating the excellent steady-state
and dynamic performance of the proposed ANN-based control strategy.
