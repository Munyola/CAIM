To study the dynamical behaviour of the engineering and physical systems, we often need to capture
their continuous behaviour, which is modeled using differential equations, and perform the frequency-domain
analysis of these systems. Traditionally, Fourier transform methods are used to perform this frequency
domain analysis using paper-and-pencil based analytical techniques or computer simulations.
However, both of these methods are error prone and thus are not suitable for analyzing systems used
in safety-critical domains, like medicine and transportation. In order to provide an accurate
alternative, we propose to use higher-order-logic theorem proving to conduct the frequency domain
analysis of these systems. For this purpose, the paper presents a higher-order-logic formalization
of Fourier transform using the HOL-Light theorem prover. In particular, we use the higher-order-logic
based formalizations of differential, integral, transcendental and topological theories of
multivariable calculus to formally define Fourier transform and reason about the correctness
of its classical properties, such as existence, linearity, time shifting, frequency shifting,
modulation, time scaling, time reversal and differentiation in time domain, and its relationships
with Fourier Cosine, Fourier Sine and Laplace transforms. We use our proposed formalization for
the formal verification of the frequency response of a generic n-order linear system, an audio equalizer
and a MEMs accelerometer, using the HOL-Light theorem prover.
