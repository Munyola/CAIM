Local geometric descriptors remain an essential component for 3D rigid data matching and fusion.
The devise of a rotational invariant local geometric descriptor usually consists of two steps:
local reference frame (LRF) construction and feature representation. Existing evaluation efforts
have mainly been paid on the LRF or the overall descriptor, yet the quantitative comparison of feature
representations remains unexplored. This paper fills this gap by comprehensively evaluating
nine state-of-the-art local geometric feature representations. Our evaluation is on the ground
that ground-truth LRFs are leveraged such that the ranking of tested feature representations are
more convincing as opposed to existing studies. The experiments are deployed on six standard datasets
with various application scenarios (shape retrieval, point cloud registration, and object recognition)
and data modalities (LiDAR, Kinect, and Space Time) as well as perturbations including Gaussian
noise, shot noise, data decimation, clutter, occlusion, and limited overlap. The evaluated terms
cover the major concerns for a feature representation, e.g., distinctiveness, robustness, compactness,
and efficiency. The outcomes present interesting findings that may shed new light on this community
and provide complementary perspectives to existing evaluations on the topic of local geometric
feature description. A summary of evaluated methods regarding their peculiarities is also presented
to guide real-world applications and new descriptor crafting.
