In this paper we investigate the aesthetic image classification problem, also known as automatically
classifying an image into low or high aesthetic quality, which is quite a challenging problem. Considering
both the local and global information of images is quite important for image aesthetic quality assessment.
Currently, a powerful inception module is proposed which shows very high performance in object
classification. We have the observation that the inception module has the ability of considering
both the local and global features in nature. Thus, in this paper, we propose a novel DCNN structure
codenamed ILGNet for image aesthetics classification, which introduces the Inception module
and connects intermediate Local layers to the Global layer for the output. In addition, the ILGNet
is derived from part of the GoogLeNet. Thus, we can easily use a pre-trained image classification
GoogleLeNet model on the ImageNet dataset and fine tune our connected local and global layer on the
large scale aesthetics assessment AVA dataset. The experimental results show that the proposed
ILGNet outperforms the state of the art results in image aesthetics assessment in the AVA benchmark.
The time cost of both training and test of the ILGNet are significantly less than those of full GoogLeNet
with only a little reduction of the classification accuracy. Our ILGNet can achieve similar classification
accuracy as that of 2/3 GoogLeNet, whose computational cost is nearly twice of ours. This makes the
aesthetic assessment model more easily to be integrated into mobile and embedded systems.
