Deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) are powerful models that yield impressive results
at object classification. However, recent work has shown that they do not generalize well to partially
occluded objects and to mask attacks. In contrast to DCNNs, compositional models are robust to partial
occlusion, however, they are not as discriminative as deep models. In this work, we integrate DCNNs
and compositional object models to retain the best of both approaches: a discriminative model that
is robust to partial occlusion and mask attacks. Our model is learned in two steps. First, a standard
DCNN is trained for image classification. Subsequently, we cluster the DCNN features into dictionaries.
We show that the dictionary components resemble object part detectors and learn the spatial distribution
of parts for each object class. We propose mixtures of compositional models to account for large
changes in the spatial activation patterns (e.g. due to changes in the 3D pose of an object). At runtime,
an image is first classified by the DCNN in a feedforward manner. The prediction uncertainty is used
to detect partially occluded objects, which in turn are classified by the compositional model.
Our experimental results demonstrate that such compositional convolutional networks resolve
a fundamental problem of current deep learning approaches to computer vision: They recognize occluded
objects with exceptional performance, even when they have not been exposed to occluded objects
during training, while at the same time maintaining high discriminative performance for non-occluded
objects.
