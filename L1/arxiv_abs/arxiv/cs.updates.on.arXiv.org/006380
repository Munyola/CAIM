This two-part paper considers the strategic topology switching for the second-order multi-agent
systems under a special class of stealthy attacks, namely the "zero-dynamics" attack. The main
mathematical tool proposed here to prevent such attacks is strategically switching the network
topology to detect a possible zero-dynamics attack. However, it is not clear a priori that such a
switching strategy will simplify control protocol and still yield consensus, while maintaining
the advantages of traditional control protocols, in this switched system in the normal (un-attacked)
operation mode. In Part I, we propose a strategy on switching times that enables the strategic topology-switching
algorithm proposed in Part II~\cite{mao2017strategic} to reach the second-order consensus in
the absence of a zero-dynamics attack. The control protocol introduced is governed only by the relative
positions of agents. Based on the stability of switched linear systems with unstable subsystems,
and the property of the multi-agent systems under fixed topology, the strategy on dwell time of topology-switching
signal is derived. Employing this strategy, a decentralized time-dependent topology-switching
algorithm is proposed. The primary advantages of the proposed algorithm are: (i) the control protocol
relies only on relative position measurements (no velocity measurements are needed); (ii) it does
not impose any constraint on the magnitudes of coupling weights. The aforementioned theoretical
results are supported by the numerical evidence obtained via simulations.
