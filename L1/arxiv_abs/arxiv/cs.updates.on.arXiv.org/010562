To efficiently support safety-related vehicular applications, the ultra-reliable and low-latency
communication (URLLC) concept has become an indispensable component of vehicular networks (VNETs).
Due to the high mobility of VNETs, exchanging near-instantaneous channel state information (CSI)
and making reliable resource allocation decisions based on such short-term CSI evaluations are
not practical. In this paper, we consider the downlink of a vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) system
conceived for URLLC based on idealized perfect and realistic imperfect CSI. By exploiting the benefits
of the massive MIMO concept, a two-stage radio resource allocation problem is formulated based
on a novel twin-timescale perspective for avoiding the frequent exchange of near-instantaneous
CSI. Specifically, based on the prevalent road-traffic density, Stage 1 is constructed for minimizing
the worst-case transmission latency on a long-term timescale. In Stage 2, the base station allocates
the total power at a short-term timescale according to the large-scale fading CSI encountered for
minimizing the maximum transmission latency across all vehicular users. Then, a primary algorithm
and a secondary algorithm are conceived for our V2I URLLC system to find the optimal solution of the
twin-timescale resource allocation problem, with special emphasis on the complexity imposed.
Finally, our simulation results show that the proposed resource allocation scheme significantly
reduces the maximum transmission latency, and it is not sensitive to the fluctuation of road-traffic
density.
