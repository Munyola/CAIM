Principal skewness analysis (PSA) has been introduced for feature extraction in hyperspectral
imagery. As a third-order generalization of principal component analysis (PCA), its solution
of searching for the locally maximum skewness direction is transformed into the problem of calculating
the eigenpairs (the eigenvalues and the corresponding eigenvectors) of a coskewness tensor. By
combining a fixed-point method with an orthogonal constraint, it can prevent the new eigenpairs
from converging to the same maxima that has been determined before. However, the eigenvectors of
the supersymmetric tensor are not inherently orthogonal in general, which implies that the results
obtained by the search strategy used in PSA may unavoidably deviate from the actual eigenpairs.
In this paper, we propose a new nonorthogonal search strategy to solve this problem and the new algorithm
is named nonorthogonal principal skewness analysis (NPSA). The contribution of NPSA lies in the
finding that the search space of the eigenvector to be determined can be enlarged by using the orthogonal
complement of the Kronecker product of the previous one, instead of its orthogonal complement space.
We give a detailed theoretical proof to illustrate why the new strategy can result in the more accurate
eigenpairs. In addition, after some algebraic derivations, the complexity of the presented algorithm
is also greatly reduced. Experiments with both simulated data and real multi/hyperspectral imagery
demonstrate its validity in feature extraction.
