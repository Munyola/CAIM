Planning the motion for humanoid robots is a computationally-complex task due to the high dimensionality
of the system. Thus, a common approach is to first plan in the low-dimensional space induced by the
robot's feet---a task referred to as footstep planning. This low-dimensional plan is then used
to guide the full motion of the robot. One approach that has proven successful in footstep planning
is using search-based planners such as A* and its many variants. To do so, these search-based planners
have to be endowed with effective heuristics to efficiently guide them through the search space.
However, designing effective heuristics is a time-consuming task that requires the user to have
good domain knowledge. Thus, our goal is to be able to effectively plan the footstep motions taken
by a humanoid robot while obviating the burden on the user to carefully design local-minima free
heuristics. To this end, we propose to use user-defined homotopy classes in the workspace that are
intuitive to define. These homotopy classes are used to automatically generate heuristic functions
that efficiently guide the footstep planner. Additionally, we present an extension to homotopy
classes such that they are applicable to complex multi-level environments. We compare our approach
for footstep planning with a standard approach that uses a heuristic common to footstep planning.
In simple scenarios, the performance of both algorithms is comparable. However, in more complex
scenarios our approach allows for a speedup in planning of several orders of magnitude when compared
to the standard approach.
