Very expensive problems are very common in practical system that one fitness evaluation costs several
hours or even days. Surrogate assisted evolutionary algorithms (SAEAs) have been widely used to
solve this crucial problem in the past decades. However, most studied SAEAs focus on solving problems
with a budget of at least ten times of the dimension of problems which is unacceptable in many very
expensive real-world problems. In this paper, we employ Voronoi diagram to boost the performance
of SAEAs and propose a novel framework named Voronoi-based efficient surrogate assisted evolutionary
algorithm (VESAEA) for very expensive problems, in which the optimization budget, in terms of fitness
evaluations, is only 5 times of the problem's dimension. In the proposed framework, the Voronoi
diagram divides the whole search space into several subspace and then the local search is operated
in some potentially better subspace. Additionally, in order to trade off the exploration and exploitation,
the framework involves a global search stage developed by combining leave-one-out cross-validation
and radial basis function surrogate model. A performance selector is designed to switch the search
dynamically and automatically between the global and local search stages. The empirical results
on a variety of benchmark problems demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly outperforms
several state-of-art algorithms with extremely limited fitness evaluations. Besides, the efficacy
of Voronoi-diagram is furtherly analyzed, and the results show its potential to optimize very expensive
problems.
