How to efficiently identify multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) linear parameter-varying
(LPV) discrete-time state-space (SS) models with affine dependence on the scheduling variable
still remains an open question, as identification methods proposed in the literature suffer heavily
from the curse of dimensionality and/or depend on over-restrictive approximations of the measured
signal behaviors. However, obtaining an SS model of the targeted system is crucial for many LPV control
synthesis methods, as these synthesis tools are almost exclusively formulated for the aforementioned
representation of the system dynamics. Therefore, in this paper, we tackle the problem by combining
state-of-the-art LPV input-output (IO) identification methods with an LPV-IO to LPV-SS realization
scheme and a maximum likelihood refinement step. The resulting modular LPV-SS identification
approach achieves statical efficiency with a relatively low computational load. The method contains
the following three steps: 1) estimation of the Markov coefficient sequence of the underlying system
using correlation analysis or Bayesian impulse response estimation, then 2) LPV-SS realization
of the estimated coefficients by using a basis reduced Ho-Kalman method, and 3) refinement of the
LPV-SS model estimate from a maximum-likelihood point of view by a gradient-based or an expectation-maximization
optimization methodology. The effectiveness of the full identification scheme is demonstrated
by a Monte Carlo study where our proposed method is compared to existing schemes for identifying
a MIMO LPV system.
