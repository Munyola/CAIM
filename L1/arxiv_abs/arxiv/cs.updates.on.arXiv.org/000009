The collection and storage of user data by third-party agents raises privacy considerations that
often constrain data sharing. Most work in privacy-aware data sharing has considered disclosing
privacy preserving summaries of data where aggregate information about the data is preserved.
However, there are applications, including online advertising and crowdsourcing markets, where
fine-grained information must be published. We consider a different data sharing paradigm where
a dataset needs to be distributed across multiple third-parties. We address the problem of privacy-aware
data partitioning, namely, the problem of splitting a sensitive dataset among k untrusted parties
(adversaries). The goal is to maximize the utility derived by partitioning and distributing the
dataset, while minimizing the sensitive information disclosed. The partitioning should allow
no additional inferences to be drawn about private information by linking together multiple pieces
of data. We formally define the problem of privacy-aware data partitioning over k adversaries assuming
no collusion, and propose a novel data sharing scheme that minimizes the inferences each party can
draw. We show that solving the problem is, in general, NP-hard, but for specific families of information
disclosure functions, good approximate solutions can be found using relaxation techniques. Finally,
we present a greedy randomized local search algorithm for solving the problem for generic families
of information disclosure functions and provide an experimental evaluation of the different techniques
presented in the paper.
