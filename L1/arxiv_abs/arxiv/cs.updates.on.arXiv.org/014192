The architecture described in this paper encodes a theory of intentions based on the the key principles
of non-procrastination, persistence, and automatically limiting reasoning to relevant knowledge
and observations. The architecture reasons with transition diagrams of any given domain at two
different resolutions, with the fine-resolution description defined as a refinement of, and hence
tightly-coupled to, a coarse-resolution description. Non-monotonic logical reasoning with
the coarse-resolution description computes an activity (i.e., plan) comprising abstract actions
for any given goal. Each abstract action is implemented as a sequence of concrete actions by automatically
zooming to and reasoning with the part of the fine-resolution transition diagram relevant to the
current coarse-resolution transition and the goal. Each concrete action in this sequence is executed
using probabilistic models of the uncertainty in sensing and actuation, and the corresponding
fine-resolution outcomes are used to infer coarse-resolution observations that are added to the
coarse-resolution history. The architecture's capabilities are evaluated in the context of a
simulated robot assisting humans in an office domain, on a physical robot (Baxter) manipulating
tabletop objects, and on a wheeled robot (Turtlebot) moving objects to particular places or people.
The experimental results indicate improvements in reliability and computational efficiency
compared with an architecture that does not include the theory of intentions, and an architecture
that does not include zooming for fine-resolution reasoning.
