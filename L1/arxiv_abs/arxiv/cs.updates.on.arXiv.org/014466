This document is one of the deliverable reports created for the ESCAPE project. ESCAPE stands for
Energy-efficient Scalable Algorithms for Weather Prediction at Exascale. The project develops
world-class, extreme-scale computing capabilities for European operational numerical weather
prediction and future climate models. This is done by identifying Weather & Climate dwarfs which
are key patterns in terms of computation and communication (in the spirit of the Berkeley dwarfs).
These dwarfs are then optimised for different hardware architectures (single and multi-node)
and alternative algorithms are explored. Performance portability is addressed through the use
of domain specific languages. Atlas has been presented in deliverable D1.3. With this deliverable
D2.3, a first version of the Atlas software libraries is publicly released with a permissive open-source
license. The software is freely available for download, and contains a user guide and installation
instructions. The Atlas libraries have been carefully designed with the user's perspective in
mind. Even though Atlas is mainly coded in C++, an equivalent Fortran interface is presented without
additional runtime overhead. The Fortran interfaces are provided to accommodate existing NWP
and climate models that typically consist of Fortran subroutines. The mixed Fortran/C++ design
enhances interoperability between NWP and climate models and novel data management techniques.
Atlas provides interoperability with accelerator hardware, and can serve as foundation to support
higher level abstractions as used in domain specific languages.
