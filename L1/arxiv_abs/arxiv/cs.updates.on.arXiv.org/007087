Unveiling pathological brain changes associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a challenging
task especially that people do not show symptoms of dementia until it is late. Over the past years,
neuroimaging techniques paved the way for computer-based diagnosis and prognosis to facilitate
the automation of medical decision support and help clinicians identify cognitively intact subjects
that are at high-risk of developing AD. As a progressive neurodegenerative disorder, researchers
investigated how AD affects the brain using different approaches: 1) image-based methods where
mainly neuroimaging modalities are used to provide early AD biomarkers, and 2) network-based methods
which focus on functional and structural brain connectivities to give insights into how AD alters
brain wiring. In this study, we reviewed neuroimaging-based technical methods developed for AD
and mild-cognitive impairment (MCI) classification and prediction tasks, selected by screening
all MICCAI proceedings published between 2010 and 2016. We included papers that fit into image-based
or network-based categories. The majority of papers focused on classifying MCI vs. AD brain states,
which has enabled the discovery of discriminative or altered brain regions and connections. However,
very few works aimed to predict MCI progression based on early neuroimaging-based observations.
Despite the high importance of reliably identifying which early MCI patient will convert to AD,
remain stable or reverse to normal over months/years, predictive models are still lagging behind.
