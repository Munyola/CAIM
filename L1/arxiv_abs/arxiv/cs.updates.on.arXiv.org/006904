Determining significant prognostic biomarkers is of increasing importance in many areas of medicine.
In order to translate a continuous biomarker into a clinical decision, it is often necessary to determine
cut-points. There is so far no standard method to help evaluate how many cut-points are optimal for
a given feature in a survival analysis setting. Moreover, most existing methods are univariate,
hence not well suited for high-dimensional frameworks. This paper introduces a prognostic method
called Binacox to deal with the problem of detecting multiple cut-points per features in a multivariate
setting where a large number of continuous features are available. It is based on the Cox model and
combines one-hot encodings with the binarsity penalty. This penalty uses total-variation regularization
together with an extra linear constraint to avoid collinearity between the one-hot encodings and
enable feature selection. A non-asymptotic oracle inequality is established. The statistical
performance of the method is then examined on an extensive Monte Carlo simulation study, and finally
illustrated on three publicly available genetic cancer datasets with high-dimensional features.
On this datasets, our proposed methodology significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art survival
models regarding risk prediction in terms of C-index, with a computing time orders of magnitude
faster. In addition, it provides powerful interpretability by automatically pinpointing significant
cut-points on relevant features from a clinical point of view.
