With an enormous range of applications, Internet of Things (IoT) has magnetized industries and
academicians from everywhere. IoT facilitates operations through ubiquitous connectivity by
providing Internet access to all the devices with computing capabilities. With the evolution of
wireless infrastructure, the focus from simple IoT has been shifted to smart, connected and mobile
IoT (M-IoT) devices and platforms, which can enable low-complexity, low-cost and efficient computing
through sensors, machines, and even crowdsourcing. All these devices can be grouped under a common
term of M-IoT. Even though the positive impact on applications has been tremendous, security, privacy
and trust are still the major concerns for such networks and an insufficient enforcement of these
requirements introduces non-negligible threats to M-IoT devices and platforms. Thus, it is important
to understand the range of solutions which are available for providing a secure, privacy-compliant,
and trustworthy mechanism for M-IoT. There is no direct survey available, which focuses on security,
privacy, trust, secure protocols, physical layer security and handover protections in M-IoT.
This paper covers such requisites and presents comparisons of state-the-art solutions for IoT
which are applicable to security, privacy, and trust in smart and connected M-IoT networks. Apart
from these, various challenges, applications, advantages, technologies, standards, open issues,
and roadmap for security, privacy and trust are also discussed in this paper.
