The ability to automatically detect certain types of cells in microscopy images is of significant
interest to a wide range of biomedical research and clinical practices. Cell detection methods
have evolved from employing hand-crafted features to deep learning-based techniques to locate
target cells. The essential idea of these methods is that their cell classifiers or detectors are
trained in the pixel space, where the locations of target cells are labeled. In this paper, we seek
a different route and propose a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based cell detection method
that uses encoding of the output pixel space. For the cell detection problem, the output space is
the sparsely labeled pixel locations indicating cell centers. Consequently, we employ random
projections to encode the output space to a compressed vector of fixed dimension. Then, CNN regresses
this compressed vector from the input pixels. Using $L_1$-norm optimization, we recover sparse
cell locations on the output pixel space from the predicted compressed vector. In the past, output
space encoding using compressed sensing (CS) has been used in conjunction with linear and non-linear
predictors. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first successful use of CNN with CS-based output
space encoding. We experimentally demonstrate that proposed CNN + CS framework (referred to as
CNNCS) exceeds the accuracy of the state-of-the-art methods on many benchmark datasets for microscopy
cell detection. Additionally, we show that CNNCS can exploit ensemble average by using more than
one random encodings of the output space.
