In this paper, we consider hybrid beamforming designs for multiuser massive multiple-input multiple-output
(MIMO)-orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems. Aiming at maximizing the
weighted spectral efficiency, we propose one alternating maximization framework where the analog
precoding is optimized by Riemannian manifold optimization. If the digital precoding is optimized
by a locally optimal algorithm, we obtain a locally optimal alternating maximization algorithm.
In contrast, if we use a weighted minimum mean square error (MMSE)-based iterative algorithm for
digital precoding, we obtain a suboptimal alternating maximization algorithm with reduced complexity
in each iteration. By characterizing the upper bound of the weighted arithmetic and geometric means
of mean square errors (MSEs), it is shown that the two alternating maximization algorithms have
similar performance when the user specific weights do not have big differences. Verified by numerical
results, the performance gap between the two alternating maximization algorithms becomes large
when the ratio of the maximal and minimal weights among users is very large. Moreover, we also propose
a low-complexity closed-form method without iterations. It employs matrix decomposition for
the analog beamforming and weighted MMSE for the digital beamforming. Although it is not supposed
to maximize the weighted spectral efficiency, it exhibits small performance deterioration compared
to the two iterative alternating maximization algorithms and it qualifies as a good initialization
for iterative algorithms, saving thereby iterations.
