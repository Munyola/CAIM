We study a multi-modal route planning scenario consisting of a public transit network and a transfer
graph representing a secondary transportation mode (e.g., walking or taxis). The objective is
to compute all journeys that are Pareto-optimal with respect to arrival time and the number of required
transfers. While various existing algorithms can efficiently compute optimal journeys in either
a pure public transit network or a pure transfer graph, combining the two increases running times
significantly. As a result, even walking between stops is typically limited by a maximal duration
or distance, or by requiring the transfer graph to be transitively closed. To overcome these shortcomings,
we propose a novel preprocessing technique called ULTRA (UnLimited TRAnsfers): Given a complete
transfer graph (without any limitations, representing an arbitrary non-schedule-based mode
of transportation), we compute a small number of transfer shortcuts that are provably sufficient
for computing all Pareto-optimal journeys. We demonstrate the practicality of our approach by
showing that these transfer shortcuts can be integrated into a variety of state-of-the-art public
transit algorithms, establishing the ULTRA-Query algorithm family. Our extensive experimental
evaluation shows that ULTRA is able to improve these algorithms from limited to unlimited transfers
without sacrificing query speed, yielding the fastest known algorithms for multi-modal routing.
This is true not just for walking, but also for other transfer modes such as cycling or driving.
