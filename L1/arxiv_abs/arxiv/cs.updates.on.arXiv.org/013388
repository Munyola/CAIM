Tumor treating fields (TTFields) is an FDA approved therapy for the treatment of Gliobastoma Multiform
(GBM) and currently being investigated for additional tumor types. TTFields are delivered to the
tumor through the placement of transducer arrays (TAs) placed on the patient scalp. The positions
of the TAs are associated with treatment outcomes via simulations of the electric fields. Therefore,
we are currently developing a method for recommending optimal placement of TAs. A key step to achieve
this goal is to correctly segment the head into tissues of similar electrical properties. Visual
inspection of segmentation quality is invaluable but time-consuming. Automatic quality assessment
can assist in automatic refinement of the segmentation parameters, suggest flaw points to the user
and indicate if the segmented method is of sufficient accuracy for TTFields simulation. As a first
step in this direction, we identified a set of features that are relevant to atlas-based segmentation
and show that these are significantly correlated (p < 0.05) with a similarity measure between validated
and automatically computed segmentations. Furthermore, we incorporated these features in a decision
tree regressor to predict the similarity of the validated and computed segmentations of 20 TTFields
patients using a leave-one-out approach. The predicted similarity measures were highly correlated
with the actual ones (average abs. difference 3% (SD = 3%); r = 0.92, p < 0.001). We conclude that quality
estimation of segmentations is feasible by incorporating machine learning and segmentation-relevant
features.
