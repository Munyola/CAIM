Reaction networks are often used to model interacting species in fields such as biochemistry and
ecology. When the counts of the species are sufficiently large, the dynamics of their concentrations
are typically modeled via a system of differential equations. However, when the counts of some species
are small, the dynamics of the counts are typically modeled stochastically via a discrete state,
continuous time Markov chain. A key quantity of interest for such models is the probability mass
function of the process at some fixed time. Since paths of such models are relatively straightforward
to simulate, we can estimate the probabilities by constructing an empirical distribution. However,
the support of the distribution is often diffuse across a high-dimensional state space, where the
dimension is equal to the number of species. Therefore generating an accurate empirical distribution
can come with a large computational cost. We present a new Monte Carlo estimator that fundamentally
improves on the "classical" Monte Carlo estimator described above. It also preserves much of classical
Monte Carlo's simplicity. The idea is basically one of conditional Monte Carlo. Our conditional
Monte Carlo estimator has two parameters, and their choice critically affects the performance
of the algorithm. Hence, a key contribution of the present work is that we demonstrate how to approximate
optimal values for these parameters in an efficient manner. Moreover, we provide a central limit
theorem for our estimator, which leads to approximate confidence intervals for its error.
