The performance of person re-identification (Re-ID) seriously depends on the camera environment,
where the large cross-view appearance variations caused by mutual occlusions and background clutters
have severely decreased the identification accuracy. Therefore, it is very essential to learn
a feature representation that can adaptively emphasize the foreground of each input image. In this
paper, we propose a simple yet effective deep neural network to solve the person Re-ID problem, which
attempts to learn a discriminative feature representation by addressing the foreground of input
images. Specifically, a novel foreground attentive neural network (FANN) is first built to strengthen
the positive influence of foreground while weaken the side effect of background, in which an encoder
and decoder subnetwork is carefully designed to drive the whole neural network to put its attention
on the foreground of input images. Then, a novel symmetric triplet loss function is designed to enhance
the feature learning capability by jointly minimizing the intra-class distance and maximizing
the inter-class distance in each triplet unit. Training the deep neural network in an end-to-end
fashion, a discriminative feature representation can be finally learned to find out the matched
reference to the probe among various candidates in the gallery. Comprehensive experiments on several
public benchmark datasets are conducted to evaluate the performance, which have shown clear improvements
of our method as compared with the state-of-the-art approaches.
