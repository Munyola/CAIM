Gait recognition using noninvasively acquired data has been attracting an increasing interest
in the last decade. Among various modalities of data sources, it is experimentally found that the
data involving skeletal representation are amenable for reliable feature compaction and fast
processing. Model-based gait recognition methods that exploit features from a fitted model, like
skeleton, are recognized for their view and scale-invariant properties. We propose a model-based
gait recognition method, using sequences recorded by a single flash lidar. Existing state-of-the-art
model-based approaches that exploit features from high quality skeletal data collected by Kinect
and Mocap are limited to controlled laboratory environments. The performance of conventional
research efforts is negatively affected by poor data quality. We address the problem of gait recognition
under challenging scenarios, such as lower quality and noisy imaging process of lidar, that degrades
the performance of state-of-the-art skeleton-based systems. We present GlidarCo to attain high
accuracy on gait recognition under the described conditions. A filtering mechanism corrects faulty
skeleton joint measurements, and robust statistics are integrated to conventional feature moments
to encode the dynamic of the motion. As a comparison, length-based and vector-based features extracted
from the noisy skeletons are investigated for outlier removal. Experimental results illustrate
the efficacy of the proposed methodology in improving gait recognition given noisy low resolution
lidar data.
