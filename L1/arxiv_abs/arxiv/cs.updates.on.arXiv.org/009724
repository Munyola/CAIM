In this paper, we address the problem of having characters with different scales in scene text recognition.
We propose a novel scale aware feature encoder (SAFE) that is designed specifically for encoding
characters with different scales. SAFE is composed of a multi-scale convolutional encoder and
a scale attention network. The multi-scale convolutional encoder targets at extracting character
features under multiple scales, and the scale attention network is responsible for selecting features
from the most relevant scale(s). SAFE has two main advantages over the traditional single-CNN encoder
used in current state-of-the-art text recognizers. First, it explicitly tackles the scale problem
by extracting scale-invariant features from the characters. This allows the recognizer to put
more effort in handling other challenges in scene text recognition, like those caused by view distortion
and poor image quality. Second, it can transfer the learning of feature encoding across different
character scales. This is particularly important when the training set has a very unbalanced distribution
of character scales, as training with such a dataset will make the encoder biased towards extracting
features from the predominant scale. To evaluate the effectiveness of SAFE, we design a simple text
recognizer named scale-spatial attention network (S-SAN) that employs SAFE as its feature encoder,
and carry out experiments on six public benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that S-SAN
can achieve state-of-the-art (or, in some cases, extremely competitive) performance without
any post-processing.
