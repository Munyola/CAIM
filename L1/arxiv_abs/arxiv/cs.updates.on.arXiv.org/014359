Variational Bayes (VB) methods have emerged as a fast and computationally-efficient alternative
to Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods for scalable Bayesian estimation of mixed multinomial
logit (MMNL) models. It has been established that VB is substantially faster than MCMC at practically
no compromises in predictive accuracy. In this paper, we address two critical gaps concerning the
usage and understanding of VB for MMNL. First, extant VB methods are limited to utility specifications
involving only individual-specific taste parameters. Second, the finite-sample properties
of VB estimators and the relative performance of VB, MCMC and maximum simulated likelihood estimation
(MSLE) are not known. To address the former, this study extends several VB methods for MMNL to admit
utility specifications including both fixed and random utility parameters. To address the latter,
we conduct an extensive simulation-based evaluation to benchmark the extended VB methods against
MCMC and MSLE in terms of estimation times, parameter recovery and predictive accuracy. The results
suggest that all VB variants with the exception of the ones relying on an alternative variational
lower bound constructed with the help of the modified Jensen's inequality perform as well as MCMC
and MSLE at prediction and parameter recovery. In particular, VB with nonconjugate variational
message passing and the delta-method (VB-NCVMP-Delta) is up to 16 times faster than MCMC and MSLE.
Thus, VB-NCVMP-Delta can be an attractive alternative to MCMC and MSLE for fast, scalable and accurate
estimation of MMNL models.
