Generally, the identification and classification of plant diseases and/or pests are performed
by an expert . One of the problems facing coffee farmers in Brazil is crop infestation, particularly
by leaf rust Hemileia vastatrix and leaf miner Leucoptera coffeella. The progression of the diseases
and or pests occurs spatially and temporarily. So, it is very important to automatically identify
the degree of severity. The main goal of this article consists on the development of a method and its
i implementation as an App that allow the detection of the foliar damages from images of coffee leaf
that are captured using a smartphone, and identify whether it is rust or leaf miner, and in turn the
calculation of its severity degree. The method consists of identifying a leaf from the image and
separates it from the background with the use of a segmentation algorithm. In the segmentation process,
various types of backgrounds for the image using the HSV and YCbCr color spaces are tested. In the
segmentation of foliar damages, the Otsu algorithm and the iterative threshold algorithm, in the
YCgCr color space, have been used and compared to k-means. Next, features of the segmented foliar
damages are calculated. For the classification, artificial neural network trained with extreme
learning machine have been used. The results obtained shows the feasibility and effectiveness
of the approach to identify and classify foliar damages, and the automatic calculation of the severity.
The results obtained are very promising according to experts.
