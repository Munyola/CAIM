In recent years, efficient optimization algorithms for Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC)
have been proposed, that significantly reduce the on-line computational time. In particular,
direct multiple shooting and Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP) are used to efficiently solve
Nonlinear Programming (NLP) problems arising from continuous-time NMPC applications. One of
the computationally demanding steps for on-line optimization is the computation of sensitivities
of the nonlinear dynamics at every sampling instant, especially for systems of large dimensions,
strong stiffness, and when using long prediction horizons. In this paper, within the algorithmic
framework of the Real-Time Iteration (RTI) scheme based on multiple shooting, an inexact sensitivity
updating scheme is proposed, that performs a partial update of the Jacobian of the constraints in
the NLP. Such update is triggered by using a Curvature-like Measure of Nonlinearity (CMoN), so that
only sensitivities exhibiting highly nonlinear behaviour are updated, thus adapting to system
operating conditions and possibly reducing the computational burden. An advanced tuning strategy
for the updating scheme is provided to automatically determine the number of sensitivities being
updated, with a guaranteed bounded error on the Quadratic Programming (QP) solution. Numerical
and control performance of the scheme is evaluated by means of two simulation examples performed
on a dedicated implementation. Local convergence analysis is also presented and a tunable convergence
rate is proven, when applied to the SQP method.
