Logit Dynamics [Blume, Games and Economic Behavior, 1993] are randomized best response dynamics
for strategic games: at every time step a player is selected uniformly at random and she chooses a
new strategy according to a probability distribution biased toward strategies promising higher
payoffs. This process defines an ergodic Markov chain, over the set of strategy profiles of the game,
whose unique stationary distribution is the long-term equilibrium concept for the game. However,
when the mixing time of the chain is large (e.g., exponential in the number of players), the stationary
distribution loses its appeal as equilibrium concept, and the transient phase of the Markov chain
becomes important. In several cases it happens that on a time-scale shorter than mixing time the
chain is "metastable", i.e. it stays close to some small set of the state space, while in a time-scale
multiple of the mixing time it jumps from one metastable configuration to another. In this paper
we give a quantitative definition of "metastable probability distributions" for a Markov chain
and we study the metastability of the logit dynamics for some classes of coordination games. We first
consider a pure n-player coordination game that highlights the distinctive features of our metastability
notion based on distributions. Then, we study no-risk-dominant coordination games on the clique
(which is equivalent to the well-known Glauber dynamics for the Curie-Weiss model) and coordination
games on a ring (both the risk-dominant and no-risk-dominant case).
