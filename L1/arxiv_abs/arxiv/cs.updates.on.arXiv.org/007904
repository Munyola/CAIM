Mathematical models for physiological processes aid qualitative understanding of the impact
of various parameters on the underlying process. We analyse two such models for human physiological
processes: the Mackey-Glass and the Lasota equations, which model the change in the concentration
of blood cells in the human body. We first study the local stability of these models, and derive bounds
on various model parameters and the feedback delay for the concentration to equilibrate. We then
deduce conditions for non-oscillatory convergence of the solutions, which could ensure that the
blood cell concentration does not oscillate. Further, we define the convergence characteristics
of the solutions which govern the rate at which the concentration equilibrates when the system is
stable. Owing to the possibility that physiological parameters can seldom be estimated precisely,
we also derive bounds for robust stability\textemdash which enable one to ensure that the blood
cell concentration equilibrates despite parametric uncertainty. We also highlight that when
the necessary and sufficient condition for local stability is violated, the system transits into
instability via a Hopf bifurcation, leading to limit cycles in the blood cell concentration. We
then outline a framework to characterise the type of the Hopf bifurcation and determine the asymptotic
orbital stability of limit cycles. The analysis is complemented with numerical examples, stability
charts and bifurcation diagrams. The insights into the dynamical properties of the mathematical
models may serve to guide the study of dynamical diseases.
