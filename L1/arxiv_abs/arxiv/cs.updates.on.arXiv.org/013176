The Quadratic Travelling Salesman Problem (QTSP) is to find a least-cost Hamiltonian cycle in an
edge-weighted graph, where costs are defined on all pairs of edges such that each edge in the pair
is contained in the Hamiltonian cycle. This is a more general version than the one that appears in
the literature as the QTSP, denoted here as the \emph{adjacent quadratic} TSP, which only considers
costs for pairs of adjacent edges. Major directions of research work on the linear TSP include exact
algorithms, heuristics, approximation algorithms, polynomially solvable special cases and
exponential neighbourhoods among others. In this paper we explore the complexity of searching
exponential neighbourhoods for QTSP, the fixed-rank QTSP, and the adjacent quadratic TSP. The
fixed-rank QTSP is introduced as a restricted version of the QTSP where the cost matrix has fixed
rank $p$. It is shown that fixed-rank QTSP is solvable in pseudopolynomial time and admits an FPTAS
for each of the special cases studied, except for the case of matching edge ejection tours. The adjacent
quadratic TSP is shown to be polynomially-solvable in many of the cases for which the linear TSP is
polynomially-solvable. Interestingly, optimizing over the matching edge ejection tour neighbourhood
is shown to be pseudopolynomial for the rank 1 case without a linear term in the objective function,
but NP-hard for the adjacent quadratic TSP case. We also show that the quadratic shortest path problem
on an acyclic digraph can be solved in pseudopolynomial time and by an FPTAS when the rank of the associated
cost matrix is fixed.
