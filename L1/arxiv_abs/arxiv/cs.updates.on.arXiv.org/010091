One of the biggest setbacks in traditional frequent pattern mining is that overwhelmingly many
of the discovered patterns are redundant. A prototypical example of such redundancy is a freerider
pattern where the pattern contains a true pattern and some additional noise events. A technique
for filtering freerider patterns that has proved to be efficient in ranking itemsets is to use a partition
model where a pattern is divided into two subpatterns and the observed support is compared to the
expected support under the assumption that these two subpatterns occur independently. In this
paper we develop a partition model for episodes, patterns discovered from sequential data. An episode
is essentially a set of events, with possible restrictions on the order of events. Unlike with itemset
mining, computing the expected support of an episode requires surprisingly sophisticated methods.
In order to construct the model, we partition the episode into two subepisodes. We then model how
likely the events in each subepisode occur close to each other. If this probability is high---which
is often the case if the subepisode has a high support---then we can expect that when one event from
a subepisode occurs, then the remaining events occur also close by. This approach increases the
expected support of the episode, and if this increase explains the observed support, then we can
deem the episode uninteresting. We demonstrate in our experiments that using the partition model
can effectively and efficiently reduce the redundancy in episodes.
