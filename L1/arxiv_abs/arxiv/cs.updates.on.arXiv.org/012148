Separable Non-negative Matrix Factorization (SNMF) is an important method for topic modeling,
where "separable" assumes every topic contains at least one anchor word, defined as a word that has
non-zero probability only on that topic. SNMF focuses on the word co-occurrence patterns to reveal
topics by two steps: anchor word selection and topic recovery. The quality of the anchor words strongly
influences the quality of the extracted topics. Existing anchor word selection algorithm is to
greedily find an approximate convex hull in a high-dimensional word co-occurrence space. In this
work, we propose a new method for the anchor word selection by associating the word co-occurrence
probability with the words similarity and assuming that the most different words on semantic are
potential candidates for the anchor words. Therefore, if the similarity of a word-pair is very low,
then the two words are very likely to be the anchor words. According to the statistical information
of text corpora, we can get the similarity of all word-pairs. We build the word similarity graph where
the nodes correspond to words and weights on edges stand for the word-pair similarity. Following
this way, we design a greedy method to find a minimum edge-weight anchor clique of a given size in the
graph for the anchor word selection. Extensive experiments on real-world corpus demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed anchor word selection method that outperforms the common convex
hull-based methods on the revealed topic quality. Meanwhile, our method is much faster than typical
SNMF based method.
