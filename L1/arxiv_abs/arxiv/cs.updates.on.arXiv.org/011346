We study the power of interactivity in local differential privacy. First, we focus on the difference
between fully interactive and sequentially interactive protocols. Sequentially interactive
protocols may query users adaptively in sequence, but they cannot return to previously queried
users. The vast majority of existing lower bounds for local differential privacy apply only to sequentially
interactive protocols, and before this paper it was not known whether fully interactive protocols
were more powerful. We resolve this question. First, we classify locally private protocols by their
compositionality, the multiplicative factor $k \geq 1$ by which the sum of a protocol's single-round
privacy parameters exceeds its overall privacy guarantee. We then show how to efficiently transform
any fully interactive $k$-compositional protocol into an equivalent sequentially interactive
protocol with an $O(k)$ blowup in sample complexity. Next, we show that our reduction is tight by
exhibiting a family of problems such that for any $k$, there is a fully interactive $k$-compositional
protocol which solves the problem, while no sequentially interactive protocol can solve the problem
without at least an $\tilde \Omega(k)$ factor more examples. We then turn our attention to hypothesis
testing problems. We show that for a large class of compound hypothesis testing problems --- which
include all simple hypothesis testing problems as a special case --- a simple noninteractive test
is optimal among the class of all (possibly fully interactive) tests.
