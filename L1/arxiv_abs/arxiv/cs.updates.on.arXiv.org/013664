Energy efficiency is a crucial issue towards longterm deployment of compliant robots in the real
world. In the context of variable impedance actuators (VIAs), one of the main focuses has been on
improving energy efficiency through reduction of energy consumption. However, the harvesting
of dissipated energy in such systems remains under-explored. This study proposes a novel variable
damping module design enabling energy regeneration in VIAs by exploiting the regenerative braking
effect of DC motors. The proposed damping module uses four switches to combine regenerative and
dynamic braking, in a hybrid approach that enables energy regeneration without a reduction in the
range of damping achievable. A physical implementation on a simple VIA mechanism is presented in
which the regenerative properties of the proposed module are characterised and compared against
theoretical predictions. To investigate the role of variable regenerative damping in terms of
energy efficiency of longterm operation, experiments are reported in which the VIA equipped with
the proposed damping module performs sequential reaching to a series of stochastic targets. The
results indicate that the combination of variable stiffness and variable regenerative damping
is preferable to achieve the optimal trade-off between task performance and energy efficiency.
Use of the latter results in a 25% performance improvement on overall performance metrics (incorporating
reaching accuracy, settling time, energy consumption and regeneration), over comparable schemes
where either stiffness or damping are fixed.
