Aerial drones are becoming an integral part of application domains including but not limited to,
military operations, package delivery, construction, monitoring and search/rescue operations.
It is critical to ensure the cyber security of networked aerial drone systems in these applications.
Standard cryptographic services can be deployed to provide basic security services; however,
they have been shown to be inefficient in terms of energy and time consumption, especially for small
aerial drones with resource-limited processors. Therefore, there is a significant need for an
efficient cryptographic framework that can meet the requirements of small aerial drones. We propose
an improved cryptographic framework for small aerial drones, which offers significant energy
efficiency and speed advantages over standard cryptographic techniques. (i) We create (to the
best of our knowledge) the first optimized public key infrastructure (PKI) based framework for
small aerial drones, which provides energy efficient techniques by harnessing special precomputation
methods and optimized elliptic curves. (ii) We also integrate recent light-weight symmetric primitives
into our PKI techniques to provide a full-fledged cryptographic framework. (iii) We implemented
standard counterparts and our proposed techniques on an actual small aerial drone (Crazyflie 2.0),
and provided an in-depth energy analysis. Our experiments showed that our improved cryptographic
framework achieves up to 35x lower energy consumption than its standard counterpart.
