For a regular cardinal $\kappa$, a formula of the modal $\mu$-calculus is $\kappa$-continuous
in a variable x if, on every model, its interpretation as a unary function of x is monotone and preserves
unions of $\kappa$-directed sets. We define the fragment $C_{\aleph_1}(x)$ of the modal $\mu$-calculus
and prove that all the formulas in this fragment are $\aleph_1$-continuous. For each formula $\phi(x)$
of the modal $\mu$-calculus, we construct a formula $\psi(x) \in C_{\aleph_1 }(x)$ such that $\phi(x)$
is $\kappa$-continuous, for some $\kappa$, if and only if $\phi(x)$ is equivalent to $\psi(x)$.
Consequently, we prove that (i) the problem whether a formula is $\kappa$-continuous for some $\kappa$
is decidable, (ii) up to equivalence, there are only two fragments determined by continuity at some
regular cardinal: the fragment $C_{\aleph_0}(x)$ studied by Fontaine and the fragment $C_{\aleph_1}(x)$.
We apply our considerations to the problem of characterizing closure ordinals of formulas of the
modal $\mu$-calculus. An ordinal $\alpha$ is the closure ordinal of a formula $\phi(x)$ if its interpretation
on every model converges to its least fixed-point in at most $\alpha$ steps and if there is a model
where the convergence occurs exactly in $\alpha$ steps. We prove that $\omega_1$, the least uncountable
ordinal, is such a closure ordinal. Moreover we prove that closure ordinals are closed under ordinal
sum. Thus, any formal expression built from 0, 1, $\omega$, $\omega_1$ by using the binary operator
symbol + gives rise to a closure ordinal.
