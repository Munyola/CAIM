We consider the problem of allocating radio resources over wireless communication links to control
a series of independent wireless control systems. Low-latency transmissions are necessary in
enabling time-sensitive control systems to operate over wireless links with high reliability.
Achieving fast data rates over wireless links thus comes at the cost of reliability in the form of
high packet error rates compared to wired links due to channel noise and interference. However,
the effect of the communication link errors on the control system performance depends dynamically
on the control system state. We propose a novel control-communication co-design approach to the
low-latency resource allocation problem. We incorporate control and channel state information
to make scheduling decisions over time on frequency, bandwidth and data rates across the next-generation
Wi-Fi based wireless communication links that close the control loops. Control systems that are
closer to instability or further from a desired range in a given control cycle are given higher packet
delivery rate targets to meet. Rather than a simple priority ranking, we derive precise packet error
rate targets for each system needed to satisfy stability targets and make scheduling decisions
to meet such targets while reducing total transmission time. The resulting Control-Aware Low Latency
Scheduling (CALLS) method is tested in numerous simulation experiments that demonstrate its effectiveness
in meeting control-based goals under tight latency constraints relative to control-agnostic
scheduling.
