We study communication systems over state-dependent channels in the presence of a malicious state-aware
jamming adversary. The channel has a memoryless state with an underlying distribution. The adversary
introduces a jamming signal into the channel. The state sequence is known non-causally to both the
encoder and the adversary. Taking an Arbitrarily Varying Channel (AVC) approach, we consider two
setups, namely, the discrete memoryless Gel'fand-Pinsker (GP) AVC and the additive white Gaussian
Dirty Paper (DP) AVC. We determine the randomized coding capacity of both the AVCs under a maximum
probability of error criterion. Similar to other randomized coding setups, we show that the capacity
is the same even under the average probability of error criterion. Even with non-causal knowledge
of the state, we prove that the state-aware adversary cannot affect the rate any worse than when it
employs a memoryless strategy which depends only on the instantaneous state. Thus, the AVC capacity
characterization is given in terms of the capacity of the worst memoryless channels with state,
induced by the adversary employing such memoryless jamming strategies. For the DP-AVC, it is further
shown that among memoryless jamming strategies, none impact the communication more than a memoryless
Gaussian jamming strategy which completely disregards the knowledge of the state. Thus, the capacity
of the DP-AVC equals that of a standard AWGN channel with two independent sources of additive white
Gaussian noise, i.e., the channel noise and the jamming noise.
