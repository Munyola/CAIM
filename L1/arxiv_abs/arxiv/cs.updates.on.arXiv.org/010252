Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the global leading cause of death. A strong risk factor for CVD events
is the amount of coronary artery calcium (CAC). To meet demands of the increasing interest in quantification
of CAC, i.e. coronary calcium scoring, especially as an unrequested finding for screening and research,
automatic methods have been proposed. Current automatic calcium scoring methods are relatively
computationally expensive and only provide scores for one type of CT. To address this, we propose
a computationally efficient method that employs two ConvNets: the first performs registration
to align the fields of view of input CTs and the second performs direct regression of the calcium score,
thereby circumventing time-consuming intermediate CAC segmentation. Optional decision feedback
provides insight in the regions that contributed to the calcium score. Experiments were performed
using 903 cardiac CT and 1,687 chest CT scans. The method predicted calcium scores in less than 0.3
s. Intra-class correlation coefficient between predicted and manual calcium scores was 0.98 for
both cardiac and chest CT. The method showed almost perfect agreement between automatic and manual
CVD risk categorization in both datasets, with a linearly weighted Cohen's kappa of 0.95 in cardiac
CT and 0.93 in chest CT. Performance is similar to that of state-of-the-art methods, but the proposed
method is hundreds of times faster. By providing visual feedback, insight is given in the decision
process, making it readily implementable in clinical and research settings.
