Traditional authentication in radio-frequency (RF) systems enable secure data transmission
within a network through techniques such as digital signatures and hash-based message authentication
codes (HMAC). However, these techniques may not prevent a malicious attacker from stealing the
secret encryption keys using invasive, modeling or side channel attacks. Physically unclonable
functions (PUF), on the other hand, can exploit manufacturing process variations to uniquely identify
silicon chips which makes a PUF-based system extremely robust and secure at low cost, as it is practically
impossible to replicate the same silicon characteristics across dies. In this paper, we present
RF- PUF: a deep neural network based framework that allows real-time authentication of wireless
nodes, using the effects of inherent process variation on RF properties of the wireless transmitters
(Tx), detected through in-situ machine learning at the receiver (Rx) end. The proposed method utilizes
the already-existing asymmetric RF communication framework and does not require any additional
circuitry for PUF generation or feature extraction. Simulation results involving the process
variations in a standard 65 nm technology node, and features such as LO offset and I-Q imbalance detected
with a neural network having 50 neurons in the hidden layer indicate that the framework can distinguish
up to 4800 transmitters with an accuracy of 99.9% (~ 99% for 10,000 transmitters) under varying channel
conditions, and without the need for traditional preambles.
