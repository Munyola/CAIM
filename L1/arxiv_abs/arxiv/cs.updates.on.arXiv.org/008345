In 2002, the UCR time series classification archive was first released with sixteen datasets. It
gradually expanded, until 2015 when it increased in size from 45 datasets to 85 datasets. In October
2018 more datasets were added, bringing the total to 128. The new archive contains a wide range of
problems, including variable length series, but it still only contains univariate time series
classification problems. One of the motivations for introducing the archive was to encourage researchers
to perform a more rigorous evaluation of newly proposed time series classification (TSC) algorithms.
It has worked: most recent research into TSC uses all 85 datasets to evaluate algorithmic advances.
Research into multivariate time series classification, where more than one series are associated
with each class label, is in a position where univariate TSC research was a decade ago. Algorithms
are evaluated using very few datasets and claims of improvement are not based on statistical comparisons.
We aim to address this problem by forming the first iteration of the MTSC archive, to be hosted at the
website www.timeseriesclassification.com. Like the univariate archive, this formulation was
a collaborative effort between researchers at the University of East Anglia (UEA) and the University
of California, Riverside (UCR). The 2018 vintage consists of 30 datasets with a wide range of cases,
dimensions and series lengths. For this first iteration of the archive we format all data to be of
equal length, include no series with missing data and provide train/test splits.
