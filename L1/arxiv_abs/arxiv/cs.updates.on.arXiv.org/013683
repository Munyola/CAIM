The proliferation of ubiquitous computing requires energy-efficient as well as secure operation
of modern processors. Side channel attacks are becoming a critical threat to security and privacy
of devices embedded in modern computing infrastructures. Unintended information leakage via
physical signatures such as power consumption, electromagnetic emission (EM) and execution time
have emerged as a key security consideration for SoCs. Also, information published on purpose at
user privilege level accessible through software interfaces results in software only attacks.
In this paper, we used a supervised learning based approach for inferring applications executing
on android platform based on features extracted from EM side-channel emissions and software exposed
dynamic voltage frequency scaling(DVFS) states. We highlight the importance of machine learning
based approach in utilizing these multi-dimensional features on a complex SoC, against profiling-based
approaches. We also show that learning the instantaneous frequency states polled from onboard
frequency driver (cpufreq) is adequate to identify a known application and flag potentially malicious
unknown application. The experimental results on benchmarking applications running on ARMv8
processor in Snapdragon 820 board demonstrates early detection of these apps, and atleast 85% accuracy
in detecting unknown applications. Overall, the highlight is to utilize a low-complexity path
to application inference attacks through learning instantaneous frequency states pattern of
CPU core.
