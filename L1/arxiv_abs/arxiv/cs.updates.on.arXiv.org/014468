Along with the development of manufacture and services, the problem of distribution network optimization
has been growing in importance, thus receiving much attention from the research community. One
of the most recently introduced network optimization problems is the Clustered Shortest-Path
Tree Problem (CluSTP). Since the problem is NP-Hard, recent approaches often prefer to use approximation
algorithms to solve it, several of which used Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) and have been proven
to be effective. However, most of the prior studies directly applied EAs to the whole CluSTP problem,
which leads to a great amount of resource consumption, especially when the problem size is large.
To overcome these limitations, this paper suggests a method for reducing the search space of the
EAs applied to CluSTP by decomposing the original problem into two sub-problems, the solution to
one of which is found by an EAs and that to the other is found by another method. The goal of the first
sub-problem is to determine a spanning tree which connects among the clusters, while the goal of
the second sub-problem is to determine the best spanning tree for each cluster. In addition, this
paper proposes a new EAs, which can be applied to solve the first sub-problem and suggests using the
Dijkstra's algorithm to solve the second sub-problem. The proposed approach is comprehensively
experimented and compared with existing methods. Experimental results prove that our method is
more efficient and more importantly, it can obtain results which are close to the optimal results.
