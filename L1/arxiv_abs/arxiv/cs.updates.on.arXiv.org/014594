Pixel- and voxel-based representations of microstructures obtained from tomographic imaging
methods is an established standard in computational materials science. The corresponding highly
resolved, uniform discretitization in numerical analysis is adequate to accurately describe
the geometry of interfaces and defects in microstructures and, therefore, to capture the physical
processes in these regions of interest. For the defect-free interior of phases and grains however,
the high resolution is in view of only weakly varying field properties not necessary such that mesh-coarsening
in these regions can improve efficiency without severe losses of accuracy in simulations. The present
work proposes two different variants of adaptive, quadtree-based mesh-coarsening algorithms
applied to pixelized images that serves the purpose of a preprocessor for consecutive finite element
analyses, here, in the context of numerical homogenization. Error analysis is carried out on the
microscale by error estimation which itself is assessed by true error computation. A modified stress
recovery scheme for a superconvergent error estimator is proposed which overcomes the deficits
of the standard recovery scheme for nodal stress computation in cases of interfaces with stiffness
jump. By virtue of error analysis the improved efficiency by the reduction of unknowns is put into
relation to the increase of the discretization error. This quantitative analysis sets a rational
basis for decisions on favorable meshes having the best trade-off between accuracy and efficiency
as will be underpinned by various examples.
