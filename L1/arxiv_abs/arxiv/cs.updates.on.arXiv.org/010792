With the tremendous growth in the number of scientific papers being published, searching for references
while writing a scientific paper is a time-consuming process. A technique that could add a reference
citation at the appropriate place in a sentence will be beneficial. In this perspective, context-aware
citation recommendation has been researched upon for around two decades. Many researchers have
utilized the text data called the context sentence, which surrounds the citation tag, and the metadata
of the target paper to find the appropriate cited research. However, the lack of well-organized
benchmarking datasets and no model that can attain high performance has made the research difficult.
In this paper, we propose a deep learning based model and well-organized dataset for context-aware
paper citation recommendation. Our model comprises a document encoder and a context encoder, which
uses Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) layer and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from
Transformers (BERT), which is a pre-trained model of textual data. By modifying the related PeerRead
dataset, we propose a new dataset called FullTextPeerRead containing context sentences to cited
references and paper metadata. To the best of our knowledge, This dataset is the first well-organized
dataset for context-aware paper recommendation. The results indicate that the proposed model
with the proposed datasets can attain state-of-the-art performance and achieve a more than 28%
improvement in mean average precision (MAP) and recall@k.
