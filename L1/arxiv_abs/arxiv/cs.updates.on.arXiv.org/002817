Vertex separators, that is, vertex sets whose deletion disconnects two distinguished vertices
in a graph, play a pivotal role in algorithmic graph theory. For instance, the concept of tree decompositions
of graphs is tightly connected to the separator concept. For many realistic models of the real world,
however, it is necessary to consider graphs whose edge set changes with time. More specifically,
the edges are labeled with time stamps. In the literature, these graphs are referred to as temporal
graphs, temporal networks, time-varying networks, edge-scheduled networks, etc. While there
is an extensive literature on separators in "static" graphs, much less is known for the temporal
setting. Building on previous work (e.g., Kempe et al. [STOC '00]), for the first time we systematically
investigate the (parameterized) complexity of finding separators in temporal graphs. Doing so,
we discover a rich landscape of computationally (fixed-parameter) tractable and intractable
cases. In particular, we shed light on the so far seemingly overlooked fact that two frequently used
models of temporal separation may lead to quite significant differences in terms of computational
complexity. More specifically, considering paths in temporal graphs one may distinguish between
strict paths (the time stamps along a path are strictly increasing) and non-strict paths (the time
stamps along a path are monotonically non-decreasing). We observe that the corresponding strict
case of temporal separators leads to several computationally much easier to handle cases than the
non-strict case does.
