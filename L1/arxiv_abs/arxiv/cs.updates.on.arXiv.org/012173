In this article, we study the nonlinear Fokker-Planck (FP) equation that arises as a mean-field
(macroscopic, Eulerian) approximation of bounded confidence opinion dynamics, where opinions
are influenced by environmental noises and opinions of radicals (stubborn individuals). The distribution
of radical opinions serves as an infinite-dimensional control input to the FP equation, visibly
influencing the steady opinion profile. We establish mathematical properties of the FP equation.
In particular, we show (i) the well-posedness (existence, uniqueness, and regularity) of the dynamic
equation in a certain class of initial conditions and provide (ii) existence result accompanied
by a global estimate for the corresponding stationary equation. Also provided is (iii) a lower bound
on the noise level that guarantees exponential convergence of the dynamics to stationary state.
Combining the last two results readily yields input-output stability of the system for sufficiently
large noises. Next, using Fourier analysis, the structure of opinion clusters under the uniform
initial distribution is examined. Specifically, two numerical schemes are provided for identification
of the order-disorder transition and characterization of the initial clustering behavior. The
results of analysis are validated through several numerical simulations of the continuum-agent
model (partial differential equation) and the corresponding discrete-agent model (interactive
stochastic differential equations) for a particular distribution of radicals.
