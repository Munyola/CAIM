This paper proposes a new highly scalable and asymptotically optimal control synthesis algorithm
from linear temporal logic specifications, called $\text{STyLuS}^{*}$ for large-Scale optimal
Temporal Logic Synthesis, that is designed to solve complex temporal planning problems in large-scale
multi-robot systems. Existing planning approaches with temporal logic specifications rely on
graph search techniques applied to a product automaton constructed among the robots. In our previous
work, we have proposed a more tractable sampling-based algorithm that builds incrementally trees
that approximate the state-space and transitions of the synchronous product automaton and does
not require sophisticated graph search techniques. Here, we extend our previous work by introducing
bias in the sampling process which is guided by transitions in the B$\ddot{\text{u}}$chi automaton
that belong to the shortest path to the accepting states. This allows us to synthesize optimal motion
plans from product automata with hundreds of orders of magnitude more states than those that existing
optimal control synthesis methods or off-the-shelf model checkers can manipulate. We show that
$\text{STyLuS}^{*}$ is probabilistically complete and asymptotically optimal and has exponential
convergence rate. This is the first time that convergence rate results are provided for sampling-based
optimal control synthesis methods. We provide simulation results that show that $\text{STyLuS}^{*}$
can synthesize optimal motion plans for very large multi-robot systems which is impossible using
state-of-the-art methods.
