Large-scale datasets have successively proven their fundamental importance in several research
fields, especially for early progress in some emerging topics. In this paper, we focus on the problem
of visual speech recognition, also known as lipreading, which has received an increasing interest
in recent years. We present a naturally-distributed large-scale benchmark for lip reading in the
wild, named LRW-1000, which contains 1000 classes with about 718,018 samples from more than 2000
individual speakers. Each class corresponds to the syllables of a Mandarin word which is composed
of one or several Chinese characters. To the best of our knowledge, it is the largest word-level lipreading
dataset and also the only public large-scale Mandarin lipreading dataset. This dataset aims at
covering a "natural" variability over different speech modes and imaging conditions to incorporate
challenges encountered in practical applications. This benchmark shows a large variation over
several aspects, including the number of samples in each class, resolution of videos, lighting
conditions, and speakers' attributes such as pose, age, gender, and make-up. Besides a detailed
description of the dataset and its collection pipeline, we evaluate the popular lipreading methods
and perform a thorough analysis of the results from several aspects. The results demonstrate the
consistency and challenges of our dataset, which may open up some new promising directions for future
work. The dataset and corresponding codes will be public for academic research use.
