This paper will present a cross-European experience of game jams as part of a Horizon 2020 funded
project: No-one Left Behind (NOLB). The NOLB project was created to unlock inclusive gaming creation
and experiences in formal learning situations from primary to secondary level, particularly for
children at risk of social exclusion. The project has engendered the concept of game jams, events
organised with the aim of designing and creating small games in a short time-frame around a central
theme. Game jams can support engagement with informal learning beyond schools across a range of
disciplines, resulting in an exciting experience associated with strong, positive emotions which
can significantly support learning goals. This paper will disseminate experience of two cross-European
game jams; the first a pilot and the second having over 95 submissions from countries across Europe,
America, Canada, Egypt, the Philippians and India. Data collected through these games jams supports
that coding, designing, reflection, analysing, creating, debugging, persevering and application,
as well as developing computational thinking concepts such as decomposition, using patterns,
abstraction and evaluation. The notion of game jams provides a paradigm for creating both formal
and informal learning experiences such as directed learning experience, problem-solving, hands-on
projects, working collaboratively, and creative invention, within a learner-centred learning
environment where children are creators of their own knowledge and learning material.
