In this paper, we propose a methodology for estimating the crowd speed using WiFi devices, and without
relying on people to carry any device (passively). Our approach not only enables speed estimation
in the region where WiFi links are, but also in the adjacent possibly WiFi-free regions where there
may be no WiFi signal available. More specifically, we use a pair of WiFi links in one region, whose
RSSI measurements are then used to estimate the crowd speed, not only in this region, but also in adjacent
WiFi-free regions. We first prove how the cross-correlation and the probability of crossing of
the two links implicitly carry key information about the pedestrian speeds and develop a mathematical
model to relate them to pedestrian speeds. We then validate our approach with 108 experiments, in
both indoor and outdoor, where up to 10 people walk in two adjacent areas, with a variety of speeds
per region, showing that our framework can accurately estimate these speeds with only a pair of WiFi
links in one region. For instance, the NMSE over all experiments is 0.18. Furthermore, the overall
classification accuracy, when crowd speed is categorized as slow, normal, and fast, is 85%. We also
evaluate our framework in a museum-type setting, where two exhibitions showcase two different
types of displays. We show how our methodology can estimate the visitor speeds in both exhibits,
deducing which exhibit is more popular. We finally run experiments in an aisle in Costco, estimating
key attributes of buyers' behaviors.
