In Turkey the increasing tension, due to the presence of 3.4 million Syrian refugees, demands the
formulation of effective integration policies. Moreover, their design requires tools aimed at
understanding the integration of refugees despite the complexity of this phenomenon. In this work,
we propose a set of metrics aimed at providing insights and assessing the integration of Syrians
refugees, by analyzing a real-world Call Details Records (CDRs) dataset including calls from refugees
and locals in Turkey throughout 2017. Specifically, we exploit the similarity between refugees'
and locals' spatial and temporal behaviors, in terms of communication and mobility in order to assess
integration dynamics. Together with the already known methods for data analysis, we use a novel
computational approach to analyze spatiotemporal patterns: Computational Stigmergy, a bio-inspired
scalar and temporal aggregation of samples. Computational Stigmergy associates each sample to
a virtual pheromone deposit (mark). Marks in spatiotemporal proximity are aggregated into functional
structures called trails, which summarize the spatiotemporal patterns in data and allows computing
the similarity between different patterns. According to our results, collective mobility and
behavioral similarity with locals have great potential as measures of integration, since they
are: (i) correlated with the amount of interaction with locals; (ii) an effective proxy for refugee's
economic capacity, thus refugee's potential employment; and (iii) able to capture events that
may disrupt the integration phenomena, such as social tensions.
