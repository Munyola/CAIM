Group-based sparse representation has shown great potential in image denoising. However, most
existing methods only consider the nonlocal self-similarity (NSS) prior of noisy input image.
That is, the similar patches are collected only from degraded input, which makes the quality of image
denoising largely depend on the input itself. However, such methods often suffer from a common drawback
that the denoising performance may degrade quickly with increasing noise levels. In this paper
we propose a new prior model, called group sparsity residual constraint (GSRC). Unlike the conventional
group-based sparse representation denoising methods, two kinds of prior, namely, the NSS priors
of noisy and pre-filtered images, are used in GSRC. In particular, we integrate these two NSS priors
through the mechanism of sparsity residual, and thus, the task of image denoising is converted to
the problem of reducing the group sparsity residual. To this end, we first obtain a good estimation
of the group sparse coefficients of the original image by pre-filtering, and then the group sparse
coefficients of the noisy image are used to approximate this estimation. To improve the accuracy
of the nonlocal similar patch selection, an adaptive patch search scheme is designed. Furthermore,
to fuse these two NSS prior better, an effective iterative shrinkage algorithm is developed to solve
the proposed GSRC model. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed GSRC modeling outperforms
many state-of-the-art denoising methods in terms of the objective and the perceptual metrics.
