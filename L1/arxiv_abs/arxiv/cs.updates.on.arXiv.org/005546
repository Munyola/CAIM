Millimeter-wave (mm-wave) will be the key enabling technology in the next generation wireless
networks due to the abundant bandwidth availability. However, the high signal attenuation at these
frequencies demands precise beam-alignment between transmitter and receiver, which may entail
significant overhead in mobile environments. This paper proposes an optimal interactive beam-alignment
and data communication protocol, with the goal of minimizing energy consumption under a minimum
rate constraint. The base-station (BS) decides to perform beam-alignment or data communication
and selects the beam parameters, based on feedback from the user-end (UE). Based on the sectored
antenna model and uniform prior on the angles of departure and arrival (AoD/AoA), it is shown that
a fixed-length two-phase protocol is optimal, with a fixed-length beam-alignment phase followed
by a data-communication phase. Moreover, a decoupled fractional search method is shown to be optimal
during beam-alignment, which decouples over time the alignment of AoD and AoA. Furthermore, a heuristic
policy is proposed for non-uniform AoD/AoA prior with provable performance guarantees, and it
is shown that the uniform prior is the worst-case scenario. The performance degradation due to detection
errors is studied analytically and via simulation. The numerical results with analog beams depict
the superior performance of our proposed scheme, showing up to 10% and 20% throughput performance
gain compared to conventional and interactive exhaustive search policies, respectively.
