Heterogeneous cellular networks (HCNs) with millimeter wave (mm-wave) communications are considered
as a promising technology for the fifth generation mobile networks. Mm-wave has the potential to
provide multiple gigabit data rate due to the broad spectrum. Unfortunately, additional free space
path loss is also caused by the high carrier frequency. On the other hand, mm-wave signals are sensitive
to obstacles and more vulnerable to blocking effects. To address this issue, highly directional
narrow beams are utilized in mm-wave networks. Additionally, device-to-device (D2D) users make
full use of their proximity and share uplink spectrum resources in HCNs to increase the spectrum
efficiency and network capacity. Towards the caused complex interferences, the combination of
D2D-enabled HCNs with small cells densely deployed and mm-wave communications poses a big challenge
to the resource allocation problems. In this paper, we formulate the optimization problem of D2D
communication spectrum resource allocation among multiple micro-wave bands and multiple mm-wave
bands in HCNs. Then, considering the totally different propagation conditions on the two bands,
a heuristic algorithm is proposed to maximize the system transmission rate and approximate the
solutions with sufficient accuracies. Compared with other practical schemes, we carry out extensive
simulations with different system parameters, and demonstrate the superior performance of the
proposed scheme. In addition, the optimality and complexity are simulated to further verify effectiveness
and efficiency.
