Mathematical theory shows us that multilayer feedforward Artificial Neural Networks(ANNs) are
universal function approximators, capable of approximating any measurable function to any desired
degree of accuracy. In practice designing practical and efficient neural network architectures
require significant effort and expertise. We present a novel software framework called Evolutionary
Cell Aided Design(ECAD) meant to aid in the exploration and design of efficient Neural Network Architectures(NNAs)
for reconfigurable hardware. Given a general neural network structure and a set of constraints
and fitness functions, the framework will explore both the space of possible NNA and the space of
possible hardware designs, using evolutionary algorithms, and attempt to find the fittest co-design
solutions according to a predefined set of goals. We test the framework on an image classification
task and use the MNIST data set of hand written digits with an Intel Arria 10 GX 1150 device as our target
platform. We design and implement a modular and scalable 2D systolic array with enhancements for
machine learning that can be used by the framework for the hardware search space. Our results demonstrate
the ability to pair neural network design and hardware development together using an evolutionary
algorithm and removing traditional human-in-the-loop development tasks. By running various
experiments of the fittest solutions for neural network and hardware searches, we demonstrate
the full end-to-end capabilities of the ECAD framework.
