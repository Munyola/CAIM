This paper considers the problem of Quantitative Group Testing (QGT). Consider a set of $N$ items
among which $K$ items are defective. The QGT problem is to identify (all or a sufficiently large fraction
of) the defective items, where the result of a test reveals the number of defective items in the tested
group. In this work, we propose a non-adaptive QGT algorithm using sparse graph codes over bi-regular
bipartite graphs with left-degree $\ell$ and right degree $r$ and binary $t$-error-correcting
BCH codes. The proposed scheme provides exact recovery with probabilistic guarantee, i.e. recovers
all the defective items with high probability. In particular, we show that for the sub-linear regime
where $\frac{K}{N}$ vanishes as $K,N\rightarrow\infty$, the proposed algorithm requires at
most ${m=c(t)K\left(t\log_2\left(\frac{\ell N}{c(t)K}+1\right)+1\right)+1}$ tests to recover
all the defective items with probability approaching one as ${K,N\rightarrow\infty}$, where
$c(t)$ depends only on $t$. The results of our theoretical analysis reveal that the minimum number
of required tests is achieved by $t=2$. The encoding and decoding of the proposed algorithm for any
$t\leq 4$ have the computational complexity of $\mathcal{O}(K\log^2 \frac{N}{K})$ and $\mathcal{O}(K\log
\frac{N}{K})$, respectively. Our simulation results also show that the proposed algorithm significantly
outperforms a non-adaptive semi-quantitative group testing algorithm recently proposed by Abdalla
\emph{et al.} in terms of the required number of tests for identifying all the defective items with
high probability.
