The copyright protection of 3D videos has become a crucial issue. In this study, a novel zero-watermark
scheme with similarity-based retrieval is proposed. In our proposed scheme the features of both
2D-video and depth-map components are first extracted. Next, master shares and ownership shares
are generated from these features and their relevant copyright information based on (2,2) visual
secret sharing scheme. Different with traditional zero-watermark schemes, both the features
and ownership shares are stored in relevant databases. When a 3D video is queried, a novel similarity-based
retrieval phase is designed to obtain the ownership shares relevant to the particular 3D video.
After that, the queried master shares are generated from this 3D video and stacked with its relevant
ownership shares to identify its copyright ownership. To satisfy different DRM requirements of
3D videos, flexible mechanisms are designed for both similarity-based retrieval and copyright
identification functions in our study. The experimental results demonstrate that RZW-SR3D not
only obtains the ownership shares relevant to a particular 3D video precisely and reliably when
processing numerous videos, which outperforms the traditional zero-watermark schemes, but also
identifies the copyrights of 2D-video and depth-map components of 3D videos reliably, independently
and simultaneously without any content distortion or watermark-embedding limitation, which
outperforms existing 2D-video based and depth-map based watermark schemes for protecting 3D video.
