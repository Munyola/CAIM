In this paper, we present a framework for shaping pulses to control biological systems. By shaping
a pulse we mean computing its magnitude and length, which results in reaching the desired control
objective. An advantage of using pulses for biological control problems is that pulses can easily
be implemented in a laboratory setting by scientists. Firstly, we consider the problem of switching
between steady states in a multi-stable system. We show that it is possible to estimate the pulses
fulfilling the objective, if the trajectories of the controlled system can be bounded from above
and below by the trajectories of monotone systems. This result can be generalised to systems with
uncertain parameter values under some mild assumptions on the set of admissible parameters. Hence,
even with infinite sampling time (that is open-loop control) some robustness guarantees can be
provided. Secondly, we consider a problem of inducing oscillatory behaviour in an eight species
generalised repressilator, which is a monotone system. In this case, the problem reduces to keeping
the trajectories in a neighbourhood of an unstable equilibrium. The problem is solved by creating
an event-based control strategy, where an event is triggered by the trajectories leaving the prescribed
neighbourhood. After the event is triggered a pulse is applied, which steers the trajectories towards
the unstable equilibrium. Potentially, this approach can also be applicable to systems, which
are bounded from above and below by monotone ones.
