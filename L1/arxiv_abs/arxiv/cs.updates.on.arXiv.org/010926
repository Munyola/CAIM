Micro- and nanosatellites have become popular platforms for a variety of commercial and scientific
applications, but today are considered suitable mainly for short and low-priority space missions
due to their low reliability. In part, this can be attributed to their reliance upon cheap, low-feature
size, COTS components originally designed for embedded and mobile-market applications, for which
traditional hardware-voting concepts are ineffective. Software-fault-tolerance concepts
have been shown effective for such systems, but have largely been ignored by the space industry due
to low maturity, as most have only been researched in theory. In practice, designers of payload instruments
and miniaturized satellites are usually forced to sacrifice reliability in favor deliver the level
of performance necessary for cutting-edge science and innovative commercial applications. Thus,
we developed a software-fault-tolerance-approach based upon thread-level coarse-grain lockstep,
which was validated using fault-injection. To offer strong long-term fault coverage, our architecture
is implemented as tiled MPSoC on an FPGA, utilizing partial reconfiguration, as well as mixed criticality.
This architecture can satisfy the high performance requirements of current and future scientific
and commercial space missions at very low cost, while offering the strong fault-coverage guarantees
necessary for platform control even for missions with a long duration. This architecture was developed
for a 4-year ESA project. Together with two industrial partners, we are developing a prototype to
then undergo radiation testing.
