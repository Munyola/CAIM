For a future 5G Ethernet-based fronthaul architecture, 100G trunk lines of a transmission distance
up to 10 km standard single mode fiber (SSMF) in combination with cheap grey optics to daisy chain
cell site network interfaces are a promising cost- and power-efficient solution. For such a scenario,
different intensity modulation and direct detect (IMDD) Formats at a data rate of 112 Gb/s, namely
Nyquist four-level pulse amplitude modulation (PAM4), discrete multi-tone Transmission (DMT)
and partial-response (PR) PAM4 are experimentally investigated, using a low-cost electro-absorption
modulated laser (EML), a 25G driver and current state-of-the-art high Speed 84 GS/s CMOS digital-to-analog
converter (DAC) and analog-to-digital converter (ADC) test chips. Each modulation Format is optimized
independently for the desired scenario and their digital signal processing (DSP) requirements
are investigated. The performance of Nyquist PAM4 and PR PAM4 depend very much on the efficiency
of pre- and post-equalization. We show the necessity for at least 11 FFE-taps for pre-emphasis and
up to 41 FFE coefficients at the receiver side. In addition, PR PAM4 requires an MLSE with four states
to decode the signal back to a PAM4 signal. On the contrary, bit- and power-loading (BL, PL) is crucial
for DMT and an FFT length of at least 512 is necessary. With optimized parameters, all Modulation
formats result in a very similar performances, demonstrating a transmission distance of up to 10
km over SSMF with bit error rates (BERs) below a FEC threshold of 4.4E-3, allowing error free transmission.
