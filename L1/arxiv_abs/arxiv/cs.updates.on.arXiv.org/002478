Embedded controllers for cyber-physical systems are often parameterized by look-up maps representing
discretizations of continuous functions on metric spaces. For example, a non-linear control action
may be represented as a table of pre-computed values, and the output action of the controller for
a given input is computed by using interpolation. For industrial-scale control systems, several
man-hours of effort is spent in tuning the values within the look-up maps, and sub-optimal performance
is often associated with inappropriate values in look-up maps. Suppose that during testing, the
controller code is found to have sub-optimal performance. The parameter fault localization problem
asks which parameter values in the code are potential causes of the sub-optimal behavior. We present
a statistical parameter fault localization approach based on binary similarity coefficients
and set spectra methods. Our approach extends previous work on software fault localization to a
quantitative setting where the parameters encode continuous functions over a metric space and
the program is reactive. We have implemented our approach in a simulation workflow for automotive
control systems in Simulink. Given controller code with parameters (including look-up maps),
our framework bootstraps the simulation workflow to return a ranked list of map entries which are
deemed to have most impact on the performance. On a suite of industrial case studies with seeded errors,
our tool was able to precisely identify the location of the errors.
