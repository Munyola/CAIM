We present first-order perturbation analysis of a simple eigenvalue and the corresponding right
and left eigenvectors of a general square matrix, not assumed to be Hermitian or normal. The eigenvalue
result is well known to a broad scientific community. The treatment of eigenvectors is more complicated,
with a perturbation theory that is not so well known outside a community of specialists. We give two
different proofs of the main eigenvector perturbation theorem. The first, inspired by the numerical
linear algebra research community and based on the implicit function theorem, has apparently not
appeared in the literature in this form. The second, based on complex function theory and on eigenprojectors,
as is standard in analytic perturbation theory, is a simplified version of well-known results in
the literature. The second derivation uses a convenient normalization of the right and left eigenvectors
that depends on the perturbation parameter, but although this dates back to the 1950s, it is rarely
discussed in the literature. We then show how the eigenvector perturbation theory is easily extended
to handle other normalizations that are often used in practice. We also explain how to verify the
perturbation results computationally. We conclude with some remarks about difficulties introduced
by multiple eigenvalues and give references to work on perturbation of invariant subspaces corresponding
to multiple or clustered eigenvalues. Throughout the paper we give extensive bibliographic commentary
and references for further reading.
