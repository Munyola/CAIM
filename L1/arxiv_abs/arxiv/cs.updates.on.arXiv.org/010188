In this paper, a block-based inter-band predictor (BIP) with multilayer propagation neural network
model (MLPNN) is presented by a completely new framework. This predictor can combine with diversity
entropy coding methods. Hyperspectral (HS) images are composed by a series high similarity spectral
bands. Our assumption is to use trained MLPNN predict the succeeding bands based on current band
information. The purpose is to explore whether BIP-MLPNN can provide better image predictive results
with high efficiency. The algorithm also changed from the traditional compression methods encoding
images pixel by pixel, the compression process only encodes the weights and the biases vectors of
BIP-MLPNN which require few bits to transfer. The decoder will reconstruct a band by using the same
structure of the network at the encoder side. The BIP-MLPNN decoder does not need to be trained as
the weights and biases have already been transmitted. We can easily reconstruct the succeeding
bands by using the BIP-MLPNN decoder. The experimental results indicate that BIP-MLPNN predictor
outperforms the CCSDS-123 HS image coding standard. Due to a good approximation of the target band,
the proposed method outperforms the CCSDS-123 by more than 2.0dB PSNR image quality in the predicted
bands. Moreover, the proposed method provides high quality image e.g., 30 to 40dB PSNR at very low
bit rate (less than 0.1 bpppb) and outperforms the existing methods e.g., JPEG, 3DSPECK, 3DSPIHT
and in terms of rate-distortion performance.
