Given two matroids $\mathcal{M}_{1} = (E, \mathcal{B}_{1})$ and $\mathcal{M}_{2} = (E, \mathcal{B}_{2})$
on a common ground set $E$ with base sets $\mathcal{B}_{1}$ and $\mathcal{B}_{2}$, some integer
$k \in \mathbb{N}$, and two cost functions $c_{1}, c_{2} \colon E \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$, we consider
the optimization problem to find a basis $X \in \mathcal{B}_{1}$ and a basis $Y \in \mathcal{B}_{2}$
minimizing cost $\sum_{e\in X} c_1(e)+\sum_{e\in Y} c_2(e)$ subject to either a lower bound constraint
$|X \cap Y| \le k$, an upper bound constraint $|X \cap Y| \ge k$, or an equality constraint $|X \cap
Y| = k$ on the size of the intersection of the two bases $X$ and $Y$. The problem with lower bound constraint
turns out to be a generalization of the Recoverable Robust Matroid problem under interval uncertainty
representation for which the question for a strongly polynomial-time algorithm was left as an open
question by Hradovich et al. We show that the two problems with lower and upper bound constraints
on the size of the intersection can be reduced to weighted matroid intersection, and thus be solved
with a strongly polynomial-time primal-dual algorithm. The question whether the problem with
equality constraint can also be solved efficiently turned out to be a lot harder. As our main result,
we present a strongly-polynomial, primal-dual algorithm for the problem with equality constraint
on the size of the intersection. Additionally, we discuss generalizations of the problems from
matroids to polymatroids, and from two to three or more matroids.
