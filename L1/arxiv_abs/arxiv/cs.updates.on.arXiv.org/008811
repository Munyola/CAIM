The increased maturity level of technological achievements towards the realization of the Internet
of Things (IoT) vision allowed sophisticated solutions to emerge, offering reliable monitoring
in highly dynamic environments that lack well-defined and well-designed infrastructures, such
as in the case of disaster scenarios. In this paper, we use a bio-inspired IoT architecture, which
allows flexible creation and discovery of sensor-based services offering self-organization
and self-optimization properties to the dynamic network, in order to make the required monitoring
information available. The main contribution of the paper is the introduction of a new algorithm
for following mobile monitored targets/individuals in the context of an IoT system, especially
a dynamic one as the aforementioned. The devised technique, called Hot-Cold, is able to ensure proximity
maintenance by the tracking robotic device solely based on the strength of the RF signal broadcasted
by the target to communicate its sensors' data. Complete geometrical, numerical, simulation,
and convergence analyses of the proposed technique are thoroughly presented, along with a detailed
simulation-based evaluation that reveals the higher following accuracy of Hot-Cold compared
to the popular concept of trilateration-based tracking. Finally, a prototype of the full architecture
was implemented to demonstrate the applicability of the presented approach for monitoring in dynamic
environments, but also the operability of the introduced tracking technique.
