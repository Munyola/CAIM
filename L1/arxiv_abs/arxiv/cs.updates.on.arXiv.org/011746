Existing item-based collaborative filtering (ICF) methods leverage only the relation of collaborative
similarity. Nevertheless, there exist multiple relations between items in real-world scenarios.
Distinct from the collaborative similarity that implies co-interact patterns from the user perspective,
these relations reveal fine-grained knowledge on items from different perspectives of meta-data,
functionality, etc. However, how to incorporate multiple item relations is less explored in recommendation
research. In this work, we propose Relational Collaborative Filtering (RCF), a general framework
to exploit multiple relations between items in recommender system. We find that both the relation
type and the relation value are crucial in inferring user preference. To this end, we develop a two-level
hierarchical attention mechanism to model user preference. The first-level attention discriminates
which types of relations are more important, and the second-level attention considers the specific
relation values to estimate the contribution of a historical item in recommending the target item.
To make the item embeddings be reflective of the relational structure between items, we further
formulate a task to preserve the item relations, and jointly train it with the recommendation task
of preference modeling. Empirical results on two real datasets demonstrate the strong performance
of RCF. Furthermore, we also conduct qualitative analyses to show the benefits of explanations
brought by the modeling of multiple item relations.
