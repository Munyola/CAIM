We provide a large image parameter dataset extracted from the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)
mission's AIA instrument, for the period of January 2011 through the current date, with the cadence
of six minutes, for nine wavelength channels. The volume of the dataset for each year is just short
of 1 TiB. Towards achieving better results in the region classification of active regions and coronal
holes, we improve upon the performance of a set of ten image parameters, through an in depth evaluation
of various assumptions that are necessary for calculation of these image parameters. Then, where
possible, a method for finding an appropriate settings for the parameter calculations was devised,
as well as a validation task to show our improved results. In addition, we include comparisons of
JP2 and FITS image formats using supervised classification models, by tuning the parameters specific
to the format of the images from which they are extracted, and specific to each wavelength. The results
of these comparisons show that utilizing JP2 images, which are significantly smaller files, is
not detrimental to the region classification task that these parameters were originally intended
for. Finally, we compute the tuned parameters on the AIA images and provide a public API (this http
URL) to access the dataset. This dataset can be used in a range of studies on AIA images, such as content-based
image retrieval or tracking of solar events, where dimensionality reduction on the images is necessary
for feasibility of the tasks.
