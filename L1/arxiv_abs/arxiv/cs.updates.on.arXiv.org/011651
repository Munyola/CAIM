Graph based clustering is one of the major clustering methods. Most of it work in three separate steps:
similarity graph construction, clustering label relaxing and label discretization with k-means.
Such common practice has three disadvantages: 1) the predefined similarity graph is often fixed
and may not be optimal for the subsequent clustering. 2) the relaxing process of cluster labels may
cause significant information loss. 3) label discretization may deviate from the real clustering
result since k-means is sensitive to the initialization of cluster centroids. To tackle these problems,
in this paper, we propose an effective discrete optimal graph clustering (DOGC) framework. A structured
similarity graph that is theoretically optimal for clustering performance is adaptively learned
with a guidance of reasonable rank constraint. Besides, to avoid the information loss, we explicitly
enforce a discrete transformation on the intermediate continuous label, which derives a tractable
optimization problem with discrete solution. Further, to compensate the unreliability of the
learned labels and enhance the clustering accuracy, we design an adaptive robust module that learns
prediction function for the unseen data based on the learned discrete cluster labels. Finally,
an iterative optimization strategy guaranteed with convergence is developed to directly solve
the clustering results. Extensive experiments conducted on both real and synthetic datasets demonstrate
the superiority of our proposed methods compared with several state-of-the-art clustering approaches.
