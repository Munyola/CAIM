Today, software industry has a rapid growth. In order to resist the competition increased by this
growth, software projects need to be developed with higher quality and especially user friendly.
Therefore, the importance of human-computer interaction emerges clearly. In design and development
phases of software projects, the properties of human which is an important agent for interaction
-- such as behavioral, cognitive, perceptive, efficiency and physical factors have to be considered.
This study aims to express the importance of developing softwares by taking into consideration
the human-computer interaction applications. In this context, firstly a wide literature review
is made to examine software development process and human-computer interaction in detail, the
results obtained by using design methods in this process are explicated and the importance of said
interaction is openly expressed with the exemplary applications in the literature. According
to the results of the research, especially in software life cycle, it is observed that rules of interaction
must be implemented before software development, however, these methods are usually included
in software life cycle in the latter stages of software development process. This situation causes
the developed softwares to be user unfriendly and of low quality. Furthermore, it is observed that
when the design methods used in the scope of human-computer interaction are integrated into software
development process during the life cycle, the developed projects are more successful, have better
quality and are more user friendly.
