In this paper, we revisit the parameter learning problem, namely the estimation of model parameters
for Dynamic Bayesian Networks (DBNs). DBNs are directed graphical models of stochastic processes
that encompasses and generalize Hidden Markov models (HMMs) and Linear Dynamical Systems (LDSs).
Whenever we apply these models to economics and finance, we are forced to make some modeling assumptions
about the state dynamics and the graph topology (the DBN structure). These assumptions may be incorrectly
specified and contain some additional noise compared to reality. Trying to use a best fit approach
through maximum likelihood estimation may miss this point and try to fit at any price these models
on data. We present here a new methodology that takes a radical point of view and instead focus on the
final efficiency of our model. Parameters are hence estimated in terms of their efficiency rather
than their distributional fit to the data. The resulting optimization problem that consists in
finding the optimal parameters is a hard problem. We rely on Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution
Strategy (CMA-ES) method to tackle this issue. We apply this method to the seminal problem of trend
detection in financial markets. We see on numerical results that the resulting parameters seem
less error prone to over fitting than traditional moving average cross over trend detection and
perform better. The method developed here for algorithmic trading is general. It can be applied
to other real case applications whenever there is no physical law underlying our DBNs.
