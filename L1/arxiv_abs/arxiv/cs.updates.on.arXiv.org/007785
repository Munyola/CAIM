Channel State Information (CSI) of WiFi signals becomes increasingly attractive in human sensing
applications due to the pervasiveness of WiFi, robustness to illumination and view points, and
little privacy concern comparing to cameras. In majority of existing works, CSI sequences are analyzed
by traditional signal processing approaches. These approaches rely on strictly imposed assumption
on propagation paths, reflection and attenuation of signal interacting with human bodies and indoor
background. This makes existing approaches very difficult to model the delicate body characteristics
and activities in the real applications. To address these issues, we build CSI-Net, a unified Deep
Neural Network (DNN), that fully utilizes the strength of deep feature representation and the power
of existing DNN architectures for CSI-based human sensing problems. Using CSI-Net, we jointly
solved two body characterization problems: biometrics estimation (including body fat, muscle,
water and bone rates) and human identification. We also demonstrated the application of CSI-Net
on two distinctive action recognition tasks: the hand sign recognition (fine-scaled action of
the hand) and falling detection (coarse-scaled motion of the body). Besides the technical contribution
of CSI-Net, we present major discoveries and insights on how the multi-frequency CSI signals are
encoded and processed in DNNs, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first attempt that bridges
the WiFi sensing and deep learning in human sensing problems.
