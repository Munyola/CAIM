The growth of wireless devices affects the availability of limited frequencies or spectrum bands
as it has been known that spectrum bands are a natural resource that cannot be added. Meanwhile, the
licensed frequencies are idle most of the time. Cognitive radio is one of the solutions to solve those
problems. Cognitive radio is a promising technology that allows the unlicensed users, known as
secondary users (SUs) to access licensed bands without making interference to licensed users or
primary users (PUs). As cloud computing has become popular in recent years, cognitive radio networks
(CRNs) can be integrated with the cloud platform. One of the important issues in CRNs is security.
It becomes a problem since CRNs use radio frequencies as a medium for transmitting and CRNs share
the same issues with wireless communication systems. Another critical issue in CRNs is performance.
Security has an adverse effect to performance and there are trade-offs between them. The goal of
this paper is to investigate the performance related to security trade-off in CRNs with supporting
cloud platforms. Furthermore, Queuing Network Models with preemptive resume and preemptive repeat
identical priority are applied in this project to measure the impact of security on performance
in CRNs with or without cloud platform. The generalized exponential (GE) type distribution is used
to reflect the bursty inter-arrival and service times at the servers. The results show that the best
performance is obtained when security is disabled and the cloud platform is enabled.
