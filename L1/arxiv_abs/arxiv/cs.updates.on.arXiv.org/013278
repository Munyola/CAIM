Myocardial infarction (MI), also known as a cardiac attack, is one of the common cardiac disorders
occurs when one or more coronary arteries are blocked. Hence, early detection of MI is critical for
the reduction of the rising of the death rate. The cardiologists use the electrocardiogram (ECG)
as a diagnostic tool to monitor and reveal the MI signals. However, all the MI signals are not constant
and noisy, so it is tough to detect or observe these signals manually. Several computer-aided diagnosis
systems (CADs) have been suggested to solve these difficulties. In this paper, we have proposed
an effective CAD system to detect MI signals using the two-dimensional convolution neural network
(CNN). In this study, we have employed two ways of the transfer learning technique to retrain the
pre-trained VGG-Net and obtained two new networks VGG-MI1 and VGG-MI2. Moreover, the heartbeat
data augmentation techniques are employed to increase the classification performance. We have
utilized two-second ECG signals from the PTB database, which has been widely employed in MI detection
studies. In case of using VGG-MI1, we achieved an accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 99.02%,
98.76%, and 99.17% respectively and we achieved an accuracy of 99.22%, a sensitivity of 99.15%,
and a specificity of 99.49% when using VGG-MI2. Results showed that the proposed algorithm is more
efficient than the state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy sensitivity, and specificity.
Finally, the proposed algorithm can assist the specialists to detect the MI signals more precisely.
