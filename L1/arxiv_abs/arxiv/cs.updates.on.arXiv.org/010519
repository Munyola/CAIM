Sampling-based roadmaps have been popular methods for robot motion and task planning, given their
generality and effectiveness in high-dimensional configuration spaces (C-spaces). Following
advances in random geometric graphs, a seminal analysis result argued the conditions for asymptotic
optimality of these approaches. In particular, a connection radius for each new C-space sample
needs to be in the order of $ \gamma (\log n / n)^{1/d} $, where $n$ is the existing number of roadmap
nodes and $d$ is the dimensionality of the C-space. This prior analysis, as well as subsequent efforts,
also specified a sufficient lower bound for the constant $\gamma$ for asymptotic optimality. All
of these results assumed that for a finite number of samples there is a path with positive clearance
from obstacles. Nevertheless, manipulation task planning requires solving problems were the
start and the goal lie on the boundary of the configuration space. The current work builds on previous
work, to: a) obtain an estimate of $\gamma$ in terms of a bound on the dispersion of the samples; and
b) propose the modifications necessary to make asymptotic optimality hold when the start and goal
lie on the boundary of the C-space under certain assumptions regarding the boundary. The last point
generalizes these properties to manipulation task planning and reduces the method's requirements
for a connection radius that achieves asymptotic optimality in this domain as well as the assumptions
regarding the boundary's smoothness relative to prior work.
