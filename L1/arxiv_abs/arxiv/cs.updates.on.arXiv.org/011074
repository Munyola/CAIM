This work introduces an innovative parallel, fully-distributed finite element framework for
growing geometries and its application to metal additive manufacturing. It is well-known that
virtual part design and qualification in additive manufacturing requires highly-accurate multiscale
and multiphysics analyses. Only high performance computing tools are able to handle such complexity
in time frames compatible with time-to-market. However, efficiency, without loss of accuracy,
has rarely held the centre stage in the numerical community. Here, in contrast, the framework is
designed to adequately exploit the resources of high-end distributed-memory machines. It is grounded
on three building blocks: (1) Hierarchical adaptive mesh refinement with octree-based meshes;
(2) a parallel strategy to model the growth of the geometry; (3) state-of-the-art parallel iterative
linear solvers. Computational experiments consider the heat transfer analysis at the part scale
of the printing process by powder-bed technologies. After verification against a 3D benchmark,
a strong-scaling analysis assesses performance and identifies major sources of parallel overhead.
A third numerical example examines the efficiency and robustness of (2) in a curved 3D shape. Unprecedented
parallelism and scalability were achieved in this work. Hence, this framework contributes to take
on higher complexity and/or accuracy, not only of part-scale simulations of metal or polymer additive
manufacturing, but also in welding, sedimentation, atherosclerosis, or any other physical problem
where the physical domain of interest grows in time.
