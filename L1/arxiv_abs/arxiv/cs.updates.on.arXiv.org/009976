Storage systems often rely on multiple copies of the same compressed data, enabling recovery in
case of binary data errors, of course, at the expense of a higher storage cost. In this paper we show
that a wiser method of duplication entails great potential benefits for data types tolerating approximate
representations, like images and videos. We propose a method to produce a set of distinct compressed
representations for a given signal, such that any subset of them allows reconstruction of the signal
at a quality depending only on the number of compressed representations utilized. Essentially,
we implement the holographic representation idea, where all the representations are equally important
in refining the reconstruction. Here we propose to exploit the shift sensitivity of common compression
processes and generate holographic representations via compression of various shifts of the signal.
Two implementations for the idea, based on standard compression methods, are presented: the first
is a simple, optimization-free design. The second approach originates in a challenging rate-distortion
optimization, mitigated by the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), leading to
a process of repeatedly applying standard compression techniques. Evaluation of the approach,
in conjunction with the JPEG2000 image compression standard, shows the effectiveness of the optimization
in providing compressed holographic representations that, by means of an elementary reconstruction
process, enable impressive gains of several dBs in PSNR over exact duplications.
