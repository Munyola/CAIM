This paper studies the convergence of the estimation error processes and the characterization
of the corresponding invariant measure in distributed Kalman filtering for potentially unstable
and large linear dynamic systems. A gossip based information exchanging scheme named Modified
Gossip Interactive Kalman Filtering (M-GIKF) is proposed, where sensors swap their filtered states
(estimates and error covariances) and also propagate their observations via inter-sensor communications
of rate $\overline{\gamma}$, where $\overline{\gamma}$ is defined as the averaged number of inter-sensor
message passages per signal evolution epoch. We interpret the filtered states as stochastic particles
with local interaction and show that the conditional estimation error covariance sequence at each
sensor under M-GIKF evolves as a random Riccati equation (RRE) with Markov modulated switching.
By formulating the RRE as a random dynamical system (RDS), it is shown that the conditional estimation
error covariance at each sensor converges weakly (in distribution) to a unique invariant measure
from any initial state. Further we prove that as $\overline{\gamma} \rightarrow \infty$ this invariant
measure satisfies the Large Deviation (LD) upper and lower bounds, implying that this measure exponentially
converges to the Dirac measure $\delta_{P^*}$, where $P^*$ is the stable error covariance in centralized
Kalman filtering. The LD results answer a fundamental question on how to quantify the rate at which
the distributed scheme approaches the centralized performance as the inter-sensor communication
rate increases.
