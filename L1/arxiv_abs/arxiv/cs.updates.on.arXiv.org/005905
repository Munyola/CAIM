We propose a novel computational strategy for de novo design of molecules with desired properties
termed ReLeaSE (Reinforcement Learning for Structural Evolution). Based on deep and reinforcement
learning approaches, ReLeaSE integrates two deep neural networks - generative and predictive
- that are trained separately but employed jointly to generate novel targeted chemical libraries.
ReLeaSE employs simple representation of molecules by their SMILES strings only. Generative models
are trained with stack-augmented memory network to produce chemically feasible SMILES strings,
and predictive models are derived to forecast the desired properties of the de novo generated compounds.
In the first phase of the method, generative and predictive models are trained separately with a
supervised learning algorithm. In the second phase, both models are trained jointly with the reinforcement
learning approach to bias the generation of new chemical structures towards those with the desired
physical and/or biological properties. In the proof-of-concept study, we have employed the ReLeaSE
method to design chemical libraries with a bias toward structural complexity or biased toward compounds
with either maximal, minimal, or specific range of physical properties such as melting point or
hydrophobicity, as well as to develop novel putative inhibitors of JAK2. The approach proposed
herein can find a general use for generating targeted chemical libraries of novel compounds optimized
for either a single desired property or multiple properties.
