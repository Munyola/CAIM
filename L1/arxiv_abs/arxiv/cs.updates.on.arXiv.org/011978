We present an algorithm for approximating a function defined over a $d$-dimensional manifold utilizing
only noisy function values at locations sampled from the manifold with noise. To produce the approximation
we do not require any knowledge regarding the manifold other than its dimension $d$. We use the Manifold
Moving Least-Squares approach of (Sober and Levin 2016) to reconstruct the atlas of charts and the
approximation is built on-top of those charts. The resulting approximant is shown to be a function
defined over a neighborhood of a manifold, approximating the originally sampled manifold. In other
words, given a new point, located near the manifold, the approximation can be evaluated directly
on that point. We prove that our construction yields a smooth function, and in case of noiseless samples
the approximation order is $\mathcal{O}(h^{m+1})$, where $h$ is a local density of sample parameter
(i.e., the fill distance) and $m$ is the degree of a local polynomial approximation, used in our algorithm.
In addition, the proposed algorithm has linear time complexity with respect to the ambient-space's
dimension. Thus, we are able to avoid the computational complexity, commonly encountered in high
dimensional approximations, without having to perform non-linear dimension reduction, which
inevitably introduces distortions to the geometry of the data. Additionaly, we show numerical
experiments that the proposed approach compares favorably to statistical approaches for regression
over manifolds and show its potential.
