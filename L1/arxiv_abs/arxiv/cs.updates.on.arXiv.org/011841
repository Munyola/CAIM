The declining price anomaly states that the price weakly decreases when multiple copies of an item
are sold sequentially over time. The anomaly has been observed in a plethora of practical applications.
On the theoretical side, Gale and Stegeman proved that the anomaly is guaranteed to hold in full information
sequential auctions with exactly two buyers. We prove that the declining price anomaly is not guaranteed
in full information sequential auctions with three or more buyers. This result applies to both first-price
and second-price sequential auctions. Moreover, it applies regardless of the tie-breaking rule
used to generate equilibria in these sequential auctions. To prove this result we provide a refined
treatment of subgame perfect equilibria that survive the iterative deletion of weakly dominated
strategies and use this framework to experimentally generate a very large number of random sequential
auction instances. In particular, our experiments produce an instance with three bidders and eight
items that, for a specific tie-breaking rule, induces a non-monotonic price trajectory. Theoretic
analyses are then applied to show that this instance can be used to prove that for every possible tie-breaking
rule there is a sequential auction on which it induces a non-monotonic price trajectory. On the other
hand, our experiments show that non-monotonic price trajectories are extremely rare. In over six
million experiments only a 0.000183 proportion of the instances violated the declining price anomaly.
