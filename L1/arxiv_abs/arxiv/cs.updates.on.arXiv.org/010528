Learning models of user behaviour is an important problem that is broadly applicable across many
application domains requiring human-robot interaction. In this work we show that it is possible
to learn a generative model for distinct user behavioral types, extracted from human demonstrations,
by enforcing clustering of preferred task solutions within the latent space. We use this model to
differentiate between user types and to find cases with overlapping solutions. Moreover, we can
alter an initially guessed solution to satisfy the preferences that constitute a particular user
type by backpropagating through the learned differentiable model. An advantage of structuring
generative models in this way is that it allows us to extract causal relationships between symbols
that might form part of the user's specification of the task, as manifested in the demonstrations.
We show that the proposed method is capable of correctly distinguishing between three user types,
who differ in degrees of cautiousness in their motion, while performing the task of moving objects
with a kinesthetically driven robot in a tabletop environment. Our method successfully identifies
the correct type, within the specified time, in 99% [97.8 - 99.8] of the cases, which outperforms
an IRL baseline. We also show that our proposed method correctly changes a default trajectory to
one satisfying a particular user specification even with unseen objects. The resulting trajectory
is shown to be directly implementable on a PR2 humanoid robot completing the same task.
