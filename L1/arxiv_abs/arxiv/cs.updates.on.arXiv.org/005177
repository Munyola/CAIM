In this paper a multi-objective mathematical model has been used to optimize grinding parameters
include workpiece speed, depth of cut and wheel speed which highly affect the final surface quality.
The mathematical model of the optimization problem consists of three conflict objective functions
subject to wheel wear and production rate constraints. Exact methods can solve the NLP model in few
seconds, therefore using Meta-heuristic algorithms which provide near optimal solutions in not
suitable. Considering this, five Multi-Objective Decision Making methods have been used to solve
the multi-objective mathematical model using GAMS software to achieve the optimal parameters
of the grinding process. The Multi-Objective Decision Making methods provide different effective
solutions where the decision maker can choose each solution in different situations. Different
criteria have been considered to evaluate the performance of the five Multi-Objective Decision
Making methods. Also, Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution method
has been used to obtain the priority of each method and determine which Multi-Objective Decision
Making method performs better considering all criteria simultaneously. The results indicated
that Weighted Sum Method and Goal programming method are the best Multi-Objective Decision Making
methods. The Weighted Sum Method and Goal programming provided solutions which are competitive
to each other. In addition, these methods obtained solutions which have minimum grinding time,
cost and surface roughness among other Multi-Objective Decision Making methods.
