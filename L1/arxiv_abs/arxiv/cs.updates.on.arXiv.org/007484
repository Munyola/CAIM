In the Sequential Selection Problem (SSP), immediate and irrevocable decisions need to be made
while candidates from a finite set are being examined one-by-one. The goal is to assign a limited
number of $b$ available jobs to the best possible candidates. Standard SSP variants begin with an
empty selection set (cold-starting) and perform the selection process once (single-round), over
a single candidate set. In this paper we introduce the Multi-round Sequential Selection Problem
(MSSP) which launches a new round of sequential selection each time a new set of candidates becomes
available. Each new round has at hand the output of the previous one, i.e. its $b$ selected employees,
and tries to update optimally that selection by reassigning each job at most once. Our setting allows
changes to take place between two subsequent selection rounds: resignations of previously selected
subjects or/and alterations of the quality score across the population. The challenge for a selection
strategy is thus to efficiently adapt to such changes. For this novel problem we adopt a cutoff-based
approach, where a precise number of candidates should be rejected first before starting to select.
We set a rank-based objective of the process over the final job-to-employee assignment and we investigate
analytically the optimal cutoff values with respect to the important parameters of the problem.
Finally, we present experimental results that compare the efficiency of different selection strategies,
as well as their convergence rates towards the optimal solution in the case of stationary score distributions.
