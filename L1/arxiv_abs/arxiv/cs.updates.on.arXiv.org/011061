We propose a new adversarial attack on frequency-hopping based wireless communication between
two users, namely Alice and Bob. In this attack, the adversary, referred to as Eve, instantaneously
modifies the transmitted signal by Alice before forwarding it to Bob within the symbol-period.
We show that this attack forces Bob to incorporate Eve's signal in the decoding process; otherwise,
treating it as noise would further degrade the performance akin to jamming. Through this attack,
we show that Eve can convert a slow-fading channel between Alice and Bob to a rapid-fading one by modifying
every transmitted symbol independently. As a result, neither pilot-assisted coherent detection
techniques nor blind-detection methods are directly applicable as countermeasures. As potential
mitigation strategies, we explore the applicability of frequency-hopping along with (i) On-Off
keying (OOK) and (ii) Binary Frequency-Shift-Keying (FSK) as modulation schemes. In the case of
OOK, the attacker attempts to introduce deep-fades on the tone carrying the information bit, whereas
in the case of BFSK, the attacker pours comparable energy levels on the tones carrying bit-$0$ and
bit-$1$, thereby degrading the performance. Based on extensive analyses and experimental results,
we show that (i) when using OOK, Bob must be equipped with a large number of receive antennas to reliably
detect Alice's signal, and (ii) when using BFSK, Alice and Bob must agree upon a secret-key to randomize
the location of the tones carrying the bits, in addition to randomizing the carrier-frequency of
communication.
