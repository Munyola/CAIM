Speech rhythms have been dealt with in three main ways: from the introspective analyses of rhythm
as a correlate of syllable and foot timing in linguistics and applied linguistics, through analyses
of durations of segments of utterances associated with consonantal and vocalic properties, syllables,
feet and words, to models of rhythms in speech production and perception as physical oscillations.
The present study avoids introspection and human-filtered annotation methods and extends the
signal processing paradigm of amplitude envelope spectrum analysis by adding an additional analytic
step of edge detection, and postulating the co-existence of multiple speech rhythms in rhythm zones
marked by identifiable edges (Rhythm Zone Theory, RZT). An exploratory investigation of the utility
of RZT is conducted, suggesting that native and non-native readings of the same text are distinct
sub-genres of read speech: a reading by a US native speaker and non-native readings by relatively
low-performing Cantonese adult learners of English. The study concludes by noting that with the
methods used, RZT can distinguish between the speech rhythms of well-defined sub-genres of native
speaker reading vs. non-native learner reading, but needs further refinement in order to be applied
to the paradoxically more complex speech of low-performing language learners, whose speech rhythms
are co-determined by non-fluency and disfluency factors in addition to well-known linguistic
factors of grammar, vocabulary and discourse constraints.
