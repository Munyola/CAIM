Since the transport sector accounts for one of the highest shares of greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions,
several existing proposals state the idea to control the by the transportation sector caused GHG
emissions through an Emission Trading Systems (ETS). However, most existing approaches integrate
GHG emissions through the fuel consumption and car registration, limiting the tracing of emissions
in more complex modes e.g. shared vehicles, shared rides and even public transportation. This paper
presents a new design of a user-centric ETS and its implementation as a carbon Blockchain framework
for Smart Mobility Data-market (cBSMD). The cBSMD allows for the seamless transactions of token-equivalent
GHG emissions when realizing a trip, or an emission trading action as well as the transaction of individual,
service or system-wide emission performance data. We demonstrate an instance of the cBSMD implementation
for the transactions of an ETS where all travellers receive a certain amount of emission credits
in the form of tokens, linked to the GHG price and a total emission cap. Travellers use their tokens
each time they emit GHG when travelling in a multi-modal network, purchase tokens for a given trip
when they have an insufficient token amount or sell when having a surplus of tokens due to a lower amount
of emitted GHG. This instance of cBSMD is then applied to a case-study of 24hours of mobility of 3,186
travellers from Oakville, Ontario, Canada, where we showcase different cBSMD transactions and
analyze token usage and emission performance.
