In this paper we consider the question what is the scientific and career performance of principal
investigators (PIs) of publicly funded research projects compared to scientific performance
of all researchers. Our study is based on high quality data about (i) research projects awarded in
Slovenia in the period 1994--2016 (7508 projects with 2725 PIs in total) and (ii) about scientific
productivity of all researchers in Slovenia that were active in the period 1970-2016 - there are
19598 such researchers in total, including the PIs. We compare average productivity, collaboration,
internationality and interdisciplinarity of PIs and of all active researchers. Our analysis shows
that for all four indicators the average performance of PIs is much higher compared to average performance
of all active researchers. Additionally, we analyze careers of both groups of researchers. The
results show that the PIs have on average longer and more fruitful career compared to all active researchers,
with regards to all career indicators. On long run, the PIs leading the research programs (the most
prestigious grants) on average demonstrate the best scientific performance. In the last part of
the paper we study 23 co-authorship networks, spanned by all active researchers in the periods 1970-1994,
..., 1970-2016. We find out that they are well connected and that PIs are well distributed across
these networks forming their backbones. We believe that our study shed new light to the relations
between the public funding of the science and the scientific output.
