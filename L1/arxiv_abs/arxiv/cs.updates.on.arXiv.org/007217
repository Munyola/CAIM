News recommender systems are aimed to personalize users experiences and help them to discover relevant
articles from a large and dynamic search space. Therefore, news domain is a challenging scenario
for recommendations, due to its sparse user profiling, fast growing number of items, accelerated
item's value decay, and users preferences dynamic shift. Some promising results have been recently
achieved by the usage of Deep Learning techniques on Recommender Systems, specially for item's
feature extraction and for session-based recommendations with Recurrent Neural Networks. In
this paper, its presented a Deep Learning architecture for Session-Based recommendations of News
articles. This architecture is composed of two modules, the first responsible to learn news articles
representations, based on their text and metadata, and the second module aimed to provide session-based
recommendations using Recurrent Neural Networks. The recommendation task addressed in this work
is next-item prediction for user sessions: "what is the next most likely article a user might read
in a session?" User session context is leveraged by the architecture to provide additional information
in such extreme cold-start scenario of news recommendation. Users' behavior and item features
are both merged in an hybrid recommendation approach. A temporal offline evaluation method is also
proposed as a complementary contribution, for a more realistic evaluation of such task, considering
dynamic factors that affect global readership interests like popularity, recency, and seasonality.
