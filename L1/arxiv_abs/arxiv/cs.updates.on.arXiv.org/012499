Enhancing the earthquake behavioral responses and post-earthquake evacuation preparedness
of building occupants is beneficial to increasing their chances of survival and reducing casualties
after the main shock of an earthquake. Traditionally, training approaches such as seminars, posters,
videos or drills are applied to enhance preparedness. However, they are not highly engaging and
have limited sensory capabilities to mimic life-threatening scenarios for the purpose of training
potential participants. Immersive Virtual Reality (IVR) and Serious Games (SG) as innovative
digital technologies can be used to create training tools to overcome these limitations. In this
study, we propose an IVR SG-based training system to improve earthquake behavioral responses and
post-earthquake evacuation preparedness. Auckland City Hospital was chosen as a case study to
test our IVR SG training system. A set of learning outcomes based on best evacuation practice has
been identified and embedded into several training scenarios of the IVR SG. Hospital staff (healthcare
and administrative professionals) and visitors were recruited as participants to be exposed to
these training scenarios. Participants' preparedness has been measured along two dimensions:
1) Knowledge about best evacuation practice; 2) Self-efficacy in dealing with earthquake emergencies.
Assessment results showed that there was a significant knowledge and self-efficacy increase after
the training. And participants acknowledged that it was easy and engaging to learn best evacuation
practice knowledge through the IVR SG training system.
