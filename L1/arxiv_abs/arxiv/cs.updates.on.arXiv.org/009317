We consider the economic dispatch (ED) for an Energy Internet composed of energy routers (ERs),
interconnected microgrids and main grid. The microgrid consists of several bus nodes associated
with distributed generators (DGs) and intelligent control units (ICUs). We propose a distributed
ED algorithm for the grid-connected microgrid, where each ICU iterates the incremental cost of
each DG and the estimation for the average power mismatch of the whole microgrid by leader-following
and average consensus algorithms, respectively. The energy router iterates the incremental power
exchanged with the distribution system. By constructing an auxiliary consensus system, we prove
that if the network topology of the Energy Internet contains a spanning tree with the energy router
as the root and there is a path from each bus node to the energy router, then the incremental costs of
all DGs converge to the electricity price of the distribution system, the power supply and demand
achieves balance and the ED achieves optimal asymptotically. Furthermore, we propose an autonomous
distributed ED algorithm covering both grid-connected and isolated modes of the microgrid by feeding
back the estimated average power mismatch for updating the incremental costs. It is proved that
if the network topology of the microgrid is connected and there exists a bus node bi-directionally
neighboring the energy router, then the microgrid can switches between the two modes reliably.
The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.
