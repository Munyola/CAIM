According to the World Health Organization, 285 million people worldwide live with visual impairment.
The most commonly used imaging technique for diagnosis in ophthalmology is optical coherence tomography
(OCT). However, analysis of retinal OCT requires trained ophthalmologists and time, making a comprehensive
early diagnosis unlikely. A recent study established a diagnostic tool based on convolutional
neural networks (CNN), which was trained on a large database of retinal OCT images. The performance
of the tool in classifying retinal conditions was on par to that of trained medical experts. However,
the training of these networks is based on an enormous amount of labeled data, which is expensive
and difficult to obtain. Therefore, this paper describes a method based on variational autoencoder
regularization that improves classification performance when using a limited amount of labeled
data. This work uses a two-path CNN model combining a classification network with an autoencoder
(AE) for regularization. The key idea behind this is to prevent overfitting when using a limited
training dataset size with small number of patients. Results show superior classification performance
compared to a pre-trained and fully fine-tuned baseline ResNet-34. Clustering of the latent space
in relation to the disease class is distinct. Neural networks for disease classification on OCTs
can benefit from regularization using variational autoencoders when trained with limited amount
of patient data. Especially in the medical imaging domain, data annotated by experts is expensive
to obtain.
