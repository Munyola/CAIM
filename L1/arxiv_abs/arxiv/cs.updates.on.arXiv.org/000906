Feature-based object matching is a fundamental problem for many applications in computer vision,
such as object recognition, 3D reconstruction, tracking, and motion segmentation. In this work,
we consider simultaneously matching object instances in a set of images, where both inlier and outlier
features are extracted. The task is to identify the inlier features and establish their consistent
correspondences across the image set. This is a challenging combinatorial problem, and the problem
complexity grows exponentially with the image number. To this end, we propose a novel framework,
termed ROML, to address this problem. ROML optimizes simultaneously a partial permutation matrix
(PPM) for each image, and feature correspondences are established by the obtained PPMs. Our contributions
are summarized as follows: (1) We formulate the problem as rank and sparsity minimization for PPM
optimization, and treat simultaneous optimization of multiple PPMs as a regularized consensus
problem in the context of distributed optimization. (2) We use the ADMM method to solve the thus formulated
ROML problem, in which a subproblem associated with a single PPM optimization appears to be a difficult
integer quadratic program (IQP). We prove that under wildly applicable conditions, this IQP is
equivalent to a linear sum assignment problem (LSAP), which can be efficiently solved to an exact
solution. (3) Our framework is independent of the domain of applications and type of features. (4)
Extensive experiments on object matching, tracking, and localization show the superiority of
our method over existing ones.
