Pay-it-forward reciprocity encourages the spread of prosocial behavior. However, existing empirical
evidence of pay-it-forward behavior has been largely based on laboratory experiments, which are
limited in sample size and external validity. Extending this research, our study uses a natural
experiment to examine pay-it-forward reciprocity in a real-life context with a large-scale dataset
of 3.4 million users of an online platform. Our natural experiment is enabled by the randomness in
the mechanism that WeChat, a Chinese online social networking platform, uses to split an online
monetary gift (also known as a "red packet") to its recipients. Our results show that recipients
on average pay forward 10.34% of the amount they receive. We further find that "Luckiest draw" recipients,
or those who obtain the largest shares of their corresponding red packets, are 1.5 times more likely
to pay it forward than other recipients. Our analyses indicate that in a multiple recipient setting,
users' pay-it-forward behavior is enforced by a group norm that luckiest draw recipients should
send the first subsequent gift and promoted by their distributional social preferences of the random
amounts split by the platform. Finally, our study shows that those recipients without any in-group
friends do pay it forward, even though their pay-it-forward behavior is less likely to be driven
by their reputational concerns among acquaintances. Overall, our work provides insights into
mechanisms and conditions that encourage pay-it-forward reciprocity, which have implications
for fostering prosocial behavior.
