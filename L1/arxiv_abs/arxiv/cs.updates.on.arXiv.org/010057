An (improper) graph colouring has "defect" $d$ if each monochromatic subgraph has maximum degree
at most $d$, and has "clustering" $c$ if each monochromatic component has at most $c$ vertices. This
paper studies defective and clustered list-colourings for graphs with given maximum average degree.
We prove that every graph with maximum average degree less than $\frac{2d+2}{d+2} k$ is $k$-choosable
with defect $d$. This improves upon a similar result by Havet and Sereni [J. Graph Theory, 2006].
For clustered choosability of graphs with maximum average degree $m$, no $(1-\epsilon)m$ bound
on the number of colours was previously known. The above result with $d=1$ solves this problem. It
implies that every graph with maximum average degree $m$ is $\lfloor{\frac{3}{4}m+1}\rfloor$-choosable
with clustering 2. This extends a result of Kopreski and Yu [Discrete Math., 2017] to the setting
of choosability. We then prove two results about clustered choosability that explore the trade-off
between the number of colours and the clustering. In particular, we prove that every graph with maximum
average degree $m$ is $\lfloor{\frac{7}{10}m+1}\rfloor$-choosable with clustering $9$, and
is $\lfloor{\frac{2}{3}m+1}\rfloor$-choosable with clustering $O(m)$. As an example, the later
result implies that every biplanar graph is 8-choosable with bounded clustering. This is the best
known result for the clustered version of the earth-moon problem. The results extend to the setting
where we only consider the maximum average degree of subgraphs with at least some number of vertices.
Several applications are presented.
