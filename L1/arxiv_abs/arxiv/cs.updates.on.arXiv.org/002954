Pandemic influenza has the epidemic potential to kill millions of people. While various preventive
measures exist (i.a., vaccination and school closures), deciding on strategies that lead to their
most effective and efficient use, remains challenging. To this end, individual-based epidemiological
models are essential to assist decision makers in determining the best strategy to curve epidemic
spread. However, individual-based models are computationally intensive and therefore it is pivotal
to identify the optimal strategy using a minimal amount of model evaluations. Additionally, as
epidemiological modeling experiments need to be planned, a computational budget needs to be specified
a priori. Consequently, we present a new sampling method to optimize the evaluation of preventive
strategies using fixed budget best-arm identification algorithms. We use epidemiological modeling
theory to derive knowledge about the reward distribution which we exploit using Bayesian best-arm
identification algorithms (i.e., Top-two Thompson sampling and BayesGap). We evaluate these
algorithms in a realistic experimental setting and demonstrate that it is possible to identify
the optimal strategy using only a limited number of model evaluations, i.e., 2-to-3 times faster
compared to the uniform sampling method, the predominant technique used for epidemiological decision
making in the literature. Finally, we contribute and evaluate a statistic for Top-two Thompson
sampling to inform the decision makers about the confidence of an arm recommendation.
