Navigation is known to be an effective complement to search. In addition to data discovery, navigation
can help users develop a conceptual model of what types of data are available. In data lakes, there
has been considerable research on dataset discovery using search. We consider the complementary
problem of creating an effective navigation structure over a data lake. We define an organization
as a navigation structure (graph) containing nodes representing sets of attributes within a data
lake. An edge represents a subset relationship. We propose a novel problem, the data lake organization
problem where the goal is to find an organization that allows a user to most efficiently find attributes.
We present a new probabilistic model of how users interact with an organization and define the likelihood
of a user finding an attribute using the organization. Our approach uses attribute values and metadata
(when available). For data lakes with little or no metadata, we propose a way of creating metadata
using metadata available in other lakes. We propose an approximate algorithm for the organization
problem and show its effectiveness on a synthetic benchmark. Finally, we construct an organization
on attributes of a real data lake containing data from federal Open Data portals and show that the
organization improves the expected probability of discovering attributes over a baseline. Using
a second real data lake with no metadata, we show how metadata can be inferred that is effective in
enabling organization creation.
