Fog computing is transforming the network edge into an intelligent platform by bringing storage,
computing, control, and networking functions closer to end-users, things, and sensors. How to
allocate multiple resource types (e.g., CPU, memory, bandwidth) of capacity-limited heterogeneous
fog nodes to competing services with diverse requirements and preferences in a fair and efficient
manner is a challenging task. To this end, we propose a novel market-based resource allocation framework
in which the services act as buyers and fog resources act as divisible goods in the market. The proposed
framework aims to compute a market equilibrium (ME) solution at which every service obtains its
favorite resource bundle under the budget constraint while the system achieves high resource utilization.
This work extends the General Equilibrium literature by considering a practical case of satiated
utility functions. Also, we introduce the notions of non-wastefulness and frugality for equilibrium
selection, and rigorously demonstrate that all the non-wasteful and frugal ME are the optimal solutions
to a convex program. Furthermore, the proposed equilibrium is shown to possess salient fairness
properties including envy-freeness, sharing-incentive, and proportionality. Another major
contribution of this work is to develop a privacy-preserving distributed algorithm, which is of
independent interest, for computing an ME while allowing market participants to obfuscate their
private information. Finally, extensive performance evaluation is conducted to verify our theoretical
analyses.
