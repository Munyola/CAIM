Big Data technology is described. Big data is a popular term used to describe the exponential growth
and availability of data, both structured and unstructured. There is constructed dataspace architecture.
Dataspace has focused solely - and passionately - on providing unparalleled expertise in business
intelligence and data warehousing strategy and implementation. Dataspaces are an abstraction
in data management that aims to overcome some of the problems encountered in data integration system.
In our case it is block vector for heterogeneous data representation. Traditionally, data integration
and data exchange systems have aimed to offer many of the purported services of dataspace systems.
Dataspaces can be viewed as a next step in the evolution of data integration architectures, but are
distinct from current data integration systems in the following way. Data integration systems
require semantic integration before any services can be provided. Hence, although there is not
a single schema to which all the data conforms and the data resides in a multitude of host systems,
the data integration system knows the precise relationships between the terms used in each schema.
As a result, significant up-front effort is required in order to set up a data integration system.
For realization of data integration from different sources we used SQL Server Integration Services,
SSIS. For developing the portal as an architectural pattern there is used pattern Model-View-Controller
(MVC). There is specifics debug operation data space as a complex system. The query translator in
Backus/Naur Form is give.
