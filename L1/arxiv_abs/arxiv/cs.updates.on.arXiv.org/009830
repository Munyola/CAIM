We present a novel architectural enhancement of Channel Boosting in deep convolutional neural
network (CNN). This idea of Channel Boosting exploits both the channel dimension of CNN (learning
from multiple input channels) and Transfer learning (TL). TL is utilized at two different stages;
channel generation and channel exploitation. In the proposed methodology, a deep CNN is boosted
by various channels available through TL from already trained Deep Neural Networks, in addition
to its own original channel. The deep architecture of CNN then exploits the original and boosted
channels down the stream for learning discriminative patterns. Churn prediction in telecom is
a challenging task due to high dimensionality and imbalanced nature of the data and it is therefore
used to evaluate the performance of the proposed Channel Boosted CNN (CB CNN). In the first phase,
discriminative informative features are being extracted using a staked autoencoder, and then
in the second phase, these features are combined with the original features to form Channel Boosted
images. Finally, the knowledge gained by a pre trained CNN is exploited by employing TL. The results
are promising and show the ability of the Channel Boosting concept in learning complex classification
problem by discerning even minute differences in churners and non churners. The proposed work validates
the concept observed from the evolution of recent CNN architectures that the innovative restructuring
of a CNN architecture may increase the representative capacity of the network.
