Many real-world video sequences cannot be conveniently categorized as general or degenerate;
in such cases, imposing a false dichotomy in using the fundamental matrix or homography model for
motion segmentation on video sequences would lead to difficulty. Even when we are confronted with
a general scene-motion, the fundamental matrix approach as a model for motion segmentation still
suffers from several defects, which we discuss in this paper. The full potential of the fundamental
matrix approach could only be realized if we judiciously harness information from the simpler homography
model. From these considerations, we propose a multi-model spectral clustering framework that
synergistically combines multiple models (homography and fundamental matrix) together. We show
that the performance can be substantially improved in this way. For general motion segmentation
tasks, the number of independently moving objects is often unknown a priori and needs to be estimated
from the observations. This is referred to as model selection and it is essentially still an open
research problem. In this work, we propose a set of model selection criteria balancing data fidelity
and model complexity. We perform extensive testing on existing motion segmentation datasets with
both segmentation and model selection tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance on all of
them; we also put forth a more realistic and challenging dataset adapted from the KITTI benchmark,
containing real-world effects such as strong perspectives and strong forward translations not
seen in the traditional datasets.
