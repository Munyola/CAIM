Partial Set Cover (PSC) is a generalization of the well-studied Set Cover problem (SC). In PSC the
input consists of an integer $k$ and a set system $(U,S)$ where $U$ is a finite set, and $S \subseteq
2^U$ is a collection of subsets of $U$. The goal is to find a subcollection $S' \subseteq S$ of smallest
cardinality such that sets in $S'$ cover at least $k$ elements of $U$; that is $|\cup_{A \in S'} A|
\ge k$. SC is a special case of PSC when $k = |U|$. In the weighted version each set $X \in S$ has a non-negative
weight $w(X)$ and the goal is to find a minimum weight subcollection to cover $k$ elements. Approximation
algorithms for SC have been adapted to obtain comparable algorithms for PSC in various interesting
cases. In recent work Inamdar and Varadarajan, motivated by geometric set systems, obtained a simple
and elegant approach to reduce PSC to SC via the natural LP relaxation. They showed that if a deletion-closed
family of SC admits a $\beta$-approximation via the natural LP relaxation, then one can obtain a
$2(\beta + 1)$-approximation for PSC on the same family. In a subsequent paper, they also considered
a generalization of PSC that has multiple partial covering constraints which is partly inspired
by and generalizes previous work of Bera et al on the Vertex Cover problem. Our main goal in this paper
is to demonstrate some useful connections between the results in previous work and submodularity.
This allows us to simplify, and in some cases improve their results. We improve the approximation
for PSC to $(1-1/e)(\beta + 1)$. We extend the previous work to the sparse setting.
