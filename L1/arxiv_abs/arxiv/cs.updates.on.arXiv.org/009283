This paper proposes a novel approach to regularize the \textit{ill-posed} and \textit{non-linear}
blind image deconvolution (blind deblurring) using deep generative networks. We employ two separate
deep generative models --- one trained to produce sharp images while the other trained to generate
blur kernels from lower-dimensional parameters. To deblur, we propose an alternating gradient
descent scheme operating in the latent lower-dimensional space of each of the pretrained generative
models. Our experiments show promising deblurring results on images even under large blurs, and
heavy noise. The deblurring performance depends on how well the range of the generator spans the
image class. To improve the performance on rich image datasets such as face images not \textit{well
learned} by the generative networks, we present a modification of the proposed scheme that governs
the deblurring process under both generative, and classical priors. We go on further to show that
including a generative prior is, in general, a good idea in image deblurring on even richer images
e.g. arbitrary natural images, by demonstrating that untrained convolutional generative networks
can act as good image priors based on their structure alone. Our novel proposed approach of using
generative networks as priors is in stark contrast to the conventional end-to-end approaches,
where a deep neural network is trained on blurred input, and the corresponding sharp output images,
while completely ignoring the knowledge of the underlying forward map (convolution operator)
in image blurring.
