Harsh deployment environments and uncertain run-time conditions create numerous challenges
for postmortem time reconstruction methods. For example, motes often reboot and thus lose their
clock state, considering that the majority of mote platforms lack a real-time clock. While existing
time reconstruction methods for long-term data gathering networks rely on a persistent basestation
for assigning global timestamps to measurements, the basestation may be unavailable due to hardware
and software faults. We present Phoenix, a novel offline algorithm for reconstructing global timestamps
that is robust to frequent mote reboots and does not require a persistent global time source. This
independence sets Phoenix apart from the majority of time reconstruction algorithms which assume
that such a source is always available. Motes in Phoenix exchange their time-related state with
their neighbors, establishing a chain of transitive temporal relationships to one or more motes
with references to the global time. These relationships allow Phoenix to reconstruct the measurement
timeline for each mote. Results from simulations and a deployment indicate that Phoenix can achieve
timing accuracy up to 6 ppm for 99% of the collected measurements. Phoenix is able to maintain this
performance for periods that last for months without a persistent global time source. To achieve
this level of performance for the targeted environmental monitoring application, Phoenix requires
an additional space overhead of 4% and an additional duty cycle of 0.2%.
