Blockchain offers an innovative approach to storing information, executing transactions, performing
functions, and establishing trust in an open environment. Many consider blockchain as a technology
breakthrough for cryptography and cybersecurity, with use cases ranging from globally deployed
cryptocurrency systems like Bitcoin, to smart contracts, smart grids over the Internet of Things,
and so forth. Although blockchain has received growing interests in both academia and industry
in the recent years, the security and privacy of blockchains continue to be at the center of the debate
when deploying blockchain in different applications. This paper presents a comprehensive overview
of the security and privacy of blockchain. To facilitate the discussion, we first introduce the
notion of blockchains and its utility in the context of Bitcoin like online transactions. Then we
describe the basic security properties that are supported as the essential requirements and building
blocks for Bitcoin like cryptocurrency systems, followed by presenting the additional security
and privacy properties that are desired in many blockchain applications. Finally, we review the
security and privacy techniques for achieving these security properties in blockchain-based
systems, including representative consensus algorithms, hash chained storage, mixing protocols,
anonymous signatures, non-interactive zero-knowledge proof, and so forth. We conjecture that
this survey can help readers to gain an in-depth understanding of the security and privacy of blockchain
with respect to concept, attributes, techniques and systems.
