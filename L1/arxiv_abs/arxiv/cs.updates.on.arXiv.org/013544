We demonstrate an approach of exploring design spaces to simultaneously satisfy kinematics- and
physics-based requirements. We present a classification of constraints and solvers to enable
postponing optimization as far down the design workflow as possible. The solvers are organized
into two broad classes of design space 'pruning' and 'exploration' by considering the types of constraints
they can satisfy. We show that pointwise constraints define feasible design subspaces that can
be represented and computed as first-class entities by their maximal feasible elements. The design
space is pruned upfront by intersecting maximal elements, without premature optimization. To
solve for other constraints, we apply topology optimization (TO), starting from the pruned feasible
space. The optimization is steered by a topological sensitivity field (TSF) that measures the global
changes in violation of constraints with respect to local topological punctures. The TSF for global
objective functions is augmented with TSF for global constraints, and penalized/filtered to incorporate
local constraints, including set constraints converted to differentiable (in)equality constraints.
We demonstrate application of the proposed workflow to nontrivial examples in design and manufacturing.
Among other examples, we show how to explore pruned design spaces via TO to simultaneously satisfy
physics-based constraints (e.g., minimize compliance and mass) as well as kinematics-based constraints
(e.g., maximize accessibility for machining).
