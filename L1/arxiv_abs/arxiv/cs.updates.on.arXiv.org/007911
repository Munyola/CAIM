Feature Selection (FS) plays an important role in learning and classification tasks. The object
of FS is to select the relevant and non-redundant features. Considering the huge amount number of
features in real-world applications, FS methods using batch learning technique can't resolve
big data problem especially when data arrive sequentially. In this paper, we propose an online feature
selection system which resolves this problem. More specifically, we treat the problem of online
supervised feature selection for binary classification as a decision-making problem. A philosophical
vision to this problem leads to a hybridization between two important domains: feature selection
using online learning technique (OFS) and automated negotiation (AN). The proposed OFS system
called MOANOFS (Multi-Objective Automated Negotiation based Online Feature Selection) uses
two levels of decision. In the first level, from n learners (or OFS methods), we decide which are the
k trustful ones (with high confidence or trust value). These elected k learners will participate
in the second level. In this level, we integrate our proposed Multilateral Automated Negotiation
based OFS (MANOFS) method to decide finally which is the best solution or which are relevant features.
We show that MOANOFS system is applicable to different domains successfully and achieves high accuracy
with several real-world applications. Index Terms: Feature selection, online learning, multi-objective
