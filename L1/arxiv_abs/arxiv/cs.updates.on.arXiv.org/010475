We consider the task of measuring time with probabilistic threshold gates implemented by bio-inspired
spiking neurons. In the model of spiking neural networks, network evolves in discrete rounds, where
in each round, neurons fire in pulses in response to a sufficiently high membrane potential. This
potential is induced by spikes from neighboring neurons that fired in the previous round, which
can have either an excitatory or inhibitory effect. We first consider a deterministic implementation
of a neural timer and show that $\Theta(\log t)$ (deterministic) threshold gates are both sufficient
and necessary. This raised the question of whether randomness can be leveraged to reduce the number
of neurons. We answer this question in the affirmative by considering neural timers with spiking
neurons where the neuron $y$ is required to fire for $t$ consecutive rounds with probability at least
$1-\delta$, and should stop firing after at most $2t$ rounds with probability $1-\delta$ for some
input parameter $\delta \in (0,1)$. Our key result is a construction of a neural timer with $O(\log\log
1/\delta)$ spiking neurons. Interestingly, this construction uses only one spiking neuron, while
the remaining neurons can be deterministic threshold gates. We complement this construction with
a matching lower bound of $\Omega(\min\{\log\log 1/\delta, \log t\})$ neurons. This provides
the first separation between deterministic and randomized constructions in the setting of spiking
neural networks. Finally, we demonstrate the usefulness of compressed counting networks for synchronizing
neural networks.
