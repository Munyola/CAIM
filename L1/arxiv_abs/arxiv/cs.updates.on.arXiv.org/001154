Representing patterns by complex relational structures, such as labeled graphs, is becoming an
increasingly common practice in the broad field of computational intelligence. Accordingly,
a wide repertoire of pattern recognition tools, such as classifiers and knowledge discovery procedures,
are nowadays available and tested for various labeled graph data types. However, the design of effective
learning and mining procedures operating in the space of labeled graphs is still a challenging problem,
especially from the computational complexity viewpoint. In this paper, we present a major improvement
of a general-purpose graph classification system, which is conceived on an interplay among dissimilarity
representation, clustering, information-theoretic techniques, and evolutionary optimization.
The improvement focuses on a specific key subroutine of the system that performs the compression
of the input data. We prove different theorems which are fundamental to the setting of such a compression
operation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the resulting classifier by benchmarking the developed
variants on well-known datasets of labeled graphs, considering as distinct performance indicators
the classification accuracy, the computing time, and the parsimony in terms of structural complexity
of the synthesized classification model. Overall, the results show state-of-the-art standards
in terms of test set accuracy, while achieving considerable reductions for what concerns the effective
computing time and classification model complexity.
