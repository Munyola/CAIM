We propose a method for automatic segmentation of individual muscles from a clinical CT. The method
uses Bayesian convolutional neural networks with the U-Net architecture, using Monte Carlo dropout
that infers an uncertainty metric in addition to the segmentation label. We evaluated the performance
of the proposed method using two data sets: 20 fully annotated CTs of the hip and thigh regions and
18 partially annotated CTs that are publicly available from The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA) database.
The experiments showed a Dice coefficient (DC) of 0.891 +/- 0.016 (mean +/- std) and an average symmetric
surface distance (ASD) of 0.994 +/- 0.230 mm over 19 muscles in the set of 20 CTs. These results were
statistically significant improvements compared to the state-of-the-art hierarchical multi-atlas
method which resulted in 0.845 +/- 0.031 DC and 1.556 +/- 0.444 mm ASD. We evaluated validity of the
uncertainty metric in the multi-class organ segmentation problem and demonstrated a correlation
between the pixels with high uncertainty and the segmentation failure. One application of the uncertainty
metric in active-learning is demonstrated, and the proposed query pixel selection method considerably
reduced the manual annotation cost for expanding the training data set. The proposed method allows
an accurate patient-specific analysis of individual muscle shapes in a clinical routine. This
would open up various applications including personalization of biomechanical simulation and
quantitative evaluation of muscle atrophy.
