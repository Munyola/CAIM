Enabling autonomous driving and industrial automation with wireless networks poses many challenges,
which are typically abstracted through reliability and latency requirements. One of the main contributors
to latency in cellular networks is the reservation-based access, which involves lengthy and resource-inefficient
signaling exchanges. An alternative is to use grant-free access, in which there is no resource reservation.
A handful of recent works investigated how to fulfill reliability and latency requirements with
different flavors of grant-free solutions. However, the resource efficiency, i.e., the throughput,
has been only the secondary focus. In this work, we formulate the throughput of grant-free access
under reliability-latency constraints, when the actual number of arrived users or only the arrival
distribution are known. We investigate how these different levels of knowledge about the arrival
process influence throughput performance of framed slotted ALOHA with $K$-multipacket reception,
for the Poisson and Beta arrivals. We show that the throughput under reliability-latency requirements
can be significantly improved for the higher expected load of the access network, if the actual number
of arrived users is known. This insight motivates the use of techniques for the estimation of the
number of arrived users, as this knowledge is not readily available in grant-free access. We also
asses the impact of estimation error, showing that for high reliability-latency requirements
the gains in throughput are still considerable.
