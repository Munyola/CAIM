Purpose: To perform and evaluate water-fat signal separation of whole-body gradient echo scans
using convolutional neural networks. Methods: Whole-body gradient echo scans of 240 subjects,
each consisting of 5 bipolar echoes, were used. Reference fat fraction maps were created using a
conventional method. Convolutional neural networks, more specifically 2D U-nets, were trained
using 5-fold cross-validation with 1 or several echoes as input, using the squared difference between
the output and the reference fat fraction maps as the loss function. The outputs of the networks were
assessed by the loss function, measured liver fat fractions, and visually. Training was performed
using a graphics processing unit (GPU). Inference was performed using the GPU as well as a central
processing unit (CPU). Results: The loss curves indicated convergence, and the final loss of the
validation data decreased when using more echoes as input. The liver fat fractions could be estimated
using only 1 echo, but results were improved by use of more echoes. Visual assessment found the quality
of the outputs of the networks to be similar to the reference even when using only 1 echo, with slight
improvements when using more echoes. Training a network took at most 28.6 h. Inference time of a whole-body
scan took at most 3.7 s using the GPU and 5.8 min using the CPU. Conclusion: It is possible to perform
water-fat signal separation of whole-body gradient echo scans using convolutional neural networks.
Separation was possible using only 1 echo, although using more echoes improved the results.
