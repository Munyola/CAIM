With the rapidly increasing interest in machine learning based solutions for automatic image annotation,
the availability of reference image annotations for algorithm training is one of the major bottlenecks
in the field. Crowdsourcing has evolved as a valuable option for low-cost and large-scale data annotation;
however, quality control remains a major issue which needs to be addressed. To our knowledge, we
are the first to investigate the analysis of clickstreams to improve crowd-based image segmentation.
Our method involves training a regressor to estimate a worker's segmentation performance from
the clickstream data, where the performance is represented by the DICE similarity coefficient
(DSC) comparing the worker's annotation and the reference segmentation. The DSC prediction can
be used to identify spammers and weight individual workers by their (estimated) skill when merging
multiple segmentations of one image. Using a total of 20,000 crowd annotations performed on publicly
available data of cars and cats, we show that (1) our method is highly accurate in predicting the DSC
based on clickstream data and thus outperforms state-of-the-art methods for merging multiple
annotations and that (2) the regressor does not need to be trained on the object class (e.g. cars)
that it is applied to (e.g. cats). In contrast to previously proposed methods, our approach does
not rely on additional sanity tasks and can thus be regarded as a low-cost option for spam control
and confidence analysis in the context of crowd-based image annotation.
