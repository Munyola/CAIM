Many real-world systems such as taxi systems, traffic networks and smart grids involve self-interested
actors that perform individual tasks in a shared environment. However, in such systems, the self-interested
behaviour of agents produces welfare inefficient and globally suboptimal outcomes that are detrimental
to all - some common examples are congestion in traffic networks, demand spikes for resources in
electricity grids and over-extraction of environmental resources such as fisheries. We propose
an incentive-design method which modifies agents' rewards in non-cooperative multi-agent systems
that results in independent, self-interested agents choosing actions that produce optimal system
outcomes in strategic settings. Our framework combines multi-agent reinforcement learning to
simulate (real-world) agent behaviour and black-box optimisation to determine the optimal modifications
to the agents' rewards or incentives given some fixed budget that results in optimal system performance.
By modifying the reward functions and generating agents' equilibrium responses within a sequence
of offline Markov games, our method enables optimal incentive structures to be determined offline
through iterative updates of the reward functions of a simulated game. Our theoretical results
show that our method converges to reward modifications that induce system optimality. We demonstrate
the applications of our framework by tackling a challenging problem within economics that involves
thousands of selfish agents and tackle a traffic congestion problem.
