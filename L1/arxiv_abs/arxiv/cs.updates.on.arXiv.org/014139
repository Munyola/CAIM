Learning topological representation of a network in dynamic environments has recently attracted
considerable attention due to the time-evolving nature of many real-world networks i.e. nodes/links
might be added/removed as time goes on. Dynamic network embedding aims to learn low dimensional
embeddings for unseen and seen nodes by using any currently available snapshots of a dynamic network.
For seen nodes, the existing methods either treat them equally important or focus on the $k$ most
affected nodes at each time step. However, the former solution is time-consuming, and the later
solution that relies on incoming changes may lose the global topology---an important feature for
downstream tasks. To address these challenges, we propose a dynamic network embedding method called
DynWalks, which includes two key components: 1) An online network embedding framework that can
dynamically and efficiently learn embeddings based on the selected nodes; 2) A novel online node
selecting scheme that offers the flexible choices to balance global topology and recent changes,
as well as to fulfill the real-time constraint if needed. The empirical studies on six real-world
dynamic networks under three different slicing ways show that DynWalks significantly outperforms
the state-of-the-art methods in graph reconstruction tasks, and obtains comparable results in
link prediction tasks. Furthermore, the wall-clock time and complexity analysis demonstrate
its excellent time and space efficiency. The source code of DynWalks is available at https://github.com/houchengbin/DynWalks
