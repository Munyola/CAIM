High-order finite element methods (HO-FEM) are gaining popularity in the simulation community
due to their success in solving complex flow dynamics. There is an increasing need to analyze the
data produced as output by these simulations. Simultaneously, topological analysis tools are
emerging as powerful methods for investigating simulation data. However, most of the current approaches
to topological analysis have had limited application to HO-FEM simulation data for two reasons.
First, the current topological tools are designed for linear data (polynomial degree one), but
the polynomial degree of the data output by these simulations is typically higher (routinely up
to polynomial degree six). Second, the simulation data and derived quantities of the simulation
data have discontinuities at element boundaries, and these discontinuities do not match the input
requirements for the topological tools. One solution to both issues is to transform the high-order
data to achieve low-order, continuous inputs for topological analysis. Nevertheless, there has
been little work evaluating the possible transformation choices and their downstream effect on
the topological analysis. We perform an empirical study to evaluate two commonly used data transformation
methodologies along with the recently introduced L-SIAC filter for processing high-order simulation
data. Our results show diverse behaviors are possible. We offer some guidance about how best to consider
a pipeline of topological analysis of HO-FEM simulations with the currently available implementations
of topological analysis.
