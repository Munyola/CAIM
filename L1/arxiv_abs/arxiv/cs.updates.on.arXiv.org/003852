Linear optimal power flow (LOPF) algorithms use a linearization of the alternating current (AC)
load flow equations to optimize generator dispatch in a network subject to the loading constraints
of the network branches. Common algorithms use the voltage angles at the buses as optimization variables,
but alternatives can be computationally advantageous. In this article we provide a review of existing
methods and describe a new formulation that expresses the loading constraints directly in terms
of the flows themselves, using a decomposition of the network graph into a spanning tree and closed
cycles. We provide a comprehensive study of the computational performance of the various formulations,
in settings that include computationally challenging applications such as multi-period LOPF
with storage dispatch and generation capacity expansion. We show that the new formulation of the
LOPF solves up to 7 times faster than the angle formulation using a commercial linear programming
solver, while another existing cycle-based formulation solves up to 20 times faster, with an average
speed-up of factor 3 for the standard networks considered here. If generation capacities are also
optimized, the average speed-up rises to a factor of 12, reaching up to factor 213 in a particular
instance. The speed-up is largest for networks with many buses and decentral generators throughout
the network, which is highly relevant given the rise of distributed renewable generation and the
computational challenge of operation and planning in such networks.
