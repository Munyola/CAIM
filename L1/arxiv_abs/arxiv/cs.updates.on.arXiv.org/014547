Machine Intelligence (MI) technologies have revolutionized the design and applications of computational
intelligence systems, by introducing remarkable scientific and technological enhancements
across domains. MI can improve Internet of Things (IoT) in several ways, such as optimizing the management
of large volumes of data or improving automation and transmission in large-scale IoT deployments.
When considering MI in the IoT context, MI services deployment must account for the latency demands
and network bandwidth requirements. To this extent, moving the intelligence towards the IoT end-device
aims to address such requirements and introduces the notion of Distributed MI (D-MI) also in the
IoT context. However, current D-MI deployments are limited by the lack of MI interoperability.
Currently, the intelligence is tightly bound to the application that exploits it, limiting the
provisioning of that specific intelligence service to additional applications. The objective
of this article is to propose a novel approach to cope with such constraints. It focuses on decoupling
the intelligence from the application by revising the traditional device's stack and introducing
an intelligence layer that provides services to the overlying application layer. This paradigm
aims to provide final users with more control and accessibility of intelligence services by boosting
providers' incentives to develop solutions that could theoretically reach any device. Based on
the definition of this emerging paradigm, we explore several aspects related to the intelligence
distribution and its impact in the whole MI ecosystem.
