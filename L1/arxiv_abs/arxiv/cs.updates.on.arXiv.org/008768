Despite the progress throughout the last decades, weather forecasting is still a challenging and
computationally expensive task. Most models which are currently operated by meteorological services
around the world rely on numerical weather prediction, a system based on mathematical algorithms
describing physical effects. Recent progress in artificial intelligence however demonstrates
that machine learning can be successfully applied to many research fields, especially areas dealing
with big data that can be used for training. Current approaches to predict thunderstorms often focus
on indices describing temperature differences in the atmosphere. If these indices reach a critical
threshold, the forecast system emits a thunderstorm warning. Other meteorological systems such
as radar and lightning detection systems are added for a more precise prediction. This paper describes
a new approach to the prediction of lightnings based on machine learning rather than complex numerical
computations. The error of optical flow algorithms applied to images of meteorological satellites
is interpreted as a sign for convection potentially leading to thunderstorms. These results are
used as the base for the feature generation phase incorporating different convolution steps. Tree
classifier models are then trained to predict lightnings within the next few hours (called nowcasting)
based on these features. The evaluation section compares the predictive power of the different
models and the impact of different features on the classification result.
