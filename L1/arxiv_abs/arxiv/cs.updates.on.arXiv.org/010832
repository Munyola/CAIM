Satellites are subject to various severe vibration during different phases of flight. The concept
of satellite smart adapter is proposed in this study to achieve active vibration control of launch
vehicle on satellite. The satellite smart adapter has 18 active struts in which the middle section
of each strut is made of piezoelectric stack actuator. Comprehensive conceptual design of the satellite
smart adapter is presented to indicate the design parameters, requirements and philosophy applied
which are based on the reliability and durability criterions to ensure successful functionality
of the proposed system, also fabrication process of the proposed piezoelectric stack actuator
is discussed in detail. The coupled electromechanical virtual work equation for the piezoelectric
stack actuator in each active strut is derived by applying D'Alembert's principle to calculate
the consistent mass matrix, the stiffness matrix and the load vector using finite element approximation.
Modal analysis is performed to characterize the inherent properties of the smart adapter and extraction
of a mathematical model of the system. Active vibration control analysis was conducted using fuzzy
logic control with triangular membership functions and acceleration feedback. The control results
conclude that the proposed satellite smart adapter configuration which benefits from piezoelectric
stack actuator as elements of its 18 active struts has high strength and shows excellent robustness
and effectiveness in vibration suppression of launch vehicle on satellite.
