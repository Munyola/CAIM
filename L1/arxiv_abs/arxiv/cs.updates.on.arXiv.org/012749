Action recognition has become a rapidly developing research field within the last decade. But with
the increasing demand for large scale data, the need of hand annotated data for the training becomes
more and more impractical. One way to avoid frame-based human annotation is the use of action order
information to learn the respective action classes. In this context, we propose a hierarchical
approach to address the problem of weakly supervised learning of human actions from ordered action
labels by structuring recognition in a coarse-to-fine manner. Given a set of videos and an ordered
list of the occurring actions, the task is to infer start and end frames of the related action classes
within the video and to train the respective action classifiers without any need for hand labeled
frame boundaries. We address this problem by combining a framewise RNN model with a coarse probabilistic
inference. This combination allows for the temporal alignment of long sequences and thus, for an
iterative training of both elements. While this system alone already generates good results, we
show that the performance can be further improved by approximating the number of subactions to the
characteristics of the different action classes as well as by the introduction of a regularizing
length prior. The proposed system is evaluated on two benchmark datasets, the Breakfast and the
Hollywood extended dataset, showing a competitive performance on various weak learning tasks
such as temporal action segmentation and action alignment.
