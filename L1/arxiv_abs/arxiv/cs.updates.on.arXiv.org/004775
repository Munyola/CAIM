Inverse dynamics control and feedforward linearization techniques are typically used to convert
the complex nonlinear dynamics of robots to a set of decoupled double integrators, and then a standard,
outer-loop controller can be used to calculate the commanded acceleration for the linearized system.
However, these methods typically depend on having a very accurate system model, which is not available
in practice. While this challenge has been addressed in the literature using different learning
approaches, most of these approaches do not provide safety guarantees in terms of stability of the
learning-based control system. In this paper, we provide a novel, learning-based control approach
based on Gaussian processes (GPs) that ensures both stability of the closed-loop system and high-accuracy
tracking. In our proposed approach, we use GPs to approximate the error between the commanded acceleration
and the actual acceleration of the system, and then use the predicted mean and variance of the GP to
calculate an upper bound on the uncertainty of the linearization. This uncertainty bound is then
used in a robust, outer-loop controller to ensure stability of the overall system. Moreover, we
show that using our proposed strategy, the tracking error converges to a ball with a radius that can
be made arbitrarily small through appropriate control design. Furthermore, we verify the effectiveness
of the proposed approach via simulations on (i) a 2 degree-of-freedom (DOF) planar manipulator,
and (ii) a 6 DOF industrial manipulator using the Gazebo simulator.
