This paper introduces the notion of cache-tapping into the information theoretic models of coded
caching. In particular, the wiretap II channel model in the presence of multiple receivers equipped
with fixed-size cache memories, and an adversary who is able to choose symbols to tap into from cache
placement, in addition to or in lieu of, delivery transmission, is introduced. The model is hence
termed the caching broadcast channel with a wire and cache tapping adversary of type II. The legitimate
parties know neither whether cache placement, delivery, or both phases are tapped, nor the positions
in which they are tapped. Only the size of the overall tapped set is known. For the instance of two receivers
and two library files, the strong secrecy capacity of the model, i.e., the maximum achievable file
rate while keeping the overall library strongly secure, is identified. Lower and upper bounds on
the achievable strong secrecy file rate are derived when the library has more than two files. Achievability
schemes in this paper rely on a code design which combines wiretap coding, security embedding codes,
one-time pad keys, and coded caching. A genie-aided upper bound, in which a genie provides the transmitter
with user demands before cache placement, establishes the converse for the two files instance.
For the library of more than two files, the upper bound is constructed by three successive channel
transformations. Our results establish that strong information theoretic security is possible
against a powerful adversary who optimizes its attack over both phases of communication in a cache-aided
system.
