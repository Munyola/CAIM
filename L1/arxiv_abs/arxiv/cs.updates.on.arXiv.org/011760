While many distributed consensus protocols provide robust liveness and consistency guarantees
under the presence of malicious actors, quantitative estimates of how economic incentives affect
security are few and far between. In this paper, we describe a system for simulating how adversarial
agents, both economically rational and Byzantine, interact with a blockchain protocol. This system
provides statistical estimates for the economic difficulty of an attack and how the presence of
certain actors influences protocol-level statistics, such as the expected time to regain liveness.
This simulation system is influenced by the design of algorithmic trading and reinforcement learning
systems that use explicit modeling of an agent's reward mechanism to evaluate and optimize a fully
autonomous agent. We implement and apply this simulation framework to Kadena's Chainweb, a parallelized
Proof-of-Work system, that contains complexity in how miner incentive compliance affects security
and censorship resistance. We provide the first formal description of Chainweb that is in the literature
and use this formal description to motivate our simulation design. Our simulation results include
a phase transition in block height growth rate as a function of shard connectivity and empirical
evidence that censorship in Chainweb is too costly for rational miners to engage in. We conclude
with an outlook on how simulation can guide and optimize protocol development in a variety of contexts,
including Proof-of-Stake parameter optimization and peer-to-peer networking design.
