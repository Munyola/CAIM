This paper considers the distributed filtering problem for a class of discrete-time stochastic
uncertain systems with biased observations under switching sensor networks and quantized communications.
First, we reconstruct the original uncertain system into a higher dimensional system with the nonlinear
uncertain dynamics being treated as an extended state. Also, the crucial properties of designing
filters for the original system and the reconstructed system are shown to be equivalent. Then, through
utilizing the techniques of interval quantization and dither operator, we propose a novel distributed
Kalman filter with guaranteed consistency under quantized sensor communications. Furthermore,
to alleviate the effect of biased observations, the event-triggered observation update mechanism
based distributed Kalman filter is presented with a tighter bound of error covariance than that
of the time-driven one by designing a proper threshold. Based on mild conditions, the boundedness
of the estimation error covariances for both the proposed two distributed filters is proven. Also,
we reveal that for the time-driven algorithm, the estimation biases asymptotically go to zero at
certain rates under some decaying conditions of uncertain dynamics and observation biases. More
importantly, the estimation biases of the event-triggered filter can asymptotically go to zero
even if the observation biases of some sensors do not decay. Finally, the numerical simulations
on estimating object's motion by four sensors demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed distributed
filters.
