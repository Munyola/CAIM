Risk stratification (characterization) of tumors from radiology images can be more accurate and
faster with computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) tools. Tumor characterization through such tools
can also enable non-invasive cancer staging, prognosis, and foster personalized treatment planning
as a part of precision medicine. In this study, we propose both supervised and unsupervised machine
learning strategies to improve tumor characterization. Our first approach is based on supervised
learning for which we demonstrate significant gains with deep learning algorithms, particularly
by utilizing a 3D Convolutional Neural Network and Transfer Learning. Motivated by the radiologists'
interpretations of the scans, we then show how to incorporate task dependent feature representations
into a CAD system via a graph-regularized sparse Multi-Task Learning (MTL) framework. In the second
approach, we explore an unsupervised learning algorithm to address the limited availability of
labeled training data, a common problem in medical imaging applications. Inspired by learning
from label proportion (LLP) approaches in computer vision, we propose to use proportion-SVM for
characterizing tumors. We also seek the answer to the fundamental question about the goodness of
"deep features" for unsupervised tumor classification. We evaluate our proposed supervised and
unsupervised learning algorithms on two different tumor diagnosis challenges: lung and pancreas
with 1018 CT and 171 MRI scans, respectively, and obtain the state-of-the-art sensitivity and specificity
results in both problems.
