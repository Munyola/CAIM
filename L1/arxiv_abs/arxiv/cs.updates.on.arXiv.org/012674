Various health-care applications such as assisted living, fall detection etc., require modeling
of user behavior through Human Activity Recognition (HAR). HAR using mobile- and wearable-based
deep learning algorithms have been on the rise owing to the advancements in pervasive computing.
However, there are two other challenges that need to be addressed: first, the deep learning model
should support on-device incremental training (model updation) from real-time incoming data
points to learn user behavior over time, while also being resource-friendly; second, a suitable
ground truthing technique (like Active Learning) should help establish labels on-the-fly while
also selecting only the most informative data points to query from an oracle. Hence, in this paper,
we propose ActiveHARNet, a resource-efficient deep ensembled model which supports on-device
Incremental Learning and inference, with capabilities to represent model uncertainties through
approximations in Bayesian Neural Networks using dropout. This is combined with suitable acquisition
functions for active learning. Empirical results on two publicly available wrist-worn HAR and
fall detection datasets indicate that ActiveHARNet achieves considerable efficiency boost during
inference across different users, with a substantially low number of acquired pool points (at least
60% reduction) during incremental learning on both datasets experimented with various acquisition
functions, thus demonstrating deployment and Incremental Learning feasibility.
