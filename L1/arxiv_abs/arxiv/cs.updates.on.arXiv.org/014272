We study the problem of persistent monitoring of finite number of inter-connected geographical
nodes for event detection via a group of heterogeneous mobile agents. We use Poisson process model
to capture the probability of the events occurring at the geographical nodes. We then tie a utility
function to the probability of detecting an event in each point of interest and use it in our policy
design to incentivize the agents to visit the geographical nodes with higher probability of event
occurrence. We show that the design of an optimal monitoring policy to maximize the utility of event
detection over a mission horizon is an NP-hard problem. By showing that the reward function is a monotone
increasing and submodular function, we then proceed to propose a suboptimal dispatch policy design
with a known optimality gap. To reduce the time complexity of constructing the feasible search set
and also to induce robustness to changes in event occurrence and other operational factors, we preform
our suboptimal policy design in a receding horizon setting. Our next contribution is to add a new
term to our optimization problem to compensate for the shortsightedness of the receding horizon
approach. This added term provides a measure of importance for nodes beyond the receding horizon's
sight, and is meant to give the policy design an intuition to steer the agents towards areas with higher
importance on the global map. Finally, we discuss how our proposed algorithm can be implemented
in a decentralized manner. We demonstrate our results through a simulation study.
