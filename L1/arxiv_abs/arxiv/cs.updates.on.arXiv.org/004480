The rapid uptake of mobile devices and the rising popularity of mobile applications and services
pose unprecedented demands on mobile and wireless networking infrastructure. Upcoming 5G systems
are evolving to support exploding mobile traffic volumes, agile management of network resource
to maximize user experience, and extraction of fine-grained real-time analytics. Fulfilling
these tasks is challenging, as mobile environments are increasingly complex, heterogeneous,
and evolving. One potential solution is to resort to advanced machine learning techniques to help
managing the rise in data volumes and algorithm-driven applications. The recent success of deep
learning underpins new and powerful tools that tackle problems in this space. In this paper we bridge
the gap between deep learning and mobile and wireless networking research, by presenting a comprehensive
survey of the crossovers between the two areas. We first briefly introduce essential background
and state-of-the-art in deep learning techniques with potential applications to networking.
We then discuss several techniques and platforms that facilitate the efficient deployment of deep
learning onto mobile systems. Subsequently, we provide an encyclopedic review of mobile and wireless
networking research based on deep learning, which we categorize by different domains. Drawing
from our experience, we discuss how to tailor deep learning to mobile environments. We complete
this survey by pinpointing current challenges and open future directions for research.
