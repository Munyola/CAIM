Radio frequency energy harvesting presents a green solution for prolonging the lifetime of wireless
communication devices. In this paper, we study the downlink multi-user scheduling problem for
a time-slotted system with joint wireless information and energy transfer. In particular, in each
time slot, a single user is scheduled to receive information, while the remaining users opportunistically
harvest the ambient energy. We investigate two channel-unaware scheduling schemes, namely round-robin
and equal throughput scheduling, as well as channel-aware scheduling schemes, namely signal-to-noise
ratio (SNR) based scheduling and normalized SNR (N-SNR) based scheduling. The N-SNR scheme is used
to provide proportional fairness among users with different channel conditions. The amount of
energy that can be harvested by the unscheduled users is studied, along with the achieved ergodic
capacity. Furthermore, in order to control the rate-energy tradeoff, we propose to modify the SNR
and the N-SNR schemes by scheduling the user having the jth-ordered (rather than the maximum) SNR/N-SNR.
We refer to this scheme as order-based SNR/N-SNR scheduling. It is shown that the smaller parameter
j is chosen, the larger the average harvested energy at the expense of a reduced ergodic system capacity.
We analyze the performance of the considered scheduling schemes for independent and non-identically
distributed (i.n.d.) Ricean fading channels, and show closed-form results for the special case
of i.n.d. Rayleigh fading. The derived analytical results are corroborated by simulations.
