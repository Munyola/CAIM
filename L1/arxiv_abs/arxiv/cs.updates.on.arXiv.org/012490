Goal: Squamous cell carcinoma of cervix is one of the most prevalent cancer worldwide in females.
Traditionally, the most indispensable diagnosis of cervix squamous carcinoma is histopathological
assessment which is achieved under microscope by pathologist. However, human evaluation of pathology
slide is highly depending on the experience of pathologist, thus big inter- and intra-observer
variability exists. Digital pathology, in combination with deep learning provides an opportunity
to improve the objectivity and efficiency of histopathologic slide analysis. Methods: In this
study, we obtained 800 haematoxylin and eosin stained slides from 300 patients suffered from cervix
squamous carcinoma. Based on information from morphological heterogeneity in the tumor and its
adjacent area, we established deep learning models using popular convolution neural network architectures
(inception-v3, InceptionResnet-v2 and Resnet50). Then random forest was introduced to feature
extractions and slide-based classification. Results: The overall performance of our proposed
models on slide-based tumor discrimination were outstanding with an AUC scores > 0.94. While, location
identifications of lesions in whole slide images were mediocre (FROC scores > 0.52) duo to the extreme
complexity of tumor tissues. Conclusion: For the first time, our analysis workflow highlighted
a quantitative visual-based slide analysis of cervix squamous carcinoma. Significance: This
study demonstrates a pathway to assist pathologist and accelerate the diagnosis of patients by
utilizing new computational approaches.
