An additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) energy-harvesting (EH) channel is considered where the
transmitter is equipped with an infinite-sized battery which stores energy harvested from the
environment. The energy arrival process is modeled as a sequence of independent and identically
distributed (i.i.d.) random variables. The capacity of this channel is known and is achievable
by the so-called best-effort and save-and-transmit schemes. This paper investigates the best-effort
scheme in the finite blocklength regime, and establishes the first non-asymptotic achievable
rate for it. The first-order term of the non-asymptotic achievable rate equals the capacity, and
the second-order term is proportional to $-\sqrt{\frac{\log n}{n}}$ where $n$ is the blocklength.
The proof technique involves analyzing the escape probability of a Markov process. In addition,
we use this new proof technique to analyze the save-and-transmit and derive a new non-asymptotic
achievable rate for it, whose first-order and second-order terms achieve the capacity and the scaling
$-O\Big(\sqrt{\frac{1}{n}}\Big)$ respectively. For all sufficiently large signal-to-noise
ratios (SNRs), this new achievable rate outperforms the existing ones. The results are also extended
to the block energy arrival model where the length of each energy block $L$ grows sublinearly in $n$.
It is shown that best-effort and save-and-transmit achieve the second-order scalings $-O\Big(\sqrt{\frac{\max\{\log
n, L\}}{n}}\Big)$ and $-O\Big(\sqrt{\frac{L}{n}}\Big)$ respectively.
