Since the inception of blockchain and Bitcoin (Nakamoto (2008)), a decentralized-distributed
ledger system and its associated cryptocurrency, respectively, the world has witnessed a slew
of newer adaptations and applications. Although the original distributed ledger technology (DLT)
of blockchain is deemed secure and decentralized, the confirmation of transactions is inefficient
by design. Recently adopted, directed acyclic graph (DAG)-based distributed ledgers validate
transactions efficiently without the physically and environmentally costly building process
of blocks (Lerner (2015)). However, centrally-controlled confirmation against the odds of multiple
validation disqualifies the DAG as a decentralized-distributed ledger. In this regard, we introduce
an innovative DLT by reconstructing a chain of antichains based on a given DAG-pool of transactions.
Each antichain (box) contains distinct nodes whose approved transactions are recursively validated
by subsequently augmenting nodes. The boxer node closes the box and keeps the hash of all transactions
confirmed by the box-genesis node. Designation of boxers and box-geneses is conditionally randomized
for decentralization. The boxes are serially concatenated with recursive confirmation (boxchain)
without incurring the cost of box generation. Rewards (boxcoin) are paid to the contributing nodes
of the ecosystem whose trust is built on the doubly-secure protocol of confirmation. A value-preserving
medium of payment (boxdollar) is among numerous practical applications discussed herein.
