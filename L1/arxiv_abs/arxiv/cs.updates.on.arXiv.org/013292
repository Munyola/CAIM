This paper describes a novel approach to systematically improve information interactions based
solely on its wording. Following an interdisciplinary literature review, we recognized three
key attributes of words that drive user engagement: (1) Novelty (2) Familiarity (3) Emotionality.
Based on these attributes, we developed a model to systematically improve a given content using
computational linguistics, natural language processing (NLP) and text analysis (word frequency,
sentiment analysis and lexical substitution). We conducted a pilot study (n=216) in which the model
was used to formalize evaluation and optimization of academic titles. A between-group design (A/B
testing) was used to compare responses to the original and modified (treatment) titles. Data was
collected for selection and evaluation (User Engagement Scale). The pilot results suggest that
user engagement with digital information is fostered by, and perhaps dependent upon, the wording
being used. They also provide empirical support that engaging content can be systematically evaluated
and produced. The preliminary results show that the modified (treatment) titles had significantly
higher scores for information use and user engagement (selection and evaluation). We propose that
computational linguistics is a useful approach for optimizing information interactions. The
empirically based insights can inform the development of digital content strategies, thereby
improving the success of information interactions.elop more sophisticated interaction measures.
