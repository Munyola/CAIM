As a subfield of machine learning, \emph{reinforcement learning} (RL) aims at empowering one's
capabilities in behavioural decision making by using interaction experience with the world and
an evaluative feedback. Unlike traditional supervised learning methods that usually rely on one-shot,
exhaustive and supervised reward signals, RL tackles with sequential decision making problems
with sampled, evaluative and delayed feedback simultaneously. Such distinctive features make
RL technique a suitable candidate for developing powerful solutions in a variety of healthcare
domains, where diagnosing decisions or treatment regimes are usually characterized by a prolonged
and sequential procedure. This survey will discuss the broad applications of RL techniques in healthcare
domains, in order to provide the research community with systematic understanding of theoretical
foundations, enabling methods and techniques, existing challenges, and new insights of this emerging
paradigm. By first briefly examining theoretical foundations and key techniques in RL research
from efficient and representational directions, we then provide an overview of RL applications
in a variety of healthcare domains, ranging from dynamic treatment regimes in chronic diseases
and critical care, automated medical diagnosis from both unstructured and structured clinical
data, as well as many other control or scheduling domains that have infiltrated many aspects of a
healthcare system. Finally, we summarize the challenges and open issues in current research, and
point out some potential solutions and directions for future research.
