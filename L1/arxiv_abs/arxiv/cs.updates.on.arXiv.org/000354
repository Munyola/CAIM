A set of vertices in a graph is a dominating set if every vertex outside the set has a neighbor in the
set. A dominating set is connected if the subgraph induced by its vertices is connected. The connected
domatic partition problem asks for a partition of the nodes into connected dominating sets. The
connected domatic number of a graph is the size of a largest connected domatic partition and it is
a well-studied graph parameter with applications in the design of wireless networks. In this paper,
we give improved approximation algorithms for constructing large connected domatic partitions
and packings. Let $n$ be the number of nodes and let $k$ be the vertex connectivity of the graph. The
fractional connected domatic number is at most $k$, and our algorithms construct partitions and
packings whose sizes are proportional to $k$. Some of our main contributions are the following:
\begin{itemize} \item An algorithm for constructing a connected domatic partition of size $\Omega(k/\ln^2{n})$
provided that $k = \Omega(\ln^3{n})$. This improves a recent result of \cite{CHGK} that gives a
$\Omega(k/\ln^5{n})$-sized partition. \item An algorithm for constructing a fractional connected
domatic packing of size $\Omega(k)$ for node-capacitated planar and minor-closed families of
graphs. \item An algorithm for constructing an edge-connected domatic partition of size $\Omega(k/\ln{n})$.
\item An improved sampling theorem for analyzing the vertex connectivity of a graph under node sampling.
\end{itemize}
