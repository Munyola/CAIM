We investigate a famous decision problem in automata theory: separation. Given a class of language
C, the separation problem for C takes as input two regular languages and asks whether there exists
a third one which belongs to C, includes the first one and is disjoint from the second. Typically,
obtaining an algorithm for separation yields a deep understanding of the investigated class C.
Therefore, a lot of effort has been devoted to finding algorithms for the most prominent classes.
Here, we are interested in classes within concatenation hierarchies. These hierarchies share
a generic construction process: one starts from an initial class called the basis and builds new
levels by applying generic operations. The most famous one is the dot-depth hierarchy of Brzozowski
and Cohen. It classifies the languages definable in first-order logic. By a theorem of Thomas, it
corresponds exactly to the quantifier alternation hierarchy of first-order logic: each level
in the dot-depth corresponds to the languages that can be defined with a prescribed number of quantifier
blocks. One of the most famous open problems in automata theory is to obtain separation algorithms
for all levels in this hierarchy. Our main theorem is generic: separation is decidable for the level
3/2 of any concatenation hierarchy whose basis is finite. Moreover, we are able to push this result
to the level 5/2 for the dot-depth. In logical terms, this means that separation is decidable for
$\Sigma_3$: first-order sentences having at most three quantifier blocks starting with an existential
one.
