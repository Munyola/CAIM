The large size of multiscale, distribution and transmission, power grids hinder fast system-wide
estimation and real-time control and optimization of operations. This paper studies graph reduction
methods of power grids that are favorable for fast simulations and follow-up applications. While
the classical Kron reduction has been successful in reduced order modeling of power grids with traditional,
hierarchical design, the selection of reference nodes for the reduced model in a multiscale, distribution
and transmission, network becomes ambiguous. In this work we extend the use of the iterative Kron
reduction by utilizing the electric grid's graph topology for the selection of reference nodes,
consistent with the design features of multiscale networks. Additionally, we propose further
reductions by aggregation of coherent subnetworks of triangular meshes, based on the graph topology
and network characteristics, in order to preserve currents and build another power-flow equivalent
network. Our reductions are achieved through the use of iterative aggregation of sub-graphs that
include general tree structures, lines, and triangles. Important features of our reduction algorithms
include that: (i) the reductions are, either, equivalent to the Kron reduction, or otherwise produce
a power-flow equivalent network; (ii) due to the former mentioned power-flow equivalence, the
reduced network can model the dynamic of the swing equations for a lossless, inductive, steady state
network; (iii) the algorithms efficiently utilize hash-tables to store the sequential reduction
steps.
