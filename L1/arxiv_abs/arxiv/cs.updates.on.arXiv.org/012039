We present DeepICP - a novel end-to-end learning-based 3D point cloud registration framework that
achieves comparable registration accuracy to prior state-of-the-art geometric methods. Different
from other keypoint based methods where a RANSAC procedure is usually needed, we implement the use
of various deep neural network structures to establish an end-to-end trainable network. Our keypoint
detector is trained through this end-to-end structure and enables the system to avoid the inference
of dynamic objects, leverages the help of sufficiently salient features on stationary objects,
and as a result, achieves high robustness. Rather than searching the corresponding points among
existing points, the key contribution is that we innovatively generate them based on learned matching
probabilities among a group of candidates, which can boost the registration accuracy. Our loss
function incorporates both the local similarity and the global geometric constraints to ensure
all above network designs can converge towards the right direction. We comprehensively validate
the effectiveness of our approach using both the KITTI dataset and the Apollo-SouthBay dataset.
Results demonstrate that our method achieves comparable or better performance than the state-of-the-art
geometry-based methods. Detailed ablation and visualization analysis are included to further
illustrate the behavior and insights of our network. The low registration error and high robustness
of our method makes it attractive for substantial applications relying on the point cloud registration
task.
