Given the rapid rise of electric vehicles (EVs) worldwide, and the ambitious targets set for the
near future, the management of large EV fleets must be seen as a priority. Specifically, we study
a scenario where EV charging is managed through self-interested EV aggregators who compete in the
day-ahead market in order to purchase the electricity needed to meet their clients' requirements.
In order to reduce electricity costs and lower the impact on electricity markets, a centralised
bidding coordination framework has been proposed in the literature employing a coordinator. In
order to improve privacy and limit the need for the coordinator, we propose a reformulation of the
coordination framework as a decentralised algorithm, employing the Alternating Direction Method
of Multipliers (ADMM). However, given the self-interested nature of the aggregators, they can
deviate from the algorithm in order to improve their personal utility. Hence, we study strategic
manipulation of the ADMM algorithm and, in doing so, describe and analyse different attack vectors
and propose a mathematical framework to quantify and detect manipulation. Moreover, this detection
framework is not limited the considered EV scenario and can be applied to general ADMM algorithms.
Finally, we test the proposed decentralised coordination and manipulation detection algorithms
in realistic scenarios using real market and driver data from Spain. Our empirical results show
the convergence of the coordination algorithm, and that the detection algorithm accurately detects
deviating behaviour in up to 96% of the cases.
