We consider continuous-time, finite-horizon, optimal quadratic control of semi-Markov jump
linear systems (S-MJLS), and develop principled approximations through Markov-like representations
for the holding-time distributions. We adopt a phase-type approximation for holding times, which
is known to be consistent, and translates a S-MJLS into a specific MJLS with partially observable
modes (MJLSPOM), where the modes in a cluster have the same dynamic, the same cost weighting matrices
and the same control policy. For a general MJLSPOM, we give necessary and sufficient conditions
for optimal (switched) linear controllers. When specialized to our particular MJLSPOM, we additionally
establish the existence of optimal linear controller, as well as its optimality within the class
of general controllers satisfying standard smoothness conditions. The known equivalence between
phase-type distributions and positive linear systems allows to leverage existing modeling tools,
but possibly with large computational costs. Motivated by this, we propose matrix exponential
approximation of holding times, resulting in pseudo-MJLSPOM representation, i.e., where the
transition rates could be negative. Such a representation is of relatively low order, and maintains
the same optimality conditions as for the MJLSPOM representation, but could violate non-negativity
of holding-time density functions. A two-step procedure consisting of a local pulling-up modification
and a filtering technique is constructed to enforce non-negativity.
