Inspired by the recent advances of Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) in deep learning, we propose
a novel rank minimization approach, termed rank residual constraint (RRC), for image denoising
in the optimization framework. Different from GAN, where a discriminative model is trained jointly
with a generative model, in image denoising, since the labels are not available, we build an unsupervised
mechanism, where two generative models are employed and jointly optimized. Specifically, by integrating
the image nonlocal self-similarity prior with the proposed RRC model, we develop an iterative algorithm
for image denoising. We first present a recursive based nonlocal means approach to obtain a good
reference of the original image patch groups, and then the rank residual of image patch groups between
this reference and the noisy image is minimized to achieve a better estimate of the desired image.
In this manner, both the reference and the estimated image in each iteration are improved gradually
and jointly; in the meantime, we progressively \emph{approximate} the underlying low-rank matrix
(constructed by image patch groups) via minimizing the rank residual, which is different from existing
low-rank based approaches that estimate the underlying low-rank matrix directly from the corrupted
observation. We further provide a theoretical analysis on the feasibility of the proposed RRC model
from the perspective of group-based sparse representation. Experimental results demonstrate
that the proposed RRC model outperforms many state-of-the-art denoising methods.
