The use of low-resolution analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) can significantly reduce power
consumption and hardware cost. However, severe nonlinear distortion due to low-resolution ADCs
makes achieving reliable data transmission challenging. Particularly, for orthogonal frequency
division multiplexing (OFDM) transmission, the orthogonality among subcarriers is destroyed,
which invalidates the conventional linear receivers that highly relies on this orthogonality.
In this study, we develop an efficient system architecture for OFDM transmission with ultra-low
resolution ADC (e.g., 1-2 bits). A novel channel estimator is proposed to estimate the desired channel
parameters without their priori distributions. In particular, we integrate the linear minimum
mean squared error channel estimator into the generalized Turbo (GTurbo) framework and derive
its corresponding extrinsic information to guarantee the convergence of the GTurbo-based algorithm.
We also propose feasible schemes for automatic gain control, noise power estimation, and synchronization.
Furthermore, we construct a proof-of-concept prototyping system and conduct over-the-air (OTA)
experiments to examine the feasibility/reliability of the entire system. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first work that focused on system design and implementation of communications with low-resolution
ADCs worldwide. Numerical simulation and OTA experiment results demonstrate that the proposed
system supports reliable OFDM data transmission with ultra-low resolution ADCs.
