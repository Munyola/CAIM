To defeat security threats such as man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)
4.2 and 5.x introduce the Secure Connections Only mode, under which a BLE device accepts only secure
paring protocols including Passkey Entry and Numeric Comparison from an initiator, e.g., an Android
mobile. However, the BLE specification does not explicitly require the Secure Connection Only
mode of the initiator. Taking the Android's BLE programming framework for example, we found that
it cannot enforce secure pairing, invalidating the security protection provided by the Secure
Connection Only mode. The same problem applies to Apple iOS too. Specifically, we examine the life
cycle of a BLE pairing process in Android and identify four severe design flaws. These design flaws
can be exploited by attackers to perform downgrading attacks, forcing the BLE pairing protocols
to run in the insecure mode without the users' awareness. To validate our findings, we selected and
tested 18 popular BLE commercial products and our experimental results proved that downgrading
attacks and MITM attacks were all possible to these products. All 3501 BLE apps from Androzoo are
also subject to these attacks. For defense, we have designed and implemented a prototype of the Secure
Connection Only mode on Android 8 through the Android Open Source Project (AOSP). We have reported
the identified BLE pairing vulnerabilities to Bluetooth Special Interest Group (SIG), Google,
Apple, Texas Instruments (TI) and all of them are actively addressing this issue. Google rated the
reported security flaw a High Severity.
