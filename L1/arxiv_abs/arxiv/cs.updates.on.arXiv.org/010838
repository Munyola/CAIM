Understanding the major fraud problems in the world and interpreting the data available for analysis
is a current challenge that requires interdisciplinary knowledge to complement the knowledge
of computer professionals. Collaborative events (called Hackathons, Datathons, Codefests,
Hack Days, etc.) have become relevant in several fields. Examples of fields which are explored in
these events include startup development, open civic innovation, corporate innovation, and social
issues. These events have features that favor knowledge exchange to solve challenges. In this paper,
we present an event format called Short Datathon, a Hackathon for the development of exploratory
data analysis and visualization skills. Our goal is to evaluate if participating in a Short Datathon
can help participants learn basic data analysis and visualization concepts. We evaluated the Short
Datathon in two case studies, with a total of 20 participants, carried out at the Federal University
of Technology - Paran\'a. In both case studies we addressed the issue of tax evasion using real world
data. We describe, as a result of this work, the qualitative aspects of the case studies and the perception
of the participants obtained through questionnaires. Participants stated that the event helped
them understand more about data analysis and visualization and that the experience with people
from other areas during the event made data analysis more efficient. Further studies are necessary
to evolve the format of the event and to evaluate its effectiveness.
