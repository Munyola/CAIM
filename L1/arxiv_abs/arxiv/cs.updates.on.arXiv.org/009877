In this survey paper, we systematically summarize the current literature on studies that apply
machine learning (ML) and data mining techniques to bearing fault diagnostics. Conventional ML
methods, including artificial neural network (ANN), principal component analysis (PCA), support
vector machines (SVM), etc., have been successfully applied to detecting and categorizing bearing
faults since the last decade, while the application of deep learning (DL) methods has sparked great
interest in both the industry and academia in the last five years. In this paper, we will first review
the conventional ML methods, before taking a deep dive into the latest developments in DL algorithms
for bearing fault applications. Specifically, the superiority of the DL based methods over the
conventional ML methods are analyzed in terms of metrics directly related to fault feature extraction
and classifier performances; the new functionalities offered by DL techniques that cannot be accomplished
before are also summarized. In addition, to obtain a more intuitive insight, a comparative study
is performed on the classifier performance and accuracy for a number of papers utilizing the open
source Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) bearing data set. Finally, based on the nature of
the time-series 1-D data obtained from sensors monitoring the bearing conditions, recommendations
and suggestions are provided to applying DL algorithms on bearing fault diagnostics based on specific
applications, as well as future research directions to further improve its performance.
