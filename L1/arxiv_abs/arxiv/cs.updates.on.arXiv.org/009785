Recognition of Handwritten Mathematical Expressions (HMEs) is a challenging problem because
of the ambiguity and complexity of two-dimensional handwriting. Moreover, the lack of large training
data is a serious issue, especially for academic recognition systems. In this paper, we propose
pattern generation strategies that generate shape and structural variations to improve the performance
of recognition systems based on a small training set. For data generation, we employ the public databases:
CROHME 2014 and 2016 of online HMEs. The first strategy employs local and global distortions to generate
shape variations. The second strategy decomposes an online HME into sub-online HMEs to get more
structural variations. The hybrid strategy combines both these strategies to maximize shape and
structural variations. The generated online HMEs are converted to images for offline HME recognition.
We tested our strategies in an end-to-end recognition system constructed from a recent deep learning
model: Convolutional Neural Network and attention-based encoder-decoder. The results of experiments
on the CROHME 2014 and 2016 databases demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of our strategies:
our hybrid strategy achieved classification rates of 48.78% and 45.60%, respectively, on these
databases. These results are competitive compared to others reported in recent literature. Our
generated datasets are openly available for research community and constitute a useful resource
for the HME recognition research in future.
