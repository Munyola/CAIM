Estimation of the Discrete-Space Fourier Transform (DSFT) at points of a finite domain arises in
many two-dimensional signal processing applications. As a new approach to tackling this task,
the notion of a Golden Angle Linogram Fourier Domain (GALFD) is presented, together with a computationally
fast and accurate tool, named Golden Angle Linogram Evaluation (GALE), for the approximation of
the DSFT at points of a GALFD. The sampling pattern in a GALFD resembles those in the linogram approach,
which has been demonstrated to be efficient and accurate. The Linogram Fourier Domain (LFD) comprises
the intersections of concentric squares with radial lines in an arrangement that facilitates computational
efficiency. A limitation of linograms is that embedding of an LFD into a larger one requires many
extra points, typically at least doubling the domain's cardinality. This prevents incremental
inclusion of new data since, for using an LFD of slightly larger cardinality, the data acquired for
the smaller LFD have to be discarded. This is overcome by the use of the GALFD, in which the radial lines
are obtained by rotations with golden angle increments. Approximation error bounds and floating
point operations counts are presented to show that GALE computes accurately and efficiently the
DSFT at the points of a GALFD. The ability to extend the data collection in small increments is beneficial
in applications such as Magnetic Resonance Imaging. Experiments for simulated and for real-world
data are presented to substantiate the theoretical claims.
