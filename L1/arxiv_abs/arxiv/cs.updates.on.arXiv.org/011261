We settle complexity questions of two problems about the free monoid $L^*$ generated by a finite
set $L$ of words over an alphabet $\Sigma$. The first one is the Frobenius monoid problem, which is
the question whether for a given finite set of words $L$, the language $L^*$ is cofinite. The open
question concerning its computational complexity was originally posed by Shallit and Xu in~2009.
The second problem is whether $L^*$ is \emph{factor universal}, which means that every word over
$\Sigma$ is a factor of some word from $L^*$. It is related to the longstanding Restivo's open question
about the maximal length of the shortest words which are not factors of any word from $L^*$. We show
that both problems are PSPACE-complete, which holds even if the alphabet is binary. Both solutions
share a large part of the construction. As auxiliary tools, we introduce three immortality problems
concerning some types of rewriting systems. Additionally, we exhibit families of sets $L$ that
show exponential (in the sum of the lengths of words in $L$) worst-case lower bounds on the lengths
related to both problems: the length of the longest words not in $L^*$ when $L^*$ is cofinite, and
the length of the shortest words that are not a factor of any word in $L^*$. The second family essentially
settles in the negative the Restivo's conjecture and its weaker variations. Finally, we note upper
bounds on the computation time and the length for both problems, which are exponential only in the
length of the longest words in $L$.
