In the monitoring of a complex electric grid, it is of paramount importance to provide operators
with early warnings of anomalies detected on the network, along with a precise classification and
diagnosis of the specific fault type. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-stage early warning
system prototype for electric grid fault detection, classification, subgroup discovery, and
visualization. In the first stage, a computationally efficient anomaly detection method based
on quartiles detects the presence of a fault in real time. In the second stage, the fault is classified
into one of nine pre-defined disaster scenarios. The time series data are first mapped to highly
discriminative features by applying dimensionality reduction based on temporal autocorrelation.
The features are then mapped through one of three classification techniques: support vector machine,
random forest, and artificial neural network. Finally in the third stage, intra-class clustering
based on dynamic time warping is used to characterize the fault with further granularity. Results
on the Bonneville Power Administration electric grid data show that i) the proposed anomaly detector
is both fast and accurate; ii) dimensionality reduction leads to dramatic improvement in classification
accuracy and speed; iii) the random forest method offers the most accurate, consistent, and robust
fault classification; and iv) time series within a given class naturally separate into five distinct
clusters which correspond closely to the geographical distribution of electric grid buses.
