Knowledge tracing (KT) refers to a machine learning technique to assess a student's level of understanding
(so-called knowledge state) of a certain concept based on the student performance on problem solving.
KT accepts a series of question-answer pairs as an input and iteratively updates the knowledge state
of the student, eventually returning the probability of the student solving an unseen question.
From the viewpoint of neuroeducation (the field of applying neuroscience, cognitive science,
and psychology to education), however, KT leaves much room for improvement in terms of explaining
the complex process of human learning. In this paper, we identify three problems of KT (namely non
adaptive knowledge growth, neglected latent information, and unintended negative influence)
and propose a memory-network-based technique named intelligent knowledge tracing (IKT) to address
them, thus approaching one step closer to understanding the complex mechanism underlying human
learning. In addition, we propose a new performance metric called correct update count (CUC) that
can measure the degree of unintended negative influence, thus quantifying how closely a student
model resembles the human learning process. The proposed CUC metric can complement the area under
the curve (AUC) metric, allowing us to evaluate competing models more effectively. According to
our experiments using a widely used public benchmark, IKT significantly (over two times) outperformed
the existing KT approaches in terms of CUC, while preserving the correctness behavior measured
in AUC.
