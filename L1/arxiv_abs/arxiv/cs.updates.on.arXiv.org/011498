The production of medical images in digital format has been growing in the most varied healthcare
providers, currently representing an essential element for supporting medical diagnosis and
treatment. In this field, formats, transmission, and visualization processes are defined by the
international Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) standard. Traditional
departmental repositories have poor access control policies and authenticated users have access
to all repository resources when using standard DICOM network services. Usually, this issue is
minimized in small environments because the repository is consumed by a unique frontend application
that imposes additional controls. However, a vendor-neutral repository is supposed to be accessible
to distinct parties through standard services. Moreover, many healthcare institutions are outsourcing
their repositories to the Cloud to be shared by distinct functional domains. This article proposes
and describes the implementation of an innovator ownership concept and access control mechanisms
in standard medical imaging resources, particularly in the context of centralized storage services
supporting multiple repositories instances. The developed accounting mechanism is capable of
associate the repository resources permissions, and delegation of rights, to third entities.
The solution also provides a programmatic interface, made available through web services, for
management of proposed services. The concept validation was done through the integration of proposed
architecture in an open-source archive.
