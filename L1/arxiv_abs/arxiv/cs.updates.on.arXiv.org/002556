Most of the existing medicine recommendation systems that are mainly based on electronic medical
records (EMRs) are significantly assisting doctors to make better clinical decisions benefiting
both patients and caregivers. Even though the growth of EMRs is at a lighting fast speed in the era
of big data, content limitations in EMRs restrain the existed recommendation systems to reflect
relevant medical facts, such as drug-drug interactions. Many medical knowledge graphs that contain
drug-related information, such as DrugBank, may give hope for the recommendation systems. However,
the direct use of these knowledge graphs in the systems suffers from robustness caused by the incompleteness
of the graphs. To address these challenges, we stand on recent advances in graph embedding learning
techniques and propose a novel framework, called Safe Medicine Recommendation (SMR), in this paper.
Specifically, SMR first constructs a high-quality heterogeneous graph by bridging EMRs (MIMIC-III)
and medical knowledge graphs (ICD-9 ontology and DrugBank). Then, SMR jointly embeds diseases,
medicines, patients, and their corresponding relations into a shared lower dimensional space.
Finally, SMR uses the embeddings to decompose the medicine recommendation into a link prediction
process while considering the patient's diagnoses and adverse drug reactions. To our best knowledge,
SMR is the first to learn embeddings of a patient-disease-medicine graph for medicine recommendation
in the world. Extensive experiments on real datasets are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness
of proposed framework.
