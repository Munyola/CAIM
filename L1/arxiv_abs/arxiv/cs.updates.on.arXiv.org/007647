For a graph $G$ and integer $q\geq 2$, an edge $q$-coloring of $G$ is an assignment of colors to edges
of $G$, such that edges incident on a vertex span at most $q$ distinct colors. The maximum edge $q$-coloring
problem seeks to maximize the number of colors in an edge $q$-coloring of a graph $G$. The problem
has been studied in combinatorics in the context of {\em anti-Ramsey} numbers. Algorithmically,
the problem is NP-Hard for $q\geq 2$ and assuming the unique games conjecture, it cannot be approximated
in polynomial time to a factor less than $1+1/q$. The case $q=2$, is particularly relevant in practice,
and has been well studied from the view point of approximation algorithms. A $2$-factor algorithm
is known for general graphs, and recently a $5/3$-factor approximation bound was shown for graphs
with perfect matching. The algorithm (which we refer to as the matching based algorithm) is as follows:
"Find a maximum matching $M$ of $G$. Give distinct colors to the edges of $M$. Let $C_1,C_2,\ldots,
C_t$ be the connected components that results when M is removed from G. To all edges of $C_i$ give the
$(|M|+i)$th color." In this paper, we first show that the approximation guarantee of the matching
based algorithm is $(1 + \frac {2} {\delta})$ for graphs with perfect matching and minimum degree
$\delta$. For $\delta \ge 4$, this is better than the $\frac {5} {3}$ approximation guarantee proved
in {AAAP}. For triangle free graphs with perfect matching, we prove that the approximation factor
is $(1 + \frac {1}{\delta - 1})$, which is better than $5/3$ for $\delta \ge 3$.
