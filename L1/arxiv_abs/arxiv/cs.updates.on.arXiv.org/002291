A lot of effort has been made in the literature to remove the common prior assumption in Bayesian mechanism
design ---the assumption that the distributions of the players' private types are common knowledge
to the designer and the players. In Bayesian auctions, dominant-strategy truthful mechanisms
require that the seller has full information about the distributions. Crowdsourced Bayesian auctions,
first considered by Azar, Chen and Micali (2012), require that each player knows the distributions
or their refinements. However, in all the studies, at least one agent (whether the seller or a player)
needs to possess enough information about the distributions for the seller to generate good revenue
in the auction. An important conceptual contribution of this work is to allow the knowledge about
the distributions to be arbitrarily scattered among the players and the seller. "Nobody knows all,
but somebody knows something." More precisely, each one of them privately knows some or none of the
value distributions (or their refinements). No constraint is imposed on who knows which distributions,
and the seller does not know who knows what. In such an unstructured information setting, we are able
to design mechanisms for unit-demand auctions and additive auctions that aggregate the players'
and the seller's knowledge, generating revenue that are constant approximations to the optimal
Bayesian mechanisms. Our mechanisms are 2-step dominant-strategy truthful and the revenue increases
gracefully with the amount of knowledge the players collectively have.
