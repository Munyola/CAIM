In psychology and neuroscience it is common to describe cognitive systems as input/output devices
where perceptual and motor functions are implemented in a purely feedforward, open-loop fashion.
On this view, perception and action are often seen as encapsulated modules with limited interaction
between them. While embodied and enactive approaches to cognitive science have challenged the
idealisation of the brain as an input/output device, we argue that even the more recent attempts
to model systems using closed-loop architectures still heavily rely on a strong separation between
motor and perceptual functions. Previously, we have suggested that the mainstream notion of modularity
strongly resonates with the separation principle of control theory. In this work we present a minimal
model of a sensorimotor loop implementing an architecture based on the separation principle. We
link this to popular formulations of perception and action in the cognitive sciences, and show its
limitations when, for instance, external forces are not modelled by an agent. These forces can be
seen as variables that an agent cannot directly control, i.e., a perturbation from the environment
or an interference caused by other agents. As an alternative approach inspired by embodied cognitive
science, we then propose a nonmodular architecture based on the active inference framework. We
demonstrate the robustness of this architecture to unknown external inputs and show that the mechanism
with which this is achieved in linear models is equivalent to integral control.
