This paper presents a games-in-games approach to provide design guidelines for mosaic command
and control that enables the secure and resilient multi-domain operations. Under the mosaic design,
pieces or agents in the network are equipped with flexible interoperability and the capability
of self-adaptability, self-healing, and resiliency so that they can reconfigure their responses
to achieve the global mission in spite of failures of nodes and links in the adversarial environment.
The proposed games-in-games approach provides a system-of-systems science for mosaic distributed
design of large-scale systems. Specifically, the framework integrates three layers of design
for each agent including strategic layer, tactical layer, and mission layer. Each layer in the established
model corresponds to a game of a different scale that enables the integration of threat models and
achieve self-mitigation and resilience capabilities. The solution concept of the developed multi-layer
multi-scale mosaic design is characterized by Gestalt Nash equilibrium (GNE) which considers
the interactions between agents across different layers. The developed approach is applicable
to modern battlefield networks which are composed of heterogeneous assets that access highly diverse
and dynamic information sources over multiple domains. By leveraging mosaic design principles,
we can achieve the desired operational goals of deployed networks in a case study and ensure connectivity
among entities for the exchange of information to accomplish the mission.
