Cyber-physical systems (CPSs) are part of most critical infrastructures such as industrial automation
and transportation systems. Thus, security incidents targeting CPSs can have disruptive consequences
to assets and people. As prior incidents tend to re-occur, sharing knowledge about these incidents
can help organizations be more prepared to prevent, mitigate or investigate future incidents.
This paper proposes a novel approach to enable representation and sharing of knowledge about CPS
incidents across different organizations. To support sharing, we represent incident knowledge
(incident patterns) capturing incident characteristics that can manifest again, such as incident
activities or vulnerabilities exploited by offenders. Incident patterns are a more abstract representation
of specific incident instances and, thus, are general enough to be applicable to various systems
- different than the one in which the incident occurred. They can also avoid disclosing potentially
sensitive information about an organization's assets and resources. We provide an automated technique
to extract an incident pattern from a specific incident instance. To understand how an incident
pattern can manifest again in other cyber-physical systems, we also provide an automated technique
to instantiate incident patterns to specific systems. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach
in the application domain of smart buildings. We evaluate correctness, scalability, and performance
using two substantive scenarios inspired by real-world systems and incidents.
