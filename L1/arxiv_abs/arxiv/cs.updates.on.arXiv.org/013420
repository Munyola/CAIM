With the recent advances in Reinforcement Learning (RL), there have been tremendous interests
in employing RL for recommender systems. RL-based recommender systems have two key advantages:
(i) they can continuously update their recommendation strategies according to users' real-time
feedback, and (ii) the optimal strategy maximizes the long-term reward from users, such as the total
revenue of a recommendation session. However, directly training and evaluating a new RL-based
recommendation algorithm needs to collect users' real-time feedback in the real system, which
is time and efforts consuming and could negatively impact on users' experiences. Thus, it calls
for a user simulator that can mimic real users' behaviors where we can pre-train and evaluate new
recommendation algorithms. Simulating users' behaviors in a dynamic system faces immense challenges
-- (i) the underlining item distribution is complex, and (ii) historical logs for each user are limited.
In this paper, we develop a user simulator base on Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). To be specific,
we design the generator to capture the underlining distribution of users' historical logs and generate
realistic logs that can be considered as augmentations of real logs; while the discriminator is
developed to not only distinguish real and fake logs but also predict users' behaviors. The experimental
results based on real-world e-commerce data demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed simulator.
Further experiments have been conducted to understand the importance of each component in the simulator.
