Dense linear algebra kernels are critical for wireless applications, and the oncoming proliferation
of 5G only amplifies their importance. Many such matrix algorithms are inductive, and exhibit ample
amounts of fine-grain ordered parallelism -- when multiple computations flow with fine-grain
producer/consumer dependences, and where the iteration domain is not easily tileable. Synchronization
overheads make multi-core parallelism ineffective and the non-tileable iterations make the vector-VLIW
approach less effective, especially for the typically modest-sized matrices. Because CPUs and
DSPs lose order-of-magnitude performance/hardware utilization, costly and inflexible ASICs
are often employed in signal processing pipelines. A programmable accelerator with similar performance/power/area
would be highly desirable. We find that fine-grain ordered parallelism can be exploited by supporting:
1. fine-grain stream-based communication/synchronization; 2. inductive data-reuse and memory
access patterns; 3. implicit vector-masking for partial vectors; 4. hardware specialization
of dataflow criticality. In this work, we propose, REVEL, as a next-generation DSP architecture.
It supports the above features in its ISA and microarchitecture, and further uses a novel vector-stream
control paradigm to reduce control overheads. Across a suite of linear algebra kernels, REVEL outperforms
equally provisioned DSPs by 4.6x-37x in latency and achieves a performance per mm 2 of 8.3x. It is
only 2.2x higher power to achieve the same performance as ideal ASICs, at about 55% of the combined
area.
