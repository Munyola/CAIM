Event-based cameras can measure intensity changes (called `{\it events}') with microsecond accuracy
under high-speed motion and challenging lighting conditions. With the active pixel sensor (APS),
the event camera allows simultaneous output of the intensity frames. However, the output images
are captured at a relatively low frame-rate and often suffer from motion blur. A blurry image can
be regarded as the integral of a sequence of latent images, while the events indicate the changes
between the latent images. Therefore, we are able to model the blur-generation process by associating
event data to a latent image. Based on the abundant event data and the low frame-rate easily blurred
images, we propose a simple and effective approach to reconstruct a high-quality and high frame-rate
shape video. Starting with a single blurry frame and its event data, we propose the \textbf{Event-based
Double Integral (EDI)} model. Then, we extend it to \textbf{ multiple Event-based Double Integral
(mEDI)} model to get more smooth and convincing results based on multiple images and their events.
We also provide an efficient solver to minimize the proposed energy model. By optimizing the energy
model, we achieve significant improvements in removing general blurs and reconstructing high
temporal resolution video. The video generation is based on solving a simple non-convex optimization
problem in a single scalar variable. Experimental results on both synthetic and real images demonstrate
the superiority of our mEDI model and optimization method in comparison to the state-of-the-art.
