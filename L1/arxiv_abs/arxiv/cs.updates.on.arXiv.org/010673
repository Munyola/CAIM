We consider a production line consisting of several machines in series separated by intermediate
finite-capacity buffers. The line operates under an "echelon buffer" (EB) policy according to
which each machine can store the parts that it produces in any of its downstream buffers if the next
machine is occupied. If the capacities of all but the last buffer are zero, the EB policy is equivalent
to CONWIP. To evaluate the performance of the line under the EB policy, we model it as a queueing network,
and we develop a method that decomposes this network into as many nested segments as there are buffers
and approximates each segment with a two-machine subsystem that can be analyzed in isolation. For
the case where the machines have geometrically distributed processing times, we model each subsystem
as a two-dimensional Markov chain that can be solved numerically. The parameters of the subsystems
are determined by relationships among the flows of parts through the echelon buffers in the original
system. An iterative algorithm is developed to solve these relationships. We use this method to
evaluate the performance of several instances of 5- and 10-machine lines including cases where
the EB policy is equivalent to CONWIP. Our numerical results show that this method is highly accurate
and computationally efficient. We also compare the performance of the EB policy against the performance
of the traditional "installation buffer" policy according to which each machine can store the parts
that it produces only in its immediate downstream buffer if the next machine is occupied.
