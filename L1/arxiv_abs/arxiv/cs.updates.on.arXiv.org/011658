Terahertz communication is emerging as a future technology to support Terabits per second link
(Tbps) with highlighting features as high throughput and negligible latency. However, the unique
features of Terahertz band such as high path loss, scattering and reflection pose new challenges
and results in short communication distance. The antenna directionality, in turn, is required
to enhance the communication distance and to overcome the high path loss. However, these features
in combine negate the use of traditional Medium access protocols. Therefore novel MAC protocol
designs are required to fully exploit their potential benefits including efficient channel access,
control message exchange, link establishment, mobility management, and line-of-sight blockage
mitigation. An in-depth survey of Terahertz MAC protocols is presented in this paper. The paper
highlights the key features of the Terahertz band which should be considered while designing an
efficient Terahertz MAC protocol, and the decisions which if taken at Terahertz MAC layer can enhance
the network performance. Different Terahertz applications at macro and nano scales are highlighted
with design requirements for their MAC protocols. The MAC protocol design issues and considerations
are highlighted. Further, the existing MAC protocols are also classified based on network topology,
channel access mechanisms, and link establishment strategies as Transmitter and Receiver initiated
communication. Some open challenges and future research directions on Terahertz MAC protocols
are highlighted.
