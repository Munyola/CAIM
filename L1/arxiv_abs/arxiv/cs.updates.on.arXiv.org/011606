Event-based cameras measure intensity changes (called events) with microsecond accuracy under
high-speed motion and challenging lighting conditions. With the active pixel sensor (APS), event
cameras allow simultaneous output of intensity frames. However, the output images are captured
at a relatively low frame rate and often suffer from motion blur. A blurred image can be regarded as
the integral of a sequence of latent images, while events indicate changes between the latent images.
Thus, we are able to model the blur-generation process by associating event data to a latent sharp
image. Based on the abundant event data alongside low frame rate, easily blurred images, we propose
a simple yet effective approach to reconstruct high-quality and high frame rate sharp videos. Starting
with a single blurred frame and its event data, we propose the Event-based Double Integral (EDI)
model and solve it by adding regularization terms. Then, we extend it to multiple Event-based Double
Integral (mEDI) model to get more smooth results based on multiple images and their events. Furthermore,
we provide a new and more efficient solver to minimize the proposed energy model. By optimizing the
energy function, we achieve significant improvements in removing blur and the reconstruction
of a high temporal resolution video. The video generation is based on solving a simple non-convex
optimization problem in a single scalar variable. Experimental results on both synthetic and real
sequences demonstrate the superiority of our mEDI model and optimization method compared to the
state of the art.
