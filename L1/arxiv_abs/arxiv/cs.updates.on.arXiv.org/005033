As a means of improving analysis of biological shapes, we propose an algorithm for sampling a Riemannian
manifold by greedily selecting points with maximum uncertainty under a Gaussian process model.
This strategy is known to be near-optimal in the experimental design literature, and appears to
outperform the use of user-placed landmarks in representing the geometry of biological objects
in our application. In the noiseless regime, we establish an upper bound for the mean squared prediction
error (MSPE) in terms of the number of samples and geometric quantities of the manifold, demonstrating
that the MSPE for our proposed sequential design decays at a rate comparable to the oracle rate achievable
by any sequential or non-sequential optimal design; to our knowledge this is the first result of
this type for sequential experimental design. The key is to link the greedy algorithm to reduced
basis methods in the context of model reduction for partial differential equations. We then apply
the proposed landmarking algorithm to geometric morphometrics, a branch of evolutionary biology
focusing on the analysis and comparisons of anatomical shapes, and compare the automatically sampled
landmarks with the "ground truth" landmarks manually placed by evolutionary anthropologists;
the results suggest that Gaussian process landmarks perform equally well or better, in terms of
both spatial coverage and downstream statistical analysis. We expect this approach will find additional
applications in other fields of research.
