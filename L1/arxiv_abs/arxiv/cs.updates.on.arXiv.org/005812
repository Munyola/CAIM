We discuss the problem of deriving compact and tractable lower bounds for the Fisher information
matrix. To motivate our particular approach towards such expressions, we first examine the structure
of the exact Fisher information matrix in the context of exponential family models. Then, by replacing
an arbitrary data model by an equivalent distribution within the exponential family of distributions,
we derive a lower bound for the Fisher information measure of probabilistic models with multivariate
output and multiple parameters. The pessimistic information matrix allows a tractable quantitative
analysis of the parameter-specific information flow through nonlinear random systems. Therefore,
the technique is exploited for the performance analysis concerning direction-of-arrival estimation
of wireless source signals with a binary radio sensor array. Further, by the example of a sensing
device exhibiting amplifier saturation, we outline how the information bound can be used to learn
compression schemes which preserve the parameter-specific information within the data while
the probabilistic model is unknown. We also show that the conservative estimation performance
characterized by the pessimistic Fisher information matrix is asymptotically achieved by a consistent
estimator operating on compressed data. A reformulation of the estimation algorithm turns out
to be reminiscent of Hansen's generalized method of moments while the pessimistic Fisher information
matrix shows a vivid interpretation within a particular Gaussian modeling framework.
