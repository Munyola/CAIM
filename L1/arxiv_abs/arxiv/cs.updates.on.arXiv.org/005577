High-performance computing trends towards many-core systems are expected to continue over the
next decade. As a result, parallel-in-time methods, mathematical formulations which exploit
additional degrees of parallelism in the time dimension, have gained increasing interest in recent
years. In this work we study a massively parallel rational approximation of exponential integrators
(REXI). This method replaces a time integration of stiff linear oscillatory and diffusive systems
by the sum of the solutions of many decoupled systems, which can be solved in parallel. Previous numerical
studies showed that this reformulation allows taking arbitrarily long time steps for the linear
oscillatory parts. The present work studies the non-linear shallow-water equations on the rotating
sphere, a simplified system of equations used to study properties of space and time discretization
methods in the context of atmospheric simulations. After introducing time integrators, we first
compare the time step sizes to the errors in the simulation, discussing pros and cons of different
formulations of REXI. Here, REXI already shows superior properties compared to explicit and implicit
time stepping methods. Additionally, we present wallclock-time-to-error results revealing
the sweet spots of REXI obtaining either a 3x higher accuracy or a reduced time-to-solution. Finally,
a detailed performance analysis of REXI reveals that the communication in time takes only 4% of the
overall wallclock time. Our results motivate further explorations of REXI for operational weather/climate
systems.
