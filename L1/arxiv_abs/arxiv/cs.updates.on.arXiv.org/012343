Utilization of directional antennas is a promising solution for efficient spectrum sensing and
accurate source localization and tracking. Spectrum sensors equipped with directional antennas
should constantly scan the space in order to track emitting sources and discover new activities
in the area of interest. In this paper, we propose a new formulation that unifies received-signal-strength
(RSS) and direction of arrival (DoA) in a compressive sensing (CS) framework. The underlying CS
measurement matrix is a function of beamforming vectors of sensors and is referred to as the propagation
matrix. Comparing to the omni-directional antenna case, our employed propagation matrix provides
more incoherent projections, an essential factor in the compressive sensing theory. Based on the
new formulation, we optimize the antenna beams, enhance spectrum sensing efficiency, track active
primary users accurately and monitor spectrum activities in an area of interest. In many practical
scenarios there is no fusion center to integrate received data from spectrum sensors. We propose
the distributed version of our algorithm for such cases. Experimental results show a significant
improvement in source localization accuracy, compared with the scenario when sensors are equipped
with omni-directional antennas. Applicability of the proposed framework for dynamic radio cartography
is shown. Moreover, comparing the estimated dynamic RF map over time with the ground truth demonstrates
the effectiveness of our proposed method for accurate signal estimation and recovery.
