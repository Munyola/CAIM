The last years of the 20 th century and the beginning of the 21 th mark the facilitation trend of our
real life due to the big development and progress of the computers and other intelligent devices.
Algorithms based on artificial intelligence are basically a part of the software. The transmitted
information by Internet or LAN arises continuously and it is expected that the protection of the
data has been ensured. The aim of the present paper is to reveal false names of users' accounts as a
result of hackers' attacks. The probability a given account to be either false or actual is calculated
using a novel approach combining machine learning analysis (especially clusters' analysis) with
chaos theory. The suspected account will be used as a pattern and by classification techniques clusters
will be formed with a respective probability this name to be false. This investigation puts two main
purposes: First, to determine if there exists a trend of appearance of the similar usernames, which
arises during the creation of new accounts. Second, to detect the false usernames and to discriminate
those from the real ones, independently of that if two types of accounts are generated with the same
speed. These security systems are applied in different areas, where the security of the data in users'
accounts is strictly required. For example, they can be used in on-line voting for balloting, in
studying the social opinion by inquiries, in protection of the information in different user accounts
of given system etc.
