We present a set-oriented graph-based computational framework for continuous-time optimal transport
over nonlinear dynamical systems. We recover provably optimal control laws for steering a given
initial distribution in phase space to a final distribution in prescribed finite time for the case
of non-autonomous nonlinear control-affine systems, while minimizing a quadratic control cost.
The resulting control law can be used to obtain approximate feedback laws for individual agents
in a swarm control application. Using infinitesimal generators, the optimal control problem is
reduced to a modified Monge-Kantorovich optimal transport problem, resulting in a convex Benamou-Brenier
type fluid dynamics formulation on a graph. The well-posedness of this problem is shown to be a consequence
of the graph being strongly-connected, which in turn is shown to result from controllability of
the underlying dynamical system. Using our computational framework, we study optimal transport
of distributions where the underlying dynamical systems are chaotic, and non-holonomic. The solutions
to the optimal transport problem elucidate the role played by invariant manifolds, lobe-dynamics
and almost-invariant sets in efficient transport of distributions in finite time. Our work connects
set-oriented operator-theoretic methods in dynamical systems with optimal mass transportation
theory, and opens up new directions in design of efficient feedback control strategies for nonlinear
multi-agent and swarm systems operating in nonlinear ambient flow fields.
