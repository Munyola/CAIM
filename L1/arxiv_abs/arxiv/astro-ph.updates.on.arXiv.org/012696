VLBI and JVLA observations revealed that GW170817 involved a narrow jet ($ \theta_j \approx 4^\circ
$) that dominated the afterglow peak at our viewing angle, $ \theta_{\rm obs} \approx 20^\circ $.
This implies that at the time of the afterglow peak, the observed signal behaved like an afterglow
of a top-hat jet seen at $ \theta_{\rm obs} \gg \theta_j $, and it can be modeled by analytic expressions
that describe such jets. We use a set of numerical simulations to calibrate these analytic relations
and obtain generic equations for the peak time and flux of such an afterglow as seen from various observing
angles. Using the calibrated equations and the estimated parameters of GW170817, we estimate the
detectability of afterglows from future double neutron star mergers during the Advanced LIGO/Virgo
observation run O3. GW170817 took place at a relatively low-density environment. Afterglows of
similar events will be detectable only at small viewing angles, $ \theta_{\rm obs} \lesssim 20^\circ
$, and only $\sim 20\% $ of the GW detections of these events will be accompanied by a detectable afterglow.
At higher densities, more typical to sGRB sites, up to $ 70\% $ of the GW detections are expected to
be followed by a detectable afterglow, typically at $ \theta_{\rm obs} \sim 30^\circ $. We also provide
the latest time one should expect an afterglow detection. We find that for typical parameters, if
the jet emission had not been detected within about a year after the merger, it is unlikely to be detected
ever.
