Future Square Kilometre Array (SKA) surveys are expected to generate huge datasets of 21cm maps
on cosmological scales from the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). We assess the viability of exploiting
machine learning techniques, namely, convolutional neural networks (CNN), to simultaneously
estimate the astrophysical and cosmological parameters from 21cm maps from semi-numerical simulations.
We further convert the simulated 21cm maps into SKA-like mock maps using the detailed SKA antennae
distribution, thermal noise and a recipe for foreground cleaning. We successfully design two CNN
architectures (VGGNet-like and ResNet-like) that are both efficiently able to extract simultaneously
three astrophysical parameters, namely the photon escape fraction (f$_{\rm esc}$), the ionizing
emissivity power dependence on halo mass ($C_{\rm ion}$) and the ionizing emissivity redshift
evolution index ($D_{\rm ion}$), and three cosmological parameters, namely the matter density
parameter ($\Omega_{m}$), the dimensionless Hubble constant ($h$), and the matter fluctuation
amplitude ($\sigma_{8}$), from 21cm maps at several redshifts. With the presence of noise from
SKA, our designed CNNs are still able to recover these astrophysical and cosmological parameters
with great accuracy ($R^{2} > 90\%$), improving to $R^{2} > 95\%$ towards low redshift and low neutral
fraction values. Our results show that future 21cm observations can play a key role to break degeneracy
between models and tightly constrain the astrophysical and cosmological parameters.
