We investigate the evolution of interstellar dust in the Universe by means of chemical evolution
models of galaxies of different morphological types, reproducing the main observed features of
present day galaxies. We adopt the most updated prescriptions for dust production from supernovae
and asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars as well as for dust accretion and destruction processes.
Then, we study the cosmic dust rate in the framework of three different cosmological scenarios for
galaxy formation: i) a pure luminosity scenario (PLE), ii) a number density evolution scenario
(DE), as suggested by the classical hierarchical clustering scenario and iii) an alternative scenario,
in which both spirals and ellipticals are allowed to evolve in number on an observationally motivated
basis. Our results give predictions about the evolution of the dust content in different galaxies
as well as the cosmic dust rate as a function of redshift. Concerning the cosmic dust rate, the best
scenario is the alternative one, which predicts a peak at 2 < z < 3 and reproduces the cosmic star formation
rate. We compute the evolution of the comoving dust density parameter {\Omega} dust and find agreement
with data for z < 0.5 in the framework of DE and alternative scenarios. Finally, the evolution of the
average cosmic metallicity is presented and it shows a quite fast increase in each scenario, reaching
the solar value at the present time, although most of the heavy elements are incorporated into solid
grains, and therefore not observable in the gas phase.
