We present Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations of multiple protostar
systems in the Perseus molecular cloud previously detected by the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array
(VLA). We observed 17 close ($<$600~AU separation) multiple systems at 1.3~mm in continuum and
five molecular lines (i.e., \twco, \cateo, \thco, H$_2$CO, SO) to characterize the circum-multiple
environments in which these systems are forming. We detect at least one component in the continuum
for the 17 multiple systems. In three systems, one companion is not detected, and for two systems
the companions are unresolved at our observed resolution. We also detect circum-multiple dust
emission toward 8 out of 9 Class 0 multiples. Circum-multiple dust emission is not detected toward
any of the 8 Class I multiples. Twelve systems are detected in the dense gas tracers toward their disks/inner
envelopes. For these 12 systems, we use the dense gas observations to characterize their formation
mechanism. The velocity gradients in the circum-multiple gas are clearly orthogonal to the outflow
directions in 8 out of the 12 systems, consistent with disk fragmentation. Moreover, only two systems
with separations $<$200~AU are \textit{inconsistent} with disk fragmentation, in addition to
the two widest systems ($>$500~AU). Our results suggest that disk fragmentation via gravitational
instability is an important formation mechanism for close multiple systems, but further statistics
are needed to better determine the relative fraction formed via this method.
