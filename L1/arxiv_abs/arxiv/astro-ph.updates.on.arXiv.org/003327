Tidal dissipation, which is directly linked to internal structure, is one of the key physical mechanisms
that drive systems evolution and govern their architecture. A robust evaluation of its amplitude
is thus needed to predict evolution time for spins and orbits and their final states. The purpose
of this paper is to refine recent model of the anelastic tidal dissipation in the central dense region
of giant planets, commonly assumed to retain a large amount of heavy elements, which constitute
an important source of dissipation. The previous paper evaluated the impact of the presence of the
static fluid envelope on the tidal deformation of the core and on the associated anelastic tidal
dissipation, through the tidal quality factor Qc. We examine here its impact on the corresponding
effective anelastic tidal dissipation, through the effective tidal quality factor Qp. We show
that the strength of this mechanism mainly depends on mass concentration. In the case of Jupiter-
and Saturn-like planets, it can increase their effective tidal dissipation by, around, a factor
2.4 and 2 respectively. In particular, the range of the rheologies compatible with the observations
is enlarged compared to the results issued from previous formulations. We derive here an improved
expression of the tidal effective factor Qp in terms of the tidal dissipation factor of the core Qc,
without assuming the commonly used assumptions. When applied to giant planets, the formulation
obtained here allows a better match between the an elastic core's tidal dissipation of a two-layer
model and the observations.
