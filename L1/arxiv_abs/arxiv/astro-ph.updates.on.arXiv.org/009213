We present the discovery of a gravitationally lensed dust-reddened QSO at $z=2.517$ discovered
in a survey for red QSOs by infrared selection. $Hubble~Space~Telescope$ imaging in the WFC3/IR
F160W and F125W filters reveals a quadruply lensed system in a cusp configuration. We find that compared
to the central image of the cusp, the nearby, brightest image is anomalous by a factor of $\sim7-11$.
Although the source is extremely bright in the mid-infrared, a magnification by a factor of $\sim50-120$
places an upper limit of 1.35 mJy on the intrinsic mid-infrared brightness, well below the $WISE~W4$
detection limit of 6 mJy. We find that this QSO is moderately reddened, with $E(B-V)=0.7$ and that
$\sim1\%$ of the intrinsic spectrum is leaked back into the line of sight resulting in an upturn in
its UV spectrum. We conclude that the QSO's reddening is intrinsic and not due to the lens. Consistent
with previous red quasar samples, this source exhibits outflows in its spectrum as well as morphological
properties suggestive of it being in a merger-driven transitional phase. Depending on how $L_{\rm
bol}$ is computed, the quasar's accretion rate may be as high as $0.26~L_{\rm Edd}$. We detect two
Lyman limit systems, at $z=2.102$ and $z=2.431$, with absorption by metal lines likely at small
impact parameter to the QSO, and a putative lens redshift of $z=0.599$. Given the rarity of quad lenses,
the discovery of this source allows detailed study of a less luminous, more typical infrared-selected
quasar at high redshift.
