HD 166191 has been identified by several studies as hosting a rare and extremely bright warm debris
disc with an additional outer cool disc component. However, an alternative interpretation is that
the star hosts a disc that is currently in transition between a full gas disc and a largely gas-free
debris disc. With the help of new optical to mid-IR spectra and Herschel imaging, we argue that the
latter interpretation is supported in several ways: i) we show that HD 166191 is co-moving with the
~4 Myr-old Herbig Ae star HD 163296, suggesting that the two have the same age, ii) the disc spectrum
of HD 166191 is well matched by a standard radiative transfer model of a gaseous protoplanetary disc
with an inner hole, and iii) the HD 166191 mid-IR silicate feature is more consistent with similarly
primordial objects. We note some potential issues with the debris disc interpretation that should
be considered for such extreme objects, whose lifetime at the current brightness is mush shorter
than the stellar age, or in the case of the outer component requires a mass comparable to the solid
component of the Solar nebula. These aspects individually and collectively argue that HD 166191
is a 4-5 Myr old star that hosts a gaseous transition disc. Though it does not argue in favour of either
scenario, we find strong evidence for 3-5 um disc variability. We place HD 166191 in context with
discs at different evolutionary stages, showing that it is a potentially important object for understanding
the protoplanetary to debris disc transition.
