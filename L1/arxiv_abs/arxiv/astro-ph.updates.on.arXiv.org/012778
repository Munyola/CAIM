The impact of 2-body scattering on the innermost density profiles of dark matter haloes is well established.
We use a suite of cosmological simulations and idealised numerical experiments to show that 2-body
scattering is exacerbated in situations where there are two species of unequal mass. This is a consequence
of mass segregation and reflects a flow of kinetic energy from the more to less massive particles.
This has important implications for the interpretation of galaxy sizes in cosmological hydrodynamic
simulations which nearly always model stars with less massive particles than are used for the dark
matter. We compare idealised models as well as simulations from the EAGLE project that differ only
in the mass resolution of the dark matter component, but keep sub-grid physics, baryonic mass resolution
and gravitational force softening fixed. If the dark matter particle mass exceeds the mass of stellar
particles, then galaxy sizes--quantified by their projected half-mass radii, ${\rm R_{50}}$--increase
systematically with time until ${\rm R_{50}}$ exceeds a small fraction of the redshift-dependent
mean inter-particle separation, $l$ (${\rm R_{50}}\geq 0.05\times l$). Our conclusions should
also apply to simulations that adopt different hydrodynamic solvers, subgrid physics or adaptive
softening, but in that case may need quantitative revision. Any simulation employing a stellar-to-dark
matter particle mass ratio greater than unity will escalate spurious energy transfer from dark
matter to baryons on small scales.
