We use the Robo-AO survey of Kepler planetary candidate host stars, the largest adaptive optics
survey yet performed, to measure the recovery rate of close stellar binaries in Gaia DR2. We find
that Gaia recovers binaries down to 1" at magnitude contrasts as large as 6; closer systems are not
resolved, regardless of secondary brightness. Gaia DR2 binary detection does not have a strong
dependence on the orientation of the stellar pairs. We find 177 nearby stars to Kepler planetary
candidate host stars in Gaia DR2 that were not detected in the Robo-AO survey, almost all of which
are faint (G>20); the remainder were largely targets observed by Robo-AO in poor conditions. If
the primary star is the host, the impact on the radii estimates of planet candidates in these systems
is likely minimal; many of these faint stars, however, could be faint eclipsing binaries that are
the source of a false positive planetary transit signal. With Robo-AO and Gaia combined, we find
that 18.7% of Kepler planet candidate hosts have nearby stars within 4". We also find 36 nearby stars
in Gaia DR2 around 35 planetary candidate host stars detected with K2. The nearby star fraction rate
for K2 planetary candidates is significantly lower than that for the primary Kepler mission. The
binary recovery rate of Gaia will improve initial radius estimates of future TESS planet candidates
significantly, however ground-based high-resolution follow-up observations are still needed
for precise characterization and confirmation. The sensitivity of Gaia to closely separated binaries
is expected to improve in later data releases.
