This paper is a sequel to Takahashi et al. (2016), in which the authors investigated the influences
of fluctuations in pre-shock accreting matter on the linear stability of the standing accretion
shock in core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe). If one understands that this was concerning the effect
of the outer boundary condition for the post-shock accretion flows, the present paper should be
regarded as an investigation on the possible influences of the inner boundary conditions. More
specifically, we impose a time-dependent, oscillating condition at the inner boundary, having
in mind the injection of acoustic power by an oscillating proto-neutron star. We also consider possible
correlations between the inner and outer boundary conditions as invoked in the argument for Lepton-number
Emission Self-sustained Asymmetry, or LESA. In this paper, we conduct the linear stability analysis
of the standing accretion shock commonly encountered in CCSNe based on Laplace transform. We find
that the acoustic power enhances the standing accretion shock instability, or SASI, especially
when the luminosity is low. On the other hand, the correlation between the fluctuations of neutrino
luminosity at the neutrino sphere has little influences on the instability, changing the amplitudes
of eigenmodes only slightly. We further investigate steady solution of perturbation equations,
being motivated by LESA, and conclude that not the difference but the sum of the fluxes of electron-type
neutrinos and anti-neutrino is the key ingredient to production of the self-sustained steady perturbed
configuration.
