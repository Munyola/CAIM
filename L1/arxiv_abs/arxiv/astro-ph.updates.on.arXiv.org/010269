We have initiated a programme to study the physical/dynamical state of gas in galaxy clusters and
the impact of the cluster environment on gaseous halos of individual galaxies using X-ray imaging
and UV absorption line spectroscopy of background QSOs. Here we report results from the analysis
Chandra and XMM-Newton archival data of five galaxy clusters with such QSOs, one of which has an archival
UV spectrum. We characterize the gravitational masses and dynamical states, as well as the hot intracluster
medium (ICM) properties of these clusters. Most clusters are dynamically disturbed clusters based
on the X-ray morphology parameters, the X-ray temperature profiles, the large offset between X-ray
peak and brightest cluster galaxy (BCG). The baryon contents in the hot ICM and stars of these clusters
within $r_{500}$ are lower than the values expected from the gravitational masses, according to
the standard cosmology. We also estimate column densities of the hot ICM along the sightlines toward
the background QSOs as well as place upper limits on the warm-hot phase for the one sightline with
existing UV observations. These column densities, compared with those of the warm and warm-hot
ICM to be measured with UV absorption line spectroscopy, will enable us to probe the relationship
among various gaseous phases and their connection to the heating/cooling and dynamical processes
of the clusters. Furthermore, our analysis of the archival QSO spectrum probing one cluster underscores
the need for high quality, targeted UV observations to robustly constrain the 10$^{5-6}$ K gas phase.
