Small amounts of star formation in elliptical galaxies are suggested by several results: surprisingly
young ages from optical line indices, cooling X-ray gas, and mid-IR dust emission. Such star formation
has previously been difficult to directly detect, but using UV Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Wide
Field Camera 3 (WFC3) imaging, we have identified individual young stars and star clusters in four
nearby ellipticals. This technique is orders of magnitude more sensitive than other methods, allowing
detections of star formation to 10^(-5) Msun/yr. Ongoing star formation is detected in all galaxies,
including three ellipticals that have previously exhibited potential signposts of star forming
conditions (NGC 4636, NGC 4697, and NGC 4374), as well as the typical "red and dead" NGC 3379. The current
star formation in our closest targets, where we are most complete, is between 1-8x10^(-5) Msun/yr.
The star formation history was roughly constant from 0.5-1.5 Gyr (at 3-5x10^(-4) Msun/yr), but
decreased by a factor of several in the past 0.3 Gyr. Most star clusters have a mass between 10^2 - 10^4
Msun. The specific star formation rates of ~10^(-16) yr^(-1) (at the present day) or ~10^(-14) yr^(-1)
(when averaging over the past Gyr) imply that a fraction 10^(-8) of the stellar mass is younger than
100 Myr and 10^(-5) is younger than 1 Gyr, quantifying the level of frosting of recent star formation
over the otherwise passive stellar population. There is no obvious correlation between either
the presence or spatial distribution of postulated star formation indicators and the star formation
we detect.
