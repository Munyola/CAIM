We take advantage of a long (with a total exposure time of 120 ks) X-ray observation of the unique Galactic
microquasar SS 433, carried out with the XMM-Newton space observatory, to search for a fluorescent
line of neutral (or weakly ionized) nickel at the energy 7.5 keV. We consider two models of the formation
of fluorescent lines in the spectrum of SS 433: 1) due to reflection of hard X-ray radiation from a
putative central source on the optically thick walls of the accretion disk "funnel"; and 2) due to
scattering of the radiation coming from the hottest parts of the jets in the optically thin wind of
the system. It is shown, that for these cases, the photon flux of Ni I K$_{\alpha}$ fluorescent line
is expected to be 0.45 of the flux of Fe I K$_{\alpha}$ fluorescent line at 6.4 keV, for the relative
nickel overabundance $Z_{Ni}/Z = 10$, as observed in the jets of SS 433. For the continuum model without
the absorption edge of neutral iron, we set a 90 per cent upper limit on the flux of the narrow Ni I K$_{\alpha}$
line at the level of $0.9 \times 10^{-5}$ ph s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$. For the continuum model with the
absorption edge, the corresponding upper limit is $2.5 \times 10^{-5}$ ph s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$.
At the same time, for the Fe I K$_{\alpha}$ line, we measure the flux of $9.9_{8.4}^{11.2} \times
10^{-5}$ ph s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$. Taken at the face value, the results imply that the relative overabundance
of nickel in the wind of the accretion disc should be at least 1.5 times less than the corresponding
excess of nickel observed in the jets of SS 433.
