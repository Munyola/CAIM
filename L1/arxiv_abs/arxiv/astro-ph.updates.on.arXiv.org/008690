When binary black holes form in the field, it is expected that their orbits typically circularize
before coalescence. In galactic nuclei and globular clusters, binary black holes can form dynamically.
Recent results suggest that $\approx5\%$ of mergers in globular clusters result from three-body
interactions. These three-body interactions are expected to induce significant orbital eccentricity
$\gtrsim 0.1$ when they enter the Advanced LIGO band at a gravitational-wave frequency of $10$ Hz.
Measurements of binary black hole eccentricity therefore provide a clear means of determining
whether or not dynamical formation in globular clusters is the primary channel for producing binary
black hole mergers. We present a framework for performing Bayesian parameter estimation on gravitational-wave
observations of black hole inspirals. Using this framework, we determine the minimum detectable
eccentricity for an event with masses and distance similar to GW150914. At design sensitivity,
we find that the current generation of advanced observatories will be sensitive to orbital eccentricities
of $\gtrsim0.08$ at a gravitational-wave frequency of $10$ Hz, demonstrating that existing detectors
can use eccentricity to unambiguously distinguish between field binaries and globular cluster
triples. We demonstrate that given a fixed signal-to-noise ratio, eccentricity is easier to distinguish
in lower-mass events. We discuss how measurements of eccentricity can be used to infer the population
properties of binary black holes.
