Cosmic voids are the major volume component in the matter distribution of the Universe. They posses
great potential for constraining dark energy as well as for testing theories of gravity. Nevertheless,
in spite of their growing popularity as cosmological probes, a gap of knowledge between cosmic void
observations and theory still persists. In particular, the void size function models proposed
in literature have been proven unsuccessful in reproducing the results obtained from cosmological
simulations in which cosmic voids are detected from biased tracers of the density field, undermining
the possibility of using them as cosmological probes. The goal of this work is to cover this gap. In
particular, we make use of the findings of a previous work in which we have improved the void selection
procedure, presenting an algorithm that redefines the void ridges and, consequently, their radius.
By applying this algorithm, we validate the volume conserving model of the void size function on
a set of unbiased simulated density field tracers. We highlight the difference in the internal structure
between voids selected in this way and those identified by the popular VIDE void finder. We also extend
the validation of the model to the case of biased tracers. We find that a relation exists between the
tracer used to sample the underlying dark matter density field and its unbiased counterpart. Moreover,
we demonstrate that, as long as this relation is accounted for, the size function is a viable approach
for studying cosmology with cosmic voids.
