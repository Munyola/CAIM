We report on the discovery of three transiting super-Earths around EPIC 210897587, a relatively
bright early M dwarf ($V=12.81$ mag) observed during Campaign 13 of the NASA {\it K2} mission. To
characterize the system and validate the planet candidates, we conducted speckle imaging and high-dispersion
optical spectroscopy, including radial velocity measurements. Based on the {\it K2} light curve
and the spectroscopic characterization of the host star, the planet sizes and orbital periods are
$1.55_{-0.17}^{+0.20}\,R_\oplus$ and $6.34365\pm 0.00028$ days for the inner planet; $1.95_{-0.22}^{+0.27}\,R_\oplus$
and $13.85402\pm 0.00088$ days for the middle planet; and $1.64_{-0.17}^{+0.18}\,R_\oplus$
and $40.6835\pm 0.0031$ days for the outer planet. The outer planet (EPIC 210897587.3) is near the
habitable zone, with an insolation $1.67\pm 0.38$ times that of the Earth. The planet's radius falls
within the range between that of smaller rocky planets and larger gas-rich planets. To assess the
habitability of this planet, we present a series of 3D global climate simulations assuming that
EPIC 210897587.3 is tidally locked and has an Earth-like composition and atmosphere. We find that
the planet can maintain a moderate surface temperature if the insolation proves to be smaller than
$\sim 1.5$ times that of the Earth. Doppler mass measurements, transit spectroscopy, and other
follow-up observations should be rewarding, since EPIC 210897587 is one of the optically brightest
M dwarfs known to harbor transiting planets.
