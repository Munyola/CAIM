Interaction of the solar wind with interstellar matter involves, among other, charge exchange
between interstellar neutral atoms and plasma, which results in the creation of secondary population
of interstellar neutral (ISN) atoms. The secondary population of interstellar He was detected
by Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX), but interpretation of these measurements was mostly
based on an approximation that the primary interstellar neutral population and the secondary population
were non-interacting homogeneous Maxwell-Boltzmann functions in the outer heliosheath. We simulate
the distribution function in the outer heliosheath and inside the heliopause using method of characteristics
with statistical weights obtained from solutions of the production and loss equations for the secondary
atoms due to charge-exchange collisions in the outer heliosheath. We show that the two-Maxwellian
approximation for the distribution function of neutral He is not a good approximation within the
outer heliosheath but a reasonable one inside the termination shock. This is due to a strong selection
effect: the He atoms able to penetrate inside the termination shock are a small, peculiar subset
of the entire secondary He population. Nevertheless, the two-Maxwellian approximation reproduces
the density distribution of ISN He inside the termination shock well and enables a realistic reproduction
of the orientation of the plane defined by the Sun's velocity vector through the local interstellar
matter and the vector of unperturbed interstellar magnetic field.
