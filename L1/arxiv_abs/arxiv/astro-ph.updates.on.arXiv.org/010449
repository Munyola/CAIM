The Pan-Andromeda Archaeological Survey is a survey of $>400$ square degrees centered on the Andromeda
(M31) and Triangulum (M33) galaxies that has provided the most extensive panorama of a $L_\star$
galaxy group to large projected galactocentric radii. Here, we collate and summarise the current
status of our knowledge of the substructures in the stellar halo of M31, and discuss connections
between these features. We estimate that the 13 most distinctive substructures were produced by
at least 5 different accretion events, all in the last 3 or 4 Gyrs. We suggest that a few of the substructures
furthest from M31 may be shells from a single accretion event. We calculate the luminosities of some
prominent substructures for which previous estimates were not available, and we estimate the stellar
mass budget of the outer halo of M31. We revisit the problem of quantifying the properties of a highly
structured dataset; specifically, we use the OPTICS clustering algorithm to quantify the hierarchical
structure of M31's stellar halo, and identify three new faint structures. M31's halo, in projection,
appears to be dominated by two `mega-structures', that can be considered as the two most significant
branches of a merger tree produced by breaking M31's stellar halo into smaller and smaller structures
based on the stellar spatial clustering. We conclude that OPTICS is a powerful algorithm that could
be used in any astronomical application involving the hierarchical clustering of points. The publication
of this article coincides with the public release of all PAndAS data products.
