The idea of the magnetorotational explosion mechanism is that the energy of rotation of the neutron
star formed in the course of a collapse is transformed into the energy of an expanding shock wave by
means of a magnetic field. In the two-dimensional case, the time of this transformation depends
weakly on the initial strength of the poloidal magnetic field because of the development of a magnetorotational
instability. Differential rotation leads to the twisting and growth of the toroidal magnetic-field
component, which becomes much stronger than the poloidal component. In the case where the initial
configuration of the magnetic field is close to a dipole configuration, the ejection of matter has
a jet character, whereas, in the case of a quadrupole configuration, there arises an equatorial
ejection. In either case, the energy release is sufficient for explaining the observed average
energy of supernova explosion. Neutrinos are emitted as the collapse and the formation of a rapidly
rotating neutron star proceeds. In addition, neutrino radiation arises in the process of magnetorotational
explosion owing to additional rotational-energy losses. In order to explain an interval of 4.5
hours between the two observed neutrino signals from SN 1987A, it is necessary to assume a weakening
of the magnetorotional instability and a small initial magnetic field (10(9)-10(10)G) in the newly
formed rotating neutron star. The existence of a black hole in the SN 1987A remnant could explain
the absence of any visible pointlike source at the center of the explosion.
