Stellar coronal mass ejections remain experimentally unconstrained, unlike their stellar flare
counterparts which are observed ubiquitously across the electromagnetic spectrum. Low frequency
radio bursts in the form of a type II burst offer the best means of identifying and constraining the
rate and properties of stellar CMEs. CME properties can be further improved through the use of proposed
solar-stellar scaling relations and multi-wavelength observations of CMEs through the use of
type II bursts and the associated flare expected to occur occur alongside. We report on 20 hours of
observation of the nearby, magnetically active, and well characterized M dwarf star EQ Peg. The
observations are simultaneously observed with the Jansky Very Large Array at their P-band (230-470
MHz) and at the Apache Point observatory in the SDSS u' filter ($\lambda$ = 3557 \AA). Dynamic spectra
of the P band data, constructed to search for signals in the frequency-time domains, did not reveal
evidence for drifting radio bursts that could be ascribed to type II bursts. Given the sensitivity
of our observations, we are able to place limits on the brightness temperature and source size of
any bursts which may have occurred. Using solar scaling rations on four observed stellar flares,
we predict CME parameters. Given the constraints on coronal density and photospheric field strength,
our models suggest that the observed flares would have been insufficient to produce detectable
type II bursts at our observed frequencies. We consider the implications of these results, and other
recent findings, on stellar mass loss.
