We present time resolved spectral analysis of prompt emission from GRB 160625B, one of the brightest
bursts ever detected by Fermi in its nine years of operations. Standard empirical functions fail
to provide an acceptable fit to the GBM spectral data, which instead require the addition of a low-energy
break to the fitting function. We introduce a new fitting function, called 2SBPL, consisting of
three smoothly connected power laws. Fitting this model to the data, the goodness of the fits significantly
improves and the spectral parameters are well constrained. We also test a spectral model that combines
non-thermal and thermal (black body) components, but find that the 2SBPL model is systematically
favoured. The spectral evolution shows that the spectral break is located around $E_{\rm break}\sim$
100 keV, while the usual $\nu F_{\nu}$ peak energy feature $E_{\rm peak}$ evolves in the 0.5-6 MeV
energy range. The slopes below and above $E_{\rm break}$ are consistent with the values -0.67 and
-1.5, respectively, expected from synchrotron emission produced by a relativistic electron population
with a low energy cut-off. If $E_{\rm break}$ is interpreted as the synchrotron cooling frequency,
the implied magnetic field in the emitting region is $\sim$ 10 Gauss, i.e. orders of magnitudes smaller
than the value expected for a dissipation region located at $\sim 10^{13-14}$ cm from the central
engine. The low ratio between $E_{\rm peak}$ and $E_{\rm break}$ implies that the radiative cooling
is incomplete, contrary to what is expected in strongly magnetized and compact emitting regions.
