Here we present a detailed analysis of the properties and evolution of different dwarf galaxies,
candidate to host the coalescence of black hole binary systems (BHB) generating GW150914-like
events. By adopting a novel theoretical framework coupling the binary population synthesis code
\texttt{SeBa} with the Galaxy formation model \texttt{GAMESH}, we can investigate the detailed
evolution of these objects in a well resolved cosmological volume of 4~cMpc, having a Milky Way-like
(MW) galaxy forming at its center. We identify three classes of interesting candidate galaxies:
MW progenitors, dwarf satellites and dwarf galaxies evolving in isolation. We find that: (i) despite
differences in individual histories and specific environments the candidates reduce to only nine
representative galaxies; (ii) among them, $\sim44\%$ merges into the MW halo progenitors by the
redshift of the expected signal, while the remaining dwarfs are found as isolated or as satellites
of the MW and their evolution is strongly shaped by both peculiar dynamical history and environmental
feedback; (iii) a stringent condition for the environments where GW150914-like binaries can form
comes from a combination of the accretion history of their DM halos and the radiative feedback in
the high redshift universe; (iv) by comparing with the observed catalogues from DGS and ALLSMOG
surveys we find two observed dwarfs respecting the properties predicted by our model. We finally
note how the present analysis opens the possibility to build future strategies for host galaxy identification.
