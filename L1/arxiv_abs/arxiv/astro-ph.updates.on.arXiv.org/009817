We present a sub-arcsecond cross-match of Gaia DR2 against the INT Photometric H-alpha Survey of
the Northern Galactic Plane Data Release 2 (IPHAS DR2) and the Kepler-INT Survey (KIS). The resulting
value-added catalogues (VACs) provide additional precise photometry to the Gaia photometry (r,
i and H-alpha for IPHAS, with additional U and g for KIS). In building the catalogue, proper motions
given in \gaia\ DR2 are wound back to match the epochs of IPHAS DR2, thus ensuring high proper motion
objects are appropriately cross-matched. The catalogues contain 7,927,224 and 791,071 sources
for IPHAS and KIS, respectively. The requirement of >5-sigma parallax detection for every included
source means that distances out to 1--1.5 kpc are well covered. We define two additional parameters
for each catalogued object: (i) $f_c$, a magnitude-dependent tracer of the quality of the Gaia astrometric
fit; (ii) $f_{FP}$, the false-positive rate for parallax measurements determined from astrometric
fits of a given quality at a given magnitude. Selection cuts based on these parameters can be used
to clean colour-magnitude and colour-colour diagrams in a controlled and justified manner. We
provide both full and light versions of the VAC, with VAC-light containing only objects that represent
our recommended trade-off between purity and completeness. Uses of the catalogues include the
identification of new variable stars in the matched data sets, and more complete identification
of H-alpha-excess emission objects thanks to separation of high-luminosity stars from the main
sequence.
