We develop a method for membership assignment in stellar clusters using only photometry and positions.
The method, UPMASK, is aimed to be unsupervised, data driven, model free, and to rely on as few assumptions
as possible. It is based on an iterative process, principal component analysis, clustering algorithm,
and kernel density estimations. Moreover, it is able to take into account arbitrary error models.
An implementation in R was tested on simulated clusters that covered a broad range of ages, masses,
distances, reddenings, and also on real data of cluster fields. Running UPMASK on simulations showed
that it effectively separates cluster and field populations. The overall spatial structure and
distribution of cluster member stars in the colour-magnitude diagram were recovered under a broad
variety of conditions. For a set of 360 simulations, the resulting true positive rates (a measurement
of purity) and member recovery rates (a measurement of completeness) at the 90% membership probability
level reached high values for a range of open cluster ages ($10^{7.1}-10^{9.5}$ yr), initial masses
($0.5-10\times10^3$M$_{\sun}$) and heliocentric distances ($0.5-4.0$ kpc). UPMASK was also
tested on real data from the fields of the open cluster Haffner~16 and of the closely projected clusters
Haffner~10 and Czernik~29. These tests showed that even for moderate variable extinction and cluster
superposition, the method yielded useful cluster membership probabilities and provided some
insight into their stellar contents. The UPMASK implementation will be available at the CRAN archive.
