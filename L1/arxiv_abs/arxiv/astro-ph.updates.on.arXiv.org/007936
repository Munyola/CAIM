Image slicing is a powerful technique in astronomy. It allows the instrument designer to reduce
the slit width of the spectrograph, increasing spectral resolving power whilst retaining throughput.
Conventionally this is done using bulk optics, such as mirrors and prisms, however more recently
astrophotonic components known as photonic lanterns (PLs) and photonic reformatters have also
been used. These devices reformat the multi-mode (MM) input light from a telescope into single-mode
(SM) outputs, which can then be re-arranged to suit the spectrograph. The photonic dicer (PD) is
one such device, designed to reduce the dependence of spectrograph size on telescope aperture and
eliminate modal noise. We simulate the PD, by optimising the throughput and geometrical design
using Soapy and BeamProp. The simulated device shows a transmission between 8 and 20 %, depending
upon the type of adaptive optics (AO) correction applied, matching the experimental results well.
We also investigate our idealised model of the PD and show that the barycentre of the slit varies only
slightly with time, meaning that the modal noise contribution is very low when compared to conventional
fibre systems. We further optimise our model device for both higher throughput and reduced modal
noise. This device improves throughput by 6.4 % and reduces the movement of the slit output by 50%,
further improving stability. This shows the importance of properly simulating such devices, including
atmospheric effects. Our work complements recent work in the field and is essential for optimising
future photonic reformatters.
