Time series analysis allows for the determination of the Power Spectral Density (PSD) and Probability
Density Function (PDF) for astrophysical sources. The former of these illustrates the distribution
of power at various timescales, typically taking a power-law form, while the latter characterises
the distribution of the underlying stochastic physical processes, with Gaussian and lognormal
functional forms both physically motivated. In this paper, we use artificial time series generated
using the prescription of Timmer & Koenig to investigate connections between the PDF and PSD. PDFs
calculated for these artificial light curves are less likely to be well described by a Gaussian functional
form for steep (<-1) PSD spectral indices due to weak non-stationarity. Using the Fermi LAT monthly
light curve of the blazar PKS2155-304 as an example, we prescribe and calculate a false positive
rate which indicates how likely the PDF is to be attributed an incorrect functional form. Here, we
generate large numbers of artificial light curves with intrinsically normally distributed PDFs
and with statistical properties consistent with observations. These are used to evaluate the probabilities
that either Gaussian or lognormal functional forms better describe the PDF. We use this prescription
to show that PKS2155-304 requires a high prior probability of having a normally distributed PDF,
P(G) >= 0.82, for the calculated PDF to prefer a Gaussian functional form over a lognormal. We present
possible choices of prior and evaluate the probability that PKS2155-304 has a lognormally distributed
PDF for each.
