Magnetic field data provided by the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager on board the Solar Dynamics
Observatory were utilized to explore the changes in the magnetic energy of four active regions (ARs)
during their emergence. We found that at the very early stage of the magnetic flux emergence, an abrupt
steepening of the magnetic power spectrum takes place leading to rapid increase of the absolute
value of the negative spectra power index $\alpha$ in $E(k)$ $\sim$ $k^{\alpha}$. As the emergence
proceeds, the energy increases at all scales simultaneously implying that elements of all sizes
do appear in the photosphere. Meanwhile, the energy gain at scales larger than $\approx$10 Mm prevails
as compared to that at smaller scales. Both direct (i.e., fragmentation of large structures into
smaller ones) and inverse (i.e., merging of small magnetic features into larger elements) cascades
are readily observed during the emergence. However, in the case of inverse cascade, the total energy
gained at large scales exceeds the energy loss at smaller scales assuming simultaneous appearance
of large-scale magnetic entities from beneath the photosphere. We conclude that most of the time
the energy may grow at all scales. We also cannot support the point of view regarding the dominant
role of the inverse cascade in the formation of an AR. Although the coalescence of small magnetic
elements into larger pores and sunspots is observed, our analysis shows that the prevailed energy
contribution to an AR comes from emergence of large-scale structures.
