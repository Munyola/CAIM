We examine whether various characteristics of planet-driven spiral arms can be used to constrain
the masses of unseen planets and their positions within their disks. By carrying out two-dimensional
hydrodynamic simulations varying planet mass and disk gas temperature, we find that a larger number
of spiral arms form with a smaller planet mass and a lower disk temperature. A planet excites two or
more spiral arms interior to its orbit for a range of disk temperature characterized by the disk aspect
ratio $0.04\leq(h/r)_p\leq0.15$, whereas exterior to a planet's orbit multiple spiral arms can
form only in cold disks with $(h/r)_p \lesssim 0.06$. Constraining the planet mass with the pitch
angle of spiral arms requires accurate disk temperature measurements that might be challenging
even with ALMA. However, the property that the pitch angle of planet-driven spiral arms decreases
away from the planet can be a powerful diagnostic to determine whether the planet is located interior
or exterior to the observed spirals. The arm-to-arm separations increase as a function of planet
mass, consistent with previous studies; however, the exact slope depends on disk temperature as
well as the radial location where the arm-to-arm separations are measured. We apply these diagnostics
to the spiral arms seen in MWC 758 and Elias 2-27. As shown in Bae et al. (2017), planet-driven spiral
arms can create concentric rings and gaps, which can produce more dominant observable signature
than spiral arms under certain circumstances. We discuss the observability of planet-driven spiral
arms versus rings and gaps.
