The carbon star V Hydrae (V Hya) provides new insight into the nature of the launching mechanism of
jet-like outflows that are believed to be the cause of the poorly understood transition phase of
AGB stars into aspherical planetary nebulae. V Hya has been shown to periodically eject collimated
gas blobs at high velocities ("bullets"). By analyzing data from HST/STIS 2-D spectra, obtained
at six epochs spaced over a decade that show 4 successively ejected bullets with a spacing of ~8.5
years, we have created kinematic models of the dynamical evolution of a specific bullet (#1) for
the first three observed epochs (2002, 2003, 2004) using a 3D spatio-kinematic code, SHAPE. Using
these models, we fit the observed morphology, line-of-sight velocity, proper motion and intensity
for the extended, gaseous bullet as a function of time over a period of 2 years, in order to constrain
its 3D movement and the evolution of its physical properties over this period. Our results suggest
that although bullet #1's motion is predominantly ballistic, there are small but significant changes
in the position angle and inclination angle of the long (symmetry) axis of the bullet that tilt it
progressively towards the symmetry axis of the bipolar molecular nebula around V Hya. In contrast,
bullet #3 shows strong acceleration soon after ejection. We discuss the possibilities that bullet
acceleration is caused by either a non-radial magnetic field and/or by hydrodynamic interaction
with the ambient gas through which the bullet is traveling.
