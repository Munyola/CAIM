The interior structure of an exoplanet is hidden from direct view yet likely plays a crucial role
in influencing the habitability of the Earth analogues. Inferences of the interior structure are
impeded by a fundamental degeneracy that exists between any model comprising more than two layers
and observations constraining just two bulk parameters: mass and radius. In this work, we show that
although the inverse problem is indeed degenerate, there exists two boundary conditions that enables
one to infer the minimum and maximum core radius fraction, CRFmin and CRFmax. These hold true even
for planets with light volatile envelopes, but require the planet to be fully differentiated and
that layers denser than iron are forbidden. With both bounds in hand, a marginal CRF can also be inferred
by sampling in-between. After validating on the Earth, we apply our method to Kepler-36b and measure
CRFmin = (0.50 +/- 0.07), CRFmax = (0.78 +/- 0.02), and CRFmarg = (0.64 +/- 0.11), broadly consistent
with the Earth's true CRF value of 0.55. We apply our method to a suite of hypothetical measurements
of synthetic planets to serve as a sensitivity analysis. We find that CRFmin and CRFmax have recovered
uncertainties proportional to the relative error on the planetary density, but CRFmarg saturates
to between 0.03 and 0.16 once delta rho/rho drops below 1-2 per cent. This implies that mass and radius
alone cannot provide any better constraints on internal composition once bulk density constraints
hit around a per cent, providing a clear target for observers.
