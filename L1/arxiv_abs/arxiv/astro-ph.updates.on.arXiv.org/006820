We present weak lensing (WL) mass constraints for a sample of massive galaxy clusters detected by
the South Pole Telescope (SPT) via the Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect (SZE). We use $griz$ imaging data
obtained from the Science Verification (SV) phase of the Dark Energy Survey (DES) to fit the WL shear
signal of 33 clusters in the redshift range $0.25 \le z \le 0.8$ with NFW profiles and to constrain
a four-parameter SPT mass-observable relation. To account for biases in WL masses, we introduce
a WL mass to true mass scaling relation described by a mean bias and an intrinsic, log-normal scatter.
We allow for correlated scatter within the WL and SZE mass-observable relations and use simulations
to calibrate priors on nuisance parameters related to bias and scatter from WL. We constrain the
normalization of the $\zeta-M_{500}$ relation, $A_\mathrm{SZ}=12.0_{-6.7}^{+2.6}$ when using
a prior on the mass slope $B_\mathrm{SZ}$ from the latest SPT cluster cosmology analysis. Without
this prior, we recover $A_\mathrm{SZ}=10.8_{-5.2}^{+2.3}$ and $B_\mathrm{SZ}=1.30_{-0.44}^{+0.22}$.
Results in both cases imply lower cluster masses than measured in previous work with and without
WL, although the uncertainties are large. The WL derived value of $B_\mathrm{SZ}$ is $\approx 20\%$
lower than the value preferred by the most recent SPT cluster cosmology analysis. The method demonstrated
in this work is designed to constrain cluster masses and cosmological parameters simultaneously
and will be used for subsequent studies that employ the full SPT cluster sample together with the
DES data.
