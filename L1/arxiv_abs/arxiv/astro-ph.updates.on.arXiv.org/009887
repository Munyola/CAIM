Recent observational studies of X-shaped structures revealed that values of their opening angles
lie in a narrow range: from 20 deg to 43 deg with smaller X-shaped structures appearing to follow a
characteristic opening angle ~ 27 deg - 31 deg. We use self-consistent numerical simulations to
uncover what parameters of host galaxies govern the opening angle spread. We constructed a series
of equilibrium models of galaxies with high spatial resolution, varying the dark halo and bulge
contribution in the overall gravitational potential, the initial disc thickness of models and
the Toomre parameter Q and followed their evolution for almost 8 Gyrs. Each model demonstrated the
formation of clear X-structures with different flatness. We have obtained that opening angles
lie in the range from 25 deg to 42 deg throughout the entire evolution. These values are roughly consistent
with observational data. The greatest variation in the opening angles is obtained by varying the
mass of the dark halo. The initial thickness of the disc and the Toomre parameter are responsible
for smaller variations of the angle and shorter X-structures. An increase of both parameters changes
the morphology of in-plane bars and X-structures. In some cases we observed even double X-structures.
The main effect of the bulge is to prevent buckling at intermediate and late stages of the disc evolution.
Comparison of models with different halo masses indicates that the smallest observable values
of opening angles can be associated with the presence of a heavy dark halo (more than 3 masses of the
disc within the optical radius).
