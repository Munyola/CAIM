We investigate the physics that drives the gas accretion rates onto galaxies at the centers of dark
matter haloes using the EAGLE suite of hydrodynamical cosmological simulations. We find that at
redshifts $z{\le}2$ the accretion rate onto the galaxy increases with halo mass in the halo mass
range $10^{10}-10^{11.7}M_{\odot}$, flattens between the halo masses $10^{11.7}-10^{12.7}M_{\odot}$,
and increases again for higher-mass haloes. However, the galaxy gas accretion does not flatten
at intermediate halo masses when AGN feedback is switched off. To better understand these trends,
we develop a physically motivated semi-analytic model of galaxy gas accretion. We show that the
flattening is produced by the rate of gas cooling from the hot halo. The ratio of the cooling radius
and the virial radius does not decrease continuously with increasing halo mass as generally thought.
While it decreases up to ${\sim}10^{13}M_{\odot}$ haloes, it increases for higher halo masses,
causing an upturn in the galaxy gas accretion rate. This may indicate that in high-mass haloes AGN
feedback is not sufficiently efficient. When there is no AGN feedback, the density of the hot halo
is higher, the ratio of the cooling and virial radii does not decrease as much and the cooling rate
is higher. Changes in the efficiency of stellar feedback can also increase or decrease the accretion
rates onto galaxies. The trends can plausibly be explained by the re-accretion of gas ejected by
progenitor galaxies and by the suppression of black hole growth, and hence AGN feedback, by stellar
feedback.
