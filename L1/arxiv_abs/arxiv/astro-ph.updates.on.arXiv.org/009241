We present HST/ACS imaging of twenty-three very low surface brightness ($\mu_{e,V}$=25-27.5)
galaxies detected in the fields of four nearby galaxy groups. These objects were selected from deep
optical imaging obtained with the Dragonfly Telephoto Array. Seven are new discoveries, while
most of the others had been identified previously in visual surveys of deep photographic plates
and more recent surveys. Few have previously been studied in detail. From the ACS images, we measure
distances to the galaxies using both the tip of the red giant branch method and the surface brightness
fluctuations method. We demonstrate that the two methods are consistent with each other in the regime
where both can be applied. The distances to 15 out of 20 galaxies with stable measurements are consistent
with that of the targeted group within errors. This suggests that assuming group membership based
solely on projected proximity is ~75% successful in this regime. The galaxies are nearly round,
with a median axis ratio of 0.85, and visually resemble dwarf spheroidal galaxies. The objects have
a range of sizes, from $R_e$=0.4 kpc to $R_e$=1.8 kpc, with a median of 1.0 kpc. They range in luminosity
from $M_V$=-11.4 to $M_V$=-15.6, with a median of -12.4. Galaxies with $R_e$~1 kpc and $M_V$~-12
are fairly rare in the Local Group but we find many of them in this relatively small sample. Four of
the objects fall in the class of ultra diffuse galaxies (UDGs), with $R_e$>1.5 kpc and $\mu_{0,V}$>24
mag/arcsec^2, including the recently identified dark matter deficient galaxy NGC1052-DF2.
