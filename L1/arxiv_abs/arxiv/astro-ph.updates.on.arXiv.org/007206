We present broadband X-ray analyses of a sample of bright ultraluminous X-ray sources with the goal
of investigating the spectral similarity of this population to the known ULX pulsars, M82 X-2, NGC7793
P13 and NGC5907 ULX. We perform a phase-resolved analysis of the broadband XMM-Newton+NuSTAR dataset
of NGC5907 ULX, finding that the pulsed emission from the accretion column in this source exhibits
a similar spectral shape to that seen in both M82 X-2 and NGC7793 P13, and that this is responsible
for the excess emission observed at the highest energies when the spectra are fit with accretion
disk models. We then demonstrate that similar 'hard' excesses are seen in all the ULXs in the broadband
sample. Finally, for the ULXs where the nature of the accretor is currently unknown, we test whether
the hard excesses are all consistent with being produced by an accretion column similar to those
present in M82 X-2, NGC7793 P13 and NGC5907 ULX. Based on the average shape of the pulsed emission,
we find that in all cases a similar accretion column can successfully reproduce the observed data,
consistent with the hypothesis that this ULX sample may be dominated by neutron star accretors.
Compared to the known pulsar ULXs, our spectral fits for the remaining ULXs suggest that the non-pulsed
emission from the accretion flow beyond the magnetosphere makes a stronger relative contribution
than the component associated with the accretion column. If these sources do also contain neutron
star accretors, this may help to explain the lack of detected pulsations.
