We revisit the hypothesis that dense galactic nuclei are formed from inspiraling globular clusters.
Recent advances in understanding of the continuous formation of globular clusters over cosmic
time and the concurrent evolution of the galaxy stellar distribution allow us to construct a simple
model that matches the observed spatial and mass distributions of clusters in the Galaxy and the
giant elliptical galaxy M87. In order to compare with observations, we model the effects of dynamical
friction and dynamical evolution, including stellar mass loss, tidal stripping of stars, and tidal
disruption of clusters by the growing galactic nucleus. We find that inspiraling globular clusters
form a dense central structure, with mass and radius comparable to the typical values in observed
nuclear star clusters (NSCs) in late-type and low-mass early-type galaxies. The density contrast
associated with the NSC is less pronounced in giant elliptical galaxies. Our results indicate that
the NSC mass as a fraction of mass of the galaxy stellar spheroid scales as M_NSC/M_* = 0.0025 M_{*,11}^{-0.5}.
Thus disrupted globular clusters could contribute most of the mass of NSCs in galaxies with stellar
mass below 10^{11} Msun. The inner part of the accumulated cluster may seed the growth of a central
black hole via stellar dynamical core collapse, thereby relieving the problem of how to form luminous
quasars at high redshift. The seed black hole may reach about 10^5 Msun within 1 Gyr of the beginning
of globular cluster formation.
