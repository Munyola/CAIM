We use 3D hydrodynamic simulations of the long-term evolution of neutron star merger ejecta to predict
the light curves of electromagnetic transients that are powered by the decay of freshly produced
r-process nuclei. For the dynamic ejecta that are launched by tidal and hydrodynamic interaction,
we adopt grey opacities of 10 cm$^2$/g, as suggested by recent studies. For our reference case of
a 1.3-1.4 $M_\odot$ merger, we find a broad IR peak 2-4 d after the merger. The peak luminosity is $\approx
2\times 10^{40}$ erg/s for an average orientation, but increased by up to a factor of 4 for more favourable
binary parameters and viewing angles. These signals are rather weak and hardly detectable within
the large error box (~100 deg$^2$) of a gravitational wave trigger. A second electromagnetic transient
results from neutrino-driven winds. These winds produce `weak' r-process material with $50 <
A < 130$ and abundance patterns that vary substantially between different merger cases. For
an adopted opacity of 1 cm$^2$/g, the resulting transients peak in the UV/optical about 6 h after
the merger with a luminosity of $\approx 10^{41}$ erg/s (for a wind of 0.01 $M_\odot$) These signals
are marginally detectable in deep follow-up searches (e.g. using Hypersuprime camera on Subaru).
A subsequent detection of the weaker but longer lasting IR signal would allow an identification
of the merger event. We briefly discuss the implications of our results to the recent detection of
an nIR transient accompanying GRB 130603B.
