We model dust formation in the core collapse supernova explosion SN 1987A by treating the gas-phase
formation of dust grain nuclei as a chemical process. To compute the synthesis of fourteen species
of grains we integrate a non-equilibrium network of nucleating and related chemical reactions
and follow the growth of the nuclei into grains via accretion and coagulation. The effects of the
radioactive cobalt, titanium, and sodium on the thermodynamics and chemistry of the ejecta are
taken into account. The grain temperature, which we allow to differ from the gas temperature, affects
the surface-tension-corrected evaporation rate. We also account for He$^+$, Ne$^+$, Ar$^+$,
and O weathering. We combine our dust synthesis model with a crude prescription for anisotropic
radioactive nickel dredge-up into the core ejecta, the so-called `nickel bubbles', to compute
the total dust mass and molecular-species-specific grain size distribution. The total mass varies
between $0.41\,M_\odot$ and $0.73\,M_\odot$, depending on the bubble shell density contrast.
In the decreasing order of abundance, the grain species produced are: magnesia, silicon, forsterite,
iron sulfide, carbon, silicon dioxide, alumina, and iron. The combined grain size distribution
is a power law $dN/da\propto a^{-4.39}$. Early ejecta compaction by expanding radioactive nickel
bubbles strongly enhances dust synthesis. This underscores the need for improved understanding
of hydrodynamic transport and mixing over the entire pre-homologous expansion.
