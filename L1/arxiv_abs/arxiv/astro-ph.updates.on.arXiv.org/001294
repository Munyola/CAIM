During the last decade, imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes (IACTs) have proven themselves
as astronomical detectors in the very-high-energy (VHE; E>0.1 TeV) regime. The IACT technique
observes the VHE photons indirectly, using the Earth's atmosphere as a calorimeter. Much of the
calibration of Cherenkov telescope experiments is done using Monte Carlo simulations of the air
shower development, Cherenkov radiation and detector, assuming certain models for the atmospheric
conditions. Any deviation of the real conditions during observations from the assumed atmospheric
model will result in a wrong reconstruction of the primary gamma-ray energy and the resulting source
spectra. During eight years of observations, the High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.) has
experienced periodic natural as well as anthropogenic variations of the atmospheric transparency
due to aerosols created by biomass burning. In order to identify data that have been taken under such
long-term reductions in atmospheric transparency, a new monitoring quantity, the Cherenkov transparency
coefficient, has been developed and will be presented here. This quantity is independent of hardware
changes in the detector and, therefore, isolates atmospheric factors that can impact the performance
of the instrument, and in particular the spectral results. Its positive correlation with independent
measurements of the atmospheric optical depth (AOD) retrieved from data of the Multi-angle Imaging
SpectroRadiometer (MISR) on board of the Terra NASA's satellite is also presented here.
