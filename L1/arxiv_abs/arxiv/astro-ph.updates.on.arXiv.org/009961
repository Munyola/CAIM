Thanks to long-term X-ray monitoring, a number of interacting binaries are now known to show X-ray
periodicities on timescales of tens to hundreds of binary orbits. In some systems, precession of
a warped accretion disc is the leading model to explain the superorbital modulation. The High Mass
X-ray Binary SMC X-1 showed two excursions in superorbital period (from ~60d to ~45d) during the
1996-2011 interval, suggesting that some characteristic of the accretion disc is varying on a timescale
of years. Because its behaviour as an X-ray pulsar has also been intensively monitored, SMC X-1 offers
the rare chance to track changes in both the accretion disk and pulsar behaviours over the same interval.
We have used archival X-ray observations of SMC X-1 to investigate whether the evolution of its superorbital
variation and pulse period are correlated. We use the 16-year dataset afforded by the RXTE~All-Sky
Monitor to trace the behaviour of the warped accretion disc in this system, and use published pulse-period
histories to trace the behaviour of the pulsar. While we cannot claim a strong detection of correlation,
the first superorbital period excursion near MJD 50,800 does coincide with structure in SMC X-1's
pulse period history. Our preferred interpretation is that the superorbital period excursion
coincides with a change in the long-term spin-up rate of the SMC X-1 pulsar. In this scenario, the
pulsar and the accretion disc are both responding to a change in the accretion flow, which the disc
itself may regulate.
