An isolated star moving supersonically through a uniform gas accretes material from its gravitationally-induced
wake. The rate of accretion is set by the accretion radius of the star and is well-described by classical
Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton theory. Stars, however, are not born in isolation. They form in clusters
where they accrete material that is influenced by all the stars in the cluster. We perform three-dimensional
hydrodynamic simulations of clusters of individual accretors embedded in a uniform-density wind
in order to study how the accretion rates experienced by individual cluster members are altered
by the properties of the ambient gas and the cluster itself. We study accretion as a function of number
of cluster members, mean separation between them, and size of their individual accretion radii.
We determine the effect of these key parameters on the aggregate and individual accretion rates,
which we compare to analytic predictions. We show that when the accretion radii of the individual
objects in the cluster substantially overlap, the surrounding gas is effectively accreted into
the collective potential of the cluster prior to being accreted onto the individual stars. We find
that individual cluster members can accrete drastically more than they would in isolation, in particular
when the flow is able to cool efficiently. This effect could potentially modify the luminosity of
accreting compact objects in star clusters and could lead to the rejuvenation of young star clusters
as well as globular clusters with low-inclination and low-eccentricity.
