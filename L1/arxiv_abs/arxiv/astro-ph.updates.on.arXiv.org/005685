Supergiant X-ray Binaries (SgXB) host a compact object, often a neutron star (NS), orbiting an evolved
O/B star. Mass transfer proceeds through the intense line-driven wind of the stellar donor, a fraction
of which is captured by the gravitational field of the NS. The subsequent accretion process onto
the NS is responsible for the abundant X-ray emission from SgXB. They also display peak-to-peak
variability of the X-ray flux by a factor of a few 10 to 100, along with changes in the hardness ratios
possibly due to varying absorption along the line-of-sight. We use recent radiation-hydrodynamic
simulations of inhomogeneities (aka clumps) in the non-stationary wind of massive hot stars to
evaluate their impact on the time-variable accretion process. For this, we run 3D hydrodynamic
simulations of the wind in the vicinity of the accretor to investigate the formation of the bow shock
and follow the inhomogeneous flow over several spatial orders of magnitude, down to the NS magnetosphere.
In particular, we show that the impact of the wind clumps on the time-variability of the intrinsic
mass accretion rate is severely tempered by the crossing of the shock, compared to the purely ballistic
Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton estimation. We also account for the variable absorption due to clumps passing
by the line-of-sight and estimate the final effective variability of the column density and mass
accretion rate for different orbital separations. Finally, we compare our results to the most recent
analysis of the X-ray flux and the hardness ratio in Vela X-1.
