The origin of the heavily fractionated reservoir of nitrogen in comets remains an issue in the theory
of their formation and hence of the solar system. Whether the fractionated reservoir traced by comets
is inherited from the interstellar cloud or is the product of processes taking place in the protostar,
or in the protoplanetary disk, remains unclear. So far, observations of nitrogen isotopic ratios
in protostars or prestellar cores have not securely identified such a fractionated reservoir owing
to the intrinsic difficulty of direct isotopic ratios measurements. In this article, we report
the detection of 5 rotational lines of \ce{HC3N}, {including the weaker components of the hyperfine
multiplets}, and two rotational lines of its $^{15}$N isotopologue, towards the L1544 prestellar
core. Based on a MCMC/non-LTE multi-line analysis at the hyperfine level, we derive the column densities
of \ce{HC3N} ($8.0\pm0.4\tdix{13}$\cc) and \ce{HC3^{15}N} ($2.0\pm0.4\tdix{11}$\cc) and
derive an isotopic ratio of 400$\pm$20(1$\sigma$). This value suggests that \ce{HC3N} is slightly
depleted in $^{15}$N in L1544 with respect to the elemental $^{14}$N/$^{15}$N ratio {of $\approx$330}
in the present-day local interstellar medium. Our study also stresses the need for radiative calculations
at the hyperfine level. Finally, the comparison of the derived ratio with those obtained in CN and
HCN in the same core seems to favor CN+C$_2$H$_2$ as the dominant formation route to HC$_3$N. However,
uncertainties in the isotopic ratios preclude definitive conclusions.
