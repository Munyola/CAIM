Burst oscillations are brightness asymmetries that develop in the burning ocean during thermonuclear
bursts on accreting neutron stars. They have been observed during H/He-triggered (Type I) bursts
and Carbon-triggered superbursts. The mechanism responsible is not unknown, but the dominant
burst oscillation frequency is typically within a few Hz of the spin frequency, where this is independently
known. One of the best-studied burst oscillation sources, 4U 1636-536, has oscillations at $581\,\text{Hz}$
in both its regular Type I bursts and in one superburst. Recently however, Strohmayer \& Mahmoodifar
reported the discovery of an additional signal at a higher frequency, $835\,\text{Hz}$, during
the superburst. This higher frequency is consistent with the predictions for several types of global
ocean mode, one of the possible burst oscillation mechanisms. If this is the case then the same physical
mechanism may operate in the normal Type I bursts of this source. In this paper we report a stacked
search for periodic signals in the regular Type I bursts: we found no significant signal at the higher
frequency, with upper limits for the single trial root mean square (rms) fractional amplitude of
0.57(6)\%. Our analysis did however reveal that the dominant $581\,\text{Hz}$ burst oscillation
signal is present at a weak level even in the sample of bursts where it cannot be detected in individual
bursts. This indicates that any cutoff in the burst oscillation mechanism occurs below the detection
threshold of existing X-ray telescopes.
