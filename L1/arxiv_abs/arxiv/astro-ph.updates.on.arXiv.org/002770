During the structure formation, charged and neutral chemical species may have separated from each
other at the gravitational contraction in primordial magnetic field (PMF). A gradient in the PMF
in a direction perpendicular to the field direction leads to the Lorentz force on the charged species.
Resultantly, an ambipolar diffusion occurs, and charged species can move differently from neutral
species, which collapses gravitationally during the structure formation. We assume a gravitational
contraction of neutral matter in a spherically symmetric structure, and calculate fluid motions
of charged and neutral species. It is shown that the charged fluid, i.e., proton, electron and $^7$Li$^+$,
can significantly decouple from the neutral fluid depending on the field amplitude. The charged
species can, therefore, escape from the gravitational collapse. We take the structure mass, the
epoch of the gravitational collapse, and the comoving Lorenz force as parameters. We then identify
a parameter region for an effective chemical separation. This type of chemical separation can reduce
the abundance ratio of Li/H in early structures because of inefficient contraction of $^7$Li$^+$
ion. Therefore, it may explain Li abundances of Galactic metal-poor stars which are smaller than
the prediction in standard big bang nucleosynthesis model. Amplitudes of the PMFs are controlled
by a magneto-hydrodynamic turbulence. The upper limit on the field amplitude derived from the turbulence
effect is close to the value required for the chemical separation.
