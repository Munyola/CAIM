We follow up on the Sterling et al (2015) discovery that nearly all polar coronal X-ray jets are made
by an explosive eruption of closed magnetic field carrying a miniature filament in its core. In the
same X-ray and EUV movies used by Sterling et al (2015), we examine the onset and growth of the driving
magnetic explosion in 15 of the 20 jets that they studied. We find evidence that: (1) in a large majority
of polar X-ray jets, the runaway internal/tether-cutting reconnection under the erupting minifilament
flux rope starts after both the minifilaments rise and the spire-producing external/breakout
reconnection have started and (2) in a large minority, (a) before the eruption starts there is a current
sheet between the explosive closed field and the ambient open field, and (b) the eruption starts
with breakout reconnection at that current sheet. The variety of event sequences in the eruptions
supports the idea that the magnetic explosions that make polar X-ray jets work the same way as the
much larger magnetic explosions that make a flare and coronal mass ejection (CME). That idea, and
recent observations indicating that magnetic flux cancelation is the fundamental process that
builds the field in and around the pre-jet mininfilament and triggers that fields jet-driving explosion,
together suggest that flux cancelation inside the magnetic arcade that explodes in a flare/CME
eruption is usually the fundamental process that builds the explosive field in the core of the arcade
and triggers that fields explosion.
