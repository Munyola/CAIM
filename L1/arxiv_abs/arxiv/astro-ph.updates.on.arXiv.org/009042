A probable carbon enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) star, Pisces II 10694, was discovered recently in
the ultra-faint (UFD) galaxy Pisces II. This galaxy is supposed to be very old, suspected to include
dark matter, and likely formed the bulk of its stars before the reionisation of the Universe. New
abundances have been obtained from observations of Pisces II 10694 at the Kueyen ESO VLT telescope,
using the high-efficiency spectrograph: X-Shooter. We found that Pisces II 10694 is a CEMP-no star
with [Fe/H]=-2.60 dex. Careful measurements of the CH and C2 bands confirm the enhancement of the
C abundance ([C/Fe]=+1.23). This cool giant has very probably undergone extra mixing and thus its
original C abundance could be even higher. Nitrogen, O, Na, and Mg are also strongly enhanced, but
from Ca to Ni the ratios [X/Fe] are similar to those observed in classical galactic very metal-poor
stars. With its low Ba abundance ([Ba/Fe] =-1.10 dex) Pisces II 10694 is a CEMP-no star. No variation
in the radial velocity could be detected between the years 2015 and 2017. The pattern of the elements
abundance has a shape similar to the pattern found in galactic CEMP-no stars like CS 22949-037 ([Fe/H]=-4.0)
or SDSS J1349+1407 ([Fe/H]=-3.6). The existence of a CEMP-no star in the UFD galaxy Pisc II suggests
that this small galaxy likely hosted zero-metallicity stars. This is consistent with theoretical
predictions of cosmological models supporting the idea that UFD galaxies are the living fossils
of the first star-forming systems.
