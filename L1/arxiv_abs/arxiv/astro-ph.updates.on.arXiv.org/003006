We have performed a statistical study of the outburst properties of 110 bright X-ray outbursts in
36 low-mass X-ray binary transients (LMXBTs) seen with the All-Sky Monitor (ASM; 2--12 keV) on board
the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer ({\it RXTE}) in 1996--2011. We have measured a number of outburst
properties including peak X-ray luminosity, rate-of-change of luminosity on daily timescale,
$e$-folding rise and decay timescales, outburst duration and total radiated energy. We found the
average values of some properties such as peak X-ray luminosity, rise and decay timescales, outburst
duration and total radiated energy of black hole LMXBTs are at least two times larger than those of
neutron star LMXBTs, implying that these properties can be used to infer the nature of the central
compact object of a newly discovered LMXBT. We also found the outburst peak X-ray luminosity is correlated
with the rate-of-change of X-ray luminosity in both the rise and the decay phases, which is consistent
with our previous studies. There are also positive correlations between total radiated energy
and peak X-ray luminosity, and between total radiated energy and $e$-folding rise or decay timescale
in the outbursts. These correlations suggest that the mass stored in the disc before an outburst
is the primary initial condition which sets up the outburst properties seen later on. We also found
the outbursts of two transient stellar-mass ULXs in M31 also follow the correlations, which indicate
the same outburst mechanism works for the outbursts of these two sources in M31 which reached above
the Eddington luminosity.
