The origin and nature of the ultrahigh energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) are still unknown. However, great
progress has been achieved in past years due to the observations performed by the Pierre Auger Observatory
and Telescope Array. Above $10^{18}$ eV the observed energy spectrum presents two features: a hardening
of the slope at about $10^{18.7}$ eV, which is known as the ankle and a suppression at approximately
$10^{19.6}$ eV. The composition inferred from the experimental data, interpreted by using the
current high energy hadronic interaction models, seems to be light below the ankle, showing a trend
to heavier nuclei for increasing values of the primary energy. Current high energy hadronic interaction
models, updated by using Large Hadron Collider data, are still subject to large systematic uncertainties,
which makes difficult the interpretation of the experimental data in terms of composition. On the
other hand, it is very well known that gamma rays and neutrinos are produced by UHECRs during propagation
from their sources, as a consequence of their interactions with the radiation field present in the
universe. The flux at Earth of these secondary particles depends on the source models of UHECRs including
the chemical composition at injection. Therefore, both gamma-ray and neutrino observations can
be used to constrain source models of UHECRs, including the composition in a way which is independent
of the high energy hadronic interaction models. In this article I will review recent results obtained
by using the latest gamma-ray and neutrino observations.
