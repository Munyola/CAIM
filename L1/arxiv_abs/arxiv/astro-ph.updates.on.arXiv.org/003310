Outbursts are known to begin with a sudden appearance and steep brightening of a "stellar nucleus"
--- an unresolved image of a plume of material on its way from the comet's surface and an initial stage
of an expanding halo of ejecta. Since the brightness of this feature is routinely reported, together
with astrometry, by most comet observers as the "nuclear magnitude," it is straightforward to determine
the onset time, a fundamental parameter of any outburst, by inspecting the chronological lists
of such observations for a major jump in the nuclear brightness. Although it is inadmissible to mix
nuclear magnitudes by different observers without first carefully examining their compatibility,
the time constraints obtained from data sets reported by different observers can readily be combined.
The intersection of these sets provides the tightest possible constraint on the outburst's onset
time. Applied to comet 168P/Hergenrother during its 2012 return to perihelion, three outbursts
were detected and their timing determined with good to excellent accuracy. Six fragmentation events
experienced by the comet are shown to have occurred in the same period of time as the outbursts. Three
companions are likely to have broken off from the primary in the first outburst, two companions in
the second outburst, and one companion in the last outburst. All companions were short-lived, belonging
to the class of excessively brittle fragments. Yet, the results suggest that most of the mass lost
in the first outburst remained relatively intact during the liftoff, while the opposite was the
case in the last outburst.
