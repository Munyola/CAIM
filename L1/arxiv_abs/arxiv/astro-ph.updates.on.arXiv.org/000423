HI line widths are typically interpreted as a measure of ISM turbulence, which is potentially driven
by star formation. In an effort to better understand the possible connections between line widths
and star formation, we have characterized \hi{} kinematics in a sample of nearby dwarf galaxies
by co-adding line-of-sight spectra after removing the rotational velocity to produce an average,
global \hi{} line profile. These "superprofiles" are composed of a central narrow peak (~6-10 km/s)
with higher-velocity wings to either side that contain ~10-15% of the total flux. The superprofiles
are all very similar, indicating a universal global HI profile for dwarf galaxies. We compare characteristics
of the superprofiles to various galaxy properties, such as mass and measures of star formation (SF),
with the assumption that the superprofile represents a turbulent peak with energetic wings to either
side. We use these quantities to derive average scale heights for the sample galaxies. When comparing
to physical properties, we find that the velocity dispersion of the central peak is correlated with
$<\Sigma_\mathrm{HI}>$. The fraction of mass and characteristic velocity of the high velocity
wings are correlated with measures of SF, consistent with the picture that SF drives surrounding
HI to higher velocities. While gravitational instabilities provide too little energy, the SF in
the sample galaxies does provide enough energy through supernovae, with realistic estimates of
the coupling efficiency, to produce the observed superprofiles.
