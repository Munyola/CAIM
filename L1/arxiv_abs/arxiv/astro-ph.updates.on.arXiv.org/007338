A rapid accumulation of observations and interpretation have followed in the wake of 1I `Oumuamua's
passage through the inner Solar System. We briefly outline the consequences that this first detection
of an interstellar asteroid implies for the planet-forming process, and we assess the near-term
prospects for detecting and observing (both remotely and in situ) future Solar System visitors
of this type. Drawing on detailed heat-transfer calculations that take both `Oumuamua's unusual
shape and its chaotic tumbling into account, we affirm that the lack of a detectable coma in deep images
of the object very likely arises from the presence of a radiation-modified coating of high molecular
weight material (rather than a refractory bulk composition). Assuming that `Oumuamua is a typical
representative of a larger population with a kinematic distribution similar to Population I stars
in the local galactic neighborhood, we calculate expected arrival rates, impact parameters and
velocities of similar objects and assess their prospects for detection using operational and forthcoming
facilities. Using `Oumuamua as a proof-of-concept, we assess the prospects for missions that intercept
interstellar objects (ISOs) using conventional chemical propulsion. Using a "launch on detection"
paradigm, we estimate wait times of order 10 years between favorable mission opportunities with
the detection capabilities of the Large-Scale Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST), a figure that
will be refined as the population of interstellar asteroids becomes observationally better constrained.
