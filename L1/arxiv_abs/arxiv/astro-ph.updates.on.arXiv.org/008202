Measurement of the acoustic peaks of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature anisotropies
has been instrumental in deciding the geometry and content of the universe. Acoustic peak positions
vary in different parts of the sky due to statistical fluctuation. We present the statistics of the
peak positions of small patches from ESA Planck data. We found that the peak positions have significantly
high variance compared to the 100 CMB simulations with best-fit LambdaCDM model with lensing and
Doppler boosting effects included. Examining individual patches, we found the one containing
the mysterious "Cold Spot", an area near the Eridanus constellation where the temperature is significantly
lower than Gaussian theory predicts, displays large synchronous shift of peak positions towards
smaller multipole numbers with significance lower than 1.11x 10^{-4}. The combination of large
synchronous shifts in acoustic peaks and lower than usual temperature at the Cold Spot area results
in a 4.73-sigma detection (significance p~ 1.11x 10^{-6}) against the LambdaCDM model. And it was
already reported in Finelli et al. (2016) that in the WISE-2MASS galaxy catalog at z<0.3 the Cold
Spot region is surrounded by surprisingly large underdense regions around 15 degs in radius, which
are found to be in the same square patch. Thus we propose there is some extra localized unknown energy
to stretch out the space in the transverse direction around the Cold Spot area to simultaneously
account for the Cold Spot, excessive shift of the acoustic peaks, and the large underdense regions.
