We study the morphologies and sizes of galaxies at z>5 using high-resolution cosmological zoom-in
simulations from the Feedback In Realistic Environments project. The galaxies show a variety of
morphologies, from compact to clumpy to irregular. The simulated galaxies have more extended morphologies
and larger sizes when measured using rest-frame optical B-band light than rest-frame UV light;
sizes measured from stellar mass surface density are even larger. The UV morphologies are usually
dominated by several small, bright young stellar clumps that are not always associated with significant
stellar mass. The B-band light traces stellar mass better than the UV, but it can also be biased by
the bright clumps. At all redshifts, galaxy size correlates with stellar mass/luminosity with
large scatter. The half-light radii range from 0.01 to 0.2 arcsec (0.05-1 kpc physical) at fixed
magnitude. At z>5, the size of galaxies at fixed stellar mass/luminosity evolves as (1+z)^{-m},
with m~1-2. For galaxies less massive than M_star~10^8 M_sun, the ratio of the half-mass radius
to the halo virial radius is ~10% and does not evolve significantly at z=5-10; this ratio is typically
1-5% for more massive galaxies. A galaxy's "observed" size decreases dramatically at shallower
surface brightness limits. This effect may account for the extremely small sizes of z>5 galaxies
measured in the Hubble Frontier Fields. We provide predictions for the cumulative light distribution
as a function of surface brightness for typical galaxies at z=6.
