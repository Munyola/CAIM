To study the disc central surface brightness ($\mu_0$) distribution in optical and near-infrared
bands, we select 708 disc-dominated galaxies within a fixed distance of 57 Mpc from SDSS DR7 and UKIDSS
DR10. Then we fit $\mu_0$ distribution by using single and double Gaussian profiles with an optimal
bin size for the final sample of 538 galaxies in optical $griz$ bands and near-infrared $YJHK$ bands.
Among the 8 bands, we find that $\mu_{0}$ distribution in optical bands can not be much better fitted
with double Gaussian profiles. However, for all the near-infrared bands, the evidence of being
better fitted by using double Gaussian profiles is positive. Especially for $K$ band, the evidence
of a double Gaussian profile being better than a single Gaussian profile for $\mu_{0}$ distribution
is very strong, the reliability of which can be approved by 1000 times test for our sample. No dust
extinction correction is applied. The difference of $\mu_{0}$ distribution between optical and
near-infrared bands could be caused by the effect of dust extinction in optical bands. Due to the
sample selection criteria, our sample is not absolutely complete. However, the sample incompleteness
does not change the double Gaussian distribution of $\mu_{0}$ in $K$ band. Furthermore, we discuss
some possible reasons for the fitting results of $\mu_{0}$ distribution in $K$ band. Conclusively,
the double Gaussian distribution of $\mu_{0}$ in $K$ band for our sample may depend on bulge-to-disk
ratio, color and disk scalelength, rather than the inclination of sample galaxies, bin size and
statistical fluctuations.
