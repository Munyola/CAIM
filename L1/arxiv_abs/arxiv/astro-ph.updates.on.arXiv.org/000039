We present the results of multi-year gamma-ray observations by the AGILE satellite of the black
hole binary system Cygnus X-1. In a previous investigation we focused on gamma-ray observations
of Cygnus X-1 in the hard state during the period mid-2007/2009. Here we present the results of the
gamma-ray monitoring of Cygnus X-1 during the period 2010/mid-2012 carried out for which includes
a remarkably prolonged `soft state' phase (June 2010 -- May 2011). Previous 1--10 MeV observations
of Cyg X-1 in this state hinted at a possible existence of a non-thermal particle component with substantial
modifications of the Comptonized emission from the inner accretion disk. Our AGILE data, averaged
over the mid-2010/mid-2011 soft state of Cygnus X-1, provide a significant upper limit for gamma-ray
emission above 100 MeV of F_soft < 20 x 10^{-8} ph/cm^2/s, excluding the existence of prominent
non-thermal emission above 100 MeV during the soft state of Cygnus X-1. We discuss theoretical implications
of our findings in the context of high-energy emission models of black hole accretion. We also discuss
possible gamma-ray flares detected by AGILE. In addition to a previously reported episode observed
by AGILE in October 2009 during the hard state, we report a weak but important candidate for enhanced
emission which occurred at the end of June 2010 (2010-06-30 10:00 - 2010-07-02 10:00 UT) exactly
in coincidence with a hard-to-soft state transition and before an anomalous radio flare. An appendix
summarizes all previous high-energy observations and possible detections of Cygnus X-1 above
1 MeV.
