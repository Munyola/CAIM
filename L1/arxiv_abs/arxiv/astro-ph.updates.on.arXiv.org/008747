High-resolution observations of the solar chromosphere at millimeter wavelengths are now possible
with the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA), promising to tackle many open problems in solar
physics. Observations from other ground and space-based telescopes will greatly benefit from
coordinated endeavors with ALMA, yet the diagnostic potential of combined optical, ultraviolet
and mm observations has remained mostly unassessed. In this paper we investigate whether mm-wavelengths
could aid current inversion schemes to retrieve a more accurate representation of the temperature
structure of the solar atmosphere. We performed several non-LTE inversion experiments of the emergent
spectra from a snapshot of 3D radiation-MHD simulation. We included common line diagnostics such
as CaII H, K, 8542 \AA$\,$ and MgII h and k, taking into account partial frequency redistribution
effects, along with the continuum around 1.2 mm and 3 mm. We found that including the mm-continuum
in inversions allows a more accurate inference of temperature as function of optical depth. The
addition of ALMA bands to other diagnostics should improve the accuracy of the inferred chromospheric
temperatures between $\log \tau\sim[-6,-4.5]$ where the CaII and MgII lines are weakly coupled
to the local conditions. However, we found that simultaneous multi-atom, non-LTE inversions of
optical and UV lines present equally strong constraints in the lower chromosphere and thus are not
greatly improved by the 1.2 mm band. Nonetheless, the 3 mm band is still needed to better constrain
the mid-upper chromosphere.
