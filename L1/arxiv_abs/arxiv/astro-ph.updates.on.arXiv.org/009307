The Dharma Planet Survey (DPS) aims to monitor about 150 nearby very bright FGKM dwarfs (within 50
pc) during 2016$-$2020 for low-mass planet detection and characterization using the TOU very high
resolution optical spectrograph (R$\approx$100,000, 380-900nm). TOU was initially mounted
to the 2-m Automatic Spectroscopic Telescope at Fairborn Observatory in 2013-2015 to conduct a
pilot survey, then moved to the dedicated 50-inch automatic telescope on Mt. Lemmon in 2016 to launch
the survey. Here we report the first planet detection from DPS, a super-Earth candidate orbiting
a bright K dwarf star, HD 26965. It is the second brightest star ($V=4.4$ mag) on the sky with a super-Earth
candidate. The planet candidate has a mass of 8.47$\pm0.47M_{\rm Earth}$, period of $42.38\pm0.01$
d, and eccentricity of $0.04^{+0.05}_{-0.03}$. This RV signal was independently detected by Diaz
et al. (2018), but they could not confirm if the signal is from a planet or from stellar activity. The
orbital period of the planet is close to the rotation period of the star (39$-$44.5 d) measured from
stellar activity indicators. Our high precision photometric campaign and line bisector analysis
of this star do not find any significant variations at the orbital period. Stellar RV jitters modeled
from star spots and convection inhibition are also not strong enough to explain the RV signal detected.
After further comparing RV data from the star's active magnetic phase and quiet magnetic phase,
we conclude that the RV signal is due to planetary-reflex motion and not stellar activity.
