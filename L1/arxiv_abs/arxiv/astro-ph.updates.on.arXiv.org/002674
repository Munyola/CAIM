While the motion of particles near a rotating, electrically-neutral (Kerr), and charged (Kerr--Newman)
black hole is always strictly regular, a perturbation in the gravitational or the electromagnetic
field generally leads to chaos. The transition from regular to chaotic dynamics is relatively gradual
if the system preserves axial symmetry, whereas non-axisymmetry induces chaos more efficiently.
Here we study the development of chaos in an oblique (electro-vacuum) magnetosphere of a magnetized
black hole. Besides the strong gravity of the massive source represented by the Kerr metric we consider
the presence of a weak, ordered, large-scale magnetic field. An axially-symmetric model consisting
of a rotating black hole embedded in an aligned magnetic field is generalized by allowing an oblique
direction of the field having a general inclination, with respect to the rotation axis of the system.
The inclination of the field acts as an additional perturbation to the motion of charged particles
as it breaks the axial symmetry of the system and cancels the related integral of motion. The axial
component of angular momentum is no longer conserved and the resulting system thus has three degrees
of freedom. Our primary concern within this contribution is to find out how sensitive the system
of bound particles is to the inclination of the field. We employ the method of the maximal Lyapunov
exponent to distinguish between regular and chaotic orbits and to quantify their chaoticity. We
find that even a small misalignment induces chaotic motion.
