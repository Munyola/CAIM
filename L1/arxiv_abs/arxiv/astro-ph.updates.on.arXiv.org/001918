The Hubble Frontier Fields (HFF) program combines the capabilities of the Hubble Space Telescope
(HST) with the gravitational lensing of massive galaxy clusters to probe the distant Universe to
an unprecedented depth. Here, we present the results of the first combined HST and Spitzer observations
of the cluster Abell 2744. We combine the full near-infrared data with ancillary optical images
to search for gravitationally lensed high-redshift (z > 6) galaxies. We report the detection
of 14 I814-dropout candidates at z ~ 6-7 and one Y105-dropout at z ~ 8 in a total survey area of 1.43 arcmin^2
in the source plane. The predictions of our lens model allow us to also identify five multiply-imaged
systems lying at redshifts between z ~ 6 and z ~ 8. Thanks to constraints from the mass distribution
in the cluster, we were able to estimate the effective survey volume corrected for completeness
and magnification effects. This was in turn used to estimate the rest-frame ultraviolet luminosity
function (LF) at z ~ 6-8. Our LF results are generally in agreement with the most recent blank field
estimates, confirming the feasibility of surveys through lensing clusters. Although based on
a shallower observations than what will be achieved in the final dataset including the full ACS observations,
the LF presented here extends down to Muv ~ -18.5 at z ~ 7 with one identified object at Muv ~ -15 thanks
to the highly-magnified survey areas. This early study forecasts the power of using massive galaxy
clusters as cosmic telescopes and its complementarity to blank fields.
