The High Altitude Water Cherenkov observatory (HAWC) is an air shower array devised for TeV gamma-ray
astronomy. HAWC is located at an altitude of 4100 m a.s.l. in Sierra Negra, Mexico. HAWC consists
of 300 Water Cherenkov Detectors, each instrumented with 4 photomultiplier tubes (PMTs). HAWC
re-uses the Front-End Boards from the Milagro experiment to receive the PMT signals. These boards
are used in combination with Time to Digital Converters (TDCs) to record the time and the amount of
light in each PMT hit (light flash). A set of VME TDC modules (128 channels each) is operated in a continuous
(dead time free) mode. The TDCs are read out via the VME bus by Single-Board Computers (SBCs), which
in turn are connected to a gigabit Ethernet network. The complete system produces ~ 500 MB/s of raw
data. A high-throughput data processing system has been designed and built to enable real-time
data analysis. The system relies on off-the-shelf hardware components, an open-source software
technology for data transfers (ZeroMQ) and a custom software framework for data analysis (AERIE).
Multiple trigger and reconstruction algorithms can be combined and run on blocks of data in a parallel
fashion, producing a set of output data streams which can be analyzed in real time with minimal latency
(< 5 s). This paper provides an overview of the hardware set-up and an in-depth description of the
software design, covering both the TDC data acquisition system and the real-time data processing
system. The performance of these systems is also discussed.
