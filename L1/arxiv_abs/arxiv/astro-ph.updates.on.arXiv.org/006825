Impulsively generated sausage wave trains in coronal structures are important for interpreting
a substantial number of observations of quasi-periodic signals with quasi-periods of order seconds.
We have previously shown that the Morlet spectra of these wave trains in coronal tubes depend crucially
on the dispersive properties of trapped sausage waves, the existence of cutoff axial wavenumbers
and the monotonicity of the dependence of the axial group speed on the axial wavenumber in particular.
This study examines the difference a slab geometry may introduce, for which purpose we conduct a
comprehensive eigenmode analysis, both analytically and numerically, on trapped sausage modes
in coronal slabs with a considerable number of density profiles. For the profile descriptions examined,
coronal slabs can trap sausage waves with longer axial wavelengths, and the group speed approaches
the internal Alfv\'en speed more rapidly at large wavenumbers in the cylindrical case. However,
common to both geometries, cutoff wavenumbers exist only when the density profile falls sufficiently
rapidly at distances far from coronal structures. Likewise, the monotonicity of the group speed
curves depends critically on the profile steepness right at the structure axis. Furthermore, the
Morlet spectra of the wave trains are shaped by the group speed curves for coronal slabs and tubes
alike. Consequently, we conclude that these spectra have the potential for telling the sub-resolution
density structuring inside coronal structures, although their detection requires an instrumental
cadence of better than $\sim 1$ second.
