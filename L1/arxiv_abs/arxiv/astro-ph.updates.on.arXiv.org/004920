Fiber bursts are a type of fine structure that is often superposed on type IV radio continuum emission
during solar flares. Although studied for many decades, its physical exciter, emission mechanism,
and association with the flare energy release remain unclear, partly due to the lack of simultaneous
imaging observations. We report the first dynamic spectroscopic imaging observations of decimetric
fiber bursts, which occurred during the rise phase of a long-duration eruptive flare on 2012 March
3, as obtained by the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array in 1--2 GHz. Our results show that the fiber sources
are located near and above one footpoint of the flare loops. The fiber source and the background continuum
source are found to be cospatial and share the same morphology. It is likely that they are associated
with nonthermal electrons trapped in the converging magnetic fields near the footpoint, as supported
by a persistent coronal hard X-ray source present during the flare rise phase. We analyze three groups
of fiber bursts in detail with dynamic imaging spectroscopy and obtain their mean frequency-dependent
centroid trajectories in projection. By using a barometric density model and magnetic field based
on a potential-field extrapolation, we further reconstruct the 3-D source trajectories of fiber
bursts, for comparison with expectations from the whistler wave model and two MHD-based models.
We conclude that the observed fiber burst properties are consistent with an exciter moving at the
propagation velocity expected for whistler waves, or models that posit similar exciter velocities.
