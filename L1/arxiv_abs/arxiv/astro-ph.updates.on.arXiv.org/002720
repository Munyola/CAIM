The ATLAS3D Survey has reported strong evidence for a non-universal stellar initial mass function
(IMF) and for a trend of the IMF with the effective stellar velocity dispersion of early type galaxies
(ETGs) (Cappellari et al. 2012). The ATLAS3D Survey consists of detailed Integral Field Spectroscopy
of 260 ETGs closer than 42 Mpc. Cappellari et al. infer the IMF by comparing mass measurements derived
from fitting the kinematic data with measurements derived from fitting the spectral energy distribution.
Here we investigate possible systematic errors and biases that could affect their conclusions.
We show that part of the reported trend between IMF and velocity dispersion is caused by a selection
effect on H\b{eta} absorption. Apart from an IMF trend with velocity dispersion, we also find an
IMF trend with distance, but no correlation between nearest neighbour ETGs as would be expected
if the dependence on distance would reflect an environmental dependence. Part of the IMF trend with
velocity dispersion can be traced back to colour-dependent calibration issues with the surface
brightness fluctuation distances of Tonry et al. (2001) and Mei et al. (2007). There is no IMF-dispersion
trend for galaxies with distances larger than 25 Mpc. The ATLAS3D Survey appears to be incomplete
for masses lower than 10^10.3 solar masses. Restricting the analysis to the kinematic mass range
M > 10^10.3 solar masses completely removes the IMF-dispersion trend. Our findings strongly
suggest that some of the trends between IMF and galaxy properties reported by ATLAS3D are unphysical
and caused by systematics.
