We present rest-frame optical spectra of 12 nitrogen-loud quasars at z ~ 2.2, whose rest-frame ultraviolet
(UV) spectra show strong nitrogen broad emission lines. To investigate their narrow-line region
(NLR) metallicities, we measure the equivalent width (EW) of the [OIII]5007 emission line: if the
NLR metallicity is remarkably high as suggested by strong UV nitrogen lines, the [OIII]5007 line
flux should be very week due to the low equilibrium temperature of the ionized gas owing to significant
metal cooling. In the result, we found that our spectra show moderate EW of the [OIII]5007 line similar
to general quasars. This indicates nitrogen-loud quasars do not have extremely metal-rich gas
clouds in NLRs. This suggests that strong nitrogen lines from broad-line regions (BLRs) are originated
by exceptionally high abundances of nitrogen relative to oxygen without very high BLR metallicities.
This result indicates that broad-emission lines of nitrogen are not good indicators of the BLR metallicity
in some cases. On the other hand, we also investigate virial black-hole masses and Eddington ratios
by using the Hbeta and CIV1549 lines for our sample. As a result, we found that black-hole masses and
Eddington ratios of nitrogen-loud quasars tend to be low and high relative to normal quasars, suggesting
that nitrogen-loud quasars seem to be in a rapidly-accreting phase. This can be explained in terms
of a positive correlation between Eddington ratios and nitrogen abundances of quasars, that is
probably caused by the connection between the mass accretion onto black holes and nuclear star formation.
