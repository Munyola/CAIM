We present the results of a survey of the brightest UV-selected galaxies in protoclusters. These
proto-brightest cluster galaxy (proto-BCG) candidates are drawn from 179 overdense regions of
$g$-dropout galaxies at $z\sim4$ from the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program identified
previously as good protocluster candidates. This study is the first to extend the systematic study
of the progenitors of BCGs from $z\sim2$ to $z\sim4$. We carefully remove possible contaminants
from foreground galaxies and, for each structure, we select the brightest galaxy that is at least
1 mag brighter than the fifth brightest galaxy. We select 63 proto-BCG candidates and compare their
properties with those of galaxies in the field and those of other galaxies in overdense structures.
The proto-BCG candidates and their surrounding galaxies have different rest-UV color $(i - z)$
distributions to field galaxies and other galaxies in protoclusters that do not host proto-BCGs.
In addition, galaxies surrounding proto-BCGs are brighter than those in protoclusters without
proto-BCGs. The image stacking analysis reveals that the average effective radius of proto-BCGs
is $\sim28\%$ larger than that of field galaxies. The $i-z$ color differences suggest that proto-BCGs
and their surrounding galaxies are dustier than other galaxies at $z\sim4$. These results suggest
that specific environmental effects or assembly biasses have already emerged in some protoclusters
as early as $z \sim 4$, and we suggest that proto-BCGs have different star formation histories than
other galaxies in the same epoch.
