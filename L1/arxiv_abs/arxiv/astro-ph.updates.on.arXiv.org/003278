We present the results of a new, ultra-deep, near-infrared imaging survey executed with the Hawk-I
imager at the ESO VLT, of which we make all the data public. This survey, named HUGS (Hawk-I UDS and
GOODS Survey), provides deep, high-quality imaging in the K and Y bands over the CANDELS UDS and GOODS-South
fields. We describe here the survey strategy, the data reduction process, and the data quality.
HUGS delivers the deepest and highest quality K-band images ever collected over areas of cosmological
interest, and ideally complements the CANDELS data set in terms of image quality and depth. The seeing
is exceptional and homogeneous, confined to the range 0.38"-0.43". In the deepest region of the
GOODS-S field, (which includes most of the HUDF) the K-band exposure time exceeds 80 hours of integration,
yielding a 1-sigma magnitude limit of ~28.0 mag/sqarcsec. In the UDS field the survey matches the
shallower depth of the CANDELS images reaching a 1-sigma limit per sq.arcsec of ~27.3mag in the K
band and ~28.3mag in the Y-band, We show that the HUGS observations are well matched to the depth of
the CANDELS WFC3/IR data, since the majority of even the faintest galaxies detected in the CANDELS
H-band images are also detected in HUGS. We present the K-band galaxy number counts produced by combining
the HUGS data from the two fields. We show that the slope of the number counts depends sensitively
on the assumed distribution of galaxy sizes, with potential impact on the estimated extra-galactic
background light (abridged).
