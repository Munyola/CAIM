We present a polarization study towards the supernova remnant (SNR) Puppis A based on original observations
performed with the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA). Based on the analysis of a feature
detected outside the SNR shell (called `the tail' throughout the paper), it was possible to disentangle
the emission with origin in Puppis A itself from that coming from the foreground Vela SNR. We found
a very low polarization fraction, of about 3 percent on average. The upper limit of the magnetic field
component parallel to the line of sight is estimated to be B$_\parallel \sim$ 20 $\mu$G. The statistical
behavior of the magnetic vectors shows two preferential directions, almost perpendicular to each
other, which are approximately aligned with the flat edges of Puppis A. A third, narrow peak oriented
perpendicular to the Galactic plane suggests the existence of an interstellar magnetic field locally
aligned in this direction. There is evidence that the magnetic vectors along the shell are aligned
with the shock front direction. The low polarization fraction and the statistical behavior of the
magnetic vectors are compatible with a scenario where the SNR evolves inside a stellar wind bubble
with a box-like morphology, produced by the interaction of the different stellar winds, one of them
magnetized, launched by the SN progenitor. This scenario can furthermore explain the morphology
of Puppis A, rendering little support to the previously accepted picture which involved strong
density gradients to explain the flat, eastern edge of the shell.
