Most stars form and spend their early life in regions of enhanced stellar density. Therefore the
evolution of protoplanetary discs (PPDs) hosted by such stars are subject to the influence of other
members of the cluster. Physically, PPDs might be truncated either by photoevaporation due to ultraviolet
flux from massive stars, or tidal truncation due to close stellar encounters. Here we aim to compare
the two effects in real cluster environments. In this vein we first review the properties of well
studied stellar clusters with a focus on stellar number density, which largely dictates the degree
of tidal truncation, and far ultraviolet (FUV) flux, which is indicative of the rate of external
photoevaporation. We then review the theoretical PPD truncation radius due to an arbitrary encounter,
additionally taking into account the role of eccentric encounters that play a role in hot clusters
with a 1D velocity dispersion $\sigma_v > 2$ km/s. Our treatment is then applied statistically to
varying local environments to establish a canonical threshold for the local stellar density ($n_{c}
> 10^4$ pc$^{-3}$) for which encounters can play a significant role in shaping the distribution
of PPD radii over a timescale $\sim 3$ Myr. By combining theoretical mass loss rates due to FUV flux
with viscous spreading in a PPD we establish a similar threshold for which a massive disc is completely
destroyed by external photoevaporation. Comparing these thresholds in local clusters we find
that if either mechanism has a significant impact on the PPD population then photoevaporation is
always the dominating influence.
