We present the Pmas/ppak Integral-field Supernova hosts COmpilation (PISCO) which comprises
Integral Field Spectroscopy (IFS) of 232 supernova (SN) host galaxies, that hosted 272 SNe, observed
over several semesters with the 3.5m telescope at the Calar Alto Observatory (CAHA). PISCO is the
largest collection of SN host galaxies observed with wide-field IFS, totaling 466,347 individual
spectra covering a typical spatial resolution of $\sim$380 pc. While focused studies regarding
specific SN Ia- related topics will be published elsewhere, this paper aims to present the properties
of the SN environments with stellar population (SP) synthesis and the gas-phase ISM, providing
additional results separating stripped-envelope SNe into their subtypes. With 11,270 HII regions
detected in all galaxies, we present for the first time an HII region statistical analysis, that
puts HII regions that have hosted SNe in context with all other SF clumps within their galaxies. SNe
Ic are associated to more metal-rich, higher EW(H{\alpha}) and higher SF rate environments within
their host galaxies than the mean of all HII regions detected within each host, on contrary SNe IIb
occur at the most different environments compared to other CC SNe types. We find two clear components
of young and old SP at SNe IIn locations. We find that SNe II fast-decliners (IIL) tend to explode at
locations where {\Sigma}SFR is more intense. Finally, we outline how a future dedicated IFS survey
of galaxies in parallel to an untargeted SN search would overcome the biases in current environmental
studies.
