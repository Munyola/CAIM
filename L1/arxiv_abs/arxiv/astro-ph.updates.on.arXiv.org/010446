The Epoch of Reionization (EoR) features a rich interplay between the first luminous sources and
the low-density gas of the intergalactic medium (IGM), where photons from these sources ionize
the IGM. There are currently few observational constraints on key observables related to the EoR,
such as the midpoint and duration of reionization. Although upcoming observations of the 21 cm power
spectrum with next-generation radio interferometers such as the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization
Array (HERA) and the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) are expected to provide information about the
midpoint of reionization readily, extracting the duration from the power spectrum alone is a more
difficult proposition. As an alternative method for extracting information about reionization,
we present an application of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to images of reionization. These
images are two-dimensional in the plane of the sky, and extracted at a series of redshift values to
generate "image cubes" that are qualitatively similar to those HERA and the SKA will generate in
the near future. Additionally, we include the impact that the bright foreground signal from the
Milky Way galaxy imparts on such image cubes from interferometers, and degrade the simulated images
accordingly. We show that we are able to recover the duration of reionization $\Delta z$ to within
10% using CNNs, assuming that the midpoint of reionization is already relatively well constrained.
These results have exciting impacts for estimating $\tau$, the optical depth to the CMB, which can
help constrain other cosmological parameters.
