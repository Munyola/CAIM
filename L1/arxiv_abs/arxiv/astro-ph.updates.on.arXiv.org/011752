Stellar population synthesis (SPS) models have long struggled to reproduce observed optical through
near-IR (NIR) spectral energy distributions (SED) of massive quiescent galaxies. We revisit this
issue using a novel approach that combines the diagnostic power of full-spectrum fitting with recently
updated stellar spectral libraries. First, we perform full-spectrum fitting of continuum-normalized
stacked SDSS spectra in bins of velocity dispersion to infer their stellar population properties,
such as the elemental abundances and age. Next, we use the resulting best-fit parameters to compute
$ugriz$ colors, which are then compared to observed colors of the same galaxies. With this approach
we are able to predict the $ugriz$ SEDs of low and high mass galaxies at the $\lesssim 0.03$ mag level
in nearly all cases. We find that the full optical through NIR SEDs of quiescent galaxies can be reproduced
only when the spectrum is fit with a flexibility that is able to capture the behavior of the entire
optical absorption line spectrum. The models include variations in individual elemental abundances,
nebular emission lines, and the presence of young stellar components. The successful prediction
of the SED shape from continuum-normalized spectra implies that the continuum information is largely
contained in the narrow absorption features. These results also imply that attempts to model broadband
photometry of quiescent systems will suffer from potentially significant biases if the detailed
abundance patterns are not taken into account.
