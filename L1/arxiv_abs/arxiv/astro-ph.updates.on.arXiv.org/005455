We propose a new type of electromagnetic transients associated with the birth of binary black holes
(BBHs), which may lead to merger events accompanied by gravitational waves in $\sim0.1-1$ Gyr.
We consider the newborn BBHs formed through the evolution of isolated massive stellar binaries.
For a close massive binary, consisting of a primary black hole (BH) and a secondary Wolf-Rayet (WR)
star that are orbiting around each other, the spin period of the WR star can be tidally synchronized
to its orbital period. Then, the angular momentum of the outer material of the WR star is large enough
to form an accretion disk around a newborn, secondary BH, following its core-collapse. This disk
may produce an energetic outflow with a kinetic energy of $\sim10^{50}-10^{52}$ erg and an outflow
velocity of $\sim10^{10}\rm~cm~s^{-1}$, resulting in an optical transient with an absolute magnitude
from $\sim -14$ to $\sim-17$ with a duration of around a day. This type of transient also produces
detectable radio signals $\sim1-10$ years after the birth of BBHs, via synchrotron emission from
non-thermal electrons accelerated at external shocks. The predicted optical transients have
a shorter duration than ordinary core-collapse supernovae. Dedicated optical transient surveys
can detect them, and distinguish it from ordinary SNe using the different features of its light curve
and late-time spectrum. In the paper I, we investigate disk-driven outflows from the secondary
BH, whereas possible signals from the primary BH will be discussed in the paper II.
