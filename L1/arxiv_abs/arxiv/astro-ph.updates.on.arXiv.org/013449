The Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) project will conduct a ten year multi-band survey starting
in 2022. Observing strategies for this survey are being actively investigated, and the science
capabilities can be best forecasted on the basis of simulated strategies from the LSST Operations
Simulator (OpSim). OpSim simulates a stochastic realization of the sequence of LSST pointings
over the survey duration, and is based on a model of the observatory (including telescope) and historical
data of observational conditions. OpSim outputs contain a record of each simulated pointing of
the survey along with a complete characterization of the pointing in terms of observing conditions,
and some useful quantities derived from the characteristics of the pointing. Thus, each record
can be efficiently used to derive the properties of observations of all astrophysical sources found
in that pointing. However, in order to obtain the time series of observations (light curves) of a
set of sources, it is often more convenient to compute all observations of an astrophysical source,
and iterate over sources. In this document, we describe the open source python package OpSimSummary
which allows for a convenient reordering. The objectives of this package are to provide users with
an Application Programming Interface (API) for accessing all such observations and summarizing
this information in the form intermediate data products usable by third party software such as SNANA,
thereby also bridging the gap between official LSST products and pre-existing simulation codes.
