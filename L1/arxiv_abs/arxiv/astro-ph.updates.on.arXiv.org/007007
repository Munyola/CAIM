FR0s are compact radio sources that represent the bulk of the Radio-Loud (RL) AGN population, but
they are still poorly understood. Pilot studies on these sources have been already performed at
radio and optical wavelengths: here we present the first X-ray study of a sample of 19 FR0 radio galaxies
selected from the SDSS/NVSS/FIRST sample of Best & Heckman (2012), with redshift $\leq$ 0.15, radio
size $\leq$ 10 kpc and optically classified as low-excitation galaxies (LEG). The X-ray spectra
are modeled with a power-law component absorbed by Galactic column density with, in some cases,
a contribution from thermal extended gas. The X-ray photons are likely produced by the jet as attested
by the observed correlation between X-ray (2-10 keV) and radio (5 GHz) luminosities, similar to
FRIs. The estimated Eddington-scaled luminosities indicate a low accretion rate. Overall, we
find that the X-ray properties of FR0s are indistinguishable from those of FRIs, thus adding another
similarity between AGN associated with compact and extended radio sources. A comparison between
FR0s and low luminosity BL Lacs, rules out important beaming effects in the X-ray emission of the
compact radio galaxies. FR0s have different X-ray properties with respect to young radio sources
(e.g. GPS/CSS sources), generally characterized by higher X-ray luminosities and more complex
spectra. In conclusion, the paucity of extended radio emission in FR0s is probably related to the
intrinsic properties of their jets that prevent the formation of extended structures, and/or to
intermittent activity of their engines.
