Understanding cosmic reionization requires the identification and characterization of early
sources of hydrogen-ionizing photons. The 2012 Hubble Ultra Deep Field (UDF12) campaign has acquired
the deepest infrared images with the Wide Field Camera 3 aboard Hubble Space Telescope and, for the
first time, systematically explored the galaxy population deep into the era when cosmic microwave
background (CMB) data indicates reionization was underway. The UDF12 campaign thus provides the
best constraints to date on the abundance, luminosity distribution, and spectral properties of
early star-forming galaxies. We synthesize the new UDF12 results with the most recent constraints
from CMB observations to infer redshift-dependent ultraviolet (UV) luminosity densities, reionization
histories, and electron scattering optical depth evolution consistent with the available data.
Under reasonable assumptions about the escape fraction of hydrogen ionizing photons and the intergalactic
medium clumping factor, we find that to fully reionize the universe by redshift z~6 the population
of star-forming galaxies at redshifts z~7-9 likely must extend in luminosity below the UDF12 limits
to absolute UV magnitudes of M_UV\sim -13 or fainter. Moreover, low levels of star formation extending
to redshifts z~15-25, as suggested by the normal UV colors of z\simeq7-8 galaxies and the smooth
decline in abundance with redshift observed by UDF12 to z\simeq10, are additionally likely required
to reproduce the optical depth to electron scattering inferred from CMB observations.
