Based on a large sample of 254 220 galaxies in 81 089 groups, which are selected from the spectroscopic
galaxy sample of the SDSS DR12, we investigate the radial distribution of incidences, morphologies,
environmental densities, and star formation properties of the active galactic nucleus (AGN) host
galaxies and star-forming galaxies (SFGs) in the groups at z<0.2, as well as their changes with group
richness ($N_{\rm rich}$). It is found that AGN fraction slightly declines with richness for the
groups/clusters. The SFG fraction is on average about 2 times larger than the AGN fraction, with
a significant declining trend with richness. The group AGNs are preferentially reside in spheroidal
and bulge-dominated disc galaxies, whereas the majority of SFGs are late-type discs. Compared
with the SFGs, the AGNs in poor groups ($5 \leqslant N_{\rm rich} \leqslant 10$) are closer to group
center. The AGN fraction does not change with the distance to the group center, whereas the SFG fraction
tends to be higher in the outskirts. The AGNs in groups have a higher incidence than the SFGs for the
massive ($\log(M_*/M_{\odot}) > 10.7$) galaxies, and the mean SFG fraction is about 6 times as that
of AGNs in the late-type galaxies with lower masses at larger radius. The distribution of environmental
luminosity densities shows that the AGNs are likely to be reside in a denser environment relative
to the SFGs. Compared with the SFGs in groups, the group AGNs are found to have a higher mean stellar
mass, a lower mean star formation rate, and an older mean stellar age.
