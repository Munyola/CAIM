The early Earth's environment is controversial. Climatic estimates range from hot to glacial,
and inferred marine pH spans strongly alkaline to acidic. Better understanding of early climate
and ocean chemistry would improve our knowledge of the origin of life and its coevolution with the
environment. Here, we use a geological carbon cycle model with ocean chemistry to calculate self-consistent
histories of climate and ocean pH. Our carbon cycle model includes an empirically justified temperature
and pH dependence of seafloor weathering, allowing the relative importance of continental and
seafloor weathering to be evaluated. We find that the Archean climate was likely temperate (0-50
{\deg}C) due to the combined negative feedbacks of continental and seafloor weathering. Ocean
pH evolves monotonically from 6.6 (+0.6,-0.4) (2{\sigma}) at 4.0 Ga to 7.0 (+0.7,-0.5) (2{\sigma})
at the Archean-Proterozoic boundary, and to 7.9 (+0.1,-0.2) (2{\sigma}) at the Proterozoic-Phanerozoic
boundary. This evolution is driven by the secular decline of pCO2, which in turn is a consequence
of increasing solar luminosity, but is moderated by carbonate alkalinity delivered from continental
and seafloor weathering. Archean seafloor weathering may have been a comparable carbon sink to
continental weathering, but is less dominant than previously assumed, and would not have induced
global glaciation. We show how these conclusions are robust to a wide range of scenarios for continental
growth, internal heat flow evolution and outgassing history, greenhouse gas abundances, and changes
in the biotic enhancement of weathering.
