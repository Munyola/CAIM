We present new, near-infrared (1.1--2.4 $\mu m$) high-contrast imaging of the bright debris disk
surrounding HIP 79977 with the Subaru Coronagraphic Extreme Adaptive Optics system (SCExAO) coupled
with the CHARIS integral field spectrograph. SCExAO/CHARIS resolves the disk down to smaller angular
separations of (0.11"; $r \sim 14$ au) and at a higher significance than previously achieved at the
same wavelengths. The disk exhibits a marginally significant east-west brightness asymmetry
in $H$ band that requires confirmation. Geometrical modeling suggests a nearly edge-on disk viewed
at a position angle of $\sim$ 114.6$^{o}$ east of north. The disk is best-fit by scattered-light
models assuming strongly forward-scattering grains ($g$ $\sim$ 0.5--0.65) confined to a torus
with a peak density at $r_{0}$ $\sim$ 53--75 au. We find that a shallow outer density power law of $\alpha_{out}=$-1--
-3 and flare index of $\beta = 1$ are preferred. Other disk parameters (e.g.~inner density power
law and vertical scale height) are more poorly constrained. The disk has a slightly blue intrinsic
color and its profile is broadly consistent with predictions from birth ring models applied to other
debris disks. While HIP 79977's disk appears to be more strongly forward-scattering than most resolved
disks surrounding 5--30 Myr-old stars, this difference may be due to observational biases favoring
forward-scattering models for inclined disks vs. lower inclination, ostensibly neutral-scattering
disks like HR 4796A's. Deeper, higher signal-to-noise SCExAO/CHARIS data can better constrain
the disk's dust composition.
