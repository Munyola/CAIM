Current planet formation theories provide successful frameworks with which to interpret the array
of new observational data in this field. However, each of the two main theories (core accretion,
gravitational instability) is unable to explain some key aspects. In many planet formation calculations,
it is usual to treat the initial properties of the planet forming disc (mass, radius, etc.) as free
parameters. In this paper, we stress the importance of setting the formation of planet forming discs
within the context of the formation of the central stars. By exploring the early stages of disc formation,
we introduce the concept of the Maximum Mass Solar Nebula (MMSN), as opposed to the oft-used Minimum
Mass Solar Nebula (here mmsn). It is evident that almost all protoplanetary discs start their evolution
in a strongly self-gravitating state. In agreement with almost all previous work in this area, we
conclude that on the scales relevant to planet formation these discs are not gravitationally unstable
to gas fragmentation, but instead form strong, transient spiral arms. These spiral arms can act
as efficient dust traps allowing the accumulation and subsequent fragmentation of the dust (but
not the gas). This phase is likely to populate the disc with relatively large planetesimals on short
timescales while the disc is still veiled by a dusty-gas envelope. Crucially, the early formation
of large planetesimals overcomes the main barriers remaining within the core accretion model.
A prediction of this picture is that essentially all observable protoplanetary discs are already
planet hosting.
