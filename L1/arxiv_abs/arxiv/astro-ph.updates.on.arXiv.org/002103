We examine a possible formation scenario of galactic thick discs with numerical simulations. Thick
discs have previously been argued to form in clumpy disc phase in the high-redshift Universe, which
host giant clumps of <10^9 M_sun in their highly gas-rich discs. We performed SPH simulations
using isolated galaxy models for the purpose of verifying whether dynamical and chemical properties
of the thick discs formed in such clumpy galaxies are compatible with observations. The results
of our simulations seem nearly consistent with observations in dynamical properties such as radial
and vertical density profiles, significant rotation velocity lag with height and distributions
of orbital eccentricities. In addition, the thick discs in our simulations indicate nearly exponential
dependence of azimuthal and vertical velocity dispersions with radius, nearly isothermal kinematics
in vertical direction and negligible metallicity gradients in radial and vertical directions.
However, our simulations cannot reproduce altitudinal dependence of eccentricities and metallicity
relations with eccentricities and rotation velocities, which shows striking discrepancy from
recent observations of the Galactic thick disc. From this result, we infer that the clumpy disc scenario
for thick-disc formation would not be suitable at least for the Milky Way. Our study, however, cannot
reject this scenario for external galaxies if not all galaxies form their thick discs by the same
process. In addition, we found that a large fraction of thick-disc stars forms in giant clumps.
