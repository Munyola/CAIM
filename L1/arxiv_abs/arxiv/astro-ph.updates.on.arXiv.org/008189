In this paper, we study the statistical properties of weak lensing peaks in light-cones generated
from cosmological simulations. In order to assess the prospects of such observable as a cosmological
probe, we consider simulations that include interacting Dark Energy (hereafter DE) models with
coupling term between DE and Dark Matter. Cosmological models that produce a larger population
of massive clusters have more numerous high signal-to-noise peaks; among models with comparable
numbers of clusters those with more concentrated haloes produce more peaks. The most extreme model
under investigation shows a difference in peak counts of about $20\%$ with respect to the reference
$\mathrm{\Lambda}$CDM model. We find that peak statistics can be used to distinguish a coupling
DE model from a reference one with the same power spectrum normalisation. The differences in the
expansion history and the growth rate of structure formation are reflected in their halo counts,
non-linear scale features and, through them, in the properties of the lensing peaks. For a source
redshift distribution consistent with the expectations of future space-based wide field surveys,
we find that typically seventy percent of the cluster population contributes to weak-lensing peaks
with signal-to-noise ratios larger than two, and that the fraction of clusters in peaks approaches
one-hundred percent for haloes with redshift z$\leq$0.5. Our analysis demonstrates that peak
statistics are an important tool for disentangling DE models by accurately tracing the structure
formation processes as a function of the cosmic time.
