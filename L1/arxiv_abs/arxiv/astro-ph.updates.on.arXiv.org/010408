X-ray substructures in clusters of galaxies provide indirect clues about the microphysical properties
of the intracluster medium (ICM), which are still not very well known. In order to investigate X-ray
substructures in detail, we studied archival $\sim$1~Msec Chandra data of the core of the Perseus
cluster, focusing on the substructures associated with the sloshing cold front. In the east half
of the cold front, we found a Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI) layer candidate. The measured
width-to-azimuthal extension ratio and the thermodynamic properties are all consistent with
it being a KHI layer currently developing along the sloshing cold front. We found a thermal pressure
deficit of the order of 10$^{-2}~\mathrm{keV~cm^{-3}}$ at the KHI layer. Assuming that turbulent
pressure fully supports the pressure deficit, we estimated the turbulent strength at several hundred
km~s$^{-1}$, which translates into the turbulent heating rate of $Q_\mathrm{turb}\sim 10^{-26}~\mathrm{erg~cm^{-3}~s^{-1}}$.
This value agrees within an order of magnitude with the previous estimation derived from the surface
brightness fluctuations, and can balance the radiative cooling at this radius. In the west half
of the cold front, we found feather-like structures which are similar to the structures observed
in recent numerical simulations of the gas sloshing of magnetized plasma. Their thermodynamic
properties are consistent with one of the feathers being a projected gas depletion layer induced
by the amplified magnetic field whose strength is $B\sim$30$~\mathrm{\mu G}$.
