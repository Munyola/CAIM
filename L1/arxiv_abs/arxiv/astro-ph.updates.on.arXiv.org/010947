We investigate the chemical segregation of complex O-bearing species (including the largest and
most complex ones detected to date in space) towards Orion KL, the closest high-mass star-forming
region. The molecular line images obtained using the ALMA science verification data reveal a clear
segregation of chemically related species depending on their different functional groups. We
map the emission of 13CH3OH, HCOOCH3, CH3OCH3, CH2OCH2, CH3COOCH3, HCOOCH2CH3, CH3CH2OCH3, HCOOH,
OHCH2CH2OH, CH3COOH, CH3CH2OH, CH3OCH2OH, OHCH2CHO, and CH3COCH3 with 1.5" angular resolution
and provide molecular abundances of these species toward different gas components of this region.
We disentangle the emission of these species in the different Orion components by carefully selecting
lines free of blending and opacity effects. Possible effects in the molecular spatial distribution
due to residual blendings and different excitation conditions are also addressed. We find that
while species containing the C-O-C group, i.e. an ether group, exhibit their peak emission and higher
abundance towards the compact ridge, the hot core south is the component where species containing
a hydroxyl group (-OH) bound to a carbon atom (C-O-H) present their emission peak and higher abundance.
This finding allows us to propose methoxy (CH3O-) and hydroxymethyl (-CH2OH) radicals as the major
drivers of the chemistry in the compact ridge and the hot core south, respectively, as well as different
evolutionary stages and prevailing physical processes in the different Orion components.
