A search for the progenitor of SN~2010jl, an unusually luminous core-collapse supernova of Type~IIn,
using pre-explosion {\it Hubble}/WFPC2 and {\it Spitzer}/IRAC images of the region, yielded upper
limits on the UV and near-infrared (IR) fluxes from any candidate star. These upper limits constrain
the luminosity and effective temperature of the progenitor, the mass of any preexisting dust in
its surrounding circumstellar medium (CSM), and dust proximity to the star. A {\it lower} limit
on the CSM dust mass is required to hide a luminous progenitor from detection by {\it Hubble}. {\it
Upper} limits on the CSM dust mass and constraints on its proximity to the star are set by requiring
that the absorbed and reradiated IR emission not exceed the IRAC upper limits. Using the combined
extinction-IR emission constraints we present viable $M_d-R_1$ combinations, where $M_d$ and
$R_1$ are the CSM dust mass and its inner radius. These depend on the CSM outer radius, dust composition
and grain size, and the properties of the progenitor. The results constrain the pre-supernova evolution
of the progenitor, and the nature and origin of the observed post-explosion IR emission from SN~2010jl.
In particular, an $\eta$~Car-type progenitor will require at least 4~mag of visual extinction
to avoid detection by the {\it Hubble}. This can be achieved with dust masses $\gtrsim 10^{-3}$~\msun\
(less than the estimated 0.2-0.5~\msun\ around $\eta$~Car) which must be located at distances
of $\gtrsim 10^{16}$~cm from the star to avoid detection by {\it Spitzer}.
