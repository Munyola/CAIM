The manifold theory of barred-spiral structure provides a dynamical mechanism explaining how
spiral arms beyond the ends of galactic bars can be supported by chaotic flows extending beyond the
bar's co-rotation zone. We discuss its applicability to N-body simulations of secularly evolving
barred galaxies. In these simulations, we observe consecutive `incidents' of spiral activity,
leading to a time-varying disc morphology. Besides disc self-excitations, we provide evidence
of a newly noted excitation mechanism related to the `off-centering' effect: particles ejected
in elongated orbits at major incidents cause the disc center-of-mass to recoil and be set in a wobble-type
orbit with respect to the halo center of mass. The time-dependent m=1 perturbation on the disc by
the above mechanism correlates with the excitation of new incidents of non-axisymmetric activity
beyond the bar. At every new excitation, the manifolds act as dynamical avenues attracting particles
which are directed far from corotation along chaotic orbits. The fact that the manifolds evolve
morphologically in time, due to varying non-axisymmetric perturbations, allows to reconcile
manifolds with the presence of multiple patterns and frequencies in the disc. We find a time-oscillating
pattern speed profile $\Omega_p(R)$ at distances R between the bar's corotation, at resonance
with the succession of minima and maxima of the non-axisymmetric activity beyond the bar. Finally,
we discuss disc thermalization, i.e., the evolution of the disc velocity dispersion profile and
its connection with disc responsiveness to manifold spirals.
