Pulsating thermal X-ray emission from millisecond pulsars can be used to obtain constraints on
the neutron star equation of state, but to date only five such sources have been identified. Of these
five millisecond pulsars, only two have well constrained neutron star masses, which improve the
determination of the radius via modelling of the X-ray waveform. We aim to find other millisecond
pulsars that already have well constrained mass and distance measurements that show pulsed thermal
X-ray emission in order to obtain tight constraints on the neutron star equation of state. The millisecond
pulsar PSR~J1909--3744 has an accurately determined mass, M = 1.54$\pm$0.03 M$_\odot$ (1 $\sigma$
error) and distance, D = 1.07$\pm$0.04 kpc. We analysed {\em XMM-Newton} data of this 2.95 ms pulsar
to identify the nature of the X-ray emission. We show that the X-ray emission from PSR~J1909--3744
appears to be dominated by thermal emission from the polar cap. Only a single component model is required
to fit the data. The black-body temperature of this emission is kT=0.26\ud{0.03}{0.02} keV and
we find a 0.2--10 keV un-absorbed flux of 1.1 $\times$ 10$^{-14}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ or an un-absorbed
luminosity of 1.5 $\times$ 10$^{30}$ erg s$^{-1}$. Thanks to the previously determined mass and
distance constraints of the neutron star PSR~J1909--3744, and its predominantly thermal emission,
deep observations of this object with future X-ray facilities should provide useful constraints
on the neutron star equation of state.
