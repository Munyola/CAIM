We present the results of N-body simulations in which we take the masses, positions and velocities
of sink particles from five pairs of hydrodynamical simulations of star formation by Dale et al.
(2012, 2013) and evolve them for a further 10Myr. We compare the dynamical evolution of star clusters
that formed under the influence of mass-loss driven by photoionization feedback, to the evolution
of clusters that formed without feedback. We remove any remaining gas and follow the evolution of
structure in the clusters (measured by the Q-parameter), half-mass radius, central density, surface
density and the fraction of bound stars. There is little discernible difference in the evolution
of clusters that formed with feedback compared to those that formed without. The only clear trend
is that all clusters which form without feedback in the hydrodynamical simulations lose any initial
structure over 10Myr, whereas some of the clusters which form with feedback retain structure for
the duration of the subsequent N-body simulation. This is due to lower initial densities (and hence
longer relaxation times) in the clusters from Dale et al. (2012, 2013) which formed with feedback,
which prevents dynamical mixing from erasing substructure. However, several other conditions
(such as supervirial initial velocities) also preserve substructure, so at a given epoch one would
require knowledge of the initial density and virial state of the cluster in order to determine whether
star formation in a cluster has been strongly influenced by feedback.
