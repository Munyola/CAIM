The non-detection of companion stars in Type Ia supernova (SN) progenitor systems lends support
to the notion of double-degenerate (DD) systems and explosions triggered by the merging of two white
dwarfs. This very asymmetric process should lead to a conspicuous polarimetric signature. By contrast,
observations consistently find very low continuum polarization as the signatures from the explosion
process largely dominate over the pre-explosion configuration within several days. Critical
information about the interaction of the ejecta with a companion and any circumstellar matter is
encoded in the early polarization spectra. In this study, we obtain spectropolarimetry of SN\,2018gv
with the ESO Very Large Telescope at $-$13.6 days relative to the $B-$band maximum light, or $\sim$5
days after the estimated explosion --- the earliest spectropolarimetric observations to date
of any Type Ia SN. These early observations still show a low continuum polarization ($\lesssim$0.2\%)
and moderate line polarization (0.30$\pm$0.04\% for the prominent \ion{Si}{2} $\lambda$6355
feature and 0.85$\pm$0.04\% for the high-velocity Ca component). The high degree of spherical
symmetry implied by the low line and continuum polarization at this early epoch is consistent with
explosion models of delayed detonations and is inconsistent with the merger-induced explosion
scenario. The dense UV and optical photometry and optical spectroscopy within the first $\sim$100
days after the maximum light indicate that SN\,2018gv is a normal Type Ia SN with similar spectrophotometric
behavior to SN\,2011fe.
