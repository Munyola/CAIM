We present and apply a method to infer the mass of the Milky Way (MW) by comparing the dynamics of MW
satellites to those of model satellites in the EAGLE cosmological hydrodynamics simulations.
A distribution function (DF) for galactic satellites is constructed from EAGLE using specific
angular momentum and specific energy, which are scaled so as to be independent of host halo mass.
In this 2-dimensional space, the orbital properties of satellite galaxies vary according to the
host halo mass. The halo mass can be inferred by calculating the likelihood that the observed satellite
population is drawn from this DF. Our method is robustly calibrated on mock EAGLE systems. We validate
it by applying it to the completely independent suite of 30 AURIGA high-resolution simulations
of MW-like galaxies: the method accurately recovers their true mass and associated uncertainties.
We then apply it to ten classical satellites of the MW with 6D phase-space measurements, including
updated proper motions from the GAIA satellite. The mass of the MW is estimated to be $M_{200}^{\textnormal{MW}}=1.17_{-0.15}^{+0.21}\times10^{12}M_{\odot}$
(68\% confidence limits). We combine our total mass estimate with recent mass estimates in the inner
regions of the Galaxy to infer an inner dark matter (DM) mass fraction $M^\textnormal{DM}(<20~\rm{kpc})/M^\textnormal{DM}_{200}=0.12$
which is typical of ${\sim}10^{12}M_{\odot}$ $\Lambda$CDM haloes in hydrodynamical galaxy formation
simulations. Assuming an NFW profile, this is equivalent to a halo concentration of $c_{200}^{\textnormal{MW}}=10.9^{+2.6}_{-2.0}$.
