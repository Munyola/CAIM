Since the advent of CoRoT, and NASA Kepler and K2, the number of low- and intermediate-mass stars
classified as pulsators has increased very rapidly with time, now accounting for several $10^4$
targets. With the recent launch of NASA TESS space mission, we have confirmed our entrance to the
era of all-sky observations of oscillating stars. TESS is currently releasing good quality datasets
that already allow for the characterization and identification of individual oscillation modes
even from single 27-days shots on some stars. When ESA PLATO will become operative by the next decade,
we will face the observation of several more hundred thousands stars where identifying individual
oscillation modes will be possible. However, estimating the individual frequency, amplitude,
and lifetime of the oscillation modes is not an easy task. This is because solar-like oscillations
and especially their evolved version, the red giant branch (RGB) oscillations, can vary significantly
from one star to another depending on its specific stage of the evolution, mass, effective temperature,
metallicity, as well as on its level of rotation and magnetism. In this perspective I will present
a novel, fast, and powerful way to derive individual oscillation mode frequencies by building on
previous results obtained with \diamonds. I will show that the oscillation frequencies obtained
with this new approach can reach precisions of about 0.1 % and accuracies of about 0.01 % when compared
to published literature values for the RGB star KIC~12008916.
