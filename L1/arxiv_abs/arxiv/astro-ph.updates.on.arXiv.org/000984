We model nanoflare heating of extrapolated active-region coronal loops via the acceleration of
electrons and protons in Harris-type current sheets. The kinetic energy of the accelerated particles
is estimated using semi-analytical and test-particle-tracing approaches. Vector magnetograms
and photospheric Doppler velocity maps of NOAA active region 09114, recorded by the Imaging Vector
Magnetograph (IVM), were used for this analysis. A current-free field extrapolation of the active-region
corona was first constructed. The corresponding Poynting fluxes at the footpoints of 5000 extrapolated
coronal loops were then calculated. Assuming that reconnecting current sheets develop along these
loops, we utilized previous results to estimate the kinetic-energy gain of the accelerated particles
and we related this energy to nanoflare heating and macroscopic loop characteristics. Kinetic
energies of 0.1 to 8 keV (for electrons) and 0.3 to 470 keV (for protons) were found to cause heating
rates ranging from $10^{-6}$ to 1 $\mathrm{erg\, s^{-1} cm^{-3}}$. Hydrodynamic simulations
show that such heating rates can sustain plasma in coronal conditions inside the loops and generate
plasma thermal distributions which are consistent with active region observations. We concluded
the analysis by computing the form of X-ray spectra generated by the accelerated electrons using
the thick target approach that were found to be in agreement with observed X-ray spectra, thus supporting
the plausibility of our nanoflare-heating scenario.
