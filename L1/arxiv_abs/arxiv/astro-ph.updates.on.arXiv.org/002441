We present a comprehensive study of star formation toward the H II region S155. Star-formation activities
therein were investigated based on multi-wavelength data from optical to the far-infrared. The
surface density distribution of selected 2MASS sources toward S155 indicates the existence of
a compact cluster, which is spatially consistent with the position of the exciting source of the
H II region, HD 217086. A sample of more than 200 excessive emission sources in the infrared were selected
based on their 2MASS color indices. The spatial distribution of the sample sources reveals the existence
of three young sub-clusters in this region, among which, sub-cluster A is spatially coincident
with the bright rim of the H II region. In addition, photometric data from the WISE survey were used
to identify and classify young stellar objects (YSOs). To further explore the evolutionary stages
of the candidate YSOs, we fit the spectral energy distribution (SEDs) of 44 sources, which led to
the identification of 14 Class I, 27 Class II, and 3 Class III YSOs. The spatial distribution of the
classified YSOs at different evolutionary stages presents a spatio-temporal gradient, which
is consistent with a scenario of sequential star formation. On the other hand, Herschel PACS observations
toward the interface between S155 and the ambient molecular cloud disclose an arc-shaped dust layer,
the origin of which could be attributed to the UV dissipation from the early type stars e.g. HD 217061
in S155. Four dusty cores were revealed by the Herschel data, which hints for new generations of star
formation.
