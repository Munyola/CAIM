Upcoming weak lensing surveys require a detailed theoretical understanding of the matter power
spectrum in order to derive accurate and precise cosmological parameter values. While galaxy formation
is known to play an important role, its precise effects are currently unknown. We present a set of
92 matter power spectra from the OWLS, cosmo-OWLS and BAHAMAS simulation suites, including different
$\Lambda$CDM cosmologies, neutrino masses, subgrid prescriptions and AGN feedback strengths.
We conduct a detailed investigation of the dependence of the relative difference between the total
matter power spectra in hydrodynamical and collisionless simulations on the effectiveness of
stellar and AGN feedback, cosmology and redshift. The strength of AGN feedback can greatly affect
the power on a range of scales, while a lack of stellar feedback can greatly increase the effectiveness
of AGN feedback on large scales. We also examine differences in the initial conditions of hydrodynamic
and N-body simulations that can lead to a ~1% discrepancy in the large-scale power, and furthermore
show our results to be insensitive to cosmic variance. We present an empirical model capable of predicting
the effect of galaxy formation on the matter power spectrum at z=0 to within 1% for k<1 h/Mpc, given
only the mean baryon fraction in galaxy groups. Differences in group baryon fractions can also explain
the quantitative disagreement between predictions from the literature. All total and dark matter
only power spectra in this library will be made publicly available at powerlib.strw.leidenuniv.nl.
