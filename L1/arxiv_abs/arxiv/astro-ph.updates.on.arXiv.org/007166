We present timing solutions for ten pulsars discovered in 350 MHz searches with the Green Bank Telescope.
Nine of these were discovered in the Green Bank Northern Celestial Cap survey and one was discovered
by students in the Pulsar Search Collaboratory program in analysis of drift-scan data. Following
discovery and confirmation with the Green Bank Telescope, timing has yielded phase-connected
solutions with high precision measurements of rotational and astrometric parameters. Eight of
the pulsars are slow and isolated, including PSR J0930$-$2301, a pulsar with nulling fraction lower
limit of $\sim$30\% and nulling timescale of seconds to minutes. This pulsar also shows evidence
of mode changing. The remaining two pulsars have undergone recycling, accreting material from
binary companions, resulting in higher spin frequencies. PSR J0557$-$2948 is an isolated, 44 \rm{ms}
pulsar that has been partially recycled and is likely a former member of a binary system which was
disrupted by a second supernova. The paucity of such so-called `disrupted binary pulsars' (DRPs)
compared to double neutron star (DNS) binaries can be used to test current evolutionary scenarios,
especially the kicks imparted on the neutron stars in the second supernova. There is some evidence
that DRPs have larger space velocities, which could explain their small numbers. PSR J1806+2819
is a 15 \rm{ms} pulsar in a 44 day orbit with a low mass white dwarf companion. We did not detect the companion
in archival optical data, indicating that it must be older than 1200 Myr.
