Strongly magnetized isolated neutron stars (NSs) are categorized into two families, according
mainly to their magnetic field strength. The one with a higher magnetic field of $10^{14}$ - $10^{15}$
G is called magnetar, characterized with repeated short bursts, and the other is X-ray isolated
neutron star (XINS) with $10^{13}$ G. Both magnetars and XINSs show thermal emission in X-rays,
but it has been considered that the thermal spectrum of magnetars is reproduced with a two-temperature
blackbody (2BB), while that of XINSs shows only a single-temperature blackbody (1BB) and the temperature
is lower than that of magnetars. On the basis of the magnetic field and temperature, it is often speculated
that XINSs may be old and cooled magnetars. Here we report that all the seven known XINSs show a high-energy
component in addition to the 1BB model. Analyzing all the XMM-Newton data of the XINSs with the highest
statistics ever achieved, we find that their X-ray spectra are all reproduced with a 2BB model, similar
to magnetars. Their emission radii and temperature ratios are also similar to those of magnetars
except for two XINSs, which show significantly smaller radii than the others. The remarkable similarity
in the X-ray spectra between XINSs and magnetars suggests that their origins of the emission are
also the same. The lower temperature in XINSs can be explained if XINSs are older than magnetars.
Therefore, these results are the observational indication that supports the standard hypothesis
on the classification of highly-magnetized NSs.
