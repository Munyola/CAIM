A dynamo mechanism driven by differential rotation when stars merge has been proposed to explain
the presence of strong fields in certain classes of magnetic stars. In the case of the high field magnetic
white dwarfs (HFMWDs), the site of the differential rotation has been variously thought to be the
common envelope, the hot outer regions of a merged degenerate core or an accretion disc formed by
a tidally disrupted companion that is subsequently accreted by a degenerate core. We have shown
previously that the observed incidence of magnetism and the mass distribution in HFMWDs are consistent
with the hypothesis that they are the result of merging binaries during common envelope evolution.
Here we calculate the magnetic field strengths generated by common envelope interactions for synthetic
populations using a simple prescription for the generation of fields and find that the observed
magnetic field distribution is also consistent with the stellar merging hypothesis. We use the
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to study the correlation between the calculated and the observed field
strengths and find that it is consistent for low envelope ejection efficiency. We also suggest that
field generation by the plunging of a giant gaseous planet on to a white dwarf may explain why magnetism
among cool white dwarfs (including DZ white dwarfs) is higher than among hot white dwarfs. In this
picture a super Jupiter residing in the outer regions of the planetary system of the white dwarf is
perturbed into a highly eccentric orbit by a close stellar encounter and is later accreted by the
white dwarf.
