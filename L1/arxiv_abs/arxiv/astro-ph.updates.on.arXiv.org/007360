VANDELS is a uniquely-deep spectroscopic survey of high-redshift galaxies with the VIMOS spectrograph
on ESO's Very Large Telescope (VLT). The survey has obtained ultra-deep optical (0.48 < lambda <
1.0 micron) spectroscopy of ~2100 galaxies within the redshift interval 1.0 < z < 7.0, over a total
area of ~0.2 sq. degrees centred on the CANDELS UDS and CDFS fields. Based on accurate photometric
redshift pre-selection, 85% of the galaxies targeted by VANDELS were selected to be at z>=3. Exploiting
the red sensitivity of the refurbished VIMOS spectrograph, the fundamental aim of the survey is
to provide the high signal-to-noise ratio spectra necessary to measure key physical properties
such as stellar population ages, masses, metallicities and outflow velocities from detailed absorption-line
studies. Using integration times calculated to produce an approximately constant signal-to-noise
ratio (20 < t_int < 80 hours), the VANDELS survey targeted: a) bright star-forming galaxies at 2.4
< z < 5.5, b) massive quiescent galaxies at 1.0 < z < 2.5, c) fainter star-forming galaxies at 3.0 < z
< 7.0 and d) X-ray/Spitzer-selected active galactic nuclei and Herschel-detected galaxies. By
targeting two extragalactic survey fields with superb multi-wavelength imaging data, VANDELS
will produce a unique legacy data set for exploring the physics underpinning high-redshift galaxy
evolution. In this paper we provide an overview of the VANDELS survey designed to support the science
exploitation of the first ESO public data release, focusing on the scientific motivation, survey
design and target selection.
