We present photometric and spectroscopic analysis of the peculiar core-collapse SN 2013gc, spanning
seven years of observations. The light curve shows an early maximum followed by a fast decline and
a phase of almost constant luminosity. At +200 days from maximum, a brightening of 1 mag is observed
in all bands, followed by a steep linear luminosity decline after +300 d. In archival images taken
between 1.5 and 2.5 years before the explosion, a weak source is visible at the supernova location,
with mag$\approx$20. The early supernova spectra show Balmer lines, with a narrow ($\sim$560 km
s$^{-1}$) P-Cygni absorption superimposed on a broad ($\sim$3400 km s$^{-1}$) component, typical
of type IIn events. Through a comparison of colour curves, absolute light curves and spectra of SN
2013gc with a sample of supernovae IIn, we conclude that SN 2013gc is a member of the so-called type
IId subgroup. The complex profile of the H$\alpha$ line suggests a composite circumstellar medium
geometry, with a combination of lower velocity, spherically symmetric gas and a more rapidly expanding
bilobed feature. This circumstellar medium distribution has been likely formed through major
mass-loss events, that we directly observed from 3 years before the explosion. The modest luminosity
($M_I\sim-16.5$ near maximum) of SN 2013gc at all phases, the very small amount of ejected $^{56}$Ni
(of the order of $10^{-3}$ M$_\odot$), the major pre-supernova stellar activity and the lack of
prominent [O I] lines in late-time spectra support a fall-back core-collapse scenario for the massive
progenitor of SN~2013gc.
