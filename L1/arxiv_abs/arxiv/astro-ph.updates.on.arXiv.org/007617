Using a sample of 472 local Universe (z<0.06) galaxies in the stellar mass range 10.25 < log M*/M_sun
< 10.75, we explore the variation in galaxy structure as a function of morphology and galaxy colour.
Our sample of galaxies is sub-divided into red, green and blue colour groups and into elliptical
and non-elliptical (disk-type) morphologies. Using KiDS and VIKING derived postage stamp images,
a group of eight volunteers visually classified bars, rings, morphological lenses, tidal streams,
shells and signs of merger activity for all systems. We find a significant surplus of rings ($2.3\sigma$)
and lenses ($2.9\sigma$) in disk-type galaxies as they transition across the green valley. Combined,
this implies a joint ring/lens green valley surplus significance of $3.3\sigma$ relative to equivalent
disk-types within either the blue cloud or the red sequence. We recover a bar fraction of ~44% which
remains flat with colour, however, we find that the presence of a bar acts to modulate the incidence
of rings and (to a lesser extent) lenses, with rings in barred disk-type galaxies more common by ~20-30
percentage points relative to their unbarred counterparts, regardless of colour. Additionally,
green valley disk-type galaxies with a bar exhibit a significant $3.0\sigma$ surplus of lenses
relative to their blue/red analogues. The existence of such structures rules out violent transformative
events as the primary end-of-life evolutionary mechanism, with a more passive scenario the favoured
candidate for the majority of galaxies rapidly transitioning across the green valley.
