We present a comprehensive timing and spectral studies of Be/X-ray binary pulsar EXO 2030+375 using
extensive Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer observations from 1995 till 2011, covering numerous Type
I and 2006 Type II outbursts. Pulse profiles of the pulsar were found to be strongly luminosity dependent.
At low luminosity, the pulse profile consisted of a main peak and a minor peak that evolved into a broad
structure at high luminosity with a significant phase shift. A narrow and sharp absorption dip,
also dependent on energy and luminosity, was detected in the pulse profile. Comparison of pulse
profiles showed that the features at a particular luminosity are independent of type of X-ray outbursts.
This indicates that the emission geometry is solely a function of mass accretion rate. The broadband
energy spectrum was described with a partial covering high energy cutoff model as well as a physical
model based on thermal and bulk Comptonization in accretion column. We did not find any signature
of cyclotron resonance scattering feature in the spectra obtained from all the observations. A
detailed analysis of spectral parameters showed that, depending on source luminosity, the power-law
photon index was distributed in three distinct regions. It suggests the phases of spectral transition
from sub-critical to super-critical regimes in the pulsar as proposed theoretically. A region
with constant photon index was also observed in ~(2-4) x 10^37 erg/s range, indicating critical
luminosity regime in EXO 2030+375.
