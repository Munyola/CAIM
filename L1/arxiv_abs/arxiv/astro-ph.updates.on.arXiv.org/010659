We present radiation hydrodynamic simulations in which binary planets form by close encounters
in a system of several super-Earth embryos. The embryos are embedded in a protoplanetary disk consisting
of gas and pebbles and evolve in a region where the disk structure supports convergent migration
due to Type I torques. As the embryos accrete pebbles, they become heated and thus affected by the
thermal torque (Ben\'{i}tez-Llambay et al. 2015) and the hot-trail effect (Chrenko et al. 2017)
which excites orbital eccentricities. Motivated by findings of Eklund & Masset (2017), we assume
the hot-trail effect operates also vertically and reduces the efficiency of inclination damping.
Non-zero inclinations allow the embryos to become closely packed and also vertically stirred within
the convergence zone. Subsequently, close encounters of two embryos assisted by the disk gravity
can form transient binary planets which quickly dissolve. Binary planets with a longer lifetime
$\sim$$10^{4}$ yr form in 3-body interactions of a transient pair with one of the remaining embryos.
The separation of binary components generally decreases in subsequent encounters and due to pebble
accretion until the binary merges, forming a giant planet core. We provide an order-of-magnitude
estimate of the expected occurrence rate of binary planets, yielding one binary planet per $\simeq$$2$--$5\times10^{4}$
planetary systems. Therefore, although rare, the binary planets may exist in exoplanetary systems
and they should be systematically searched for.
