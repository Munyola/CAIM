Imaging the immediate vicinity of supermassive black holes (SMBH) and extracting a BH-spin signature
is one of the grand challenges in astrophysics. M87 is known as one of the best targets for imaging
the BH shadow and it can be partially thick against synchrotron self-absorption (SSA), particularly
in a flaring state with high mass accretion rate. However, little is known about influences of the
SSA-thick region on BH shadow images. Here we investigate BH shadow images of M87 at 230 GHz properly
taking into account the SSA-thick region. When the BH has a high spin value, the corresponding BH
shadow image shows the positional offset between the center of the photon ring and that of the SSA-thick
ring at the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) due to the frame-dragging effect in the Kerr spacetime.
As a result, we find that a dark-crescent structure is generally produced between the photon ring
and the SSA-thick ISCO ring in the BH shadow image. The scale size of the dark-crescent increase with
BH spin: its width reaches up to $\sim 2$ gravitational radius when the BH spin is 99.8% of its maximum
value. The dark crescent is regarded as a new signature of a highly spinning BH. This feature is expected
to appear in flaring states with relatively high mass accretion rate rather than the quiescent states.
We have simulated the image reconstruction of our theoretical image by assuming the current and
future Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) array, and have found that the future EHT including space-very
long baseline interferometry in 2020s can detect the dark crescent.
