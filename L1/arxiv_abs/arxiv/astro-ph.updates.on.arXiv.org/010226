In this work we focus on a group of Galactic double neutron star (DNS) systems with long orbital periods
of $ \gtrsim 1$ day and low eccentricities of $\lesssim 0.4$. The feature of these orbital parameters
is used to constrain the evolutionary processes of progenitor binaries and the supernova (SN) kicks
of the second born NSs. Adopting that the mass transfer during primordial binary evolution is highly
non-conservative (rotation-dependent), the formation of DNS systems involves a double helium
star binary phase, the common envelope (CE) evolution initiates before the first NS formation.
During the CE evolution the binary orbital energy is obviously larger when using a helium star rather
than a NS to expel the donor envelope, this can help explain the formation of DNS systems with long
periods. SN kicks at NS birth can lead to eccentric orbits and even the disruption of binary systems,
the low eccentricities require that the DNSs receive a small natal kick at the second collapse. Compared
with the overall distribution of orbital parameters for observed DNS binaries, we propose that
the second born NSs in most DNS systems are subject to small natal kicks with the Maxwellian dispersion
velocity of less than $ 80 \,\rm km\,s^{-1} $, which can provide some constraints on the SN explosion
processes. The mass distribution of DNS binaries is also briefly discussed. We suggest that the
rotation-dependent mass transfer mode and our results about SN kicks should be applied to massive
binary evolution and population synthesis studies.
