We present a detailed Monte Carlo model of observational errors in observed galaxy scaling relations
to recover the intrinsic (cosmic) scatter driven by galaxy formation and evolution processes.
We apply our method to the stellar radial acceleration relation (RAR) which compares the local observed
radial acceleration to the local Newtonian radial acceleration computed from the stellar mass
distribution. The stellar and baryonic RAR are known to exhibit similar scatter. Lelli+2017 (L17)
studied the baryonic RAR using a sample of 153 spiral galaxies and inferred a negligible intrinsic
scatter. If true, a small scatter might challenge the LCDM galaxy formation paradigm, possibly
favoring a modified Newtonian dynamics interpretation. The intrinsic scatter of the baryonic
RAR is predicted by modern LCDM simulations to be ~0.06-0.08 dex, contrasting with the null value
reported by L17. We have assembled a catalog of structural properties with over 2500 spiral galaxies
from six deep imaging and spectroscopic surveys (called the "Photometry and Rotation curve OBservations
from Extragalactic Surveys") to quantify the intrinsic scatter of the stellar RAR and other scaling
relations. The stellar RAR for our full sample has a median observed scatter of 0.17 dex. We use our
Monte Carlo method, which accounts for all major sources of measurement uncertainty, to infer a
contribution of 0.12 dex from the observational errors. The intrinsic scatter of the stellar RAR
is thus estimated to be 0.11$\pm$0.02 dex, in agreement with, though slightly greater than, current
LCDM predictions.
