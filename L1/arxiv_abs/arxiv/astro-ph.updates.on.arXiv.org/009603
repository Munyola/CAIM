Synthesis imaging of the black hole in the center of the Milky Way, Sgr A*, with the Event Horizon Telescope
(EHT) rests on the assumption of a stationary image. We explore the limitations of this assumption
using high-cadence GRMHD simulations of Sgr A*. We employ analytic models that capture the basic
characteristics of the images to understand the origin of the variability in the simulated visibility
amplitudes. We find that, in all simulations, the visibility amplitudes for baselines oriented
perpendicular to the spin axis of the black hole typically decrease smoothly over baseline lengths
that are comparable to those of the EHT. On the other hand, the visibility amplitudes for baselines
oriented parallel to the spin axis show significant structure with one or more minima. This suggests
that fitting EHT observations with geometric models will lead to reasonably accurate determination
of the orientation of the black-hole on the plane of the sky. However, in the disk-dominated models,
the locations and depths of the minima in the visibility amplitudes depend primarily on the width
and asymmetry of the crescent-like images and are highly variable. In the jet-dominated models,
the locations of the minima are determined by the separation of the two image components but their
depths depend primarily on the relative brightness of the two components and are also variable.
This suggests that using time-independent models to infer additional black-hole parameters,
such as the shadow size or the spin magnitude, will be severely affected by the variability of the
accretion flow.
