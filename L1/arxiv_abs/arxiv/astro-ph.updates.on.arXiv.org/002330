We present new astrometry for the young (12-21 Myr) exoplanet beta Pictoris b taken with the Gemini/NICI,
Magellan/MagAO+Clio2, and Magellan/MagAO+VisAO instruments between 2009 and 2012. The high
dynamic range of our observations allows us to measure the relative position of beta Pic b with respect
to its primary star with greater accuracy than previous observations. Based on a Markov Chain Monte
Carlo analysis, we find the planet has an orbital semi-major axis of 9.2 [+8.3, -0.5] AU and orbital
eccentricity <0.15 at 68% confidence (with 95% confidence intervals of 8.2-72.3 AU and 0.00-0.88
for semi-major axis and eccentricity, respectively). We find that the planet has reached its maximum
projected elongation, enabling higher precision determination of the orbital parameters than
previously possible, and that the planet's projected separation is currently decreasing. With
unsaturated data of the entire beta Pic system (primary star, planet, and disk) obtained thanks
to NICI's semi-transparent focal plane mask, we are able to tightly constrain the relative orientation
of the circumstellar components. We find the orbital plane of the planet lies between the inner and
outer disks but closer to the inner (warped) disk: the position angle (PA) of nodes (211.8 +/- 0.3
degrees) is 6-sigma greater than the PA of the spine of the outer disk and 1.8-sigma less than the warped
inner disk PA. Finally, for the first time we are able to dynamically constrain the mass of the primary
star beta Pic to 1.7 +/- 0.3 M_sun.
