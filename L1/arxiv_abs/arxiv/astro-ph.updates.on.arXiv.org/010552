One of the biggest successes of the Cassini mission is the detection of small moons (moonlets) embedded
in Saturn's rings which cause S-shaped density structures in their close vicinity, called propellers
(Spahn and Sremcevic 2000; Tiscareno et al. 2006; Sremcevic et al. 2007). Here, we present isothermal
hydrodynamic simulations of moonlet-induced propellers in Saturn's A ring which denote a further
development of the original model (Spahn and Sremcevic 2000). We find excellent agreement between
these new hydrodynamic and corresponding N-body simulations. Furthermore, the hydrodynamic
simulations confirm the predicted scaling laws (Spahn and Sremcevic 2000) and the analytical solution
for the density in the propeller gaps (Sremcevic et al. 2002). Finally, this mean field approach
allows us to simulate the pattern of the giant propeller Bleriot, which is too large to be modeled
by direct N-body simulations. Our results are compared to two stellar occultation observations
by the Cassini Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrometer (UVIS), that intersect the propeller Bleriot.
Best fits to the UVIS optical depth profiles are achieved for a Hill radius of 590 m, which implies
a moonlet diameter of about 860 m. Furthermore, the model favours a kinematic shear viscosity of
the surrounding ring material of $\nu_0 = 340$ cm^2/s, a dispersion velocity in the range of 0.3 cm/s
$< c_0 <$ 1.5 cm/s, and a fairly high bulk viscosity $7 < \xi_0/\nu_0 < 17$. These large transport values
might be overestimated by our isothermal ring model and should be reviewed by an extended model including
thermal fluctuations.
