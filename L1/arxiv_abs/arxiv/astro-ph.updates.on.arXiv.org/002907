Massive early-type galaxies represent the modern-day remnants of the earliest major star formation
episodes in the history of the universe. These galaxies are central to our understanding of the evolution
of cosmic structure, stellar populations, and supermassive black holes, but the details of their
complex formation histories remain uncertain. To address this situation, we have initiated the
MASSIVE Survey, a volume-limited, multi-wavelength, integral-field spectroscopic (IFS) and
photometric survey of the structure and dynamics of the ~100 most massive early-type galaxies within
a distance of 108 Mpc. This survey probes a stellar mass range M* > 10^{11.5} Msun and diverse galaxy
environments that have not been systematically studied to date. Our wide-field IFS data cover ~two
effective radii of individual galaxies, and for a subset of them, we are acquiring additional IFS
observations on sub-arcsecond scales with adaptive optics. Dynamical orbit modeling of the combined
data will allow us to simultaneously determine the stellar, black hole, and dark matter halo masses.
The goals of the project are to constrain the black hole scaling relations at high masses, investigate
systematically the stellar initial mass function and dark matter distribution in massive galaxies,
and probe the late-time assembly of ellipticals through stellar population and kinematical gradients.
In the present work, we describe the MASSIVE sample selection, discuss the structural and environmental
properties of the selected galaxies, and provide an overview of our basic observational program
and science goals.
