High redshift blazars are an important class of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) that can provide an
independent estimate of the supermassive black-hole mass function in high redshift radio-loud
AGN without the bias due to absorption along the line-of-sight. Using the Cosmic Lens All Sky Survey
(CLASS) we built a complete radio flux-limited sample of high redshift (z>4) blazars suitable for
statistical studies. By combining dedicated optical observations and the SDSS spectroscopic
database, we obtained a sample of 26 blazar candidates with a spectroscopic redshift above 4. On
the basis of their radio spectrum we distinguish between blazars and QSO with a Gigahertz Peaked
Spectrum (GPS) like spectrum. Out of the 18 confirmed blazars 14 constitute a completely identified,
flux-limited sample down to a magnitude of 21 (AB). Using this complete sample we derive a space density
of blazars with 4<z<5.5 of rho=0.13 (+0.05,-0.03) Gpc^-3. This is the first actual estimate of the
blazar space density in this range of redshift. This value is in good agreement with the extrapolation
of the luminosity function and cosmological evolution based on a sample of flat-spectrum radio
quasars selected at lower redshifts and it is consistent with a cosmological evolution peaking
at z$\sim$2 similar to radio-quiet QSO. We do not confirm, instead, the presence of a peak at z~4 in
the space density evolution, recently suggested using an X-ray selected sample of blazars. It is
possible that this extreme peak of the evolution is present only among the most luminous blazars.
