We investigate the interplay between jets from Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) and the surrounding
InterStellar Medium (ISM) through full 3D, high resolution, Adaptive Mesh Refinement simulations
performed with the FLASH code. We follow the jet- ISM system for several Myr in its transition from
an early, compact source to an extended one including a large cocoon. During the jet evolution, we
identify three major evolutionary stages and we find that, contrary to the prediction of popular
theoretical models, none of the simulations shows a self-similar behavior. We also follow the evolution
of the energy budget, and find that the fraction of input power deposited into the ISM (the AGN coupling
constant) is of order of a few percent during the first few Myr. This is in broad agreement with galaxy
formation models employing AGN feedback. However, we find that in these early stages, this energy
is deposited only in a small fraction (< 1%) of the total ISM volume. Finally we demonstrate the
relevance of backflows arising within the extended cocoon generated by a relativistic AGN jet within
the ISM of its host galaxy, previously proposed as a mechanism for self-regulating the gas accretion
onto the central object. These backflows tend later to be destabilized by the 3D dynamics, rather
than by hydrodynamic (Kelvin- Helmholtz) instabilities. Yet, in the first few hundred thousand
years, backflows may create a central accretion region of significant extent, and convey there
as much as a few millions of solar masses.
