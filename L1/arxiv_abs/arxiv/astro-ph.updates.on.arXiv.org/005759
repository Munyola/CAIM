We present intensity-corrected Herschel maps at 100 um, 160 um, 250 um, 350 um, and 500 um for 56 isolated
low-mass clouds. We determine the zero-point corrections for Herschel PACS and SPIRE maps from
the Herschel Science Archive (HSA) using Planck data. Since these HSA maps are small, we cannot correct
them using typical methods. Here, we introduce a technique to measure the zero-point corrections
for small Herschel maps. We use radial profiles to identify offsets between the observed HSA intensities
and the expected intensities from Planck. Most clouds have reliable offset measurements with this
technique. In addition, we find that roughly half of the clouds have underestimated HSA-SPIRE intensities
in their outer envelopes relative to Planck, even though the HSA-SPIRE maps were previously zero-point
corrected. Using our technique, we produce corrected Herschel intensity maps for all 56 clouds
and determine their line-of-sight average dust temperatures and optical depths from modified
black body fits. The clouds have typical temperatures of ~ 14-20 K and optical depths of ~ 1e-5 - 1e-3.
Across the whole sample, we find an anti-correlation between temperature and optical depth. We
also find lower temperatures than what was measured in previous Herschel studies, which subtracted
out a background level from their intensity maps to circumvent the zero-point correction. Accurate
Herschel observations of clouds are key to obtain accurate density and temperature profiles. To
make such future analyses possible, intensity-corrected maps for all 56 clouds are publicly available
in the electronic version.
