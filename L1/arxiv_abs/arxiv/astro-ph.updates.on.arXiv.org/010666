Black hole (BH) spins in low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) show a great variety of values that can be
explained by accretion after BH birth. In contrast, the three presently measured BH spins in high-mass
X-ray binaries (HMXBs) show only values near the maximum and likely have another origin. We explore
here two possible scenarios to explain the high spins of BHs in HMXBs: formation in binaries that
undergo mass transfer (MT) during the main sequence (Case-A MT), and very close binaries undergoing
chemically homogeneous evolution (CHE). We find that both scenarios are able to produce high spin
BH if not too strong internal angular momentum transport (i.e., weak coupling) is assumed in the
progenitor star after its main-sequence evolution. If instead efficient angular momentum transport
is assumed, we find that the resulting BH spins are always too low with respect to observations. The
Case-A MT model provides a good fit for the BH spins, the masses of the two components, and the final
orbital periods for two of the three BHs in HMXBs with measured spins. For one of them, the mass predicted
for the BH companion is significantly lower than observed, but this depends strongly on the efficiency
of mass transfer. The CHE models predict too large orbital periods in the 3 cases considered here,
and we expect the Case-A MT to be much more frequent at the metallicities considered, so the Case-A
MT scenario is preferred. Finally, we predict that the stellar companions of HMXBs formed through
the Case-A MT have enhanced nitrogen surface abundances, which can be challenged by future observations.
