Supermassive black holes and/or very dense stellar clusters are found in the central regions of
galaxies. Nuclear star clusters are present mainly in faint galaxies while upermassive black holes
are common in galaxies with masses $\geq 10^{10}$ M$_\odot $. In the intermediate galactic mass
range both types of central massive objects (CMOs) are found. Here we present our collection of a
huge set of nuclear star cluster and massive black hole data that enlarges significantly already
existing data bases useful to investigate for correlations of their absolute magnitudes, velocity
dispersions and masses with structural parameters of their host galaxies. In particular, we directed
our attention to some differences between the correlations of nuclear star clusters and massive
black holes as subsets of CMOs with hosting galaxies. In this context, the mass-velocity dispersion
relation plays a relevant role because it seems the one that shows a clearer difference between the
supermassive black holes and nuclear star clusters. The $M_{MBH}-{\sigma}$ has a slope of $5.19\pm
0.28$ while $M_{NSC}-{\sigma}$ has the much smaller slope of $1.84\pm 0.64$. The slopes of the CMO
mass- host galaxy B magnitude of the two types of CMOs are indistinguishable within the errors while
that of the NSC mass-host galaxy mass relation is significantly smaller than for supermassive black
holes. Another important result is the clear depauperation of the NSC population in bright galaxy
hosts, which reflects also in a clear flattening of the NSC mass vs host galaxy mass at high host masses.
