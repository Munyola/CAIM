The $\Lambda$CDM model is reaching its limits. Current surveys do not point towards new physics,
which makes cosmologists wonder if we are `nearing the limit of all we can know about cosmology'.
However, the explored extensions of the $\Lambda$CDM model mostly include the evolution of $\Lambda$
but do not focus on its fixed spatial flatness. This paper shows that the spatial curvature can evolve
from initial flatness, predicted by inflation, towards negatively curved present-day universe.
The analysis is based on solving the Einstein equations under the approximation of the `silent universe'
with the code \textsl{simsilun} (GNU GPL software released with this paper). Using the Millennium
simulation to set up the initial conditions, and comparing the evolution of the silent universe
with the Millennium simulation it is found that the spatial curvature emerges due to nonlinear evolution
of comics structures. This results with a slightly lower value of matter density $\Omega_M$ and
a slightly higher value of the Hubble constant $H_0$ compared to the Millennium simulation. This
new extension of the $\Lambda$CDM model which is based on numerical relativistic cosmology allows
for emerging spatial curvature. This can resolve some tensions between the cosmological parameters,
which arise when one tries to fit a single spatially flat model to explain properties of the low-redshift
and high-redshift universe. This paper, therefore, points toward emerging spatial curvature
which can provide a way out from the cosmological cul-de-sac of the $\Lambda$CDM model.
