The fan-spine magnetic topology is believed to be responsible for many curious features in solar
explosive events. A spine field line links distinct flux domains, but direct observation of such
feature has been rare. Here we report a unique event observed by the Solar Dynamic Observatory where
a set of hot coronal loops (over 10 MK) connected to a quasi-circular chromospheric ribbon at one
end and a remote brightening at the other. Magnetic field extrapolation suggests these loops are
partly tracer of the evolving spine field line. Continuous slipping- and null-point-type reconnections
were likely at work, energizing the loop plasma and transferring magnetic flux within and across
the fan quasi-separatrix layer. We argue that the initial reconnection is of the "breakout" type,
which then transitioned to a more violent flare reconnection with an eruption from the fan dome.
Significant magnetic field changes are expected and indeed ensued. This event also features an
extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) late phase, i.e. a delayed secondary emission peak in warm EUV lines
(about 2-7 MK). We show that this peak comes from the cooling of large post-reconnection loops beside
and above the compact fan, a direct product of eruption in such topological settings. The long cooling
time of the large arcades contributes to the long delay; additional heating may also be required.
Our result demonstrates the critical nature of cross-scale magnetic coupling - topological change
in a sub-system may lead to explosions on a much larger scale.
