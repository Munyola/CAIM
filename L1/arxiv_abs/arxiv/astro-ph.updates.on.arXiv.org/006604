We present a large scale survey of CO outflows in the Gem OB1 molecular cloud complex and its surroundings
using the Purple Mountain Observatory Delingha 13.7 m telescope. A total of 198 outflow candidates
were identified over a large area ($\sim$ 58.5 square degrees), of which 193 are newly detected.
Approximately 68% (134/198) are associated with the Gem OB1 molecular cloud complex, including
clouds GGMC 1, GGMC 2, BFS 52, GGMC 3 and GGMC 4. Other regions studied are: Local Arm (Local Lynds,
West Front), Swallow, Horn, and Remote cloud. Outflow candidates in GGMC 1, BFS 52, and Swallow are
mainly located at ring-like or filamentary structures. To avoid excessive uncertainty in distant
regions ($\gtrsim$ 3.8 kpc), we only estimated the physical parameters for clouds in the Gem OB1
molecular cloud complex and in the Local arm. In those clouds, the total kinetic energy and the energy
injection rate of the identified outflow candidates are $\lesssim$ 1% and $\lesssim$ 3% of the turbulent
energy and the turbulent dissipation rate of each cloud, indicating that the identified outflow
candidates cannot provide enough energy to balance turbulence of their host cloud at the scale of
the entire cloud (several pc to dozens of pc). The gravitational binding energy of each cloud is $\gtrsim$
135 times the total kinetic energy of the identified outflow candidates within the corresponding
cloud, indicating that the identified outflow candidates cannot cause major disruptions to the
integrity of their host cloud at the scale of the entire cloud.
