The origin of cosmic magnetic fields is an unsolved problem and magnetogenesis could have occurred
in the early Universe. We study the evolution of such primordial magnetic fields across the cosmological
recombination epoch via 3D magnetohydrodynamic numerical simulations. We compute the effective
or net heating rate of baryons due to decaying magnetic fields and its dependence on the magnetic
field strength and spectral index. In the drag-dominated regime ($z \gtrsim 1500$), prior to recombination,
we find no real heating is produced. Our simulations allow us to smoothly trace a new transition regime
($600 \lesssim z \lesssim 1500$), where magnetic energy decays, at first, into the kinetic energy
of baryons. A turbulent velocity field is built up until it saturates, as the net heating rate rises
from a low value at recombination to its peak towards the end of the transition regime. This is followed
by a turbulent decay regime ($z \lesssim 600$) where magnetic energy dissipates via turbulent decay
of both magnetic and velocity fields while net heating remains appreciable and declines slowly.
Both the peak of the net heating rate and the onset of turbulent decay are delayed significantly beyond
recombination, by up to 0.5 Myr (until $z\simeq 600-700$), for scale-invariant magnetic fields.
We provide analytic approximations and present numerical results for a range of field strengths
and spectral indices, illustrating the redshift-dependence of dissipation and net heating rates.
These can be used to study cosmic microwave background constraints on primordial magnetic fields.
