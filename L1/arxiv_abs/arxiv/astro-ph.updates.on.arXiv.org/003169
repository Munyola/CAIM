We investigate the origin of carbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) stars starting from the recently
discovered $\rm [Fe/H]<-7.1$ star SMSS J031300 (Keller et al. 2014). We show that the elemental
abundances observed on the surface of SMSS J031300 can be well fit by the yields of faint, metal free,
supernovae. Using properly calibrated faint supernova explosion models, we study, for the first
time, the formation of dust grains in such carbon-rich, iron-poor supernova ejecta. Calculations
are performed assuming both unmixed and uniformly mixed ejecta and taking into account the partial
destruction by the supernova reverse shock. We find that, due to the paucity of refractory elements
beside carbon, amorphous carbon is the only grain species to form, with carbon condensation efficiencies
that range between (0.15-0.84), resulting in dust yields in the range (0.025-2.25)M$_{\odot}$.
We follow the collapse and fragmentation of a star forming cloud enriched by the products of these
faint supernova explosions and we explore the role played by fine structure line cooling and dust
cooling. We show that even if grain growth during the collapse has a minor effect of the dust-to-gas
ratio, due to C depletion into CO molecules at an early stage of the collapse, the formation of CEMP
low-mass stars, such as SMSS J031300, could be triggered by dust cooling and fragmentation. A comparison
between model predictions and observations of a sample of C-normal and C-rich metal-poor stars
supports the idea that a single common pathway may be responsible for the formation of the first low-mass
stars.
