We study the influence of the turbulent transport on ice chemistry in protoplanetary disks, focusing
on carbon and nitrogen bearing molecules. Chemical rate equations are solved with the diffusion
term, mimicking the turbulent mixing in the vertical direction. Turbulence can bring ice-coated
dust grains from the midplane to the warm irradiated disk surface, and the ice mantles are reprocessed
by photoreactions, thermal desorption, and surface reactions. The upward transport decreases
the abundance of methanol and ammonia ices at r < 30 AU, because warm dust temperature prohibits
their reformation on grain surfaces. This reprocessing could explain the smaller abundances of
carbon and nitrogen bearing molecules in cometary coma than those in low-mass protostellar envelopes.
We also show the effect of mixing on the synthesis of complex organic molecules (COMs) are two ways:
(1) transport of ices from the midplane to the disk surface and (2) transport of atomic hydrogen from
the surface to the midplane. The former enhances the COMs formation in the disk surface, while the
latter suppresses it in the midplane. Then, when mixing is strong, COMs are predominantly formed
in the disk surface, while their parent molecules are (re)formed in the midplane. This cycle expands
the COMs distribution both vertically and radially outward compared with that in the non-turbulent
model. We derive the timescale of the sink mechanism by which CO and N2 are converted to less volatile
molecules to be depleted from the gas phase, and find that the vertical mixing suppresses this mechanism
in the inner disks.
