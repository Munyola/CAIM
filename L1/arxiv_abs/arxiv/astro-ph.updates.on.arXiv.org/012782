On 2018 July 28, GRB 180728A triggered \textit{Swift} satellites and, soon after the determination
of the redshift, we identified this source as a type II binary-driven hypernova (BdHN II) in our model.
Consequently, we predicted the appearance time of its associated supernova (SN), which was later
confirmed as SN 2018fip. A BdHN II originates in a binary composed of a carbon-oxygen core (CO$_{\rm
core}$) undergoing SN, and the SN ejecta hypercritically accrete onto a companion neutron star
(NS). From the time of the SN shock breakout to the time when the hypercritical accretion starts,
we infer the binary separation $\simeq 3 \times 10^{10}$ cm. The accretion explains the prompt emission
of isotropic energy $\simeq 3 \times 10^{51}$ erg, lasting $\sim 10$ s, and the accompanying observed
blackbody emission from a thermal convective instability bubble. The new neutron star ($\nu$NS)
originating from the SN powers the late afterglow from which a $\nu$NS initial spin of $2.5$ ms is
inferred. We compare GRB 180728A with GRB 130427A, a type I binary-driven hypernova (BdHN I) with
isotropic energy $> 10^{54}$ erg. For GRB 130427A we have inferred an initially closer binary separation
of $\simeq 10^{10}$ cm, implying a higher accretion rate leading to the collapse of the NS companion
with consequent black hole formation, and a faster, $1$ ms spinning $\nu$NS. In both cases, the optical
spectra of the SNe are similar, and not correlated to the energy of the gamma-ray burst. We present
three-dimensional smoothed-particle-hydrodynamic simulations and visualisations of the BdHNe
I and II.
