In this work we derive state-of-the-art model-independent constraints on cosmology from SN Ia
by measuring purely kinematical $\left( q,j \right)$ model parameters (where $q$ and $j$ are related
to the first and second derivative of the Hubble parameter). For the JLA compilation of SN Ia an agreement
within 2$\sigma$ of $\Lambda$CDM expectations is found, where best-fitting kinematical parameters
are $q=-0.66 \pm 0.11$ and $j=0.41 ^{+0.32}_{-0.33}$. With $q=-0.73 \pm 0.13$ and $j=0.76 ^{+0.41}_{-0.43}$
the Pantheon sample shows even better agreement with the $\Lambda$CDM expectation of $j=1$ than
JLA, hinting at less systematics and/or a higher number of SN Ia alleviating tensions. For the future
we predict the precision achievable with SN Ia from the LSST deep survey as $\Delta q \sim 0.05$ and
$\Delta j \sim 0.1$, which is systematics-limited and could lead to detect both deviations from
$\Lambda$CDM (in $j$) or current expansion rates measured (in $q$). In comparison, for standard
cosmological parameters we get $\Delta \Omega_\mathrm{m}=0.01$ and $\Delta w=0.07$ for LSST.
Given the high number of SN Ia expected for LSST, kinematical parameters in up to 500 sky regions,
each with their own individual Hubble diagram, can be constrained. For each region an individual
precision at the 10s of percent level is within reach at current systematics-levels, comparable
to present-day full-sky surveys. This will determine anisotropy in cosmic expansion, or the dark
energy dipole, at the 10s of percent level at 10s of degree scales.
