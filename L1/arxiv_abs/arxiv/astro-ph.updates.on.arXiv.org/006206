Polarized emission is detected in two young nearly edge-on protostellar disks in 343 GHz continuum
at ~ 50 au (~ 0.12") resolution with Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. One disk is in
HH 212 (Class 0) and the other in HH 111 (early Class I) protostellar system. Polarization fraction
is ~ 1%. The disk in HH 212 has a radius of ~ 60 au. The emission is mainly detected from the nearside of
the disk. The polarization orientations are almost perpendicular to the disk major axis, consistent
with either self-scattering or emission by grains aligned with a poloidal field around the outer
edge of the disk because of optical depth effect and temperature gradient; the presence of a poloidal
field would facilitate the launching of a disk wind, for which there is already tentative evidence
in the same source. The disk of HH 111 VLA 1 has a larger radius of ~ 220 au and is thus more resolved. The
polarization orientations are almost perpendicular to the disk major axis in the nearside, but
more along the major axis in the farside, forming roughly half of an elliptical pattern there. It
appears that toroidal and poloidal magnetic field may explain the polarization on the near and far
side of the disk, respectively. However, it is also possible that the polarization is due to self-scattering.
In addition, alignment of dust grains by radiation flux may play a role in the farside. Our observations
reveal a diversity of disk polarization patterns that should be taken into account in future modeling
efforts.
