The abundance of deuterated molecules in a star-forming region is sensitive to the environment
in which they are formed. Deuteration fractions therefore provide a powerful tool for studying
the physical and chemical evolution of a star-forming system. While local low-mass star-forming
regions show very high deuteration ratios, much lower fractions are observed towards Orion and
the Galactic Centre. We derive methanol deuteration fractions at a number of locations towards
the high-mass star-forming region NGC 6334I, located at a mean distance of 1.3 kpc, and discuss how
these can shed light on the conditions prevailing during its formation. We use high sensitivity,
high spatial and spectral resolution observations obtained with ALMA to study transitions of the
less abundant, optically thin, methanol-isotopologues: (13)CH3OH, CH3(18)OH, CH2DOH and CH3OD,
detected towards NGC 6334I. Assuming LTE and excitation temperatures of 120-330 K, we derive column
densities for each of the species and use these to infer CH2DOH/CH3OH and CH3OD/CH3OH fractions.
Interestingly, the column densities of CH3OD are consistently higher than those of CH2DOH throughout
the region. All regions studied in this work show CH2DOH/CH3OH as well as CH2DOH/CH3OD ratios that
are considerably lower than those derived towards low-mass star-forming regions and slightly
lower than those derived for the high-mass star-forming regions in Orion and the Galactic Centre.
The low ratios indicate a grain surface temperature during formation ~30 K, for which the efficiency
of the formation of deuterated species is significantly reduced.
