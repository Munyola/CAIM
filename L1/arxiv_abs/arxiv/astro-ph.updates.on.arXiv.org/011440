Recurrent novae (RNe) are novae with multiple recorded outbursts powered by a thermonuclear runaway.
The outburst occurs on the surface of the white dwarf which accompanies with a late type main-sequence
or giant secondary star transferring material onto the white dwarf primary star. They resemble
classical novae (CNe) outbursts but only RNe has more than one recorded outbursts. RNe play an important
role as one of the suspected progenitor systems of Type Ia supernovae (SNe) which are used as primary
distance indicators in cosmology. Thus, it is important to investigate the outburst type of CNe
and RNe and finally ascertain the population of objects that might ultimately be candidates for
Type Ia SNe explosions. The proposal that RNe occupy a region separated from CNe in an outburst amplitude
versus speed class diagram was adopted. Since the low amplitude results from the existence of an
evolved secondary and/or high mass transfer rate in the quiescent system, RNe candidates should
accordingly have low amplitude. We selected 3 preliminary targets including T Pyx, BT Mon and V574
Pup. Their amplitudes are not that low but the lowest amplitude that can be observed with Thai National
Telescope (TNT). We obtained their magnitudes at quiescence using ULTRASPEC camera on the 2.4-m
TNT. The positions of three targets on optical and near-infrared color-magnitude diagrams suggest
that all three should have mainsequence secondary stars. This is true for T Pyx, whose secondary
star has been confirmed its spectroscopy to be a main-sequence star, but not yet confirmed for BT
Mon and V574 Pup.
