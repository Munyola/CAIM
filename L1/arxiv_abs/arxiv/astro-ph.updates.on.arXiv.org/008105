We present the first results from the BAaDE (Bulge Asymmetries and Dynamic Evolution) survey. Though
only a subset of the complete survey ($\sim$2700 out of $\sim$20000 final sources), our data comprise
the largest radio kinematic survey to date of stellar SiO masers observed toward the Galactic bulge
and plane from $-15^\circ < l < +12^\circ$ and $-6^\circ < b < +6^\circ$. Our sources include a substantial
number of line-of-sight (LoS) velocities in high extinction regions within $\pm 1^\circ$ of the
Galactic plane. When matched with 2MASS photometry, our radio-detected sample lies significantly
brighter than and red-ward of the first red giant branch tip, reaching extremes of $(J-Ks)_0 > 8$,
colors consistent with Mira variables and mass losing AGB stars. We see a clean division into two
kinematic populations: a kinematically cold ($\sigma \sim 50\rm\ km\ sec^{-1}$) population that
we propose is in the foreground disk, consisting of giants with 2MASS $Ks<5.5$, and a kinematically
hot ($\sigma \sim 100\rm\ km\ sec^{-1}$) candidate bulge/bar population for most giants with $Ks>5.5$.
Only the kinematically hot giants with $Ks>5.5$ include the reddest stars. Adopting 8.3 kpc to the
Galactic Center, and correcting for foreground extinction, we find that most of the sources have
$M_{bol} \sim -5$, consistent with their being luminous, and possibly intermediate age, AGB stars.
We note some tension between the possibly intermediate age of the kinematically hot population,
and its high velocity dispersion compared to the disk.
