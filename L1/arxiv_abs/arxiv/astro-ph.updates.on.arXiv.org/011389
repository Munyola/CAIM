We present a study of the three-dimensional (3D) structure of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) using
~2.2 million red clump (RC) stars selected from the Survey of the MAgellanic Stellar History. To
correct for line-of-sight dust extinction, the intrinsic RC color and magnitude and their radial
dependence are carefully measured by using internal nearly dust-free regions. These are then used
to construct an accurate 2D reddening map (165 square degrees with ~10 arcmin resolution) of the
LMC disk and the 3D spatial distribution of RC stars. An inclined disk model is fit to the 2D distance
map yielding a best-fit inclination angle i = 25.86(+0.73,-1.39) degrees with random errors of
+\-0.19 degrees and line-of-nodes position angle theta = 149.23(+6.43,-8.35) degrees with random
errors of +/-0.49 degrees. These angles vary with galactic radius, indicating that the LMC disk
is warped and twisted likely due to the repeated tidal interactions with the Small Magellanic Cloud
(SMC). For the first time, our data reveal a significant warp in the southwestern part of the outer
disk starting at rho ~ 7 degrees that departs from the defined LMC plane up to ~4 kpc toward the SMC,
suggesting that it originated from a strong interaction with the SMC. In addition, the inner disk
encompassing the off-centered bar appears to be tilted up to 5-15 degrees relative to the rest of
the LMC disk. These findings on the outer warp and the tilted bar are consistent with the predictions
from the Besla et al. simulation of a recent direct collision with the SMC.
