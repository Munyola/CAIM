Context: The bulk of the Molecular gas in the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) of the Galactic center
region shows warm kinetic temperatures, ranging from $>20$ K in the coldest and densest regions
(n$\sim 10^{4-5}$ cm$^{-3}$) up to more than 100 K for densities of about n$\sim 10^3$ cm$^{-3}$.
Recently, a more diffuse, hotter ($n \sim 100$ cm$^{-3}$, $T\sim 250$ K) gas component was discovered
through absorption observations of H$_3^+$. This component may be widespread in the Galactic center,
and low density gas detectable in absorption may be present even outside the CMZ along sightlines
crossing the extended bulge of the Galaxy. Aims: We aim to observe and characterize diffuse and low
density gas using observations of 3-mm molecular transitions seen in absorption. Methods: Using
the Atacama Large (sub)Millimeter Array (ALMA) we observed the absorption against the quasar J1744-312,
which is located towards the Galactic bulge region at $(l,b)=(-2{^\circ}.13,-1{^\circ}.0)$,
but outside the main molecular complexes. Results: ALMA observations in absorption against the
J1744-312 quasar reveal a rich and complex chemistry in low density molecular and presumably diffuse
clouds. We detected three velocity components, at $\sim $ 0, $-153$, and $-192$ km s$^{-1}$. The
component at $\sim 0$ km s$^{-1}$ could represent gas in the Galactic disk while the velocity components
at $-153$, and $-192$ km s$^{-1}$ likely originate from the Galactic bulge. We detected 12 molecules
in the survey, but only 7 in the Galactic bulge gas.
