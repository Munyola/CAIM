We propose a new physics scenario in which the decay of a very heavy dark-matter candidate which does
not interact with the neutrino sector could explain the two anomalous events recently reported
by ANITA. The model is composed of two components of dark matter, an unstable dark-sector state,
and a massive dark gauge boson. We assume that the heavier dark-matter particle of EeV-range mass
is distributed over the galactic halo and disintegrates into a pair of lighter -- highly boosted
-- dark-matter states in the present universe which reach and penetrate the Earth. The latter scatters
{\it in}elastically off a nucleon and produces a heavier dark-sector unstable state which subsequently
decays back to the lighter dark matter along with hadrons, which induce Extensive Air Showers, via
on-/off-shell dark gauge boson. Depending on the mass hierarchy within the dark sector, either
the dark gauge boson or the unstable dark-sector particle can be long-lived, hence transmitted
significantly through the Earth. We study the angular distribution of the signal and show that our
model favors emergence angles in the range $\sim 25^\circ -35^\circ$ if the associated parameter
choices bear the situation where the mean free path of the boosted incident particle is much larger
than the Earth diameter while its long-lived decay product has a decay length of dimensions comparable
to the Earth radius. Our model, in particular, avoids any constraints from complementary neutrino
searches such as IceCube or the Auger observatory.
