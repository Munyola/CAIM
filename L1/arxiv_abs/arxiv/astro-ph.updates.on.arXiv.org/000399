Aims. The magnetic fields of the member galaxies NGC 3628 and NGC 3627 show morphological peculiarities,
suggesting that interactions within the group may be caused by stripping of the magnetic field.
This process could supply the intergalactic space with magnetised material, a scenario considered
as a possible source of intergalactic magnetic fields (as seen eg. in the Taffy pairs of galaxies).
Additionally, the plumes are likely to be the tidal dwarf galaxy candidates. Methods. We performed
radio continuum mapping observations at 2.64 GHz using the 100-m Effelsberg radio telescope. We
obtained total power and polarised intensity maps of the Triplet. These maps were analysed together
with the archive data, and the magnetic field strength (as well as the magnetic energy density) was
estimated. Results. Extended emission was not detected either in the total power or the polarised
intensity maps. We obtained upper limits of the magnetic field strength and the energy density of
the magnetic field in the Triplet. We detected emission from the easternmost clump and determined
the strength of its magnetic field. In addition, we measured integrated fluxes of the member galaxies
at 2.64 GHz and estimated their total magnetic field strengths. Conclusions. We found that the tidal
tail hosts a tidal dwarf galaxy candidate that possesses a detectable magnetic field with a non-zero
ordered component. Extended radio continuum emission, if present, is weaker than the reached confusion
limit. The total magnetic field strength does not exceed 2.8 {\mu}G and the ordered component is
lower than 1.6 {\mu}G.
