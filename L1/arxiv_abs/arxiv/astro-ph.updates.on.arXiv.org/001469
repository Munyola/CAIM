Aims: We investigate the role of the second synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) photon generation to
the multiwavelength emission from the compact regions of sources that are characterized as misaligned
blazars. For this, we focus on the nearest high-energy emitting radio galaxy Centaurus A and we revisit
the one-zone SSC model for its core emission. Methods: We have calculated analytically the peak
luminosities of the first and second SSC components by, first, deriving the steady-state electron
distribution in the presence of synchrotron and SSC cooling and, then, by using appropriate expressions
for the positions of the spectral peaks. We have also tested our analytical results against those
derived from a numerical code where the full emissivities and cross-sections were used. Results:
We show that the one-zone SSC model cannot account for the core emission of Centaurus A above a few
GeV, where the peak of the second SSC component appears. We, thus, propose an alternative explanation
for the origin of the high energy ($\gtrsim 0.4$ GeV) and TeV emission, where these are attributed
to the radiation emitted by a relativistic proton component through photohadronic interactions
with the photons produced by the primary leptonic component. We show that the required proton luminosities
are not extremely high, e.g. $\sim 10^{43}$ erg/s, provided that the injection spectra are modelled
by a power-law with a high value of the lower energy cutoff. Finally, we find that the contribution
of the core emitting region of Cen A to the observed neutrino and ultra-high energy cosmic-ray fluxes
is negligible.
