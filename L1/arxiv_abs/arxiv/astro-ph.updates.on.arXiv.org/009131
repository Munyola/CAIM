Discoveries of low mass galaxy pairs and groups are increasing. Studies indicate that dwarf galaxy
pairs are gas rich in the field and exhibit elevated star formation rates, suggestive of interactions.
Lacking are dynamical models of observed dwarf galaxy pairs to disentangle the physical processes
regulating their baryon cycles. We present new optical data and the first detailed theoretical
model of an observed tidal encounter between two isolated low mass galaxies, NGC 4490 & NGC 4485.
This system is an isolated analog of the Magellanic Clouds and is surrounded by a ~50 kpc extended
HI envelope. We use hybrid $N$-body and test-particle simulations along with a visualization interface
$Identikit$ to simultaneously reproduce the observed present-day morphology and kinematics.
Our results demonstrate how repeated encounters between two dwarf galaxies can "park" baryons
at very large distances, without the aid of environmental effects. Our best match to the data is an
8:1 mass ratio encounter where a one-armed spiral is induced in the NGC 4490-analog, which we postulate
explains the nature of diffuse starlight presented in the new optical data. We predict that the pair
will fully merge in ~370 Myr, but that the extended tidal features will continue to evolve and return
to the merged remnant over ~5 Gyr. This pre-processing of baryons will affect the efficiency of gas
stripping if such dwarf pairs are accreted by a massive host. In contrast, in isolated environments
this study demonstrates how dwarf-dwarf interactions can create a long-lived supply of gas to the
merger remnant.
