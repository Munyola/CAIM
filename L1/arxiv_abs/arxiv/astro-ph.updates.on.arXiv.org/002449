We present a support vector machine classifier to identify the K giant stars from the LAMOST survey
directly using their spectral line features. The completeness of the identification is about 75%
for tests based on LAMOST stellar parameters. The contamination in the identified K giant sample
is lower than 2.5%. Applying the classification method to about 2 million LAMOST spectra observed
during the pilot survey and the first year survey, we select 298,036 K giant candidates. The metallicities
of the sample are also estimated with uncertainty of $0.13\sim0.29$\,dex based on the equivalent
widths of Mg$_{\rm b}$ and iron lines. A Bayesian method is then developed to estimate the posterior
probability of the distance for the K giant stars, based on the estimated metallicity and 2MASS photometry.
The synthetic isochrone-based distance estimates have been calibrated using 7 globular clusters
with a wide range of metallicities. The uncertainty of the estimated distance modulus at $K=11$\,mag,
which is the median brightness of the K giant sample, is about 0.6\,mag, corresponding to $\sim30$%
in distance. As a scientific verification case, the trailing arm of the Sagittarius stream is clearly
identified with the selected K giant sample. Moreover, at about 80\,kpc from the Sun, we use our K
giant stars to confirm a detection of stream members near the apo-center of the trailing tail. These
rediscoveries of the features of the Sagittarius stream illustrate the potential of the LAMOST
survey for detecting substructures in the halo of the Milky Way.
