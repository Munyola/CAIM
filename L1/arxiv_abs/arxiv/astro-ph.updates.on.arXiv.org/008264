We present a 1.3 mm continuum survey of the young (2-3 Myr) stellar cluster IC 348, which lies at a distance
of 310 pc, and is dominated by low-mass stars (M$_{\star}$ $\sim$ 0.1-0.6 M$_{\odot}$). We observed
136 Class II sources (disks that are optically thick in the infrared) at 0.8$''$ (200 au) resolution
with a 3$\sigma$ sensitivity of $\sim$ 0.45 mJy (M$_{\rm dust}$ $\sim$ 1.3 M$_{\oplus}$). We detect
40 of the targets and construct a mm-continuum luminosity function. We compare the disk mass distribution
in IC 348 to those of younger and older regions, taking into account the dependence on stellar mass.
We find a clear evolution in disk masses from 1 to 5-10 Myr. The disk masses in IC 348 are significantly
lower than those in Taurus (1-3 Myr) and Lupus (1-3 Myr), similar to those of Chamaleon~I, (2-3 Myr)
and $\sigma$ Ori (3-5 Myr) and significantly higher than in Upper Scorpius (5$-$10 Myr). About 20
disks in our sample ($\sim$5$\%$ of the cluster members) have estimated masses (dust $+$ gas) $>$1
M$_{\rm Jup}$ and hence might be the precursors of giant planets in the cluster. Some of the most massive
disks include transition objects with inner opacity holes based on their infrared SEDs. From a stacking
analysis of the 96 non-detections, we find that these disks have a typical dust mass of just $\lesssim$
0.4 M$_{\oplus}$, even though the vast majority of their infrared SEDs remain optically thick and
show little signs of evolution. Such low-mass disks may be the precursors of the small rocky planets
found by \emph{Kepler} around M-type stars.
