We present new narrow-band H alpha imaging from the Hubble Space Telescope of two redshift 0.91 galaxies
that have been lensed by foreground galaxy cluster Abell 2390. These data probe spatial scales as
small as 0.3 kpc, providing a magnified look at the morphology of star formation at an epoch when the
global star formation rate was high. However, dust attenuates our spatially resolved star formation
rate (SFR) indicators, the H alpha and rest-UV emission, and we lack a direct measurement of extinction.
Other studies have found that ionized gas in galaxies tends to be roughly 50 percent more obscured
than stars; however, given an unextincted measurement of the SFR we can quantify the relative stellar
to nebular extinction and the extinction in H{\alpha}. We infer SFRs from Spitzer and Herschel mid-
to far-infrared observations and compare these to integrated H alpha and rest-UV SFRs; this yields
stellar to nebular extinction ratios consistent with previous studies. We take advantage of high
spatial resolution and contextualize these results in terms of the source-plane morphologies,
comparing the distribution of H alpha to that of the rest-frame UV and optical light. In one galaxy,
we measure separate SFRs in visually distinct clumps, but can set only a lower limit on the extinction
and thus the star formation. Consequently, the data are also consistent with there being an equal
amount of extinction along the lines of sight to the ionized gas as to the stars. Future observations
in the far-infrared could settle this by mapping out the dust directly.
