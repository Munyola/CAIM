We build a full spectral-timing model for the low/hard state of black hole binaries assuming that
the spectrum of the X-ray hot flow can be produced by two Comptonisation zones. Slow fluctuations
generated at the largest radii/softest spectral region of the flow propagate down to modulate the
faster fluctuations produced in the spectrally harder region close to the black hole. The observed
spectrum and variability are produced by summing over all regions in the flow, including its emission
reflected from the truncated disc. This produces energy-dependent Fourier lags qualitatively
similar to those in the data. Given a viscous frequency prescription, the model predicts Fourier
power spectral densities and lags for any energy bands. We apply this model to archival RXTE data
from Cyg X-1, using the time-averaged energy spectrum together with an assumed emissivity to set
the radial bounds of the soft and hard Comptonisation regions. We find that the power spectra cannot
be described by any smooth model of generating fluctuations, instead requiring that there are specific
radii in the flow where noise is preferentially produced. We also find fluctuation damping between
spectrally distinct regions is required to prevent all the variability power generated at large
radii being propagated into the inner regions. Even with these additions, we can fit either the power
spectra at each energy, or the lags between energy bands, but not both. We conclude that either the
spectra are more complex than two zone models, or that other processes are important in forming the
variability.
