Given the central role of carbon in the chemistry of life, it is a fundamental question as to how carbon
is supplied to the Earth, in what form and when. We provide an accounting of carbon found in solar system
bodies, in particular a comparison between the organic content of meteorites and that in identified
organics in the dense interstellar medium (ISM). Based on this accounting identified organics
created by the chemistry of star formation could contain at most ~15% of the organic carbon content
in primitive meteorites and significantly less for cometary organics, which represent the putative
contributors to starting materials for the Earth. In the ISM ~30% of the elemental carbon is found
in CO, either in the gas or ices, with a typical abundance of ~10^-4 (relative to H2). Recent observations
of the TW Hya disk find that the gas phase abundance of CO is reduced by an order of magnitude compared
to this value. We explore a solution where the volatile CO is destroyed via a gas phase processes,
providing an additional source of carbon for organic material to be incorporated into planetesimals
and cometesimals. This chemical processing mechanism requires warm grains (> 20 K), partially
ionized gas, and sufficiently small <10 micron grains, i.e. a larger total grain surface area,
such that freeze-out is efficient. Under these conditions static (non-turbulent) chemical models
predict that a large fraction of the carbon nominally sequestered in CO can be the source of carbon
for a wide variety of organics that are present as ice coatings on the surfaces of warm pre-planetesimal
dust grains.
