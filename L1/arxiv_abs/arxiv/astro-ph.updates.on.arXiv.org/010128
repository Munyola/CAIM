In order to study stellar populations and galaxy structures at intermediate and high redshift (z=0.2-2.0)
and link these properties to those of low redshift galaxies, there is a need for well-defined local
reference samples. Especially for galaxies in massive clusters, such samples are often limited
to the Coma cluster galaxies. We present consistently calibrated velocity dispersions and absorption
line indices for galaxies in the central 2 R500 x 2 R500 of four massive clusters at z<0.1: Abell 426/Perseus,
Abell 1656/Coma, Abell 2029, and Abell 2142. The measurements are based on data from Gemini Observatory,
McDonald Observatory, and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. For bulge-dominated galaxies the samples
are 95 percent complete in Perseus and Coma, and 74 percent complete in A2029 and A2142, to a limit
of M_Babs <= -18.5 mag. The data serve as the local reference for our studies of galaxy populations
in the higher redshift clusters that are part of the Gemini/HST Galaxy Cluster Project (GCP). We
establish the scaling relations between line indices and velocity dispersions as reference for
the GCP. We derive stellar population parameters ages, metallicities [M/H], and abundance ratios
from line indices, both averaged in bins of velocity dispersion, and from individual measurements
for galaxies in Perseus and Coma. The zero points of relations between the stellar population parameters
and the velocity dispersions limit the allowed cluster-to-cluster variation of the four clusters
to +-0.08 dex in age, +-0.06 dex in [M/H], +-0.07 dex in [CN/Fe], and +-0.03 dex in [Mg/Fe].
