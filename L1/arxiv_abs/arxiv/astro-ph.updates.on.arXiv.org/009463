We present a study of the radio properties of the dominant early-type galaxies in 26 galaxy groups,
the high-richness sub-sample of the Complete Local-volume Groups Sample (CLoGS). Combining new
610 MHz and 235 MHz observations of 21 groups from the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) with
archival GMRT and Very Large Array (VLA) survey data, we find a high detection rate, with 92% of the
dominant galaxies hosting radio sources. The sources have a wide range of luminosities, 10$^{20}$
$-$ 10$^{24}$ W/Hz in the 235 and 610 MHz bands. The majority (54%) are point-like, but 23% have radio
jets, and another 15% are diffuse radio sources with no clear jet/lobe morphology. The spectral
index of the detected radio sources ranges from very flat values of ~0.2 to typical radio synchrotron
spectra of ~0.9 with only two presenting steep radio spectra with $\alpha_{235}^{610}$ > 1. We find
that jet sources are more common in X-ray bright groups, with radio non-detections found only in
X-ray faint systems. Radio point sources appear in all group environments irrespective of their
X-ray properties or spiral fraction. We estimate the mechanical power (Pcav) of the jet sources
in the X-ray bright groups to be 10$^{41}$ $-$ 10$^{43}$ erg/s, with the two large-scale jet systems
(NGC 193 and NGC 4261) showing jet powers two orders of magnitude greater than the radiative losses
from the cool cores of their groups. This suggests that central AGN are not always in balance with
cooling, but may instead produce powerful periodical bursts of feedback heating.
