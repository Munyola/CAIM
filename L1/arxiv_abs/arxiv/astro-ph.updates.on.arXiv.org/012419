We visually analyzed the Transit Timing Variation (TTV) data of 5930 Kepler Objects of Interest
(KOIs) homogeneously. Using data from Rowe et al. 2014 and Holczer et al. 2016, we investigated TTVs
for KOIs in Kepler's Data Release 24 catalog. Using TTV plots, periodograms, and folded quadratic
sinusoid fits, we visually rated each KOI's TTV data in five categories. Our ratings emphasize the
hundreds of planets with TTVs that are weaker than the 200 or so that have been studied in detail. Our
findings are consistent with statistical methods for identifying strong TTVs (Holczer et al. 2016),
though we find some additional systems worth investigation. Between about 3-50 days and 1.3-6 Earth
radii, the frequency of strong TTVs increases with period and radius. As expected, strong TTVs are
very common when period ratios are near a resonance, but there is not a one-to-one correspondence.
The observed planet-by-planet frequency of strong TTVs is only somewhat lower in systems with 1-2
known planets (7 +/- 1 percent) than in systems with 3+ known planets (11 +/- 2 percent). We attribute
TTVs to known planets in multi-transiting systems, but find about 30 cases where the perturbing
planet is unknown. Our conclusions are valuable as an ensemble for learning about planetary system
architectures and individually as stepping stones towards more detailed mass-radius constraints.
We also discuss Data Release 25 TTVs, about 100 KOIs with Transit Duration and/or Depth Variations,
and that the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) will likely find roughly 10 planets with
strong TTVs.
