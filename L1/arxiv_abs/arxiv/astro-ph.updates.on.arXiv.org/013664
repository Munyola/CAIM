The Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) could be revolutionary for MeV neutrino astrophysics,
because of its huge detector volume, unique event reconstruction capabilities, and excellent
sensitivity to the $\nu_e$ flavor. However, its backgrounds are not yet known. A major background
is expected due to muon spallation of argon, which produces unstable isotopes that later beta decay.
We present the first comprehensive study of MeV spallation backgrounds in argon, detailing isotope
production mechanisms and decay properties, analyzing beta energy and time distributions, and
proposing experimental cuts. We show that above a nominal detection threshold of 5-MeV electron
energy, the most important backgrounds are --- surprisingly --- due to low-A isotopes, such as Li,
Be, and B, even though high-A isotopes near argon are abundantly produced. We show that spallation
backgrounds can be powerfully rejected by simple cuts, with clear paths for improvements. We compare
these background rates to rates of possible MeV astrophysical neutrino signals in DUNE, including
solar neutrinos (detailed in a companion paper [Capozzi et al. arXiv:1808.08232 [hep-ph]]), supernova
burst neutrinos, and the diffuse supernova neutrino background. Further, to aid trigger strategies,
in the Appendixes we quantify the rates of single and multiple MeV events due to spallation, radiogenic
neutron capture, and other backgrounds, including through pileup. Our overall conclusion is that
DUNE has high potential for MeV neutrino astrophysics, but reaching this potential requires new
experimental initiatives.
