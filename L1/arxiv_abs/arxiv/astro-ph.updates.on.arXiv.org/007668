We model the inspiral of globular clusters (GCs) towards a galactic nucleus harboring a supermassive
black hole (SMBH), a leading scenario for the formation of nuclear star clusters. We consider the
case of GCs containing either an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) or a population of stellar
mass black holes (BHs), and study the formation of gravitational wave (GW) sources. We perform direct
summation $N$-body simulations of the infall of GCs with different orbital eccentricities in the
live background of a galaxy with either a shallow or steep density profile. We find that the GC acts
as an efficient carrier for the IMBH, facilitating the formation of a bound pair. The hardening and
evolution of the binary depends sensitively on the galaxy's density profile. If the host galaxy
has a shallow profile the hardening is too slow to allow for coalescence within a Hubble time, unless
the initial cluster orbit is highly eccentric. If the galaxy hosts a nuclear star cluster, the hardening
leads to coalescence by emission of GWs within $3-4$ Gyr. In this case, we find a IMBH-SMBH merger
rate of $\Gamma_{\rm IMBH-SMBH} = 2.8\times 10^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$ Gpc$^{-3}$. If the GC hosts a population
of stellar BHs, these are deposited close enough to the SMBH to form extreme-mass-ratio-inspirals
with a merger rate of $\Gamma_{\rm EMRI} = 0.25$ yr$^{-1}$ Gpc$^{-3}$. Finally, the SMBH tidal field
can boost the coalescence of stellar black hole binaries delivered from the infalling GCs. The merger
rate for this merging channel is $\Gamma_{\rm BHB} = 0.4-4$ yr$^{-1}$ Gpc$^{-3}$.
