The formation scenario of a gapped disk, i.e., transitional disk, and its asymmetry is still under
debate. Proposed scenarios such as disk-planet interaction, photoevaporation, grain growth,
anticyclonic vortex, eccentricity, and their combinations would result in different radial distributions
of the gas and the small (sub-$\mu$m size) and large (millimeter size) dust grains as well as asymmetric
structures in a disk. Optical/near-infrared (NIR) imaging observations and (sub-)millimeter
interferometry can trace small and large dust grains, respectively; therefore multi-wavelength
observations could help elucidate the origin of complicated structures of a disk. Here we report
SMA observations of the dust continuum at 1.3~mm and $^{12}$CO~$J=2\rightarrow1$ line emission
of the pre-transitional protoplanetary disk around the solar-mass star PDS~70. PDS~70, a weak-lined
T Tauri star, exhibits a gap in the scattered light from its disk with a radius of $\sim$65~AU at NIR
wavelengths. However, we found a larger gap in the disk with a radius of $\sim$80~AU at 1.3~mm. Emission
from all three disk components (the gas and the small and large dust grains) in images exhibits a deficit
in brightness in the central region of the disk, in particular, the dust-disk in small and large dust
grains has asymmetric brightness. The contrast ratio of the flux density in the dust continuum between
the peak position to the opposite side of the disk reaches 1.4. We suggest the asymmetries and different
gap-radii of the disk around PDS~70 are potentially formed by several (unseen) accreting planets
inducing dust filtration.
