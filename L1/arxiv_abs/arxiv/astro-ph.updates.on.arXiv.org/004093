Since 2012, thanks to the installation of the high resolution echelle spectrograph in the optical
range HARPS-N, the Italian telescope TNG (La Palma) became one of the key facilities for the study
of the extrasolar planets. In 2014 TNG also offered GIANO to the scientific community, providing
a near-infrared (NIR) cross-dispersed echelle spectroscopy covering 0.97 - 2.45 micron at a resolution
of 50,000. GIANO, although designed for direct light-feed from the telescope at the Nasmyth-B focus,
was provisionally mounted on the rotating building and connected via fibers to only available interface
at the Nasmyth-A focal plane. The synergy between these two instruments is particularly appealing
for a wide range of science cases, especially for the search for exoplanets around young and active
stars and the characterisation of their atmosphere. Through the funding scheme "WOW" (a Way to Others
Worlds), the Italian National Institute for Astrophysics (INAF) proposed to position GIANO at
the focal station for which it was originally designed and the simultaneous use of these spectrographs
with the aim to achieve high-resolution spectroscopy in a wide wavelength range (0.383-2.45 micron)
obtained in a single exposure, giving rise to the project called GIARPS (GIANO-B & HARPS-N). Because
of its characteristics GIARPS can be considered the first and unique worldwide instrument providing
not only high resolution in a large wavelength band, but also a high precision radial velocity measurement
both in the visible and in the NIR arm, since in the next future GIANO-B will be equipped with gas absorption
cells.
