We present a study of 58 double-peaked emission line galaxies for which one of the components is suppressed
in [OIII]5008 or significantly weaker than the other one. Accordingly, the two components are classified
differently in the BPT diagram. We show that the strong [OIII] component coincides with the stellar
velocity and the suppressed component is off-centred in 66% of the galaxies, while in 12% of them
it is the opposite. The analysis of their morphology reveals that about half of the sample is composed
of S0, the rest is composed in equal part of mergers and late-type galaxies. We discuss that these
characteristics exclude rotating discs and suggest different stages of merging. It is possible
that the number of mergers is underestimated if the double nuclei are not resolved. Tidal features
are detected in the outskirts of some S0 galaxies. This high fraction of S0 is surprising, as in addition
most of the galaxies are isolated and the others in small groups. All these galaxies, hosting an AGN
component, are massive, lie on the star forming sequence, and exhibit an enhanced star formation
in their centre. While we cannot exclude outflows, these galaxies exhibit a spectra, which do not
correspond to usual outflow observations characterised by high gas velocities, and the standard
deviations of the two peaks are comparable. In parallel, these characteristics are compatible
with ultimate stages of galaxy merging, where the two nuclei are too close to be detected or dynamical
disturbances might be present in post-mergers like massive S0.
