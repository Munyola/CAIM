Generation of primordial magnetic fields during inflation typically requires the breaking of
conformal invariance of the Electromagnetic action. In this paper this has been achieved naturally
in a higher dimensional cosmological model with a Gauss-Bonnet term in the action. The evolution
of the scale factor of the extra dimension (whose dynamics is influenced by the Gauss-Bonnet term)
acts as the cause for the breaking of conformal invariance. Different cases have been investigated,
each of which is characterized by the number of higher dimensions, the value of the Gauss-Bonnet
parameter, and the cosmological constant. Many of the scenarios considered are highly constrained
by the requirements that the cosmic evolution is stable, that the normal dimensions expand and that
there is no back reaction due to growing electric fields. However there do exist scenarios which
satisfy the above requirements and are well suited for magnetogenesis. In particular, a scenario
where the number of extra dimensions $D=4$ and the cosmological constant is non-zero, turns out
to be best suited for generating primordial magnetic fields. It is shown that for these values of
parameters, a scale invariant magnetic field of the order of $10^{-10}-10^{-9}$ $G$ can be produced.
Even in these most favorable scenarios, the higher dimensional space expands during inflation
at the same rate as the normal dimension. Hence if a mechanism could freeze the evolution of the higher
dimension, this seems to be a viable mechanism to produce acceptable primordial magnetic fields.
