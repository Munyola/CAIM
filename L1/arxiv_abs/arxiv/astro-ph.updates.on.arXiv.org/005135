We present a multi-component structural analysis of the internal structure of $1074$ high redshift
massive galaxies at $1<z<3$ from the CANDELS HST Survey. In particular we examine galaxies best-fit
by two structural components, and thus likely forming discs and bulges. We examine the stellar mass,
star formation rates, and colours of both the inner `bulge' and outer `disc' components for these
systems using SED information from the resolved ACS+WFC3 HST imaging. We find that the majority
of both inner and outer components lie in the star-forming region of UVJ space ($68$ and $90$ per cent
respectively). However, the inner portions, or the likely forming bulges, are dominated by dusty
star formation. Furthermore, we show that the outer components of these systems have a higher star
formation rate than their inner regions, and the ratio of star formation rate between `disc' and
`bulge' increases at lower redshifts. Despite the higher star formation rate of the outer component,
the stellar mass ratio of inner to outer component remains constant through this epoch. This suggests
that there is mass transfer from the outer to inner components for typical two component forming
systems, thus building bulges from disks. Finally, using Chandra data we find that the presence
of an AGN is more common in both $1$-component spheroid-like galaxies and $2$-component systems
($13\pm3$ and $11\pm2$ per cent) than in $1$-component disc-like galaxies ($3\pm1$ per cent),
demonstrating that the formation of a central inner-component likely triggers the formation of
central massive black holes in these galaxies.
