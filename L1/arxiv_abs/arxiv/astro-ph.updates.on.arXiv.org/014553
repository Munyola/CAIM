There is evidence that protoplanetary disks--including the protosolar one--contain crystalline
dust grains on spatial scales where the dust temperature is lower than the threshold value for their
formation through thermal annealing of amorphous interstellar silicates. We interpret these
observations in terms of an extended, magnetocentrifugally driven disk wind that transports grains
from the inner disk--where they are thermally processed by the stellar radiation after being uplifted
from the disk surfaces--to the outer disk regions. For any disk radius $r$ there is a maximum grain
size $a_\mathrm{max}(r)$ that can be uplifted from that location: grains of size $a$$\ll$$a_\mathrm{max}$
are carried away by the wind, whereas those with $a$$\lesssim$$a_\mathrm{max}$ reenter the disk
at larger radii. A significant portion of the reentering grains converge to--and subsequently
accumulate in--a narrow region just beyond $r_\mathrm{max}(a)$, the maximum radius from which
grains of size $a$ can be uplifted. We show that this model can account for the inferred crystallinity
fractions in classical T Tauri and Herbig Ae disks and for their indicated near constancy after being
established early in the disk evolution. It is also consistent with the reported radial gradients
in the mean grain size, crystallinity, and crystal composition. In addition, this model yields
the properties of the grains that remain embedded in the outflows from protoplanetary disks and
naturally explains the inferred persistence of small grains in the surface layers of these disks.
