We use our state-of-the-art semi analytic model for GAlaxy Evolution and Assembly (GAEA), and observational
measurements of nearby galaxies to study the influence of the environment on the gas content and
gaseous/stellar disc sizes of star-forming galaxies. We analyse the origin of differences between
physical properties of satellites and those of their central counterparts, identified by matching
the Vmax of their host haloes at the accretion time of the satellites. Our model reproduces nicely
the differences between centrals and satellites measured for the HI mass, size of the star-forming
region, and stellar radii. In contrast, our model predicts larger differences with respect to data
for the molecular gas mass and star formation rate. By analysing the progenitors of central and satellite
model galaxies, we find that differences in the gas content arise after accretion, and can be entirely
ascribed to the instantaneous stripping of the hot gas reservoir. The suppression of cold gas replenishment
via cooling and star formation leads to a reduction of the cold gas and of its density. Therefore,
more molecular gas is lost than lower density HI gas, and model satellites have less molecular gas
and lower star formation rates than observed satellites. We argue that these disagreements could
be largely resolved with the inclusion of a proper treatment for ram-pressure stripping of cold
gas and a more gradual stripping of the hot gas reservoir. A more sophisticated treatment of angular
momentum exchanges, accounting for the multi-phase nature of the gaseous disc is also required.
