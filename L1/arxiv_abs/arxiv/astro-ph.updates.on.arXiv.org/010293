We present a detailed analysis of the properties of twisted, force-free magnetospheres of non-rotating
neutron stars, which are of interest in the modelling of magnetar properties and evolution. In our
models the magnetic field smoothly matches to a current-free (vacuum) solution at some large external
radius, and they are specifically built to avoid pathological surface currents at any of the interfaces.
By exploring a large range of parameters, we find a few remarkable general trends. We find that the
total dipolar moment can be increased by up to $40\%$ with respect to a vacuum model with the same surface
magnetic field, due to the contribution of magnetospheric currents to the global magnetic field.
Thus, estimates of the surface magnetic field based on the large-scale dipolar braking torque are
slightly overestimating the surface value by the same amount. Consistently, there is a moderate
increase in the total energy of the model with respect to the vacuum solution of up to $25\%$, which
would be the available energy budget in the event of a fast, global magnetospheric reorganization
commonly associated with magnetar flares. We have also found the interesting result of the existence
of a critical twist ($\varphi_{\rm max} \lesssim 1.5$ rad), beyond which we cannot find any more
numerical solutions. Combining the models considered in this paper with the evolution of the interior
of neutron stars will allow us to study the influence of the magnetosphere on the long-term magnetic,
thermal, and rotational evolution.
