The TRAPPIST-1 system has 7 known terrestrial planets arranged compactly in a mean-motion resonant
chain around an ultra-cool central star, some within the estimated habitable zone. Given their
short orbital periods of just a few days, it is often presumed that the planets are likely tidally
locked such that the spin rate is equal to that of the orbital mean motion. However, the compact, and
resonant, nature of the system implies that there can be significant variations in the mean motion
of these planets due to their mutual interactions. Such fluctuations create a moving target between
the spin rotation rate and the orbital mean motion, which we show can then have significant effects
on the spin states of these planets. In this paper, we analyze, using detailed numerical simulations,
the mean motion histories of the three planets that are thought to lie within or close to the habitable
zone of the system: planets d, e, and f. We demonstrate that, depending on the strength of the mutual
interactions within the system, these planets can be pushed into spin states which are effectively
non-synchronous. We find that it can produce significant wobble of the spin state, if not complete
circulation in the co-rotating frame. We also show that these spin states are likely to be unable
to sustain long-term stability, with many of our simulations suggesting that the spin evolves,
under the influence of tidal synchronization forces, into quasi-stable attractor states, which
last on timescales of thousands of years.
