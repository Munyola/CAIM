The transition between the proto-star, Class I, and the pre-main sequence star, Class II, phases
is still one of the most uncertain, and important, stages in the knowledge of the process of formation
of an individual star, because it is the stage that determines the final mass of the star. We observed
the YSO "Holoea", associated with IRAS 05327+3404, which was classified as an object in transition
between the Class I and Class II phases with several unusual properties, and appears to be surrounded
by large amounts of circumstellar material. We used the SMA and BIMA telescopes at millimeter and
sub-millimeter wavelengths to observe the dust continuum emission and the CO (1-0) and (2-1), HCO+
(1-0) and (3-2), and HCN (1-0) transitions in the region around IRAS 05327+3404. We detected two
continuum emission peaks at 1.1-mm: SMM 1, the sub-mm counterpart of IRAS 05327+3404, and SMM 2,
~6 arcsec to the West. The emissions of the three molecules show marked differences. The CO emission
near the systemic velocity is filtered out by the telescopes, and CO mostly traces the high-velocity
gas. The HCO+ and HCN emissions are more centrally concentrated around the central parts of the region,
and show several intensity peaks coincident with the sub-mm continuum peaks. We identify two main
molecular outflows: a bipolar outflow in an E-W direction that would be powered by SMM 1 and another
one in a NE direction, which we associate with SMM 2. We propose that the SMM sources are probably Class
I objects, with SMM 1 in an earlier evolutionary stage.
