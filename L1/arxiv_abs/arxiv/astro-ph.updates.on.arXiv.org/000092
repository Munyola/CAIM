New measurements using radio and plasma-wave instruments in interplanetary space have shown that
nanometer-scale dust, or nanodust, is a significant contributor to the total mass in interplanetary
space. Better measurements of nanodust will allow us to determine where it comes from and the extent
to which it interacts with the solar wind. When one of these nanodust grains impacts a spacecraft,
it creates an expanding plasma cloud, which perturbs the photoelectron currents. This leads to
a voltage pulse between the spacecraft body and the antenna. Nanodust has a high charge/mass ratio,
and therefore can be accelerated by the interplanetary magnetic field to speeds up to the speed of
the solar wind: significantly faster than the Keplerian orbital speeds of heavier dust. The amplitude
of the signal induced by a dust grain grows much more strongly with speed than with mass of the dust
particle. As a result, nanodust can produce a strong signal, despite their low mass. The WAVES instruments
on the twin Solar TErrestrial RElations Observatory spacecraft have observed interplanetary
nanodust particles since shortly after their launch in 2006. After describing a new and improved
analysis of the last five years of STEREO/WAVES Low Frequency Receiver data, a statistical survey
of the nanodust characteristics, namely the rise time of the pulse voltage and the flux of nanodust,
is presented. Agreement with previous measurements and interplanetary dust models is shown. The
temporal variations of the nanodust flux are also discussed.
