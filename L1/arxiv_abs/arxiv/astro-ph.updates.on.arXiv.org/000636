Black hole candidates in X-ray binary systems and at the centers of galaxies are expected to be the
Kerr black holes of General Relativity, but the actual nature of these objects has yet to be verified.
In this paper, we consider the possibility that they are exotic compact objects and we describe their
exterior gravitational field with a subclass of the Manko-Novikov metrics, which are exact solutions
of the vacuum Einstein's equations and can describe the spacetime geometry around bodies with arbitrary
mass-multipole moments. We point out that around a Manko-Novikov object there may exist many disconnected
non-plunging regions at small radii, with no counterpart in the Kerr background, and that their
existence may be tested. For instance, in the presence of an accretion disk, they may be filled by
the accreting gas, forming a ring structure that might remind the rings of Saturn. We suggest that
the existence of these regions may have a clear observational signature in the waveform of the gravitational
radiation emitted by an EMRI: in the last stage of the inspiral, the waveform would be the combination
of "regular chirps", produced when the small object orbits in one of the non-plunging regions, and
"bursts", released when the small object jumps from a non-plunging region to another one at smaller
radii. Our conclusions are supported by some numerical calculations of trajectories in the geodesic
approximation, in which a particle plunges from the ISCO and then seems to get trapped in the potential
well at smaller radii.
