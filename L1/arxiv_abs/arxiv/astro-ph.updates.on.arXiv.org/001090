We present a multi-wavelength study of the Magellanic Stream (MS), a massive gaseous structure
in the Local Group that is believed to represent material stripped from the Magellanic Clouds. We
use ultraviolet, optical and radio data obtained with HST/COS, VLT/UVES, FUSE, GASS, and ATCA to
study metal abundances and physical conditions in the Stream toward the quasar Fairall 9. Line absorption
in the MS from a large number of metal ions and from molecular hydrogen is detected in up to seven absorption
components, indicating the presence of multi-phase gas. From the analysis of unsaturated SII absorption,
in combination with a detailed photoionization model, we obtain a surprisingly high alpha abundance
in the Stream toward Fairall 9 of [S/H]=-0.30pm0.04 (0.5 solar). This value is 5 times higher than
what is found along other MS sightlines based on similar COS/UVES data sets. In contrast, the measured
nitrogen abundance is found to be substantially lower ([N/H]=-1.15pm0.06), implying a very low
[N/alpha] ratio of -0.85 dex. The substantial differences in the chemical composition of MS toward
Fairall 9 compared to other sightlines point toward a complex enrichment history of the Stream.
We favour a scenario, in which the gas toward Fairall 9 was locally enriched with alpha elements by
massive stars and then was separated from the Magellanic Clouds before the delayed nitrogen enrichment
from intermediate-mass stars could set in. Our results support (but do not require) the idea that
there is a metal-enriched filament in the Stream toward Fairall 9 that originates in the LMC.
