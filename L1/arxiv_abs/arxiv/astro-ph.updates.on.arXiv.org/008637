We present numerical simulations of energetic flows propagating through the debris cloud of a binary
neutron star (BNS) merger. Starting from the scale of the central engine, we use a moving-mesh hydrodynamics
code to simulate the complete dynamical evolution of the produced relativistic jets. We compute
synchrotron emission directly from the simulations and present multi-band light curves of the
early (sub-day) through late (weeks to years) afterglow stages. Our work systematically compares
two distinct models for the central engine, referred to as the narrow and wide engine scenario, which
is associated with a successful structured jet and a quasi-isotropic explosion respectively.
Both engine models naturally evolve angular and radial structure through hydrodynamical interaction
with the merger debris cloud. They both also result in a relativistic blast wave capable of producing
the observed multi-band afterglow data. However, we find that the narrow and wide engine scenario
might be differentiated by a new emission component that we refer to as a merger flash. This component
is a consequence of applying the synchrotron radiation model to the shocked optically thin merger
cloud. Such modeling is appropriate if injection of non-thermal electrons is sustained in the breakout
relativistic shell, for example by internal shocks or magnetic reconnection. The rapidly declining
signature may be detectable for future BNS mergers during the first minutes to day following the
GW chirp. Furthermore, its non-detection for the GRB170817A event may disfavor the wide, quasi-isotropic
explosion model.
