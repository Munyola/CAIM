The Gamma-Ray Integrated Detectors (GRID) is a space mission concept dedicated to monitoring the
transient gamma-ray sky in the energy range from 10 keV to 2 MeV using scintillation detectors onboard
CubeSats in low Earth orbits. The primary targets of GRID are the gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) in the local
universe. The scientific goal of GRID is, in synergy with ground-based gravitational wave (GW)
detectors such as LIGO and VIRGO, to accumulate a sample of GRBs associated with the merger of two
compact stars and study jets and related physics of those objects. It also involves observing and
studying other gamma-ray transients such as long GRBs, soft gamma-ray repeaters, terrestrial
gamma-ray flashes, and solar flares. With multiple CubeSats in various orbits, GRID is unaffected
by the Earth occultation and serves as a full-time and all-sky monitor. Assuming a horizon of 200
Mpc for ground-based GW detectors, we expect to see a few associated GW-GRB events per year. With
about 10 CubeSats in operation, GRID is capable of localizing a faint GRB like 170817A with a 90% error
radius of about 10 degrees, through triangulation and flux modulation. GRID is proposed and developed
by students, with considerable contribution from undergraduate students, and will remain operated
as a student project in the future. The current GRID collaboration involves more than 20 institutes
and keeps growing. On August 29th, the first GRID detector onboard a CubeSat was launched into a Sun-synchronous
orbit and is currently under test.
