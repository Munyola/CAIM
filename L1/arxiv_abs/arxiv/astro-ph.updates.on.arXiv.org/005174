We present multi-epoch, multi-colour pre-outburst photometry and post-outburst light curves
and spectra of the luminous blue variable (LBV) outburst Gaia16cfr discovered by the Gaia satellite
on 1 December 2016. We detect Gaia16cfr in 13 epochs of Hubble Space Telescope imaging spanning phases
of 10 yr to 8 months before the outburst and in Spitzer Space Telescope imaging 13 years before outburst.
Pre-outburst optical photometry is consistent with an 18 Msun F8 I star, although the star was likely
reddened and closer to 30 Msun. The pre-outburst source exhibited a significant near-infrared
excess consistent with a 120 AU shell with 4x10-6 Msun of dust. We infer that the source was enshrouded
by an optically-thick and compact shell of circumstellar material from an LBV wind, which formed
a pseudo-photosphere consistent with S Dor-like variables in their "maximum" phase. Within a year
of outburst, the source was highly variable on 10-30 day timescales. The outburst light curve closely
matches that of the 2012 outburst of SN 2009ip, although the observed velocities are significantly
slower than in that event. In Halpha, the outburst had an excess of blueshifted emission at late times
centred around -1500 km/s, similar to that of double-peaked Type IIn supernovae and the LBV outburst
SN 2015bh. From the pre-outburst and post-outburst photometry, we infer that the outburst ejecta
are evolving into a dense, highly structured circumstellar environment from precursor outbursts
within years of the December 2016 event.
