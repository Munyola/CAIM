{We report on the first of a series of studies on coronal bright points investigating the physical
mechanism that generates these phenomena.} {The aim of this paper is to understand the magnetic-field
structure that hosts the bright points.} {We use longitudinal magnetograms taken by the Solar Optical
Telescope with the Narrowband Filter Imager. For a single case, magnetograms from the Helioseismic
and Magnetic Imager were added to the analysis. The longitudinal magnetic field component is used
to derive the potential magnetic fields of the large regions around the bright points. A magneto-static
field extrapolation method is tested to verify the accuracy of the potential field modelling. The
three dimensional magnetic fields are investigated for the presence of magnetic null points and
their influence on the local magnetic domain.} {In 9 out of 10 cases the bright point resides in areas
where the coronal magnetic field contains an opposite polarity intrusion defining a magnetic null
point above it. It is found that X-ray bright points reside, in these 9 cases, in a limited part of the
projected fan dome area, either fully inside the dome or expanding over a limited area below which
typically a dominant flux concentration resides. The 10th bright point is located in a bipolar loop
system without an overlying null point.} {All bright points in coronal holes and two out of tree bright
points in quiet Sun regions are seen to reside in regions containing a magnetic null point. An yet
unidentified process(es) generates the BPs in specific regions of the fan-dome structure. }
