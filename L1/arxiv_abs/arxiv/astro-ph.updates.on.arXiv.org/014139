In the current era of radio astronomy, continuum surveys observe a multitude of objects with complex
morphologies and sizes, and are not limited to observing point sources. Typical radio source extraction
software generates catalogues by using Gaussian components to form a model of the emission. This
may not be well suited to complicated jet structures and extended emission, particularly in the
era of interferometers with a high density of short baselines, that are sensitive to extended emission.
In this paper, we investigate how the optically-motivated source detection package ProFound (Robotham
et al. 2018) may be used to model radio emission of both complicated and point-like radio sources.
We use a combination of observations and simulations to investigate how ProFound compares to other
source extractor packages used for radio surveys. We find that ProFound can accurately recover
both the flux densities of simulated Gaussian sources as well as extended radio galaxies. ProFound
can create models that trace the complicated nature of these extended galaxies, which we show is
not necessarily the case with other source extraction software. Our work suggests that our knowledge
of the emission from extended radio objects may be both over or under-estimated using traditional
software. We suggest that ProFound offers a useful alternative to the fitting of Gaussian components
for generating catalogues from current and future radio surveys. Furthermore, ProFound's multi-wavelength
capabilities will be useful in investigating radio sources in combination with multiwavelength
data.
