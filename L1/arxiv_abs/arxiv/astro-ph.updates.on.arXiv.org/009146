We report the detection of a new Galactic bubble at the interface between the halo and the Galactic
disc. We suggest that the nearby Lupus complex and parts of the Ophiuchus complex constitute the
denser parts of the structure. This young bubble, < 3 Myr old, could be the remnant of a supernova and
expands inside a larger HI loop that has been created by the outflows of the Upper Scorpius OB association.
An HI cavity filled with hot X-ray gas is associated with the structure, which is consistent with
the Galactic chimney scenario. The X-ray emission extends beyond the west and north-west edges
of the bubble, suggesting that hot gas outflows are breaching the cavity, possibly through the fragmented
Lupus complex. Analyses of the polarised radio synchrotron and of the polarised dust emission of
the region suggest the connection of the Galactic centre spur with the young Galactic bubble. A distribution
of HI clumps that spatially corresponds well to the cavity boundaries was found at V_LSR ~ -100 km/s.
Some of these HI clumps are forming jets, which may arise from the fragmented part of the bubble. We
suggest that these clumps might be `dripping' cold clouds from the shell walls inside the cavity
that is filled with hot ionised gas. It is possible that some of these clumps are magnetised and were
then accelerated by the compressed magnetic field at the edge of the cavity. Such a mechanism would
challenge the Galactic accretion and fountain model, where high-velocity clouds are considered
to be formed at high Galactic latitude from hot gas flows from the Galactic plane.
