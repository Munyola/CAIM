We present CO(2-1) observations of 72 galaxies in the nearby, disturbed Antlia galaxy cluster with
the Atacama Pathfinder Experiment (APEX) telescope. The galaxies in our sample are selected to
span a wide range of stellar masses ($10^{8}M_{\odot}\lesssim M_{\star} \lesssim 10^{10}M_{\odot}$)
and star formation rates ($0.0005M_{\odot}\text{yr}^{-1}<\text{SFR}<0.3M_{\odot}\text{yr}^{-1}$).
Reaching a depth of $23\text{mJy}$ in $50\text{km}\text{s}^{-1}$ channels, we report a total
CO detection rate of $37.5\%$ and a CO detection rate of $86\%$ for sources within 1 dex of the main
sequence. We compare our sample with a similar sample of galaxies in the field, finding that, for
a fixed stellar mass and SFR, galaxies in the Antlia cluster have comparable molecular gas reservoirs
to field galaxies. We find that $\sim41\%$ (11/27) of our CO detections display non-Gaussian CO(2-1)
emission line profiles, and a number of these sources display evidence of quenching in their optical
images. We also find that the majority of our sample lie either just below, or far below the main sequence
of field galaxies, further hinting at potential ongoing quenching. We conclude that the Antlia
cluster represents an intermediate environment between fields and dense clusters, where the gentler
intracluster medium (ICM) allows the cluster members to retain their reservoirs of molecular gas,
but in which the disturbed ICM is just beginning to influence the member galaxies, resulting in high
SFRs and possible ongoing quenching.
