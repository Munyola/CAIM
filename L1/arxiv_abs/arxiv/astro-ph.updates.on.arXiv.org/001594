The flavor composition of ultra-high energy cosmic neutrinos (UHECN) carries precious information
about the physical properties of their sources, the nature of neutrino oscillations and possible
exotic physics involved during the propagation. Since UHECN with different incoming directions
would propagate through different amounts of matter in Earth and since different flavors of charged
leptons produced in the neutrino-nucleon charged-current (CC) interaction would have different
energy-loss behaviors in the medium, measurement of the angular distribution of incoming events
by a neutrino observatory can in principle be employed to help determine the UHECN flavor ratio.
In this paper we report on our investigation of the feasibility of such an attempt. Simulations were
performed, where the detector configuration was based on the proposed Askaryan Radio Array (ARA)
Observatory at the South Pole, to investigate the expected event-direction distribution for each
flavor. Assuming $\nu_{\mu}$-$\nu_{\tau}$ symmetry and invoking the standard oscillation and
the neutrino decay scenarios, the probability distribution functions (PDF) of the event directions
are utilized to extract the flavor ratio of cosmogenic neutrinos on Earth. The simulation results
are summarized in terms of the probability of flavor ratio extraction and resolution as functions
of the number of observed events and the angular resolution of neutrino directions. We show that
it is feasible to constrain the UHECN flavor ratio using the proposed ARA Observatory.
