We investigate the feedback of the stellar jets on the surrounding interstellar gas based on 2D and
3D simulations applying HD and MHD module of PLUTO 4.2 code. The main question we address is whether
the stellar jet can be considered as a turbulence driver into the interstellar gas. In addition,
we investigate the most effective circumstances in which the driven turbulence is larger and can
survive for a longer time scale in the ambient gas. We present a case study of different parameters
runs including the jet Mach number, the initial jet velocity field and the background magnetic field
geometries and the interacting jets. Also, we study the environmental effects on the jet-gas interaction
by considering the non-homogeneous surrounding gas containing the clumps in the model setup. Among
different setups, we find that for (1) a higher jet Mach number, (2) a rotating jet, 16 pages(3) a jet
propagating in a magnetized environment, (4)a jet propagating in a non-homogeneous environment,
and (5) the interacting jets more fluctuations and random motions are produced in the entrained
gas which can survive for a longer time scale. In addition, we perform the 3D simulations of jet-ambient
gas interaction and we find that the amount of (subsonic-supersonic) fluctuations increases compared
to the axisymmetric run and the entrained gas gains higher velocities in a 3D run. In total, we confirm
the previous finding that the stellar jets can transfer the turbulence on neighboring regions and
are not sufficient drivers of the large-scale supersonic turbulence in molecular clouds.
