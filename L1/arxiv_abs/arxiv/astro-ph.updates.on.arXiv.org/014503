We report on our combined analysis of HST, VLT/MUSE, VLT/SINFONI, and ALMA observations of the local
Seyfert 2 galaxy, NGC 5728 to investigate in detail the feeding and feedback of the AGN. The datasets
simultaneously probe the morphology, excitation, and kinematics of the stars, ionized gas, and
molecular gas over a large range of spatial scales (10 pc--10 kpc). NGC 5728 contains a large stellar
bar which is driving gas along prominent dust lanes to the inner 1 kpc where the gas settles into a circumnuclear
ring. The ring is strongly star forming and contains a substantial population of young stars as indicated
by the lowered stellar velocity dispersion and gas excitation consistent with HII regions. We model
the kinematics of the ring using the velocity field of the CO (2--1) emission and stars and find it
is consistent with a rotating disk. The outer regions of the disk, where the dust lanes meet the ring,
show signatures of inflow at a rate of 1 M$_{\sun}$ yr$^{-1}$. Inside the ring, we observe three molecular
gas components corresponding to the circular rotation of the outer ring, a warped disk, and the nuclear
stellar bar. The AGN is driving an ionized gas outflow that reaches a radius of 250 pc with a mass outflow
rate of 0.08 M$_{\sun}$ yr$^{-1}$ consistent with its luminosity and scaling relations from previous
studies. While we observe distinct holes in CO emission which could be signs of molecular gas removal,
we find that largely the AGN is not disrupting the structure of the circumnuclear region.
