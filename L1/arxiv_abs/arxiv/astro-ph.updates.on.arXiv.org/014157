In this paper we demonstrate that the information encoded in \emph{one} single (sufficiently large)
$N$-body simulation can be used to reproduce arbitrary numbers of halo catalogues with different
phases. To this end we use as a reference one realisation (from an ensemble of $300$) of the Minerva
$N$-body simulations and the recently published Bias Assignment Method (Balaguera-Antol\'inez
et al. 2019) to extract the local and non-local bias linking the halo to the dark matter distribution.
We use an approximate (and fast) gravity solver to generate $300$ dark matter density fields from
the down-sampled initial conditions of the reference simulation and sample each of these fields
using the halo-bias and a kernel, both calibrated from the arbitrarily chosen realisation of the
reference simulation. We show that the power spectrum, its variance and the three-point statistics
are reproduced within $\sim 2\%$ (up to $k\sim 1.0\,h\,{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$), $\sim 5\%$ and $10\%$,
respectively. Using a model for the real space power spectrum we show that the covariance matrices
obtained from our procedure lead to parameter uncertainties that are compatible within $\sim 1\%$
with respect to those derived from the reference covariance matrix. Our method has the potential
to learn from one simulation with moderate volumes and high-mass resolution and extrapolate the
information of the bias and the kernel to larger volumes, making it ideal for the construction of
mock catalogues for present and forthcoming observational campaigns such as Euclid or DESI.
