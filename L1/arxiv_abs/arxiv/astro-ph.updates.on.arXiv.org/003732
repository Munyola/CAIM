To make relevant predictions about observable emission, hydrodynamical simulation codes must
employ schemes that account for radiative losses, but the large dimensionality of accurate radiative
transfer schemes is often prohibitive. Stamatellos and collaborators introduced a scheme for
smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations based on the notion of polytropic pseudo-clouds
that uses only local quantities to estimate cooling rates. The computational approach is extremely
efficient and works well in cases close to spherical symmetry, such as in star formation problems.
Unfortunately, the method, which takes the local gravitational potential as an input, can be inaccurate
when applied to non-spherical configurations, limiting its usefulness when studying disks or
stellar collisions, among other situations of interest. Here, we introduce the "pressure scale
height method," which incorporates the fluid pressure scale height into the determination of column
densities and cooling rates, and show that it produces more accurate results across a wide range
of physical scenarios while retaining the computational efficiency of the original method. The
tested models include spherical polytropes as well as disks with specified density and temperature
profiles. We focus on applying our techniques within an SPH code, although our method can be implemented
within any particle-based Lagrangian or grid-based Eulerian hydrodynamic scheme. Our new method
may be applied in a broad range of situations, including within the realm of stellar interactions,
collisions, and mergers.
