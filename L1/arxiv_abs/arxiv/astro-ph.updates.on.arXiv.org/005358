The abundance of nitrogen in the interstellar medium is a powerful probe of star for- mation processes
over cosmological timescales. Since nitrogen can be produced both in massive and intermediate-mass
stars with metallicity-dependent yields, its evolution is challenging to model, as evidenced
by the differences between theoretical predictions and observations. In this work we attempt to
identify the sources of these discrepancies using a cosmic evolution model. To further complicate
matters, there is considerable dispersion in the abundances from observations of DLAs at redshift
2 - 3. We study the evolution of nitrogen with a detailed chemical evolution model and find good agreement
with observations, including the relative abundances of N/O and N/Si ratios. We find that the principal
contribution of nitrogen comes from intermediate mass stars, with the exception of systems with
the lowest N/H, where nitrogen production might possibly be dominated by massive stars. This last
result could be strengthened if stellar rotation which is important at low metallicity can produce
significant amounts of nitrogen. Moreover, these systems likely reside in host galaxies with stellar
masses below 10**8.5 solar mass. We also study the origin of the observed dispersion in nitrogen
abundances using the cosmological hydrodynamical simulations Horizon-AGN. We conclude that
this dispersion can originate from two effects: differ- ence in the masses of the DLA host galaxies,
and difference in the their position inside the galaxy.
