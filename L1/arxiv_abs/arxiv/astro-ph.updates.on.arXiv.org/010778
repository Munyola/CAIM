WIRC+Pol is a newly commissioned low-resolution (R~100), near-infrared (J and H band) spectropolarimetry
mode of the Wide-field InfraRed Camera (WIRC) on the 200-inch Hale Telescope at Palomar Observatory.
The instrument utilizes a novel polarimeter design based on a quarter-wave plate and a polarization
grating (PG), which provides full linear polarization measurements (Stokes I, Q, and U) in one exposure.
The PG also has high transmission across the J and H bands. The instrument is situated at the prime
focus of an equatorially mounted telescope. As a result, the system only has one reflection in the
light path, providing minimal telescope induced polarization. A data reduction pipeline has been
developed for WIRC+Pol to produce linear polarization measurements from observations. WIRC+Pol
has been on-sky since February 2017. Results from the first year commissioning data show that the
instrument has a high dispersion efficiency as expected from the polarization grating. We demonstrate
the polarimetric stability of the instrument with RMS variation at 0.2% level over 30 minutes for
a bright standard star (J = 8.7). While the spectral extraction is photon noise limited, polarization
calibration between sources remain limited by systematics, likely related to gravity dependent
pointing effects. We discuss instrumental systematics we have uncovered in the data, their potential
causes, along with calibrations that are necessary to eliminate them. We describe a modulator upgrade
that will eliminate the slowly varying systematics and provide polarimetric accuracy better than
0.1%.
