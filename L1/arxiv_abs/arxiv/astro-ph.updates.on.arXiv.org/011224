We present observations and analysis of 18 stripped-envelope supernovae observed during 2013
-- 2018. This sample consists of 5 H/He-rich SNe, 6 H-poor/He-rich SNe, 3 narrow lined SNe Ic and 4
broad lined SNe Ic. The peak luminosity and characteristic time-scales of the bolometric light
curves are calculated, and the light curves modelled to derive 56Ni and ejecta masses (MNi and Mej).
Additionally, the temperature evolution and spectral line velocity-curves of each SN are examined.
Analysis of the [O I] line in the nebular phase of eight SNe suggests their progenitors had initial
masses $<20$ Msun. The bolometric light curve properties are examined in combination with those
of other SE events from the literature. The resulting dataset gives the Mej distribution for 80 SE-SNe,
the largest such sample in the literature to date, and shows that SNe Ib have the lowest median Mej,
followed by narrow lined SNe Ic, H/He-rich SNe, broad lined SNe Ic, and finally gamma-ray burst SNe.
SNe Ic-6/7 show the largest spread of Mej, ranging from $\sim 1.2 - 11$ Msun, considerably greater
than any other subtype. For all SE-SNe $<$Mej$>=2.8\pm{1.5}$ Msun which further strengthens the
evidence that SE-SNe arise from low mass progenitors which are typically $<5$ Msun at the time of
explosion, again suggesting Mzams $<25$ Msun. The low $<$Mej$>$ and lack of clear bimodality in
the distribution implies $<30$ Msun progenitors and that envelope stripping via binary interaction
is the dominant evolutionary pathway of these SNe.
