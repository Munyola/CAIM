We identify optical emission-line features 700" (12 kpc) southwest of the nucleus of Centaurus
A, roughly opposite the radio jet and well-known optical emission filaments associated with the
northern radio structure. These regions are spatially associated with far-infrared emission
peaks in a cold dust cloud identified using Herschel and Spitzer data, and there may be a mismatch
between the low temperature of the dust and the expected heating effect of young stars. We use integral-field
optical spectroscopy to trace the ratios of strong emission lines. Their ratios are consistent
with photoionization in normal H II regions, by modest numbers of OB stars; they must be obscured
along our line of sight. The location raises the question of whether this star-forming episode was
enhanced or triggered by an outflow from the central parts of Centaurus A. Optical emission-line
ratios and line widths limit the role of shocks on the gas, so any interaction with an outflow, either
from the radio source or star formation in the gas-rich disk, can at most have compressed the gas weakly.
We speculate that the presence of similar star-forming regions on both sides of the galaxy, contrasted
with the difference in the character of the emission-line clouds, reflects the presence of a collimated
radio jet to the northeast and perhaps anisotropic escape of ionizing radiation from the AGN. Star
formation on the southwestern side of Cen A could be enhanced by a broad outflow, distinct from the
radio jet and lobes. (abridged)
