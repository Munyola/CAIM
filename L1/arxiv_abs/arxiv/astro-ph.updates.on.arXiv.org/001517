The KOI-94 system is a closely-packed, multi-transiting planetary system discovered by the Kepler
space telescope. It is known as the first system that exhibited a rare event called a "planet-planet
eclipse (PPE)," in which two planets partially overlap with each other in their double-transit
phase. In this paper, we constrain the parameters of the KOI-94 system with an analysis of the transit
timing variations (TTVs). Such constraints are independent of the radial velocity (RV) analysis
recently performed by Weiss and coworkers, and valuable in examining the reliability of the parameter
estimate using TTVs. We numerically fit the observed TTVs of KOI-94c, KOI-94d, and KOI-94e for their
masses, eccentricities, and longitudes of periastrons, and obtain the best-fit parameters including
$m_{\rm c} = 9.4_{-2.1}^{+2.4} M_{\oplus}$, $m_{\rm d} = 52.1_{-7.1}^{+6.9} M_{\oplus}$, $m_{\rm
e} = 13.0_{-2.1}^{+2.5} M_{\oplus}$, and $e \lesssim 0.1$ for all the three planets. While these
values are mostly in agreement with the RV result, the mass of KOI-94d estimated from the TTV is significantly
smaller than the RV value $m_{\rm d} = 106 \pm 11 M_{\oplus}$. In addition, we find that the TTV of the
outermost planet KOI-94e is not well reproduced in the current modeling. We also present analytic
modeling of the PPE and derive a simple formula to reconstruct the mutual inclination of the two planets
from the observed height, central time, and duration of the brightening caused by the PPE. Based
on this model, the implication of the results of TTV analysis for the time of the next PPE is discussed.
