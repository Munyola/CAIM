Jupiter-mass planets with large semi-major axes ($a > 1.0$ AU) occur at a higher rate around evolved
intermediate mass stars. There is a pronounced paucity of close-in ($a < 0.6$ AU), intermediate
period ($5 < P < 100$ days), low-mass ($M_{\rm planet} < 0.7M_{\rm Jup} $) planets, known as the `Planet
Desert'. Current radial velocity methods have yet to yield close-in, low-mass planets around these
stars because the planetary signals could be hidden by the (5-10) m s$^{-1}$ radial velocity variations
caused by acoustic oscillations. We find that by implementing an observing strategy of taking three
observations per night separated by an optimal $\Delta t$, which is a function of the oscillation
periods and amplitudes, we can average over the stellar jitter and improve our sensitivity to low-mass
planets. We find $\Delta t$ can be approximated using the stellar mass and radius given by the relationship
$\Delta t = $1.79 $(M/M_{\odot})^{-0.82} ~(R/R_{\odot})^{1.92}$. We test our proposed method
by injecting planets into very well sampled data of a subgiant star, $\gamma$ Cep. We compare the
fraction of planets recovered by our method to the fraction of planets recovered using current radial
velocity observational strategies. We find that our method decreases the RMS of the stellar jitter
due to acoustic oscillations by a factor of three over current single epoch observing strategies
used for subgiant stars. Our observing strategy provides a means to test whether the Planet Desert
extends to lower mass planets.
