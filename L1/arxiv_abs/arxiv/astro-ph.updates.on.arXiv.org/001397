We report a 5.4\sigma\ detection of pulsed gamma rays from PSR B1821-24 in the globular cluster M28
using ~44 months of Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) data that have been reprocessed with improved
instrument calibration constants. We constructed a phase-coherent ephemeris, with post-fit
residual RMS of 3 \mu s, using radio data spanning ~23.2 years, enabling measurements of the multi-wavelength
light curve properties of PSR B1821-24 at the milliperiod level. We fold RXTE observations of PSR
B1821-24 from 1996 to 2007 and discuss implications on the emission zones. The gamma-ray light curve
consists of two peaks, separated by 0.41$\pm$0.02 in phase, with the first gamma-ray peak lagging
the first radio peak by 0.05$\pm$0.02 in phase, consistent with the phase of giant radio pulses.
We observe significant emission in the off-peak interval of PSR B1821-24 with a best-fit LAT position
inconsistent with the core of M28. We do not detect significant gamma-ray pulsations at the spin
or orbital periods from any other known pulsar in M28, and we place limits on the number of energetic
pulsars in the cluster. The derived gamma-ray efficiency, ~2%, is typical of other gamma-ray pulsars
with comparable spin-down power, suggesting that the measured spin-down rate ($2.2\times10^{36}$
erg s$^{-1}$) is not appreciably distorted by acceleration in the cluster potential. This confirms
PSR B1821-24 as the second very energetic millisecond pulsar in a globular cluster and raises the
question of whether these represent a separate class of objects that only form in regions of very
high stellar density
