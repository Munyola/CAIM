We use deep \textit{Hubble Space Telescope} spectroscopy to constrain the metallicities and (\editone{light-weighted})
ages of massive ($\log M_\ast/M_\odot\gtrsim10$) galaxies selected to have quiescent stellar
populations at $1.0<z<1.8$. The data include 12--orbit depth coverage with the WFC3/G102 grism
covering $\sim$ $8,000<\lambda<11,500$~\AA\, at a spectral resolution of $R\sim 210$ taken as
part of the CANDELS Lyman-$\alpha$ Emission at Reionization (CLEAR) survey. At $1.0<z<1.8$, the
spectra cover important stellar population features in the rest-frame optical. We simulate a suite
of stellar population models at the grism resolution, fit these to the data for each galaxy, and derive
posterior likelihood distributions for metallicity and age. We stack the posteriors for subgroups
of galaxies in different redshift ranges that include different combinations of stellar absorption
features. Our results give \editone{light-weighted ages of $t_{z \sim 1.1}= 3.2\pm 0.7$~Gyr,
$t_{z \sim 1.2}= 2.2\pm 0.6$~Gyr, $t_{z\sim1.3}= 3.1\pm 0.6$~Gyr, and $t_{z\sim1.6}= 2.0 \pm
0.6$~Gyr, \editone{for galaxies at $z\sim 1.1$, 1.2, 1.3, and 1.6. This} implies that most of the
massive quiescent galaxies at $1<z<1.8$ had formed $>68$\% of their stellar mass by a redshift of
$z>2$}. The posteriors give metallicities of \editone{$Z_{z\sim1.1}=1.16 \pm 0.29$~$Z_\odot$,
$Z_{z\sim1.2}=1.05 \pm 0.34$~$Z_\odot$, $Z_{z\sim1.3}=1.00 \pm 0.31$~$Z_\odot$, and $Z_{z\sim1.6}=0.95
\pm 0.39$~$Z_\odot$}. This is evidence that massive galaxies had enriched rapidly to approximately
Solar metallicities as early as $z\sim3$.
