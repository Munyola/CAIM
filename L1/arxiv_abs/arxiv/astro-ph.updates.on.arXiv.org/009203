We test the distance--duality relation $\eta \equiv d_L / [ (1 + z)^2 d_A ] = 1$ between cosmological
luminosity distance ($d_L$) from the JLA SNe Ia compilation (arXiv:1401.4064) and angular-diameter
distance ($d_A$) based on Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS; arXiv:1607.03155)
and WiggleZ baryon acoustic oscillation measurements (arXiv:1105.2862, arXiv:1204.3674).
The $d_L$ measurements are matched to $d_A$ redshift by a statistically consistent compression
procedure. With Monte Carlo methods, nontrivial and correlated distributions of $\eta$ can be
explored in a straightforward manner without resorting to a particular evolution template $\eta(z)$.
Assuming independent constraints on cosmological parameters that are necessary to obtain $d_L$
and $d_A$ values, we find 9% constraints consistent with $\eta = 1$ from the analysis of SNIa + BOSS
and an 18% bound results from SNIa + WiggleZ. These results are contrary to previous claims that $\eta
< 1$ has been found close to or above the $1 \sigma$ level. We discuss the effect of different cosmological
parameter inputs and the use of the apparent deviation from distance--duality as a proxy of systematic
effects on cosmic distance measurements. The results suggest possible systematic overestimation
of SNIa luminosity distances compared with $d_A$ data when a Planck {\Lambda}CDM cosmological
parameter inference (arXiv:1502.01589) is used to enhance the precision. If interpreted as an
extinction correction due to a gray dust component, the effect is broadly consistent with independent
observational constraints.
