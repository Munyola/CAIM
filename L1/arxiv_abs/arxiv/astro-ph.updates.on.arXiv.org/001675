Population III stars are the first stars in the Universe to form at z=20-30 out of a pure hydrogen and
helium gas in minihalos of 10^5-10^6 M$_\odot$ . Cooling and fragmentation is thus regulated via
molecular hydrogen. At densities above 10^8 cm$^{-3}$, the three-body H2 formation rates are particularly
important for making the gas fully molecular. These rates were considered to be uncertain by at least
a few orders of magnitude. We explore the impact of new accurate three-body H2 formation rates derived
by Forrey (2013) for three different minihalos, and compare to the results obtained with three-body
rates employed in previous studies. The calculations are performed with the cosmological hydrodynamics
code ENZO (release 2.2) coupled with the chemistry package KROME (including a network for primordial
chemistry), which was previously shown to be accurate in high resolution simulations. While the
new rates can shift the point where the gas becomes fully molecular, leading to a different thermal
evolution, there is no trivial trend in how this occurs. While one might naively expect the results
to be inbetween the calculations based on Palla et al. (1983) and Abel et al. (2002), the behavior
can be close to the former or the latter depending on the dark matter halo that is explored. We conclude
that employing the correct three-body rates is about as equally important as the use of appropriate
initial conditions, and that the resulting thermal evolution needs to be calculated for every halo
individually.
