We have combined the wide-area Herschel-ATLAS far-IR survey with spectroscopic redshifts from
GAMA and SDSS to define a sample of 21 low--redshift ($z_{\rm spec} < 0.5$) analogs of submm galaxies
(SMGs). These have been selected because their dust temperatures and total IR luminosities are
similar to those for the classical high-redshift SMG population. As well as presenting the sample,
in this paper we report $^{12}$CO(2-1) and $^{12}$CO(1-0) observations of 16 low-redshift analogs
of SMGs taken with the IRAM-30m telescope. We have obtained that low-redshift analogs of SMGs represent
a very diverse population, similar to what has been found for high-redshift SMGs. A large variety
in the molecular gas excitation or $^{12}$CO(2-1)/$^{12}$CO(1-0) line ratio is seen, meaning
that extrapolations from $J \geq 2$ CO lines can result in very uncertain molecular gas mass determinations.
Our sources with $^{12}$CO(1-0) detections follow the dust--gas correlation found in previous
work at different redshifts and luminosities. The molecular gas mass of low-redshift SMGs has an
average value of $M_{\rm H_2} \sim 1.6 \times 10^{10}\,M_\odot$ and will be consumed in $\sim 100
\, {\rm Myr}$ . We also find a wide range of molecular gas fractions, with the highest values being
compatible with those found in high-redshift SMGs with $^{12}$CO(1-0) detections, which are only
the most luminous. Low-redshift SMGs offer a unique opportunity to study the properties of extreme
star formation in a detail not possible at higher redshifts.
