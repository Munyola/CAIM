To study the dust evolution in the cosmological structure formation history, we perform a smoothed
particle hydrodynamic simulation with a dust enrichment model in a cosmological volume. We adopt
the dust evolution model that represents the grain size distribution by two sizes and takes into
account stellar dust production and interstellar dust processing. We examine the dust mass function
and the scaling properties of dust in terms of the characteristics of galaxies. The simulation broadly
reproduces the observed dust mass functions at redshift $z = 0$, except that it overproduces the
massive end at dust mass $M_\mathrm{d} \gtrsim 10^{8}$ ${\rm M}_\odot$. This overabundance is
due to overproducing massive gas/metal-rich systems, but we also note that the relation between
stellar mass and gas-phase metallicity is reproduced fairly well by our recipe. The relation between
dust-to-gas ratio and metallicity shows a good agreement with the observed one at $z=0$, which indicates
successful implementation of dust evolution in our cosmological simulation. Star formation consumes
not only gas but also dust, causing a decreasing trend of the dust-to-stellar mass ratio at the high-mass
end of galaxies. We also examine the redshift evolution up to $z \sim~ 5$, and find that the galaxies
have on average the highest dust mass at $z = 1-2$. For the grain size distribution, we find that galaxies
with metallicity $\sim 0.3~ Z_\odot$ tend to have the highest small-to-large grain abundance ratio;
consequently, the extinction curves in those galaxies have the steepest ultraviolet slopes.
