We report on observations made with the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS) on the Hubble Space Telescope
(HST) using background QSOs to probe the circum-galactic medium (CGM) around 17 low-redshift galaxies
that are undergoing or have recently undergone a strong starburst (the COS-Burst program). The
sightlines extend out to roughly the virial radius of the galaxy halo. We construct control samples
of normal star-forming low-redshift galaxies from the COS/HST archive that match the starbursts
in terms of galaxy stellar mass and impact parameter. We find clear evidence that the CGM around the
starbursts differs systematically compared to the control galaxies. The Ly$\alpha$, Si III, C
IV, and possibly O VI absorption-lines are stronger as a function of impact parameter, and the ratios
of the equivalent widths of C IV/Ly$\alpha$ and Si III/Ly$\alpha$ are both larger than in normal
star-forming galaxies. We also find that the widths and the velocity offsets (relative to $v_{sys}$)
of the Ly$\alpha$ absorption-lines are significantly larger in the CGM of the starbursts, implying
velocities of the absorbing material that are roughly twice the halo virial velocity. We show that
these properties can be understood as a consequence of the interaction between a starburst-driven
wind and the pre-existing CGM. These results underscore the importance of winds driven from intensely
star-forming galaxies in helping drive the evolution of galaxies and the intergalactic medium.
They also offer a new probe of the properties of starburst-driven winds and of the CGM itself.
