GJ1214b stands out among the detected low-mass exoplanets, because it is, so far, the only one amenable
to transmission spectroscopy. Up to date there is no consensus about the composition of its envelope
although most studies suggest a high molecular weight atmosphere. In particular, it is unclear
if hydrogen and helium are present or if the atmosphere is water dominated. Here, we present results
on the composition of the envelope obtained by using an internal structure and evolutionary model
to fit the mass and radius data. By examining all possible mixtures of water and H/He, with the corresponding
opacities, we find that the bulk amount of H/He of GJ1214b is at most 7% by mass. In general, we find
the radius of warm sub-Neptunes to be most sensitive to the amount of H/He. We note that all (Kepler-11b,c,d,f,
Kepler-18b, Kepler-20b, 55Cnc-e, Kepler-36c and Kepler-68b) but one (Kepler-11e) of the discovered
low-mass planets so far have less than 10% H/He. In fact, Kepler-11e has 10-25% bulk H/He. Conversely,
little can be determined about the H2O or rocky content of sub-Neptune planets. We find that although
a 100% water composition fits the data for GJ1214b, based on formation constraints the presence
of heavier refractory material on this planet is expected, and hence, so is a component lighter than
water required. The same is true for Kepler-11f. A robust determination by transmission spectroscopy
of the composition of the upper atmosphere of GJ1214b will help determine the extent of compositional
segregation between the atmosphere and envelope.
