We present results from simulations of rotating magnetized turbulent convection in spherical
wedge geometry representing parts of the latitudinal and longitudinal extents of a star. Here we
consider a set of runs for which the density stratification is varied, keeping the Reynolds and Coriolis
numbers at similar values. In the case of weak stratification, we find quasi-steady dynamo solutions
for moderate rotation and oscillatory ones with poleward migration of activity belts for more rapid
rotation. For stronger stratification, the growth rate tends to become smaller. Furthermore,
a transition from quasi-steady to oscillatory dynamos is found as the Coriolis number is increased,
but now there is an equatorward migrating branch near the equator. The breakpoint where this happens
corresponds to a rotation rate that is about 3-7 times the solar value. The phase relation of the magnetic
field is such that the toroidal field lags behind the radial field by about $\pi/2$, which can be explained
by an oscillatory $\alpha^2$ dynamo caused by the sign change of the $\alpha$-effect about the equator.
We test the domain size dependence of our results for a rapidly rotating run with equatorward migration
by varying the longitudinal extent of our wedge. The energy of the axisymmetric mean magnetic field
decreases as the domain size increases and we find that an $m=1$ mode is excited for a full $2\pi$ azimuthal
extent, reminiscent of the field configurations deduced from observations of rapidly rotating
late-type stars.
