We obtained high temporal resolution spectroscopy of the unusual binary system AR Sco covering
nearly an orbit. The H$\alpha$ emission shows a complex line structure similar to that seen in some
polars during quiescence. Such emission is thought to be due to long-lived prominences originating
on the red dwarf. A difference between AR Sco and these other systems is that the white dwarf in AR Sco
is rapidly spinning relative to the orbital period. "Slingshot" prominences stable at 3 to 5 stellar
radii require surface magnetic fields between 100 and 500 G. This is comparable to the estimated
WD magnetic field strength near the surface of the secondary. Our time-resolved spectra also show
emission fluxes, line equivalent widths, and continuum color varying over the orbit and the beat/spin
periods of the system. During much of the orbit, the optical spectral variations are consistent
with synchrotron emission with the highest energy electrons cooling between pulses. On the time-scale
of the beat/spin period we detect red and blue-shifted H$\alpha$ emission flashes that reach velocities
of 700 km/s. Red-shifted Balmer emission flashes are correlated with the bright phases of the continuum
beat pulses while blue-shifted flashes appear to prefer the time of minimum in the beat light curve.
We propose that much of the energy generated in AR Sco comes from fast magnetic reconnection events
occurring near the inward face of the secondary and we show that the energy generated by magnetic
reconnection can account for the observed excess luminosity from the system.
