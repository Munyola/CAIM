There has been a long-lasting debate on the question of whether or not electric currents in solar
active regions are neutralized. That is, whether or not the main (or direct) coronal currents connecting
the active region polarities are surrounded by shielding (or return) currents of equal total value
and opposite direction. Both theory and observations are not yet fully conclusive regarding this
question, and numerical simulations have, surprisingly, barely been used to address it. Here we
quantify the evolution of electric currents during the formation of a bipolar active region by considering
a three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulation of the emergence of a sub-photospheric,
current-neutralized magnetic flux rope into the solar atmosphere. We find that a strong deviation
from current neutralization develops simultaneously with the onset of significant flux emergence
into the corona, accompanied by the development of substantial magnetic shear along the active
region's polarity inversion line. After the region has formed and flux emergence has ceased, the
strong magnetic fields in the region's center are connected solely by direct currents, and the total
direct current is several times larger than the total return current. These results suggest that
active regions, the main sources of coronal mass ejections and flares, are born with substantial
net currents, in agreement with recent observations. Furthermore, they support eruption models
that employ pre-eruption magnetic fields containing such currents.
