The Herschel SPIRE instrument consists of an imaging photometric camera and an imaging Fourier
Transform Spectrometer (FTS), both operating over a frequency range of 450-1550 GHz. In this paper,
we briefly review the FTS design, operation, and data reduction, and describe in detail the approach
taken to relative calibration (removal of instrument signatures) and absolute calibration against
standard astronomical sources. The calibration scheme assumes a spatially extended source and
uses the Herschel telescope as primary calibrator. Conversion from extended to point-source calibration
is carried out using observations of the planet Uranus. The model of the telescope emission is shown
to be accurate to within 6% and repeatable to better than 0.06% and, by comparison with models of Mars
and Neptune, the Uranus model is shown to be accurate to within 3%. Multiple observations of a number
of point-like sources show that the repeatability of the calibration is better than 1%, if the effects
of the satellite absolute pointing error (APE) are corrected. The satellite APE leads to a decrement
in the derived flux, which can be up to ~10% (1 sigma) at the high-frequency end of the SPIRE range in
the first part of the mission, and ~4% after Herschel operational day 1011. The lower frequency range
of the SPIRE band is unaffected by this pointing error due to the larger beam size. Overall, for well-pointed,
point-like sources, the absolute flux calibration is better than 6%, and for extended sources where
mapping is required it is better than 7%.
