Discoveries of extrasolar planets in the habitable zone (HZ) of their parent star lead to questions
about the habitability of massive moons orbiting planets in the HZ. Around low-mass stars, the HZ
is much closer to the star than for Sun-like stars. For a planet-moon binary in such a HZ, the proximity
of the star forces a close orbit for the moon to remain gravitationally bound to the planet. Under
these conditions the effects of tidal heating, distortion torques, and stellar perturbations
become important considerations for exomoon habitability. Utilizing a model that considers both
dynamical and tidal interactions simultaneously, we performed a computational investigation
into exomoon evolution for systems in the HZ of low-mass stars ($\lesssim 0.6\ M_{\odot}$). We show
that dwarf stars with masses $\lesssim 0.2\ M_{\odot}$ cannot host habitable exomoons within the
stellar HZ due to extreme tidal heating in the moon. Perturbations from a central star may continue
to have deleterious effects in the HZ up to $\approx 0.5\ M_{\odot}$, depending on the host planet's
mass and its location in the HZ, amongst others. In addition to heating concerns, torques due to tidal
and spin distortion can lead to the relatively rapid inward spiraling of a moon. Therefore, moons
of giant planets in HZs around the most abundant type of star are unlikely to have habitable surfaces.
In cases with lower intensity tidal heating the stellar perturbations may have a positive influence
on exomoon habitability by promoting long-term heating and possibly extending the HZ for exomoons.
