We present the first stereoscopic and Doppler observations of simultaneous transverse oscillations
of a prominence and a filament and longitudinal oscillation of another filament launched by a single
shock wave. Using H-alpha Doppler observations, we derive the three-dimensional oscillation
velocities at different heights along the prominence axis. The results indicate that the prominence
has a larger oscillation amplitude and damping time at higher altitude, but the periods at different
heights are the same (i.e., 13.5 minutes). This suggests that the prominence oscillates like a linear
vertical rigid body with one end anchored on the Sun. One of the filaments shows weak transverse oscillation
after the passing of the shock, which is possibly due to the low altitude of the filament and the weakening
(due to reflection) of the shock wave before the interaction. Large amplitude longitudinal oscillation
is observed in the other filament after the passing of the shock wave. The velocity amplitude and
period are about 26.8 km/s and 80.3 minutes, respectively. We propose that the orientation of a filament
or prominence relative to the normal vector of the incoming shock should be an important factor for
launching transverse or longitudinal filament oscillations. In addition, the restoring forces
of the transverse prominence are most likely due to the coupling of gravity and magnetic tension
of the supporting magnetic field, while that for the longitudinal filament oscillation is probably
the resultant force of gravity and magnetic pressure.
