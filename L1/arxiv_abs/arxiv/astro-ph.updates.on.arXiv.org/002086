In this paper, we show how the two-fluid equations describing the evolution of a dust and gas mixture
can be reformulated to describe a single fluid moving with the barycentric velocity of the mixture.
This leads to evolution equations for the total density, momentum, the differential velocity between
the dust and the gas phases and either the dust-to-gas ratio or the dust fraction. The equations are
similar to the usual equations of gas dynamics, providing a convenient way to extend existing codes
to simulate two-fluid mixtures without modifying the code architecture. Our approach avoids the
inherent difficulties related to the standard approach where the two phases are separate and coupled
via a drag term. In particular, the requirements of infinite spatial and temporal resolution as
the stopping time tends to zero are no longer necessary. This means that both small and large grains
can be straightforwardly treated with the same method, with no need for complicated implicit schemes.
Since there is only one resolution scale the method also avoids the problem of unphysical trapping
of one fluid (e.g. dust) below the resolution of the other. We also derive a simplified set of equations
applicable to the case of strong drag/small grains, consisting of the standard fluid equations
with a modified sound speed, plus an advection-diffusion equation for the dust-to-gas ratio. This
provides a simple and fast way to evolve the mixture when the stopping time is smaller than the Courant
timestep. We present a Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics implementation in a companion paper.
