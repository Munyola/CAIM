Penitentes are ablative features observed in snow and ice that, on Earth, are characterized by regular
cm to tens of cm spaced bowl-shaped depressions whose edges grade into tall spires up to several meters
tall (Nichols et al. 1939, Lliboutry et al. 1954, Claudin et al. 2015). While penitentes have been
suggested as an explanation for anomalous radar data on Europa (Hobley et al. 2013), hitherto no
penitentes have been identified conclusively on other planetary bodies. Regular ridges with spacing
of 3000 m to 5000 m and a depth of $\sim500$ m with morphologies that resemble penitentes (Fig. 1) have
been observed by the New Horizons spacecraft (Moore et al. 2016, Stern et al. 2015, Gladstone et al.
2016, Moore et al. 2017) in the Tartarus Dorsa (TD) region of Pluto (approximately 220-250$^\circ$
E, 0-20$^\circ$ N). Here we report simulations, based upon a recent model (Claudinet al. 2015) adapted
to conditions on Pluto (Gladstone et al. 2016, Toigo et al. 2015), that reproduce both the tri-modal
orientation and the spacing of these features by deepening penitentes. These penitentes deepen
by of order 1 cm per orbital cycle in the present era and grow only during periods of relatively high
atmospheric pressure, suggesting a formation timescale of several tens of millions of years, consistent
with cratering ages and the current atmospheric loss rate of methane. This time scale, in turn, implies
that the penitentes formed from initial topographic variations of no more than a few 10s of meters,
consistent with Pluto's youngest terrains.
