In a non-expanding universe surface brightness is independent of distance or redshift, while in
an expanding universe it decreases rapidly with both. Similarly, for objects of the same luminosity,
the angular radius of an object in a non-expanding universe declines with redshift, while in an expanding
universe this radius increases for redshifts z>1.25. The author and colleagues have previously
shown that data for the surface brightness of disk galaxies are compatible with a static universe
with redshift linearly proportional to distance at all z (SEU hypothesis). In this paper we examine
the more conventional hypothesis that the universe is expanding, but that the actual radii of galaxies
of a given luminosity increase with time (decrease with z), as others have proposed. We show that
the radii data for both disk and elliptical galaxies are incompatible with any of the published size-evolution
predictions based on an expanding universe. We find that all the physical mechanisms proposed for
size evolution, such as galaxy mergers, lead to predictions that are in quantitative contradiction
with either the radius data or other data sets, such as the observed rate of galaxy mergers. In addition,
we find that when the effect of telescope resolution is taken into account, the r-z relationships
for disk and elliptical galaxies are identical. Both are excellently fit by SEU predictions. An
overall comparison of cosmological models requires examining all available data-sets, but for
this data-set there is a clear contradiction of predictions based on an expanding universe hypothesis.
