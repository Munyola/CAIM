Interstellar graphene could be present in the interstellar medium (ISM), resulting from the photochemical
processing of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) molecules and/or collisional fragmentation
of graphitic particles. Indeed, by comparing the observed ultraviolet (UV) extinction and infrared
(IR) emission of the diffuse ISM with that predicted for graphene, as much as $\sim$ 2% of the total
interstellar carbon could have been locked up in graphene without violating the observational
constraints. While the possible detection of planar C$_{24}$, a small piece of a graphene sheet,
has been reported towards several Galactic and extragalactic planetary nebulae, graphene has
not yet been detected in interstellar environments. In this work, we search for the characteristic
IR features of C$_{24}$ at $\sim$ 6.6, 9.8, 20 $\mu m$ toward Sgr B2, a high-mass star formation region,
and find a candidate target toward R.A. (J2000) = $267^{\circ}.05855$ and Decl. (J2000) = $-28^{\circ}.01479$
in Sgr B2 whose Spitzer/IRS spectra exhibit three bands peaking at $\sim$ 6.637, 9.853 and 20.050
$\mu m$ which appear to be coincident with that of C$_{24}$. Possible features of C$_{60}$ are also
seen in this region. The candidate region is a warm dust environment heated by massive stars or star
clusters, associated with a WISE spot (a tracer of star-formation activity), close to the HII region
candidate IRAS 17450-2759, and is surrounded by seven young stellar object candidates within $\sim$
5$^{\prime}$, suggesting that the creation and/or excitation of C$_{24}$ could be related to star
formation activities.
