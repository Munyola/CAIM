Binaries within the sphere of influence of a massive black hole (MBH) are susceptible to the Lidov-Kozai
(LK) mechanism, which can drive binaries to high eccentricities and trigger strong interactions
such as the emission of gravitational waves (GWs), and, ultimately, mergers of compact objects.
These events are potential sources for GW detectors such as aLIGO and VIRGO. The LK mechanism is only
effective if the binary is highly inclined with respect to the MBH, implying low rates compared to
the inferred aLIGO rates. However, close to an MBH, \sqrt{N}-torques from the stellar cluster give
rise to vector resonant relaxation (VRR), which affects the orientation of the binary around the
MBH. This process can bring a binary with low inclination into an `active' LK regime in which high
eccentricities, and, subsequently, strong interactions are triggered. Here, we study the coupled
LK-VRR dynamics, with implications for aLIGO and VIRGO GW sources. We carry out population synthesis
simulations and find that the enhancement in the merger fraction is up to a factor of ~10 for the lower
end of MBH masses (M_MBH = 10e4 M_Sun), and decreases sharply with increasing M_MBH. For M_MBH = 10e4
M_Sun and with optimistic and highly uncertain assumptions, VRR can boost the merger rate from below
to above to lower limit inferred by aLIGO. This suggests that compact object mergers in galactic
nuclei may be dominated by low-mass MBHs, assuming the latter exist. The binary eccentricity when
reaching the aLIGO band in our simulations is slightly enhanced by VRR, but is small (~1e-5).
