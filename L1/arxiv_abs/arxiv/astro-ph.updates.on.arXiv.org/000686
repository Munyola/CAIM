FS Aur is famous for a variety of uncommon and puzzling periodic photometric and spectroscopic variabilities.
It was previously proposed that the precession of a fast-rotating magnetically accreting white
dwarf can successfully explain these phenomena. We present a study of FS Aur based on two extensive
sets of optical photometric observations and three X-ray data sets in which we intended to verify
whether the observational properties of the long period modulations observed in FS Aur and V455
And are similar in appearance to the spin modulation in ordinary IPs. These new optical observations
have revealed, for the first time in photometric data, the variability with the presumed precession
period of the white dwarf, previously seen only spectroscopically. We also found that the modulations
with the precession and orbital periods are evident in X-ray data. We show that the observed properties
of FS Aur closely resemble those of other intermediate polars, thus confirming this cataclysmic
variable as a member of the class. Our analysis of multicolour observations of intermediate polars
has shown that time-series analysis of colour indices appears to be a powerful technique for revealing
hidden variabilities and shedding light on their nature. We have found that the (B-I) power spectrum
of V1223 Sgr indicates the presence in the data of the spin pulsation which is not seen in the optical
light curve at all. Also, the analysis of the colour indices of V455 And revealed the presence of the
photometric variations which, similarly to FS Aur, was previously observed only spectroscopically.
