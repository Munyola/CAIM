Theoretical models for the expected merger rates of intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) are
vital for planned gravitational-wave detection experiments such as the Laser Interferometer
Space Antenna (LISA). Using collisionless $N$-body simulations of dwarf galaxy (DG) mergers,
we examine how the orbital decay of IMBHs and the efficiency of IMBH binary formation depend on the
central dark matter (DM) density profile of the merging DGs. Specifically, we explore various asymptotic
inner slopes $\gamma$ of the DG's DM density distribution, ranging from steep cusps ($\gamma=1$)
to shallower density profiles ($\gamma<1$), motivated by well-known baryonic-feedback effects
as well as by DM models that differ from cold DM at the scales of DGs. We find that the inner DM slope is
crucial for the formation (or lack thereof) of an IMBH binary; only mergers between DGs with cuspy
DM profiles ($\gamma=1$) are favourable to forming a hard IMBH binary, whereas when $\gamma<1$
the IMBHs stall at a separation of 50-100 pc. Consequently, the rate of LISA signals from IMBH coalescence
will be determined by the fraction of DGs with a cuspy DM profile. Conversely, the LISA event rates
at IMBH mass scales offer in principle a novel way to place constraints on the inner structure of DM
halos in DGs and address the core-cusp controversy. We also show that, with spatial resolutions
of $\sim$0.1 kpc, as often adopted in cosmological simulations, all IMBHs stall, independent of
$\gamma$. This suggests caution in employing cosmological simulations of galaxy formation to
study BH dynamics in DGs.
