A new sample of 204 low-mass black holes (LMBHs) in active galactic nuclei (AGNs) is presented with
black hole masses in the range of $(1-20) \times 10^5 M_{\odot}$. The AGNs are selected from a systematic
search among galaxies in the Data Release (DR) 7 of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), by careful
analyses of their optical spectra and precise measurement of spectral parameters. Combining them
with our previous sample selected from the SDSS DR 4 (Dong et al. 2012) makes it the largest LMBH sample
so far, totaling over 500 objects. Some of the statistical properties of the combined LMBH AGN sample
are briefly discussed, in the context of exploring the low-mass end of the AGN population. Their
X-ray luminosities follow the extension of the previously known correlation with the $ {\rm [O\,{\tiny
III}]}$ luminosity. The effective optical-to-X-ray spectral indices $\rm \alpha_{OX}$, albeit
a large scatter, are broadly consistent with the extension of the relation with the near-UV luminosity
$L_{\rm 2500 \AA}$. Interestingly, a correlation of $\rm \alpha_{OX}$ with black hole mass is also
found in the sense that $\rm \alpha_{OX}$ is statistically flatter (stronger X-ray relative to
optical) for lower black hole mass. Only 26 objects, mostly radio loud, were detected in radio at
20 cm in the FIRST survey, making a radio loud fraction of 4%. The host galaxies of LMBHs have stellar
masses in the range of $10^{8.8-12.4} M_{\odot}$ and optical colors typical of Sbc spirals. They
are dominated by young stellar populations which seem to have undergone a continuous star formation
history.
