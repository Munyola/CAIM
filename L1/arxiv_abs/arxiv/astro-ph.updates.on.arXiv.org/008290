We present a catalogue of local ($z<0.1$) galaxies that contain faint AGN. We select these objects
by identifying galaxies that exhibit a significant excess in their radio luminosities, compared
to what is expected from the observed levels of star-formation activity in these systems. This is
achieved by comparing the optical (spectroscopic) star formation rate (SFR) to the 1.4~GHz luminosity
measured from the FIRST survey. The majority of the AGN identified in this study are fainter than
those in previous work, such as in the Best and Heckman (2012) catalogue. We show that these faint
AGN make a non-negligible contribution to the radio luminosity function at low luminosities (below
$10^{22.5}$ W Hz$^{-1}$), and host $\sim$13 per cent of the local radio luminosity budget. Their
host galaxies are predominantly high stellar-mass systems (with a median stellar mass of $10^{11}\textrm{M}_{\odot}$),
are found across a range of environments (but typically in denser environments than star-forming
galaxies) and have early-type morphologies. This study demonstrates a general technique to identify
AGN in galaxy populations where reliable optical SFRs can be extracted using spectro-photometry
and where radio data are also available so that a radio excess can be measured. Our results also demonstrate
that it is unsafe to infer SFRs from radio emission \textit{alone}, even if bright AGN have been excluded
from a sample, since there is a significant population of faint radio AGN which may contaminate the
radio-derived SFRs.
