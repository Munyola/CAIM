The color-magnitude diagrams of many Magellanic Cloud clusters (with ages up to 2 billion years)
display extended turnoff regions where the stars leave the main sequence, suggesting the presence
of multiple stellar populations with ages which may differ even by hundreds million years (Mackey
et al. 2008, Milone et al. 2009, Girardi et al. 2011). A strongly debated question is whether such
an extended turnoff is instead due to populations with different stellar rotations (Girardi et
al. 2011, Goudfrooij et al. 2011, Rubele et al. 2013, Li et al. 2014). The recent discovery of a `split'
main sequence in some younger clusters (about 80--400Myr) added another piece to this puzzle. The
blue (red) side of the main sequence is consistent with slowly (rapidly) rotating stellar models
(D'Antona et al. 2015, Milone et al. 2016, Correnti et al. 2017, Milone et al 2016), but a complete
theoretical characterization of the observed color-magnitude diagram appeared to require also
an age spread (Correnti et al. 2017). We show here that, in three clusters so far analyzed, if the blue
main sequence stars are interpreted with models that have been always slowly rotating, they must
be about 30% younger than the rest of the cluster. If they are instead interpreted as stars initially
rapidly rotating, but that have later slowed down, the age difference disappears, and "braking"
also helps to explain the apparent age differences of the extended turnoff. The age spreads in Magellanic
Cloud clusters are a manifestation of rotational stellar evolution. Observational tests are suggested.
