We present gas-phase metallicity and ionization parameter maps of 25 star-forming face-on spiral
galaxies from the SAMI Galaxy Survey Data Release 1. Self-consistent metallicity and ionization
parameter maps are calculated simultaneously through an iterative process to account for the interdependence
of the strong emission line diagnostics involving ([OII]+[OIII])/H$\beta$ (R23) and [OIII]/[OII]
(O32). The maps are created on a spaxel-by-spaxel basis because HII regions are not resolved at the
SAMI spatial resolution. We combine the SAMI data with stellar mass, star formation rate (SFR),
effective radius (R$_e$), ellipticity, and position angles (PA) from the GAMA survey to analyze
their relation to the metallicity and ionization parameter. We find a weak trend of steepening metallicity
gradient with galaxy stellar mass, with values ranging from -0.03 to -0.20 dex/R$_e$. Only two galaxies
show radial gradients in ionization parameter. We find that the ionization parameter has no significant
correlation with either SFR, sSFR (specific star formation rate), or metallicity. For several
individual galaxies we find structure in the ionization parameter maps suggestive of spiral arm
features. We find a typical ionization parameter range of $7.0 < \log(q) < 7.8$ for our galaxy sample
with no significant overall structure. An ionization parameter range of this magnitude is large
enough to caution the use of metallicity diagnostics which have not considered the effects of a varying
ionization parameter distribution.
