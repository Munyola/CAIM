The presence of planets in binary systems poses interesting problems for planet formation theories,
both in cases where planets must have formed in very compact discs around the individual stars and
where they are located near the edge of the stable circumbinary region, where in situ formation is
challenging. Dust dynamics is expected to play an important role in such systems, since dust trapping
at the inner edge of circumbinary discs could aid in situ formation, but would simultaneously starve
the circumstellar discs of the solid material needed to form planets. Here we investigate the dynamics
of dust in binary systems using Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics. We find that all our simulations
tend towards dust trapping in the circumbinary disc, but the timescale on which trapping begins
depends on binary mass ratio ($q$) and eccentricity as well as the angular momentum of the infalling
material. For $q \gtrsim 0.1$, we find that dust can initially accrete onto the circumstellar discs,
but as the circumbinary cavity grows in radius, dust eventually becomes trapped in the circumbinary
disc. For $q = 0.01$, we find that increasing the binary eccentricity increases the time required
for dust trapping to begin. However, even this longer timescale is likely to be shorter than the planet
formation timescale in the inner disc and is insufficient to explain the observed pre-transitional
discs. This indicates that increase in companion eccentricity alone is not enough to allow significant
transfer of solids from the outer to the inner disc.
