Recent core-collapse supernova (CCSN) simulations have predicted several distinct features
in gravitational-wave (GW) spectrograms, including a ramp-up signature due to the g-mode oscillation
of the proto-neutron star (PNS) and an excess in the low-frequency domain (100-300 Hz) potentially
induced by the standing accretion shock instability (SASI). These predictions motivated us to
perform a sophisticated time-frequency analysis (TFA) of the GW signals, aimed at preparation
for future observations. By reanalyzing a gravitational waveform obtained in a three-dimensional
general-relativistic CCSN simulation, we show that both the spectrogram with an adequate window
and the quadratic TFA separate the multimodal GW signatures much more clearly compared with the
previous analysis. We find that the observed low-frequency excess during the SASI active phase
is divided into two components, a stronger one at 130 Hz and an overtone at 260 Hz, both of which evolve
quasi-statically during the simulation time. We also identify a new mode whose frequency varies
from 700 to 600 Hz. Furthermore, we develop the quadratic TFA for the Stokes I, Q, U, and V parameters
as a new tool to investigate the GW circular polarization. We demonstrate that the polarization
states that randomly change with time after bounce are associated with the PNS g-mode oscillation,
whereas a slowly changing polarization state in the low-frequency domain is connected to the PNS
core oscillation. This study demonstrates the capability of the sophisticated TFA for diagnosing
the polarized CCSN GWs in order to explore their complex nature.
