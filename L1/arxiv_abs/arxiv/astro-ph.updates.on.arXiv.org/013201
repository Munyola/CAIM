The larger-than-expected scatter in the opacity of the Ly$\alpha$ forest suggests that the metagalactic
ionizing background is strongly fluctuating at $z > 5.5$. Models for ionizing background fluctuations
predict a strong positive bias on large scales, so the environments of massive $>10^{12}\,{\rm
M}_\odot$ dark matter halos, e.g. $z\sim6$ quasar hosts, would be ideal laboratories to constrain
the sources of ionizing photons. While the quasars themselves should overwhelm any plausible ionizing
photon contribution from neighboring galaxies, proximate damped Ly$\alpha$ absorbers (DLAs)
have recently been discovered in the foreground of $z\sim6$ quasars, and the Ly$\alpha$ forest
in the shadow of these DLAs could probe the local ionization environment. Using Gpc$^3$ simulations
of $z=6$ ionizing background fluctuations, we show that while the Ly$\alpha$ forest signal from
ionization bias around a quasar host halo should be strong, it is likely suppressed by the associated
intergalactic matter overdensity. We also show that the quasar itself may still overwhelm the clustering
signal via a "ghost" of the proximity effect from the quasar radiation causing a large-scale bias
in the ionizing photon mean free path. This ghost proximity effect is sensitive to the lifetime and
geometry of quasar emission, potentially unlocking a new avenue for constraining these fundamental
quasar properties. Finally, we present observations of a $z\sim6$ quasar with a proximate DLA which
shows a strong excess in Ly$\alpha$ forest transmission at the predicted location of the ghost proximity
effect.
