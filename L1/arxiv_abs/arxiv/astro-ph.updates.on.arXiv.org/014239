We present the first X-ray reverberation mass measurement of a stellar-mass black hole. Accreting
stellar-mass and supermassive black holes display characteristic spectral features resulting
from reprocessing of hard X-rays by the accretion disc, such as an Fe K$\alpha$ line and a Compton
hump. This emission probes of the innermost region of the accretion disc through general relativistic
distortions to the line profile. However, these spectral distortions are insensitive to black
hole mass, since they depend on disc geometry in units of gravitational radii. Measuring the reverberation
lag resulting from the difference in path length between direct and reflected emission calibrates
the absolute length of the gravitational radius. We use a relativistic model able to reproduce the
behaviour of the lags as a function of energy for a wide range of variability timescales, addressing
both the reverberation lags on short timescales and the intrinsic hard lags on longer timescales.
We jointly fit the time-averaged spectrum and the real and imaginary parts of the cross-spectrum
as a function of energy for a range of Fourier frequencies to Rossi X-ray Timing Exporer data from
the X-ray binary Cygnus X-1. We also show that introducing a self-consistently calculated radial
ionisation profile in the disc improves the fit, but requires us to impose an upper limit on ionisation
profile peak to allow a plausible value of the accretion disc density. This limit leads to a mass value
more consistent with the existing dynamical measurement.
