The existence of stellar halos around galaxies is a natural prediction of the hierarchical nature
of the LambdaCDM model. Recent observations of Milky Way-like galaxies have revealed a wide range
in stellar halo mass, including cases with no statistically significant detection of a stellar
halo, as in the case of M101, NGC3351 and NGC1042. We use the Illustris simulation to investigate
the scatter in stellar halo content and, in particular, to study the formation of galaxies with the
smallest fraction of this diffuse component. Stellar halos are far from spherical, which diminishes
the surface brightness of the stellar halo for face-on disks. Once accounting for projection effects,
we find that the stellar halo fraction f_SH correlates strongly with galaxy morphology and star
formation rate, but not with environment, in agreement with observations. Galaxies with the lowest
stellar halo fractions are disk-dominated, star-forming and assemble their dark matter halos
on average earlier than galaxies with similar stellar masses. Accreted satellites are also lower
in stellar mass and have earlier infall times than centrals with high f_SH. In situ rather than accreted
stars dominate the stellar halos of galaxies with the lowest stellar halo fractions, with a transition
radius from in situ to accretion-dominated r~45 kpc. Our results extrapolated to real galaxies
such as M101 may indicate that these galaxies inhabit old halos which endured mergers only at higher
redshifts and evolved relatively unperturbed in the last ~10 Gyrs.
