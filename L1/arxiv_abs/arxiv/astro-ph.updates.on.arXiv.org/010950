Young and dynamically active planetary systems can form disks of debris that are easier to image
than the planets themselves. The morphology and evolution of these disks can help to infer the properties
of the putative planets responsible for generating and shaping the debris structures. We present
integral field spectroscopy and dual-band imaging from VLT/SPHERE ($1.0 - 1.7 \mu m$) of the debris
disk around the young F2V/F3V star HD 115600. We aim to 1) characterize the geometry and composition
of the debris ring, 2) search for thermal emission of young giant planets, and 3) in the absence of
detected planets, to refine the inferred properties of plausible planets around HD 115600 to prepare
future attempts to detect them. Using a different dust scattering model (ZODIPIC) than in the discovery
paper (Henyey-Greenstein) to model the disk geometry, we find $a_0 = 46 \pm 2$ au for the disk's central
radius and offsets $\Delta \alpha$, $\Delta \delta$ = $ -1.0 \pm 0.5, 0.5 \pm 0.5$ au. This offset
is smaller than previously found, suggesting that unseen planets of lower masses could be sculpting
the disk. Spectroscopy of the disk in Y-J bands with SPHERE shows reddish color, which becomes neutral
or slightly blue in H band seen with GPI, broadly consistent with a mixed bulk disk composition of
processed organics and water ice. While our observed field contains numerous background objects
at wide separations, no exoplanet has been directly observed to a mass sensitivity limit of $2-3(5-7)
M_{\rm J}$ between a projected separation of 40 and 200 au for hot (cold)-start models.
