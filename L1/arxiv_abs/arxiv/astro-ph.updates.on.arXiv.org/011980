The stability of the flow under the magnetic force is one of the classical problems in fluid mechanics.
In this paper, the flow in a rectangular duct with different Hartmann (Ha) number is simulated. The
finite volume method and the SIMPLE algorithm are used to solve a system of equations and the energy
gradient theory is then used to study the (associated) stability of magnetohydrodynamics (MHD).
The flow stability of MHD flow for different Hartmann (Ha) number, from Ha=1 to 40, at the fixed Reynolds
number, Re=190 are investigated. The simulation is validated firstly against the simulation in
literature. The results show that, with the increasing Ha number, the centerline velocity of the
rectangular duct with MHD flow decreases and the absolute value of the gradient of total mechanical
energy along the streamwise direction increases. The maximum of K appears near the wall in both coordinate
axis of the duct. According to the energy gradient theory, this position of the maximum of K would
initiate flow instability (if any) than the other positions. The higher the Hartmann number is,
the smaller the K value becomes, which means that the fluid becomes more stable in the presence of
higher magnetic force. As the Hartmann number increases, the K value in the parallel layer decreases
more significantly than in the Hartmann layer. The most dangerous position of instability tends
to migrate towards wall of the duct as the Hartmann number increases. Thus, with the energy gradient
theory, the stability or instability in the rectangular duct can be controlled by modulating the
magnetic force.
