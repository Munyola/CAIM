Globular clusters (GCs) are evolved stellar systems containing entire populations of millisecond
pulsars (MSPs), which are efficient gamma-ray emitters. Observations of this emission can be used
as a powerful tool to explore the dynamical processes leading to binary system formation in GCs.
In this work, 9 years of Fermi Large Area Telescope data were used to investigate the gamma-ray emission
from all GCs in the Milky Way. 23 clusters were found as gamma-ray bright, with 2 of them never having
been reported before. It was also found that magnetic braking probably has a smaller impact on the
formation rate of binary systems in metal-rich GCs than previously suggested, while a large value
for the two-body encounter rate seems to be a necessary condition. The influence of the encounter
rate per formed binary was for the first time explored in conjunction with gamma-ray data, giving
evidence that if this quantity is very high, binary systems will get destroyed before having time
to evolve into MSPs, thus decreasing the total number of MSPs in a GC. No extended emission was found
even for clusters whose optical extent is ~0.5 degrees; all of them are point-like sources spatially
in agreement with the optical cores of the GCs, supporting previous X-rays results of heavier objects
sinking into the clusters' cores via dynamical friction. The possibility of extrapolating these
results to ultra-compact dwarf galaxies is discussed, as these systems are believed to be the intermediate
case between GCs and dwarf galaxies.
