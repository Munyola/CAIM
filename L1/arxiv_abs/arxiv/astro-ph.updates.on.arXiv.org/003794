We describe a simple but efficient method for deriving a consistent set of monopole and dipole corrections
for multi-frequency sky map data sets, allowing robust parametric component separation with the
same data set. The computational core of this method is linear regression between pairs of frequency
maps, often called "T-T plots". Individual contributions from monopole and dipole terms are determined
by performing the regression locally in patches on the sky, while the degeneracy between different
frequencies is lifted when ever the dominant foreground component exhibits a significant spatial
spectral index variation. Based on this method, we present two different, but each internally consistent,
sets of monopole and dipole coefficients for the 9-year WMAP, Planck 2013, SFD 100 um, Haslam 408
MHz and Reich & Reich 1420 MHz maps. The two sets have been derived with different analysis assumptions
and data selection, and provides an estimate of residual systematic uncertainties. In general,
our values are in good agreement with previously published results. Among the most notable results
are a relative dipole between the WMAP and Planck experiments of 10-15 uK (depending on frequency),
an estimate of the 408 MHz map monopole of 8.9 +- 1.3 K, and a non-zero dipole in the 1420 MHz map of $0.15
+- 0.03 K pointing towards Galactic coordinates (l,b) = (308,-36) +- 14 degrees. These values represent
the sum of any instrumental and data processing offsets, as well as any Galactic or extra-Galactic
component that is spectrally uniform over the full sky.
