The most abundant stars in the Galaxy, M dwarfs, are very commonly hosts to diverse systems of low-mass
planets. Their abundancy implies that the general occurrence rate of planets is dominated by their
occurrence rate around such M dwarfs. In this article, we combine the M dwarf surveys conducted with
the HIRES/Keck, PFS/Magellan, HARPS/ESO, and UVES/VLT instruments supported with data from several
other instruments. We analyse the radial velocities of an approximately volume- and brightness-limited
sample of 426 nearby M dwarfs in order to search for Doppler signals of cadidate planets. In addition,
we analyse spectroscopic activity indicators and ASAS photometry to rule out radial velocity signals
corresponding to stellar activity as Doppler signals of planets. We calculate estimates for the
occurrence rate of planets around the sample stars and study the properties of this occurrence rate
as a function of stellar properties. Our analyses reveal a total of 118 candidate planets orbiting
nearby M dwarfs. Based on our results accounting for selection effects and sample detection threshold,
we estimate that M dwarfs have on average at least 2.39$^{+4.58}_{-1.36}$ planets per star orbiting
them. Accounting for the different sensitivities of radial velocity surveys and Kepler transit
photometry implies that there are at least 3.0 planets per star orbiting M dwarfs. We also present
evidence for a population of cool mini-Neptunes and Neptunes with indications that they are found
an order of magnitude more frequently orbiting the least massive M dwarfs in our sample.
