Context: Gravitational microlensing is sensitive to compact-object lenses in the Milky Way, including
white dwarfs, neutron stars or black holes, and could potentially probe a wide range of stellar remnant
masses. However, the mass of the lens can be determined only in very limited cases, due to missing
information on both source and lens distances and their proper motions. Aims: We aim at improving
the mass estimates in the annual parallax microlensing events found in the 8 years of OGLE-III observations
towards the Galactic Bulge (Wyrzykowski et al. 2016) with the use of Gaia Data Release 2 (DR2). Methods:
We use Gaia DR2 data on distances and proper motions of non-blended sources and recompute the masses
of lenses in parallax events. We also identify new events in that sample which are likely to have dark
lens; the total number of such events is now 18. Results: The derived distribution of masses of dark
lenses is consistent with a continuous distribution of stellar remnant masses. A mass gap between
neutron-star and black-hole masses in the range between 2 and 5 solar masses is not favoured by our
data, unless black holes receive natal-kicks above 20-80 km/s. We present 8 candidates for objects
with masses within the putative mass gap, including a spectacular multi-peak parallax event with
mass of $2.4^{+1.9}_{-1.3}\ M_\odot$ located just at 600 pc. The absence of an observational mass
gap between neutron stars and black holes, or, conversely, the evidence for black hole natal kicks
if a mass gap is assumed, can inform future supernova modelling efforts.
