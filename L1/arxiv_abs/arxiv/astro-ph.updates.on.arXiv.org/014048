We survey the highly ionized circumgalactic media (CGM) of 29 blindly selected galaxies at 0.49
< z_(gal) < 1.44 based on high-S/N ultraviolet spectra of z > 1 QSOs and the galaxy database from the
COS Absorption Survey of Baryon Harbors (CASBaH). We detect the Ne VIII doublet in nine of the galaxies,
and for gas with N(Ne VIII) > 10^13.3 cm^-2 (> 10^13.5 cm^-2), we derive a Ne VIII covering fraction
f_c = 75 +15/-25% (44 +22/-20%) within impact parameter (rho) < 200 kpc of M_* = 10^(9.5-11.5) Msol
galaxies and f_c = 70 +16/-22% (f_c = 42 +20/-17%) within rho < 1.5 virial radii. We estimate the mass
in Ne VIII-traced gas to be M_gas(Ne VIII) > 10^9.5 Msol (Z/Zsol)^-1, or 6-20% of the expected baryonic
mass if the Ne VIII absorbers have solar metallicity. Ionizing Ne VII to Ne VIII requires 207 eV, and
photons with this energy are scarce in the CGM. However, for the median halo mass and redshift of our
sample, the virial temperature is close to the peak temperature for the Ne VIII ion, and the Ne VIII-bearing
gas is plausibly collisionally ionized near this temperature. Moreover, we find that photoionized
Ne VIII requires cool and low-density clouds that would be highly underpressured (by approximately
two orders of magnitude) relative to the putative, ambient virialized medium, complicating scenarios
where such clouds could survive. Thus, more complex (e.g., non-equilibrium) models may be required;
this first statistical sample of Ne VIII absorber/galaxy systems will provide stringent constraints
for future CGM studies.
