Optical and near-IR (NIR) line profiles of many ageing core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) exhibit
an apparently asymmetric bluewards shift often attributed to greater extinction by internal dust
of redshifted radiation emitted from the receding regions of the SN ejecta. The DAMOCLES Monte Carlo
line radiative transfer code models the extent and shape of these dust-affected line profiles to
determine the dust mass that has condensed, in addition to other properties of the dusty ejecta.
I present here the application of an affine invariant Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) ensemble sampler
(emcee) to the DAMOCLES code in order to investigate the multi-dimensional parameter space rigorously
and characterise the posterior probability distribution. A likelihood function is formulated
that handles both Monte Carlo and observational uncertainties. This Bayesian approach is applied
to four simulated line profiles in order to test the method and investigate its efficacy. The majority
of parameters can be tightly constrained using this method, and a strong (predictable) dependence
between the grain size and the dust mass is quantified. The new approach is also applied to the H$\alpha$
line and [O I]6300,6363 \AA\ doublet of SN 1987A at 714d post-outburst, re-examining a previous
5-dimensional smooth model and also investigating a new, more complex, 10-dimensional model that
treats both features simultaneously. The dust mass, dust grain size and a range of other parameters
can be well constrained using this technique, representing a significant improvement over the
previous manual approach.
