`Imaka is a ground layer adaptive optics (GLAO) demonstrator on the University of Hawaii 2.2m telescope
with a 24'x18' field-of-view, nearly an order of magnitude larger than previous AO instruments.
In 15 nights of observing with natural guide star asterisms ~16' in diameter, we measure median AO-off
and AO-on empirical full-widths at half-maximum (FWHM) of 0''95 and 0''64 in R-band, 0''81 and 0''48
in I-band, and 0''76 and 0''44 at 1 micron. This factor of 1.5-1.7 reduction in the size of the point
spread function (PSF) results from correcting both the atmosphere and telescope tracking errors.
The AO-on PSF is uniform out to field positions ~5' off-axis, with a typical standard deviation in
the FWHM of 0''018. Images exhibit variation in FWMM by 4.5% across the field, which has been applied
as a correction to the aforementioned quantities. The AO-on PSF is also 10x more stable in time compared
to the AO-off PSF. In comparing the delivered image quality to proxy measurements, we find that in
both AO-off and AO-on data, delivered image quality is correlated with `imaka's telemetry, with
R-band correlation coefficients of 0.68 and 0.70, respectively. At the same wavelength, the data
are correlated to DIMM and MASS seeing with coefficients of 0.45 and 0.55. Our results are an essential
first step to implementing facility-class, wide-field GLAO on Maunakea telescopes, enabling
new opportunities to study extended astronomical sources, such as deep galaxy fields, nearby galaxies
or star clusters, at high angular resolution.
