A solar active region (AR) that produces at least one M- or X-class major flare tends to produce multiple
flares during its passage across the solar disk. It will be interesting if we can estimate how flare-productive
a given major flaring AR is for a time interval of several days, by investigating time series of its
photospheric magnetic field properties. For this, we studied 93 major flaring ARs observed from
2010 to 2016 by the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory
(SDO). More specifically, for each AR under study, the mean and fluctuation were calculated from
an 8-day time series of each of 18 photospheric magnetic parameters extracted from the Space-weather
HMI Active Region Patch (SHARP) vector magnetogram products at 12-min cadence. We then compared
these with the AR's 8-day flare index, which is defined as the sum of soft X-ray peak fluxes of flares
produced in the AR during the same interval of the 8-day SHARP parameter time series. As a result,
it is found that the 8-day flare index is well correlated with the mean and/or fluctuation values
of some magnetic parameters (with correlation coefficients of 0.6-0.7 in log-log space). Interestingly,
the 8-day flare index shows a slightly better correlation with the fluctuation than the mean for
the SHARP parameters associated with the surface integral of photospheric magnetic free energy
density. We also discuss how the correlation varies if the 8-day flare index is compared with the
mean or fluctuation calculated from an initial portion of the SHARP parameter time series.
