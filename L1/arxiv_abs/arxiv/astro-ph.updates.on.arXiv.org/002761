We report measurements of X-ray expansion of the youngest Galactic supernova remnant (SNR), G1.9+0.3,
using Chandra observations in 2007, 2009, and 2011. The measured rates strongly deviate from uniform
expansion, decreasing radially by about 60% along the X-ray bright SE-NW axis from 0."84% +/- 0."06%
per yr to 0."52% +/- 0."03% per yr. This corresponds to undecelerated ages of 120-190 yr, confirming
the young age of G1.9+0.3, and implying a significant deceleration of the blast wave. The spatially-integrated
dominantly synchrotron X-ray flux increases at 1.9% +/- 0.4% per yr. We identify the outer and inner
rims with the blast wave and reverse shock, respectively. Sudden large density gradients in either
ejecta or ambient medium are required to produce the sudden deceleration of the reverse shock or
the blast wave implied by the large spread in expansion ages. The blast wave could have been decelerated
recently by an encounter with a modest density discontinuity in the ambient medium, such as found
at a wind termination shock, requiring strong mass loss in the progenitor. Alternatively, the reverse
shock might have encountered an order-of-magnitude density discontinuity within the ejecta,
such as found in pulsating delayed-detonation Type Ia supernova models. We demonstrate that the
blast wave is much more decelerated than the reverse shock in these models for remnants at ages similar
to G1.9+0.3. Dense shells possibly associated with high-velocity features in Type Ia spectra may
also produce similar effects. Accounting for the asymmetry of G1.9+0.3 will require more realistic
3D Type Ia models.
