We present gas and stellar kinematics of a high-resolution zoom-in cosmological chemodynamical
simulation, which fortuitously captures the formation and evolution of a star-forming barred
spiral galaxy, from redshift $z\sim3$ to $z\sim2$ at the peak of the cosmic star formation rate.
The galaxy disc grows by accreting gas and substructures from the environment. The spiral pattern
becomes fully organised when the gas settles from a thick (with vertical dispersion $\sigma_{v}
>$ 50 km/s) to a thin ($\sigma_{v} \sim 25$ km/s) disc component in less than 1 Gyr. Our simulated disc
galaxy also has a central X-shaped bar, the seed of which formed by the assembly of dense gas-rich
clumps by $z \sim 3$. The star formation activity in the galaxy mainly happens in the bulge and in several
clumps along the spiral arms at all redshifts, with the clumps increasing in number and size as the
simulation approaches $z=2$. We find that stellar populations with decreasing age are concentrated
towards lower galactic latitudes, being more supported by rotation, and having also lower velocity
dispersion; furthermore, the stellar populations on the thin disc are the youngest and have the
highest average metallicities. The pattern of the spiral arms rotates like a solid body with a constant
angular velocity as a function of radius, which is much lower than the angular velocity of the stars
and gas on the thin disc; moreover, the angular velocity of the spiral arms steadily increases as
function of time, always keeping its radial profile constant. The origin of our spiral arms is also
discussed.
