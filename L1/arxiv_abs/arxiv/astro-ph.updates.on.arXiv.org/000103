We argue that type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are the result of head-on collisions of White Dwarfs (WDs)
in triple systems. The thermonuclear explosions resulting from the zero-impact-parameter collisions
of WDs are calculated from first principles by using 2D hydrodynamical simulations. Collisions
of typical WDs with masses 0.5-0.9 M_Sun result in explosions that synthesize Ni56 masses in the
range of 0.15-0.8 M_Sun, spanning the wide distribution of yields observed for the majority of SNe
Ia. The robustness of the shock ignition process is verified with a detailed study using a one-dimensional
toy model and analytic tools. The late-time (~50 days after peak) bolometric light curve is equal
to the instantaneous energy deposition and is calculated exactly, by solving the transport of gamma-rays
emitted by the decay of Ni56 using a Monte-Carlo code. All collisions are found to have the same late-time
light curves, when normalized to the amount of synthesized Ni56. This universal light curve is shown
to agree with the majority of the supernovae in the compilation made by M. Stritzinger to an accuracy
of better than 30% in the range 40<t<80 days after bolometric peak. The widths of the Ni56-mass-weighted-line-of-sight
velocity distributions are correlated with the Ni56 yield and in agreement with the observed Mazzali
relation. The continuous distribution of observed SN Ia features, is naturally reproduced with
the distribution of WD masses involved in the collisions. The effect of a non-zero impact parameter
requires further studies, using 3D hydrodynamical codes.
