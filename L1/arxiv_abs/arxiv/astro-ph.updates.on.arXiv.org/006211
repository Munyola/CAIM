HD 100453AB is a 10+/-2 Myr old binary whose protoplanetary disk was recently revealed to host a global
two-armed spiral structure. Given the relatively small projected separation of the binary (1.05",
or ~108 au), gravitational perturbations by the binary seemed to be a likely driving force behind
the formation of the spiral arms. However, the orbit of these stars remained poorly understood,
which prevented a proper treatment of the dynamical influence of the companion on the disk. We observed
HD 100453AB between 2015-2017 utilizing extreme adaptive optics systems on the Very Large Telescope
and Magellan Clay Telescope. We combined the astrometry from these observations with published
data to constrain the parameters of the binary's orbit to a=1.06"+/-0.09", e=0.17+/-0.07, and
i=32.5+/- 6.5 degrees. We utilized publicly available ALMA CO data to constrain the inclination
of the disk to i~28 degrees, which is relatively co-planar with the orbit of the companion and consistent
with previous estimates from scattered light images. Finally, we input these constraints into
hydrodynamical and radiative transfer simulations to model the structural evolution of the disk.
We find that the spiral structure and truncation of the circumprimary disk in HD 100453 are consistent
with a companion-dirven origin. Furthermore, we find that the primary star's rotation, its outer
disk, and the companion exhibit roughly the same direction of angular momentum, and thus the system
likely formed from the same parent body of material.
