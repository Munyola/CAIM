X-ray measurements suggest the abundance of Calcium in the intracluster medium is higher than can
be explained using favored models for core-collapse and Type Ia supernovae alone. We investigate
whether the Calcium conundrum in the intracluster medium can be alleviated by including a contribution
from the recently discovered subclass of supernovae known as Calcium-rich gap transients. Although
the Calcium-rich gap transients make up only a small fraction of all supernovae events, we find that
their high Calcium yields are sufficient to reproduce the X-ray measurements found for nearby rich
clusters. We find the $\chi^{2}$ goodness-of-fit metric improves from 84 to 2 by including this
new class. Moreover, Calcium-rich supernovae preferentially occur in the outskirts of galaxies
making it easier for the nucleosynthesis products of these events to be incorporated in the intracluster
medium via ram-pressure stripping. The discovery of a Calcium-rich gap transients in clusters
and groups far from any individual galaxy suggests supernovae associated with intracluster stars
may play an important role in enriching the intracluster medium. Calcium-rich gap transients may
also help explain anomalous Calcium abundances in many other astrophysical systems including
individual stars in the Milky Way, the halos of nearby galaxies and the circumgalactic medium. Our
work highlights the importance of considering the diversity of supernovae types and corresponding
yields when modeling the abundance of the intracluster medium and other gas reservoirs.
