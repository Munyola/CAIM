Chemical tagging has great promise as a technique to unveil our Galaxy's history. Grouping stars
based on their similar chemistry can establish details of the star formation and merger history
of the Milky Way. With precise measurements of stellar chemistry, chemical tagging may be able to
group together stars born from the same gas cloud, regardless of their current positions and kinematics.
Successfully tagging these birth clusters requires high quality chemical space information and
a good cluster-finding algorithm. To test the feasibility of chemical tagging on data from current
and upcoming spectroscopic surveys, we construct a realistic set of synthetic clusters, creating
both observed spectra and derived chemical abundances for each star. We use Density-Based Spatial
Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) to group stars based on their spectra or abundances;
these groups are matched to input clusters and are found to be highly homogeneous and complete. The
percentage of clusters with more than 10 members recovered is 40% when tagging on abundances with
uncertainties achievable with current techniques. Based on our fiducial model for the Milky Way,
we predict recovering over 600 clusters with at least 10 observed members and 70% membership homogeneity
in a sample similar to the APOGEE survey. Tagging larger surveys like the GALAH survey and the future
Milky Way Mapper in SDSS V could recover tens of thousands of clusters at high homogeneity. Access
to so many unique co-eval clusters will transform how we understand the star formation history and
chemical evolution of our Galaxy.
