While the number of exoplanets discovered continues to increase at a rapid rate, we are still to discover
any system that truly resembles the Solar system. Existing and near future surveys will likely continue
this trend of rapid discovery. To see if these systems are Solar system analogues, we will need to
efficiently allocate resources to carry out intensive follow-up observations. We seek to uncover
the properties and trends across systems that indicate how much of the habitable zone is stable in
each system to provide focus for planet hunters. We study the dynamics of all known single Jovian
planetary systems, to assess the dynamical stability of the habitable zone around their host stars.
We perform a suite of simulations of all systems where the Jovian planet will interact gravitationally
with the habitable zone, and broadly classify these systems. Besides the system's mass ratio (Mpl/Mstar),
and the Jovian planet's semi-major axis (apl) and eccentricity (epl), we find that there are no underlying
system properties which are observable that indicate the potential for planets to survive within
the system's habitable zone. We use Mpl/Mstar, apl and epl to generate a parameter space over which
the unstable systems cluster, thus allowing us to predict which systems to exclude from future observational
or numerical searches for habitable exoplanets. We also provide a candidate list of 20 systems that
have completely stable habitable zones and Jovian planets orbiting beyond the habitable zone as
potential first order Solar system analogues.
