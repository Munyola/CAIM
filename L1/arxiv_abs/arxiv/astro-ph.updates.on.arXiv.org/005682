The variability of young stellar objects is mostly driven by star-disk interactions. In long-term
photometric monitoring of the accreting T Tauri star GI Tau, we detect extinction events with typical
depths of $\Delta V \sim 2.5$ mag that last for days-to-months and often appear to occur stochastically.
In 2014 - 2015, extinctions that repeated with a quasi-period of 21 days over several months is the
first empirical evidence of slow warps predicted from MHD simulations to form at a few stellar radii
away from the central star. The reddening is consistent with $R_V=3.85\pm0.5$ and, along with an
absence of diffuse interstellar bands, indicates that some dust processing has occurred in the
disk. The 2015 -- 2016 multi-band lightcurve includes variations in spot coverage, extinction,
and accretion, each of which results in different traces in color-magnitude diagrams. This lightcurve
is initially dominated by a month-long extinction event and return to the unocculted brightness.
The subsequent light-curve then features spot modulation with a 7.03 day period, punctuated by
brief, randomly-spaced extinction events. The accretion rate measured from $U$-band photometry
ranges from $1.3\times10^{-8}$ to $1.1\times10^{-10}$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ (excluding the highest
and lowest 5% of high- and low- accretion rate outliers), with an average of $4.7 \times 10^{-9}$
M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$. A total of 50% of the mass is accreted during bursts of $>12.8\times10^{-9}$
M$_\odot$ yr${^{-1}}$, which indicates limitations on analyses of disk evolution using single-epoch
accretion rates.
