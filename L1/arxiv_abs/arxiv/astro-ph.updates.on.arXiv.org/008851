We analyze the stellar growth of Brightest Cluster Galaxies (BCGs) produced by cosmological zoom-in
hydrodynamical simulations of the formation of massive galaxy clusters. The evolution of the stellar
mass content is studied considering different apertures, and tracking backwards either the main
progenitor of the $z=0$ BCG or that of the cluster hosting the BCG at $z=0$. Both methods lead to similar
results up to $z \simeq 1.5$. The simulated BCGs masses at $z=0$ are in agreement with recent observations.
In the redshift interval from $z=1$ to $z=0$ we find growth factors 1.3, 1.6 and 3.6 for stellar masses
within 30kpc, 50kpc and 10% of $R_{500}$ respectively. The first two factors, and in general the
mass evolution in this redshift range, are in agreement with most recent observations. The last
larger factor is similar to the growth factor obtained by a semi-analytical model (SAM). Half of
the star particles that end up in the inner 50 kpc was typically formed by redshift $\sim$ 3.7, while
the assembly of half of the BCGs stellar mass occurs on average at lower redshifts $\sim 1.5$. This
assembly redshift correlates with the mass attained by the cluster at high $z \gtrsim 1.3$, due to
the broader range of the progenitor clusters at high-$z$. The assembly redshift of BCGs decreases
with increasing apertures. Our results are compatible with the {\it inside-out} scenario. Simulated
BCGs could lack intense enough star formation (SF) at high redshift, while possibly exhibit an excess
of residual SF at low redshift.
