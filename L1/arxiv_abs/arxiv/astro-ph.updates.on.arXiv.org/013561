Despite its dominance, hydrogen has been largely ignored in studies of the abundance patterns of
the chemical elements in gradual solar energetic-particle (SEP) events; those neglected abundances
show a surprising new pattern of behavior. Abundance enhancements of elements with 2 <= Z <= 56, relative
to coronal abundances, show a power-law dependence, versus their average mass-to-charge ratio
A/Q, that varies from event to event and with time during events. The ion charge states Q depend upon
the source plasma temperature T. For most gradual SEP events, shock waves have accelerated ambient
coronal material with T < 2 MK with decreasing power-laws in A/Q. In this case, the proton abundances
agree rather well with the power-law fits extrapolated from elements with Z >= 6 at A/Q > 2 down to hydrogen
at A/Q = 1. Thus the abundances of the elements with Z >= 6 fairly accurately predict the observed abundance
of H, at a similar velocity, in most SEP events. However, for those gradual SEP events where ion enhancements
follow positive powers of A/Q, especially those with T > 2 MK where shock waves have reaccelerated
residual suprathermal ions from previous impulsive SEP events, proton abundances commonly exceed
the extrapolated expectation, usually by a factor of order ten. This is a new and unexpected pattern
of behavior that is unique to the abundances of protons and may be related to the need for more streaming
protons to produce sufficient waves for scattering and acceleration of more heavy ions at the shock.
