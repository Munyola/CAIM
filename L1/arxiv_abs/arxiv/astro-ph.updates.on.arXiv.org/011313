We present the curation and verification of a new combined optical and near infrared dataset for
cosmology and astrophysics, derived from the combination of $ugri$-band imaging from the Kilo
Degree Survey (KiDS) and $ZY\!J\!H\!K_{\rm s}$-band imaging from the VISTA Kilo degree Infrared
Galaxy (VIKING) survey. This dataset is unrivaled in cosmological imaging surveys due to its combination
of area ($458$ deg$^2$ before masking), depth ($r\le25$), and wavelength coverage ($ugriZY\!J\!H\!K_{\rm
s}$). The combination of survey depth, area, and (most importantly) wavelength coverage allows
significant reductions in systematic uncertainties (i.e. reductions of between 10 and 60\% in
bias, outlier rate, and scatter) in photometric-to-spectroscopic redshift comparisons, compared
to the optical-only case at photo-$z$ above $0.7$. The complementarity between our optical and
NIR surveys means that over $80\%$ of our sources, across all photo-$z$, have significant detections
(i.e. not upper limits) in our $8$ reddest bands. We derive photometry, photo-$z$, and stellar masses
for all sources in the survey, and verify these data products against existing spectroscopic galaxy
samples. We demonstrate the fidelity of our higher-level data products by constructing the survey
stellar mass functions in 8 volume-complete redshift bins. We find that these photometrically
derived mass functions provide excellent agreement with previous mass evolution studies derived
using spectroscopic surveys. The primary data products presented in this paper are publicly available
