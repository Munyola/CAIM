The growth of solids from sub-micron to millimeter and centimeter sizes is the early step toward
the formation of planets inside protoplanetary disks (PPDs). However, such processes and their
potential impact on the later stages of solid growth are still poorly understood. In this work, we
test the hypothesis that most disks contain at least one ringed structure with a relative small radius.
We have carried out a large family of 1D two-fluid (gas+dust) hydrodynamical simulations by evolving
the gas and dust motion self-consistently while allowing dust size to evolve via coagulation and
fragmentation. We investigate the joint effects of ringed structures and dust size growth on the
overall sub-millimeter and millimeter (mm) flux and spectral index of PPDs. Ringed structures
slow down the dust radial drift and speed up the dust growth. In particular, we find that those unresolved
disks with a high fragmentation velocity ($\sim10\ {\rm m~s^{-1}}$) and a high dust surface density
($\sim10\ {\rm g\ cm^{-2}}$ in the ring) can have mm spectral indices as low as $\sim2.0$, consistent
with mm observations of faint disks in nearby star forming regions. Furthermore, disks with more
than one ringed structure can potentially reproduce brighter disks with spectral indices lower
than $\sim2.5$. Future multi-wavelength high-resolution observations of these low spectral
index sources can be used to test the existence of the ringed structures in the unresolved disks and
differentiate the effects of dust size growth from optical depth.
