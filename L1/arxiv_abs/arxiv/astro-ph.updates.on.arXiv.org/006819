We present a study on the robustness of the covariance matrix estimation for galaxy clustering measurements
depending on the cosmological parameters and galaxy bias. To this end, we have produced 9000 galaxy
mock catalogues relying on the effective Zel'dovich approximation implemented in the EZmocks
computer code, using different input cosmological models and bias parameters. The reference catalogue
has also been produced with this code making our study insensitive to the approximation at least
on a relative-qualitative level. Our findings indicate that the covariance matrix is insensitive
to the input power spectrum (including $\sigma_8$), as long as the 2- and 3-point galaxy clustering
measurements agree with the given data. In fact, the covariance matrix shows a bias at small scales
($r\lesssim40 h^{-1}$Mpc) when the chosen galaxy bias parameters yield a 3-point statistics,
which is not compatible with the reference one within the error bars, even though the 2-point statistics
agree within 1%. Nevertheless, the error becomes negligible at large scales making the covariance
matrix still reliable for data analysis using only measurements in that regime (e.g., measuring
baryon acoustic oscillations). High precision in cosmological parameter estimation is expected
for covariance matrices extracted from mock galaxy catalogues which take accurately into account
both the 2- and the 3- point statistics. This is independent of whether this is achieved by using the
right cosmology and galaxy bias (which are not a priori known) or just any combination of both fitting
the net observed galaxy clustering.
