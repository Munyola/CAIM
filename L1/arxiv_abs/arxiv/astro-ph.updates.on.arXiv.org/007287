We present a detailed analysis of the X-ray/IR fast variability of the Black-Hole Transient GX 339-4
during its low/hard state in August 2008. Thanks to simultaneous high time-resolution observations
made with the VLT and RXTE, we performed the first characterisation of the sub-second variability
in the near-infrared band - and of its correlation with the X-rays - for a low-mass X-ray binary, using
both time and frequency-domain techniques. We found a power-law correlation between the X-ray
and infrared fluxes when measured on timescales of 16 seconds, with a marginally variable slope,
steeper than the one found on timescales of days at similar flux levels. We suggest the variable slope
- if confirmed - could be due to the infrared flux being a non-constant combination of both optically
thin and optically thick synchrotron emission from the jet, as a result of a variable self-absorption
break. From cross spectral analysis we found an approximately constant infrared time lag of $\approx$
0.1s, and a very high coherence of $\approx$ 90 per cent on timescales of tens of seconds, slowly decreasing
toward higher frequencies. Finally, we report on the first detection of a linear rms-flux relation
in the emission from a low-mass X-ray binary jet, on timescales where little correlation is found
between the X-rays and the jet emission itself. This suggests that either the inflow variations
and jet IR emission are coupled by a non-linear or time-variable transform, or that the IR rms-flux
relation is not transferred from the inflow to the jet, but is an intrinsic property of emission processes
in the jet.
