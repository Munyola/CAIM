We investigate the clustering properties of radio sources in the Alternative Data Release 1 of the
TIFR GMRT Sky Survey (TGSS), focusing on large angular scales, where previous analyses have detected
a large clustering signal. After appropriate data selection, the TGSS sample we use contains ~110,000
sources selected at 150 MHz over ~70% of the sky. The survey footprint is largely superimposed on
that of the NRAO VLA Sky Survey (NVSS) with the majority of TGSS sources having a counterpart in the
NVSS sample. These characteristics make TGSS suitable for large-scale clustering analyses and
facilitate the comparison with the results of previous studies. In this analysis we focus on the
angular power spectrum, although the angular correlation function is also computed to quantify
the contribution of multiple-component radio sources. We find that on large angular scales, corresponding
to multipoles $2 \leq \ell \leq 30$, the amplitude of the TGSS angular power spectrum is significantly
larger than that of the NVSS. We do not identify any observational systematic effects that may explain
this mismatch. We have produced a number of physically motivated models for the TGSS angular power
spectrum and found that all of them fail to match observations, even when taking into account observational
and theoretical uncertainties. The same models provide a good fit to the angular spectrum of the
NVSS sources. These results confirm the anomalous nature of the TGSS large-scale power, which has
no obvious physical origin and seems to indicate that unknown systematic errors are present in the
TGSS dataset.
