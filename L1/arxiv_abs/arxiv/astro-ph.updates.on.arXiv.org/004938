We present simulations of magnetized astrophysical shocks taking into account the interplay between
the thermal plasma of the shock and supra-thermal particles. Such interaction is depicted by combining
a grid-based magneto-hydrodynamics description of the thermal fluid with particle in cell techniques
devoted to the dynamics of supra-thermal particles. This approach, which incorporates the use
of adaptive mesh refinement features, is potentially a key to simulate astrophysical systems on
spatial scales that are beyond the reach of pure particle-in-cell simulations. We consider in this
study non-relativistic shocks with various Alfv\'enic Mach numbers and magnetic field obliquity.
We recover all the features of both magnetic field amplification and particle acceleration from
previous studies when the magnetic field is parallel to the normal to the shock. In contrast with
previous particle-in-cell-hybrid simulations, we find that particle acceleration and magnetic
field amplification also occur when the magnetic field is oblique to the normal to the shock but on
larger timescales than in the parallel case. We show that in our simulations, the supra-thermal
particles are experiencing acceleration thanks to a pre-heating process of the particle similar
to a shock drift acceleration leading to the corrugation of the shock front. Such oscillations of
the shock front and the magnetic field locally help the particles to enter the upstream region and
to initiate a non-resonant streaming instability and finally to induce diffuse particle acceleration.
