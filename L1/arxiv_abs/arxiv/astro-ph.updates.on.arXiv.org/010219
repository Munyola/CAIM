Constraints on primordial non-Gaussianity will shed light on the origin of primordial fluctuations
and the physics of the early universe. The intensity mapping technique is a promising probe of structure
formation on large scales; at high redshifts, it can provide complimentary information to other
cosmological probes. We explore the potential of future wide-field [CII] and CO intensity mapping
surveys in constraining primordial non-Gaussianity of the local shape, which induces a distinct,
scale-dependent correction to the line bias. We explore the parameter space of CO and [CII] survey
designs which can achieve the nominal target of $\sigma(f_{\rm NL}^{\rm loc}) =1$, and further
calculate what constraints such surveys can place on primordial non-Gaussianity of the equilateral,
orthogonal and quasi-single field shapes. We further test the dependence of these constraints
on various model assumptions; namely the halo mass function, modeling of line bias, and correlation
between mass and [CII]/CO luminosity. We find that the ability of CO and [CII] intensity mapping
surveys to constrain $f_{\rm NL}^{\rm loc}$ relies heavily on the spectral (redshift) coverage,
requiring at least a coverage of an octave in frequency, to produce significant results, with the
optimized surveys generally covering between $z\sim[2-8]$. As this redshift window partially
overlaps with 21-cm EoR experiments like HERA, we additionally explore the prospects for a hypothetical
set of surveys to place constraints on $\sigma(f_{\rm NL}^{\rm loc})$ utilizing multi-tracer
analysis between lines of HI, CO, and [CII].
