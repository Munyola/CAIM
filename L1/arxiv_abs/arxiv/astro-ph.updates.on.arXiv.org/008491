We present the results of an investigation of the dredge-up and mixing during the merger of two white
dwarfs with different chemical compositions by conducting hydrodynamic simulations of binary
mergers for three representative mass ratios. In all the simulations, the total mass of the two white
dwarfs is $\lesssim1.0~{\rm M_\odot}$. Mergers involving a CO and a He white dwarf have been suggested
as a possible formation channel for R Coronae Borealis type stars, and we are interested in testing
if such mergers lead to conditions and outcomes in agreement with observations. Even if the conditions
during the merger and subsequent nucleosynthesis favor the production of $^{18}{\mathrm O}$,
the merger must avoid dredging up large amounts of $^{16}{\mathrm O}$, or else it will be difficult
to produce sufficient $^{18}{\mathrm O}$ to explain the oxygen ratio observed to be of order unity.
We performed a total of 9 simulations using two different grid-based hydrodynamics codes using
fixed and adaptive meshes, and one smooth particle hydrodynamics (SPH) code. We find that in most
of the simulations, $>10^{-2}~{\rm M_\odot}$ of $^{16}{\mathrm O}$ is indeed dredged up during
the merger. However, in SPH simulations where the accretor is a hybrid He/CO white dwarf with a $\sim
0.1~{\rm M_\odot}$ layer of helium on top, we find that no $^{16}{\mathrm O}$ is being dredged up,
while in the $q=0.8$ simulation $<10^{-4}~{\rm M_\odot}$ of $^{16}{\mathrm O}$ has been brought
up, making a WD binary consisting of a hybrid CO/He WD and a companion He WD an excellent candidate
for the progenitor of RCB stars.
