Kepler-62f is the first exoplanet small enough to plausibly have a rocky composition orbiting within
the habitable zone (HZ) discovered by the Kepler Mission. The planet is 1.4 times the size of the Earth
and has an orbital period of 267 days. At the time of its discovery, it had the longest period of any
small planet in the habitable zone of a multi-planet system. Because of its long period, only four
transits were observed during Kepler's interval of observations. It was initially missed by the
Kepler pipeline, but the first three transits were identified by an independent search by Eric Agol,
and it was identified as a planet candidate in subsequent Kepler catalogs. However in the latest
catalog of exoplanets (Thompson et al., 2018), it is labeled as a false positive. Recent exoplanet
catalogues have evolved from subjective classification to automatic classifications of planet
candidates by algorithms (such as `Robovetter'). While exceptionally useful for producing a uniform
catalogue, these algorithms sometimes misclassify planet candidates as a false positive, as is
the case of Kepler-62f. In particularly valuable cases, i.e., when a small planet has been found
orbiting in the habitable zone (HZ), it is important to conduct comprehensive analyses of the data
and classification protocols to provide the best estimate of the true status of the detection. In
this paper we conduct such analyses and show that Kepler-62f is a true planet and not a false positive.
