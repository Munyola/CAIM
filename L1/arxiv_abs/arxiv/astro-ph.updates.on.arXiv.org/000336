In this paper we present the first formulation of the theory of non-linear particle acceleration
in collisionless shocks in the presence of neutral hydrogen in the acceleration region. The dynamical
reaction of the accelerated particles, the magnetic field amplification and the magnetic dynamical
effects on the shock are also included. The main new aspect consists however in accounting for charge
exchange and ionization of neutral hydrogen, which profoundly change the structure of the shock,
as discussed in our previous work. This important dynamical effect of neutrals is mainly associated
to the so-called neutral return flux, namely the return of hot neutrals from the downstream region
to the upstream, where they deposit energy and momentum through charge exchange and ionization.
We also present the self-consistent calculation of Balmer line emission from the shock region and
discuss how to use measurements of the anomalous width of the different components of the Balmer
line to infer the cosmic ray acceleration efficiency in supernova remnants showing Balmer emission:
the broad Balmer line, which is due to charge exchange of hydrogen atoms with hot ions downstream
of the shock, is shown to become narrower as a result of the energy drainage into cosmic rays, while
the narrow Balmer line, due to charge exchange in the cosmic-ray--induced precursor, is shown to
become broader. In addition to these two well-known components, the neutral return flux leads to
the formation of a third component with intermediate width: this too contains information on ongoing
processes at the shock.
