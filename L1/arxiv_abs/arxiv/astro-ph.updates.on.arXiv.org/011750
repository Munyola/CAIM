We report the discovery of a large, dynamically cold, coeval stellar stream that is currently traversing
the immediate solar neighborhood at a distance of only 100 pc. The structure was identified in a wavelet
decomposition of the 3D velocity space of all stars within 300 pc to the Sun. Its members form a highly
elongated structure with a length of at least 400 pc, while its vertical extent measures only about
50 pc. Stars in the stream are not isotropically distributed but instead form two parallel lanes
with individual local overdensities, that may correspond to a remnant core of a tidally disrupted
cluster or OB association. Its members follow a very well-defined main sequence in the observational
Hertzsprung-Russel diagram and also show a remarkably low 3D velocity dispersion of only 1.3 km
s$^{-1}$. These findings strongly suggest a common origin as a single coeval stellar population.
An extrapolation of the present-day mass function indicates a total mass of at least 2000 M$_\odot$,
making it larger than most currently known clusters or associations in the solar neighborhood.
We estimated the stream's age to be around 1 Gyr based on a comparison with a set of isochrones and giant
stars in our member selection and find a mean metallicity of $\left[ \mathrm{Fe/H} \right] = -0.04$.
This structure may very well represent the Galactic disk counterpart to the prominent stellar streams
observed in the Milky Way halo. As such, it constitutes a new valuable probe to constrain the Galaxy's
mass distribution.
