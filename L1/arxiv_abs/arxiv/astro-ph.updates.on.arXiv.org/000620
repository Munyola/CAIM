Context: Cosmic rays are thought to be accelerated at supernova remnant (SNR) shocks, but conclusive
evidence is lacking. Aims: New data from ground-based gamma-ray telescopes and the Large Area Telescope
on the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope are used to test this hypothesis. A simple model for gamma-ray
production efficiency is compared with measured gamma-ray luminosities of SNRs, and the GeV to
TeV fluxes ratios of SNRs are examined for correlations with SNR ages. Methods: The supernova explosion
is modeled as an expanding spherical shell of material that sweeps up matter from the surrounding
interstellar medium (ISM). The accumulated kinetic energy of the shell, which provides the energy
available for nonthermal particle acceleration, changes when matter is swept up from the ISM and
the SNR shell decelerates. A fraction of this energy is assumed to be converted into the energy of
cosmic-ray electrons or protons. Three different particle radiation processes---nuclear pion-production
interactions, nonthermal electron bremsstrahlung, and Compton scattering---are considered.
Results: The efficiencies for gamma-ray production by these three processes are compared with
gamma-ray luminosities of SNRs. Our results suggest that SNRs become less gamma-ray luminous at
>~ 10^4 yr, and are consistent with the hypothesis that supernova remnants accelerate cosmic
rays with an efficiency of ~10% for the dissipation of kinetic energy into nonthermal cosmic rays.
Weak evidence for an increasing GeV to TeV flux ratio with SNR age is found.
