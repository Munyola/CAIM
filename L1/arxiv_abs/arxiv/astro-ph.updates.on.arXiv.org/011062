Ammonia, if present in the ice shells of icy satellites, could lower the temperature for the onset
of melting to 176 K and create a large temperature range where partial melt is thermally stable. The
evolution of regions of ammonia-rich partial melt could strongly influence the geological and
thermal evolution of icy bodies. For melt to be extracted from partially molten regions, the surrounding
solid matrix must deform and compact. Whether ammonia-rich melts sink to the subsurface ocean or
become frozen into the ice shell depends on the compaction rate and thermal evolution. Here we construct
a model for the compaction and thermal evolution of a partially molten, ammonia-rich ice shell in
a one-dimensional geometry. We model the thickening of an initially thin ice shell above an ocean
with $10\%$ ammonia. We find that ammonia-rich melts can freeze into the upper $5$ to $10$ kilometers
of the ice shell, when ice shell thickening is rapid compared to the compaction rate. The trapping
of near-surface volatiles suggests that, upon reheating of the ice shell, eutectic melting events
are possible. However, as the ice shell thickening rate decreases, ammonia-rich melt is efficiently
excluded from the ice shell and the bulk of the ice shell is pure water ice. We apply our results to the
thermal evolution of Neptune's moon Triton. As Triton's ice shell thickens, the gradual increase
of ammonia concentration in Triton's subsurface ocean helps to prevent freezing and increases
the predicted final ocean thickness by up to $50$ km.
