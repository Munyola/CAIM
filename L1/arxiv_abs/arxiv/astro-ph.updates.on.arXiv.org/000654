In order to understand the collapse dynamics of observed low-mass starless cores, we revise the
conventional stability condition of hydrostatic Bonnor-Ebert spheres to take internal motions
into account. Because observed starless cores resemble Bonnor-Ebert density structures, the
stability and dynamics of the starless cores are frequently analyzed by comparing to the conventional
stability condition of a hydrostatic Bonnor-Ebert sphere. However, starless cores are not hydrostatic
but have observed internal motions. In this study, we take gaseous spheres with a homologous internal
velocity field and derive stability conditions of the spheres utilizing a virial analysis. We propose
two limiting models of spontaneous gravitational collapse: the collapse of critical Bonnor-Ebert
spheres and uniform density spheres. The collapse of these two limiting models are intended to provide
the lower and the upper limits, respectively, of the infall speeds for a given density structure.
The results of our study suggest that the stability condition sensitively depends on internal motions.
A homologous inward motion with a transonic speed can reduce the critical size compared to the static
Bonnor-Ebert sphere by more than a factor of two. As an application of the two limiting models of spontaneous
gravitational collapse, we compare the density structures and infall speeds of the observed starless
cores L63, L1544, L1689B, and L694-2 to the two limiting models. L1689B and L694-2 seem to have been
perturbed to result in faster infall motions than for spontaneous gravitational collapse.
