The intrinsic photometric properties of inner and outer stellar bars within 17 double-barred galaxies
are thoroughly studied through a photometric analysis consisting of: i) two-dimensional multi-component
photometric decompositions, and ii) a three-dimensional statistical deprojection for measuring
the thickening of bars, thus retrieving their 3D shape. The results are compared with previous measurements
obtained with the widely used analysis of integrated light. Large-scale bars in single- and double-barred
systems show similar sizes, and inner bars may be longer than outer bars in different galaxies. We
find two distinct groups of inner bars attending to their in-plane length, resulting in a bimodal
behaviour for the inner/outer bar length ratio. Such bimodality is not related to the properties
of the host galaxy or the dominant bulge, and it does not show a counterpart in the dimension off the
disc plane. The group of long inner bars lays at the bottom end of the outer bar length vs. ellipticity
correlation, whereas the short inner bars are out of that relation. We suggest that this behaviour
could be due to either a different nature of the inner discs from which the inner bars are dynamically
formed, or a different assembly stage for the inner bars. This last possibility would imply that
the dynamical assembly of inner bars is a slow process taking several Gyr to happen. Finally, we have
also explored whether all large-scale bars are prone to develop an inner bar at some stage of their
lives, possibility we cannot fully confirm or discard.
