Giant radio relics in the outskirts of galaxy clusters are known to be lighten by relativistic electrons
produced via diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) in shocks with low sonic Mach numbers, $M_{\rm
s}\lesssim3$. The particle acceleration at these collisonless shocks critically depends on the
kinetic plasma processes that govern the injection to DSA. Here, we study the preacceleration of
suprathermal electrons in weak, quasi-perpendicular ($Q_\perp$) shocks in the hot, high-$\beta$
($\beta = P_{\rm gas}/P_{\rm B}$) intracluster medium (ICM) through two-dimensional particle-in-cell
(PIC) simulations. \citet{guo2014a,guo2014b} showed that in high-$\beta$ $Q_\perp$-shocks,
some of incoming electrons could be reflected upstream and gain energy via shock drift acceleration
(SDA). The temperature anisotropy due to the SDA-energized electrons then can induce the electron
firehose instability (EFI), and oblique waves are generated, leading to a Fermi-like acceleration
of electrons in the preshock region. We find that such electron preacceleration is effective only
in shocks above a certain critical Mach number, $M_{\rm ef}^*\approx2.3$ in high-$\beta$ plasmas.
This means that in $Q_\perp$-shocks with $M_{\rm s}\lesssim2.3$, electrons may not be efficiently
accelerated. We also find that even in $Q_\perp$-shocks with $M_{\rm s}\gtrsim2.3$, electrons
may not reach high enough energies to be injected to the full Fermi-I process of DSA, because long-wavelength
waves are not developed via the EFI alone. This indicates that other processes for electron preacceleration
might be required to explain radio relics.
