Context. The early-type binary MY Cam belongs to the young open cluster Alicante 1, embedded in Cam
OB3. Aims. MY Cam consists of two early-O type main-sequence stars and shows a photometric modulation
suggesting an orbital period slightly above one day. We intend to confirm this orbital period and
derive orbital and stellar parameters. Methods. Timing analysis of a very exhaustive (4607 points)
light curve indicates a period of 1.1754514 +- 0.0000015 d. High- resolution spectra and the cross-correlation
technique implemented in the TODCOR program were used to derive radial velocities and obtain the
corresponding radial velocity curves for MY Cam. Modelling with the stellar atmosphere code FASTWIND
was used to obtain stellar parameters and create templates for cross-correlation. Stellar and
orbital parameters were derived using the Wilson-Devinney code, such that a complete solution
to the binary system could be described. Results. The determined masses of the primary and secondary
stars in MY Cam are 37.7 +- 1.6 and 31.6 +- 1.4 Msol, respectively. The corresponding temperatures,
derived from the model atmosphere fit, are 42 000 and 39 000 K, with the more massive component being
hotter. Both stars are overfilling their Roche lobes, sharing a common envelope. Conclusions.
MY Cam contains the most massive dwarf O-type stars found so far in an eclipsing binary. Both components
are still on the main sequence, and probably not far from the zero-age main sequence. The system is
a likely merger progenitor, owing to its very short period.
