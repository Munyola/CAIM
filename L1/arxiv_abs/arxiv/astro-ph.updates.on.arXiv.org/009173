The solar corona shows a distinctive pattern of elemental abundances that is different from that
of the photosphere. Low first ionization potential (FIP) elements are enhanced by factors of several.
A similar effect is seen in the atmospheres of some solar-like stars, while late type M stars show
an inverse FIP effect. This inverse effect was recently detected on the Sun during solar flares,
potentially allowing a very detailed look at the spatial and temporal behavior that is not possible
from stellar observations. A key question for interpreting these measurements is whether both
effects act solely on low FIP elements (a true inverse effect predicted by some models), or whether
the inverse FIP effect arises because high FIP elements are enhanced. Here we develop a new diagnostic
that can discriminate between the two scenarios, based on modeling of the radiated power loss, and
applying the models to a numerical hydrodynamic simulation of coronal loop cooling. We show that
when low/high FIP elements are depleted/enhanced, there is a significant difference in the cooling
lifetime of loops that is greatest at lower temperatures. We apply this diagnostic to a post X1.8
flare loop arcade and inverse FIP region, and show that for this event, low FIP elements are depleted.
We discuss the results in the context of stellar observations, and models of the FIP and inverse FIP
effect. We also provide the radiated power loss functions for the two inverse FIP effect scenarios
in machine readable form to facilitate further modeling.
