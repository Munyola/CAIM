Gas blown away from galactic disks by supernova (SN) feedback plays a key role in galaxy evolution.
We investigate outflows utilizing the solar neighborhood model of our high-resolution, local
galactic disk simulation suite, TIGRESS. In our numerical implementation, star formation and
SN feedback are self-consistently treated and well resolved in the multiphase, turbulent, magnetized
interstellar medium. Bursts of star formation produce spatially and temporally correlated SNe
that drive strong outflows, consisting of hot (T>5x10^5K) winds and warm (5050K < T < 2x10^4K) fountains.
The hot gas at distance d>1kpc from the midplane has mass and energy fluxes nearly constant with d.
The hot flow escapes our local Cartesian box barely affected by gravity and is expected to accelerate
up to the terminal velocity of v_wind~350-500km/s. The mean mass and energy loading factors of the
hot wind are 0.1 and 0.02, respectively. For warm gas, the mean outward mass flux through d=1kpc is
comparable to the mean star formation rate, but only a small fraction of this gas is at velocity >50km/s.
Thus, the warm outflows eventually fall back as inflows. The warm fountain flows are created by expanding
hot superbubbles at d< 1kpc; at larger d neither ram pressure acceleration nor cooling transfers
significant momentum or energy flux from the hot wind to the warm outflow. The velocity distribution
at launching near d~1kpc better represents warm outflows than a single mass loading factor, potentially
enabling development of subgrid models for warm galactic winds in arbitrary large-scale galactic
potentials.
