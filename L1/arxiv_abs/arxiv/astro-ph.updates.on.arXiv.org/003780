We have recently detected the [CII] 157.7 micron line in eight star forming galaxies at redshifts
1 to 2 using the redshift(z) Early Universe Spectrometer (ZEUS). Our sample targets star formation
dominant sources detected in PAH emission. This represents a significant addition to [CII] observations
during the epoch of peak star formation. We have augmented this survey with observations of the [OI]
63 micron line and far infrared photometry from the PACS and SPIRE Herschel instruments as well as
Spitzer IRS spectra from the literature showing PAH features. Our sources exhibit above average
gas heating efficiency, many with both [OI]/FIR and [CII]/FIR ~1% or more. The relatively strong
[CII] emission is consistent with our sources being dominated by star formation powered PDRs, extending
to kpc scales. We suggest that the star formation mode in these systems follows a Schmidt-Kennicutt
law similar to local systems, but at a much higher rate due to molecular gas surface densities 10 to
100 times that of local star forming systems. The source of the high molecular gas surface densities
may be the infall of neutral gas from the cosmic web. In addition to the high [CII]/FIR values, we also
find high [CII]/PAH ratios and, in at least one source, a cool dust temperature. This source, SWIRE
4-5, bears a resemblance in these diagnostics to shocked regions of Stephan's Quintet, suggesting
that another mode of [CII] excitation in addition to normal photoelectric heating may be contributing
to the observed [CII] line.
