The detection of an unexpectedly large number of faint candidate quasars (QSO) at $z \gtrsim 4$ has
motivated Madau and Haardt to investigate a reionization scenario in which active galactic nuclei
dominate the photon budget at all times. Their analytical study reveals that this picture is in agreement
with the evolution of the HI volume fraction in the intergalactic medium (IGM) and the optical depth
to Thomson scattering of the cosmic microwave background. We employ a suite of hydrodynamical simulations
post-processed with a radiative transfer code to further investigate the properties of such a reionization
history. In particular, we generate synthetic absorption-line spectra for HI and HeII that we compare
with observational data. Although we confirm the analytical results mentioned above, we also find
that the evolution of the IGM temperature and of the HeII optical depth are at odds with current observational
constraints. Nevertheless, the QSO-dominated scenario presents the attractive feature that
it naturally generates an inhomogeneous IGM and thus produces an extended tail at high values in
the distribution function of the HI effective optical depth, in agreement with recent observations.
We find tentative evidence that considering some QSO emission at redshift $z \gtrsim 5$ could reconcile
such observations with numerical simulations that have so far failed to reproduce this feature.
Finally, we show that collecting more HeII-absorption spectra at $z \gtrsim 3$ and studying their
distinctive characteristics will be key to precisely constraining the QSO contribution to reionization.
