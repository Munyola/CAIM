We present a detailed study of the evolution of GMCs in a galactic disc simulation. We follow individual
GMCs (defined in our simulations by a total column density criterion), including their level of
star formation, from their formation to dispersal. We find the evolution of GMCs is highly complex.
GMCs often form from a combination of smaller clouds and ambient ISM, and similarly disperse by splitting
into a number of smaller clouds and ambient ISM. However some clouds emerge as the result of the disruption
of a more massive GMC, rather than from the assembly of smaller clouds. Likewise in some cases, clouds
accrete onto more massive clouds rather than disperse. Because of the difficulty of determining
a precursor or successor of a given GMC, determining GMC histories and lifetimes is highly non-trivial.
Using a definition relating to the continuous evolution of a cloud, we obtain lifetimes typically
of 4-25 Myr for >10^5 M$_{\odot}$ GMCs, over which time the star formation efficiency is about
1 %. We also relate the lifetime of GMCs to their crossing time. We find that the crossing time is a reasonable
measure of the actual lifetime of the cloud, although there is considerable scatter. The scatter
is found to be unavoidable because of the complex and varied shapes and dynamics of the clouds. We
study cloud dispersal in detail and find both stellar feedback and shear contribute to cloud disruption.
We also demonstrate that GMCs do not behave as ridge clouds, rather massive spiral arm GMCs evolve
into smaller clouds in inter-arm spurs.
