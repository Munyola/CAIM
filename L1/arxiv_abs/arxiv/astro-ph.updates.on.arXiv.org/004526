The volume of data that will be produced by new-generation surveys requires automatic classification
methods to select and analyze sources. Indeed, this is the case for the search for strong gravitational
lenses, where the population of the detectable lensed sources is only a very small fraction of the
full source population. We apply for the first time a morphological classification method based
on a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for recognizing strong gravitational lenses in $255$ square
degrees of the Kilo Degree Survey (KiDS), one of the current-generation optical wide surveys. The
CNN is currently optimized to recognize lenses with Einstein radii $\gtrsim 1.4$ arcsec, about
twice the $r$-band seeing in KiDS. In a sample of $21789$ colour-magnitude selected Luminous Red
Galaxies (LRG), of which three are known lenses, the CNN retrieves 761 strong-lens candidates and
correctly classifies two out of three of the known lenses. The misclassified lens has an Einstein
radius below the range on which the algorithm is trained. We down-select the most reliable 56 candidates
by a joint visual inspection. This final sample is presented and discussed. A conservative estimate
based on our results shows that with our proposed method it should be possible to find $\sim100$ massive
LRG-galaxy lenses at $z\lsim 0.4$ in KiDS when completed. In the most optimistic scenario this number
can grow considerably (to maximally $\sim$2400 lenses), when widening the colour-magnitude selection
and training the CNN to recognize smaller image-separation lens systems.
