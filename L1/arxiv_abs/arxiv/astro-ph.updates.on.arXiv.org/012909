Follow-up observations of (sub-)mm-selected gravitationally-lensed systems have allowed a
more detailed study of the dust-enshrouded phase of star-formation up to very early cosmic times.
Here, the case of the gravitationally lensed merger in HATLAS J142935.3-002836 (also known as H1429-0028;
z_lens=0.218, z_bkg=1.027) is revisited following recent developments in the literature and
new APEX observations targeting two carbon monoxide (CO) rotational transitions J_up=3 and 6.
We show that the line-profiles comprise three distinct velocity components, where the fainter
high-velocity one is less magnified and more compact. The modelling of the observed spectral line
energy distribution of CO J_up=2 to 6 and [CI]3P_1-3P_0 assumes a large velocity gradient scenario,
where the analysis is based on four statistical approaches. Since the detected gas and dust emission
comes exclusively from only one of the two merging components (the one oriented North-South, NS),
we are only able to determine upper-limits for the companion. The molecular gas in the NS component
in H1429-0028 is found to have a temperature of ~70K, a volume density of log(n[/cm3])~3.7, to be
expanding at ~10km/s/pc, and amounts to M_H2=4(-2,+3)*1e9 Msun. The CO to H2 conversion factor
is estimated to be alpha_CO=0.4(-0.2,+0.3) Msun/(K.km/s.pc2). The NS galaxy is expected to have
a factor of >10x more gas than its companion (M_H2<3e8 Msun). Nevertheless, the total amount of molecular
gas in the system comprises only up to 15 per cent (1sigma upper-limit) of the total (dynamical) mass.
