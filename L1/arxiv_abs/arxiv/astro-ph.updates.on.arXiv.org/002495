One of the consequences of entering the era of precision cosmology is the widespread adoption of
photometric redshift probability density functions (PDFs). Both current and future photometric
surveys are expected to obtain images of billions of distinct galaxies. As a result, storing and
analyzing all of these PDFs will be non-trivial and even more severe if a survey plans to compute and
store multiple different PDFs. In this paper we propose the use of a sparse basis representation
to fully represent individual photo-$z$ PDFs. By using an Orthogonal Matching Pursuit algorithm
and a combination of Gaussian and Voigt basis functions, we demonstrate how our approach is superior
to a multi-Gaussian fitting, as we require approximately half of the parameters for the same fitting
accuracy with the additional advantage that an entire PDF can be stored by using a 4-byte integer
per basis function, and we can achieve better accuracy by increasing the number of bases. By using
data from the CFHTLenS, we demonstrate that only ten to twenty points per galaxy are sufficient to
reconstruct both the individual PDFs and the ensemble redshift distribution, $N(z)$, to an accuracy
of 99.9% when compared to the one built using the original PDFs computed with a resolution of $\delta
z = 0.01$, reducing the required storage of two hundred original values by a factor of ten to twenty.
Finally, we demonstrate how this basis representation can be directly extended to a cosmological
analysis, thereby increasing computational performance without losing resolution nor accuracy.
