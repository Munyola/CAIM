We revisit a model in which neutrino masses and mixing are described by a two right-handed (RH) neutrino
seesaw scenario, implying a strictly hierarchical light neutrino spectrum. A third decoupled
RH neutrino, $N_{\rm DM}$ with mass $M_{\rm DM}$, plays the role of cold dark matter (DM) and is produced
by the mixing with a source RH neutrino, $N_{\rm S}$ with mass $M_{\rm S}$, induced by Higgs portal
interactions. The same interactions are also responsible for $N_{\rm DM}$ decays. We discuss in
detail the constraints coming from DM abundance and stability conditions, showing that in the hierarchical
case ($M_{\rm DM} \gg M_{\rm S}$) there is an allowed window on $M_{\rm DM}$, which necessarily implies
a contribution from DM decays to the high-energy neutrino flux recently detected by IceCube. We
also show how the model can explain the matter-antimatter asymmetry of the Universe via leptogenesis
in the quasi-degenerate limit. In this case, the DM mass should be within the range 300 GeV $\lesssim
M_{\rm S} < M_{\rm DM} \lesssim$ 10 PeV. We discuss the specific properties of this high-energy neutrino
flux and show the predicted event spectrum for two exemplary cases. Although DM decays, with a relatively
hard spectrum, cannot account for all the IceCube high-energy data, we illustrate how this extra
source of high-energy neutrinos could reasonably explain some potential features in the observed
spectrum. In this way, this represents a unified scenario for leptogenesis and DM that could be tested
during the next years with more high-energy neutrino events.
