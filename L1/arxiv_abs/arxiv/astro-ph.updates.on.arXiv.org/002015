There is cumulative evidence showing that, for the most massive galaxies, the fraction of disk-like
objects compared to those with spheroidal properties increases with redshift. However, this evolution
is thus far based on the surface brightness study of these objects. To explore the consistency of
this scenario, it is necessary to measure the dynamical status of these galaxies. With this aim we
have obtained seeing-limited near-infrared integral field spectra in the H-band for 10 massive
galaxies (M_{stellar} >10^{11} h_{70}^-2 M_{Sun}) at z~1.4 with SINFONI at the VLT. Our sample
is selected by their stellar mass and EW[OII] > 15 \AA, to secure their kinematic measurements,
but without accounting for any morphological or flux criteria a priori. Through this 3D kinematic
spectroscopy analysis we find that half (i.e. 50+/-7%) of our galaxies are compatible with being
rotationally supported disks, in agreement with previous morphological expectations. This is
a factor of approximately two higher than what is observed in the present Universe for objects of
the same stellar mass. Strikingly, the majority of our sample of massive galaxies show extended
and fairly high rotational velocity maps, implying that massive galaxies acquire rapidly rotational
support and hence gravitational equilibrium. Our sample also show evidence for ongoing interactions
and mergers. Summarizing, massive galaxies at high-z show a significant diversity and must have
continued evolution beyond the fading of stellar populations, to become their present day counterparts.
