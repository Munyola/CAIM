Centaurs have orbits between Jupiter and Neptune and are thought to originate from the trans-Neptunian
region. Observations of surface properties of Centaurs and comparison with those of trans-Neptunian
objects (TNOs) would provide constraints on their origin and evolution. We analyzed imaging data
of nine known Centaurs observed by the Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) installed on the Subaru Telescope
with the g and i band filters. Using the data available in the public HSC data archive as well as those
obtained by the HSC Subaru Strategic Program (HSC-SSP) by the end of June, 2017, we obtained the g-i
colors of the nine Centaurs. We compared them with those of known TNOs in the HSC-SSP data obtained
by Terai et al. (2018). We found that the color distribution of the nine Centaurs is similar to that
of those TNOs with high orbital inclinations, but distinct from those TNOs with low orbital inclinations.
We also examined correlations between the colors of these Centaurs and their orbital elements and
absolute magnitude. The Centaurs' colors show a moderate positive correlation with semi-major
axis, while no significant correlations between the color and other orbital elements or absolute
magnitude were found for these Centaurs. On the other hand, recent studies on Centaurs with larger
samples show interesting correlations between their color and absolute magnitude or orbital inclination.
We discuss how our data fit in these previous studies, and also discuss implications of these results
for their origin and evolution.
