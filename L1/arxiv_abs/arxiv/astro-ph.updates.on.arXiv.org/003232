Future radial velocity, astrometric and direct imaging surveys will find nearby Earth-sized planets
within the habitable zone (HZ) in the near future. How can we search for water and oxygen in those non-transiting
planets? We propose a combination of high-dispersion spectroscopy and coronagraphic techniques
as a method to detect molecular lines in Earth-like planets (ELPs). In this method, the planetary
signals are spectroscopically separated from the telluric absorption due to the Doppler shift.
Assuming a long observing campaign ($T_\mathrm{exp}=$ 20 days) using the high-dispersion spectrometer
($R = 50,000$) with the speckle suppression on a 30 m telescope, we simulate the spectra from the ELPs
around M dwarfs at 5 pc. Performing the cross-correlation analysis with the binary template of the
molecular lines, we find that the raw contrasts of $10^{-4}$ (0.8-1.8 $\mu$m) and $10^{-4.5}$ (use
of J-band only) at 30 mas are required to detect the water vapor for a $\sim 4 - 5 \sigma$ detection.
The raw contrast of $10^{-5}$ is required for a 4 $\sigma$ detection of the oxygen 1.27 $\mu$m band.
For the ELPs around solar-type stars, it is necessary to assume a several hundred times better contrast
than that for M dwarfs in order to detect water vapor. This method does not require any additional
post-processings and is less sensitive to the terrestrial noise than the low resolution spectroscopy.
We conclude that a combination of high-dispersion spectroscopy and high-contrast instruments
can be a powerful means to characterize the ELPs in the extremely large telescope era.
