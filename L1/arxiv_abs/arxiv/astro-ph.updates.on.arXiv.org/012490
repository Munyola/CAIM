The globular clusters of large spiral galaxies can be divided into two populations: one which formed
in-situ and one which comprises clusters tidally stripped away from other galaxies. In this paper
we investigate the contribution to the outer globular cluster population in the M31 galaxy through
donation of clusters from dwarf galaxies. We test this numerically by comparing the contribution
of globular clusters from simulated encounters to the observed M31 globular cluster population.
To constrain our simulations, we specifically investigate the outermost globular cluster in the
M31 system, MGC1. The remote location of MGC1 favours the idea of it being captured, however, the
cluster is devoid of features associated with tidal interactions. Hence we separate simulations
where tidal features are present and where they are hidden. We find that our simulated encounters
can place clusters on MGC1-like orbits. In addition, we find that tidal stripping of clusters from
dwarf galaxies leaves them on orbits having a range of separations, broadly matching those observed
in M31. We find that the specific energies of globular clusters captured by M31 closely matches those
of the incoming host dwarf galaxies. Furthermore, in our simulations we find an equal number of accreted
clusters on co-rotating and counter-rotating orbits within M31 and use this to infer the fraction
of clusters that has been accreted. We find that even close in roughly 50% of the clusters are accreted,
whilst this figure increases to over 80% further out.
