Since May 1, 2010, we have been able to study (almost) continuously the vector magnetic field in the
Sun, thanks to two space-based observatories: the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) and Hinode.
Both are equipped with instruments able to measure the Stokes parameters of Zeeman-induced polarization
of photospheric line radiation. But the observation modes, the spectral lines, the spatial, spectral
and temporal sampling, and even the inversion codes used to recover magnetic and thermodynamic
information from the Stokes profiles are different. We compare the vector magnetic fields derived
from observations with the HMI instrument on board SDO, with those observed by the SP instrument
on Hinode. We have obtained relationships between components of magnetic vectors in the umbra,
penumbra and plage observed in 14 maps of NOAA AR 11084. Importantly, we have transformed SP data
into observables comparable to those of HMI, to explore possible influences of the different modes
of operation of the two instruments, and the inversion schemes used to infer the magnetic fields.
The assumed filling factor (fraction of each pixel containing a Zeeman signature) produces the
most significant differences in derived magnetic properties, especially in the plage. The spectral
and angular samplings have the next largest effects. We suggest to treat the disambiguation in the
same way in the data provided by HMI and SP. That would make the relationship between the vector magnetic
field recovered from these data stronger, what would favor the simultaneous or complementary use
of both instruments.
