The extreme infrared (IR) luminosity of local luminous and ultra-luminous IR galaxies (U/LIRGs;
11 < log LIR /Lsun < 12 and log LIR /Lsun > 12, respectively) is mainly powered by star-formation processes
triggered by mergers or interactions. While U/LIRGs are rare locally, at z > 1, they become more common,
they dominate the star-formation rate (SFR) density, and a fraction of them are found to be normal
disk galaxies. Therefore, there must be an evolution of the mechanism triggering these intense
starbursts with redshift. To investigate this evolution, we present new optical SWIFT integral
field spectroscopic H{\alpha}+[NII] observations of a sample of 9 intermediate-z (0.2 < z < 0.4)
U/LIRG systems selected from Herschel 250{\mu}m observations. The main results are the following:
(a) the ratios between the velocity dispersion and the rotation curve amplitude indicate that 10-25%
(1-2 out of 8) might be compatible with being isolated disks while the remaining objects are interacting/merging
systems; (b) the ratio between un-obscured and obscured SFR traced by H{\alpha} and LIR, respectively,
is similar in both local and these intermediate-z U/LIRGs; and (c) the ratio between 250{\mu}m and
the total IR luminosities of these intermediate-z U/LIRGs is higher than that of local U/LIRGs with
the same LIR . This indicates a reduced dust temperature in these intermediate-z U/LIRGs. This,
together with their already measured enhanced molecular gas content, suggests that the interstellar
medium conditions are different in our sample of intermediate-z galaxies when compared to local
U/LIRGs.
