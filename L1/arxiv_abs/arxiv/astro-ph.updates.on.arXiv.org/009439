We characterise the origin and evolution of a mesoscale wave pattern in Jupiter's North Equatorial
Belt (NEB), detected for the first time at 5 $\mu$m using a 2016-17 campaign of `lucky imaging' from
the VISIR instrument on the Very Large Telescope and the NIRI instrument on the Gemini observatory,
coupled with M-band imaging from Juno's JIRAM instrument during the first seven Juno orbits. The
wave is compact, with a $1.1-1.4^\circ$ longitude wavelength (wavelength 1,300-1,600 km, wavenumber
260-330) that is stable over time, with wave crests aligned largely north-south between $14$ and
$17^\circ$N (planetographic). The waves were initially identified in small ($10^\circ$ longitude)
packets immediately west of cyclones in the NEB at $16^\circ$N, but extended to span wider longitude
ranges over time. The waves exhibit a 7-10 K brightness temperature amplitude on top of a $\sim210$-K
background at 5 $\mu$m. The thermal structure of the NEB allows for both inertio-gravity waves and
gravity waves. Despite detection at 5 $\mu$m, this does not necessarily imply a deep location for
the waves, and an upper tropospheric aerosol layer near 400-800 mbar could feature a gravity wave
pattern modulating the visible-light reflectivity and attenuating the 5-$\mu$m radiance originating
from deeper levels. Strong rifting activity appears to obliterate the pattern, which can change
on timescales of weeks. The NEB underwent a new expansion and contraction episode in 2016-17 with
associated cyclone-anticyclone formation, which could explain why the mesoscale wave pattern
was more vivid in 2017 than ever before.
