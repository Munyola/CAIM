We propose a cadence optimization strategy for the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) to unveil
a large population of kilonovae. These transients are generated during binary neutron star and
potentially neutron-star black-hole mergers and are electromagnetic counterparts to gravitational-wave
signals detectable in nearby events with Advanced LIGO, Advanced Virgo, and other interferometers
that will come online in the near future. Discovering a large population of kilonovae will allow
us to determine how heavy element production varies with the intrinsic parameters of the merger
and across cosmic time. The rate of binary neutron star mergers is still uncertain and less than 15
events with associated kilonovae are expected to be detectable per year within the LIGO horizon.
The rapid evolution (days) at optical/infrared wavelengths, relatively low luminosity, and the
low volumetric rate of kilonovae makes their discovery difficult, especially during blind surveys
of the sky. With the current LSST cadence design, about 7.5 poorly-sampled kilonovae are expected
to be discovered in both the WFD and DDF surveys per year, under optimistic assumptions on their rate
and luminosity. We propose to adopt a rolling cadence for the WFD survey in which g-i observations
are taken for a particular 750 square degrees tract of sky every night for 10 consecutive nights,
with the total yearly exposure time in g-i being equivalent to the WFD baseline across the survey.
We expect this strategy to return about 272 GW170817-like kilonovae throughout the survey discovered
independently from gravitational-wave triggers.
