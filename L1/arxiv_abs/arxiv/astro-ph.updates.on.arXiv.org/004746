We aim at constraining the dust mass in high-redshift ($z\gtrsim 5$) galaxies using the upper limits
obtained by ALMA in combination with the rest-frame UV--optical spectral energy distributions
(SEDs). For SED fitting, because of degeneracy between dust extinction and stellar age, we focus
on two extremes: continuous star formation (Model A) and instantaneous star formation (Model B).
We apply these models to Himiko (as a representative UV-bright object) and a composite SED of $z>5$
Lyman break galaxies (LBGs). For Himiko, Model A requires a significant dust extinction, which
leads to a high dust temperature $>70$ K for consistency with the ALMA upper limit. This high dust
temperature puts a strong upper limit on the total dust mass $M_\mathrm{d}\lesssim 2\times 10^6$
M$_{\odot}$, and the dust mass produced per supernova (SN) $m_\mathrm{d,SN}\lesssim 0.1$ M$_{\odot}$.
Such a low $m_\mathrm{d,SN}$ suggests significant loss of dust by reverse shock destruction or
outflow, and implies that SNe are not the dominant source of dust at high $z$. Model B allows $M_\mathrm{d}\sim
2\times 10^7$ M$_{\odot}$ and $m_\mathrm{d,SN}\sim 0.3$ M$_{\odot}$.} We could distinguish
between Models A and B if we observe Himiko at {wavelength $<$ 1.2 mm by ALMA. For the LBG sample, we
obtain $M_\mathrm{d}\lesssim 2\times 10^6$ M$_{\odot}$ for a typical LBG at $z>5$, but this only
puts an upper limit for $m_\mathrm{d,SN}$ as $\sim 2$ M$_{\odot}$. This clarifies the importance
of observing UV-bright objects (like Himiko) to constrain the dust production by SNe.
