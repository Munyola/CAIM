We examine He I 10830 profile morphologies for a sample of 56 Herbig Ae/Be stars (HAEBES). We find
significant differences between HAEBES and CTTSs in the statistics of both blue-shifted absorption
(i.e. mass outflows) and red-shifted absorption features (i.e. mass infall or accretion). Our
results suggest that, in general, Herbig Be (HBe) stars do not accrete material from their inner
disks in the same manner as CTTSs, which are believed to accrete material via magnetospheric accretion,
while Herbig Ae (HAe) stars generally show evidence for magnetospheric accretion. We find no evidence
in our sample of narrow blue--shifted absorption features which are typical indicators of inner
disk winds and are common in He I 10830 profiles of CTTSs. The lack of inner disk wind signatures in
HAEBES, combined with the paucity of detected magnetic fields on these objects, suggests that accretion
through large magnetospheres which truncate the disk several stellar radii above the surface is
not as common for HAe and late-type HBe stars as it is for CTTSs. Instead, evidence is found for smaller
magnetospheres in the maximum red-shifted absorption velocities in our HAEBE sample. These velocities
are, on average, a smaller fraction of the system escape velocity than is found for CTTSs, suggesting
accretion is taking place closer to the star. Smaller magnetospheres, and evidence for boundary
layer accretion in HBe stars, may explain the less common occurrence of red--shifted absorption
in HAEBES. Evidence is found that smaller magnetospheres may be less efficient at driving outflows
compared to CTTS magnetospheres.
