In this follow-up paper, we continue our study of the effect of using knowledge from electromagnetic
observations in the gravitational wave (GW) data analysis of Galactic binaries that are predicted
to be observed by the new \textit{Laser Interferometer Space Antenna} in the low-frequency range,
$10^{-4} \:\mathrm{Hz}<f<1 \:\mathrm{Hz}$. In the first paper, we have shown that the strong
correlation between amplitude and inclination can be used for mildly inclined binaries to improve
the uncertainty in amplitude, and that this correlation depends on the inclination of the system.
In this paper we investigate the overall effect of the other orientation parameters, namely the
sky position and the polarisation angle. We find that after the inclination, the ecliptic latitude
of the source has the strongest effect in determining the GW parameter uncertainties. We ascertain
that the strong correlation we found previously, only depends on the inclination of the source and
not on the other orientation parameters. We find that knowing the sky position of the source from
electromagnetic data can reduce the GW parameter uncertainty up to a factor of $\sim 2$, depending
on the inclination and the ecliptic latitude of the system. Knowing the sky position and inclination
can reduce the uncertainty in amplitude by a factor larger than 40. We also find that unphysical errors
in the inclinations, which we found when using the Fisher matrix, can affect the corresponding uncertainties
in the amplitudes, which need to be corrected.
