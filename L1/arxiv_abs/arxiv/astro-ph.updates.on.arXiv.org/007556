We present the discovery of ringlike diffuse radio emission structures in the peripheral regions
of the Bullet cluster 1E 0657$-$55.8. Ring formations are spanning between 1--3 Mpc away from the
center of the cluster, significantly further away from the two already reported relics. Integrated
fluxes of four of the sub-regions in the inner `ring' from 4.5 to 10 GHz have also been reported. To
understand the possible origin of these structures, here we present a maiden attempt of numerical
modelling of a 3D and realistic `bullet' like event in a full cosmological ($\Lambda$CDM) environment
with N-body plus hydrodynamics code. We report a simulated `bullet' found inside a (128 Mpc)$^3$
volume simulation with a speed of 2700 km s$^{-1}$, creating a high supersonic bow shock of Mach $M=3.5$
and a clear evidence of temporal separation of dark matter and baryons, assuring no challenge to
$\Lambda$CDM cosmology from the bullet event as of now. We are also able to unveil the physics behind
the formation of these observed multiple shock structures. Modelled radio emissions in our simulation
support a complex combination of merger-associated processes that accelerates and re-accelerates
fossil and cosmic-ray electrons. With a time evolution study and the computed radio emissions,
we have shown that the ring like formation around the bullet is originated due to the interaction
of the strong merger shocks with the accretion shocks at the periphery. The multiple shock structures
observed are possibly originated from multiple mergers that have taken place at different times
and much before the bullet event.
