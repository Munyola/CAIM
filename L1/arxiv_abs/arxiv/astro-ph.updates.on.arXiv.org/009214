We performed sensitive observations of the N15ND+(1-0) and 15NND+(1-0) lines toward the prestellar
core L1544 using the IRAM 30m telescope. The lines are not detected down to 3 sigma levels in 0.2 km/s
channels of around 6 mK. The non-detection provides the lower limit of the 14N/15N ratio for N2D+
of ~700-800, which is much higher than the elemental abundance ratio in the local ISM of ~200-300.
The result indicates that N2 is depleted in 15N in the central part of L1544, because N2D+ preferentially
traces the cold dense gas, and because it is a daughter molecule of N2. In-situ chemistry is unlikely
responsible for the 15N depletion in N2; neither low-temperature gas phase chemistry nor isotope
selective photodissociation of N2 explains the 15N depletion; the former prefers transferring
15N to N2, while the latter requires the penetration of interstellar FUV photons into the core center.
The most likely explanation is that 15N is preferentially partitioned into ices compared to 14N
via the combination of isotope selective photodissociation of N2 and grain surface chemistry in
the parent cloud of L1544 or in the outer regions of L1544 which are not fully shielded from the interstellar
FUV radiation. The mechanism is the most efficient at the chemical transition from atomic to molecular
nitrogen. In other words, our result suggests that the gas in the central part of L1544 already went
trough the transition from atomic to molecular nitrogen in the earlier evolutionary stage, and
that N2 is currently the primary form of gas-phase nitrogen.
