Uranus and Neptune are ice giants with $\sim$ 15% atmospheres by mass, placing them in an intermediate
category between rocky planets and gas giants. These atmospheres are too massive to have been primarily
outgassed, yet they never underwent runaway gas accretion. The ice giants never reached critical
core mass ($M_\text{crit}$) in a full gas disk, yet their cores are $\gtrsim M_\text{crit}$, suggesting
that their envelopes were mainly accreted at the end of the disk lifetime. Pebble accretion calls
into question traditional slow atmospheric growth during this phase. We show that the full-sized
ice giants predominantly accreted gas from a disk depleted by at least a factor of $\sim 100$. Such
a disk dissipates in $ \lesssim 10^5$ years. Why would both cores stay sub-critical for the entire
$\sim$ Myr disk lifetime, only to reach $M_\text{crit}$ in the final $10^5$ years? This is fine tuned.
Ice giants in the outer disk have atmospheric mass fractions comparable to the disk gas-to-solid
ratio during the bulk of their gas accretion. This point in disk evolution coincides with a dynamical
upheaval: the gas loses its ability to efficiently damp the cores' random velocities, allowing
them to be gravitationally excited by Jupiter and Saturn. We suggest that the ice giants' cores began
growing on closer-in orbits (staying sub-critical), and migrated out during this dynamical instability.
There, their orbits circularized after accreting much of their mass in solids. Finally, they accreted
their envelopes from a depleted nebula, where the sparseness of feeding zone gas prevented runaway.
