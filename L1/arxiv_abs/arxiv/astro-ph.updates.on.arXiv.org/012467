We have performed cosmological hydrodynamic simulations to study the effect of fragmentation
on the SMBH seed mass in the direct collapse formation scenario. We considered different background
UV intensities, host halo spin, and halo merger histories. Our simulations in low-spin halos, in
the presence of a strong UV background are consistent with the Direct Collapse Black Hole model,
in which a single massive object $\sim10^5$ M$_{\odot}$ is formed in the center of a proto-galaxy.
While in our simulations under the presence of a low UV background, we find fragmentation and the
formation of various minor seeds. These fragments have masses of 10$^3$ - 10$^4$ M$_{\odot}$. These
values are significant if we consider the potential mergers between them, and the fact that these
minor objects are formed earlier in cosmic time compared to the massive single seeds. In one of our
simulations, we observed gas fragmentation even in the presence of a strong UV intensity. Said structure
arose in a dark matter halo that formed after various merger episodes, and the one with the highest
spin value. The final mass obtained was $\sim 10^5$ M$_{\odot}$ in this run. From these results,
we conclude that fragmentation in fact produces less massive objects, however, they are still prone
to merge. In simulations that formed many fragments, they all approach the most massive one with
time. We see no uniqueness in the strength of the UV intensity value required to achieve a DCBH, since
it depends in other factors like the system dynamics in our cases.
