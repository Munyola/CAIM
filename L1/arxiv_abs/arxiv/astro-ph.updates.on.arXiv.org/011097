We report $0.14"$ resolution observations of the dust continuum at band 7, and the CO(3--2) and HCO$^{+}$(4--3)
line emissions toward the transitional disk around Sz 91 with Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter
Array (ALMA). The dust disk appears to be an axisymmetric ring, peaking a radius of $\sim$95~au from
a Gaussian fit. The Gaussian fit widths of the dust ring are 24.6 and 23.7~au for the major and the minor
axes, respectively, indicating that the dust ring is not geometrically thin. The gas disk extends
out to $\sim$320~au and is also detected in the inner hole of the dust ring. A twin-line pattern is
found in the channel maps of CO, which can be interpreted as the emission from the front and rear of
the flared gas disk. We perform the radiative transfer calculations using RADMC-3D, to check whether
the twin-line pattern can be reproduced under the assumption that the flared gas disk has a power-law
form for the column density and $T_\mathrm{gas}=T_\mathrm{dust}$. The thermal Monte Carlo calculation
in RADMC-3D shows that the disk temperature has a gradient along the vertical direction beyond the
dust ring, as it blocks the stellar radiation, and thus the twin-line pattern can be naturally explained
by the flared gas disk in combination with the dust ring. In addition, no significant depletion of
the CO molecules in the cold midplane achieves a reasonable agreement with the observed twin-line
pattern. This result indicates that the CO emission from the rear surface must be heavily absorbed
in the cold midplane.
