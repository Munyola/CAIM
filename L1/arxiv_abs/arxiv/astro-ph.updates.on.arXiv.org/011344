Plasma processes occurring in the corona and solar wind can be probed by studying the thermodynamic
properties of different ion species. However, most in-situ observations of positive ions in the
solar wind are taken at 1 AU, where information on their solar source properties may have been irreversibly
erased. In this study we aimed to use the properties of alpha particles at heliocentric distances
between 0.3 and 1 AU to study plasma processes occurring at the points of observation, and to infer
processes occurring inside 0.3 AU by comparing our results to previous remote sensing observations
of the plasma closer to the Sun. We reprocessed the original Helios positive ion distribution functions,
isolated the alpha particle population, and computed the alpha particle number density, velocity,
and magnetic field perpendicular and parallel temperatures. We then investigated the radial variation
of alpha particle temperatures in fast solar wind observed between 0.3 and 1 AU. Between 0.3 and 1
AU alpha particles are heated in the magnetic field perpendicular direction, and cooled in the magnetic
field parallel direction. Alpha particle evolution is bounded by the alpha firehose instability
threshold, which provides one possible mechanism to explain the observed parallel cooling and
perpendicular heating. Closer to the Sun our observations suggest that the alpha particles undergo
heating the perpendicular direction, whilst the large magnetic field parallel temperatures observed
at 0.3 AU may be due the combined effect of double adiabatic expansion and alpha particle deceleration
inside 0.3 AU.
