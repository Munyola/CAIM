It is often assumed that the halo-patch fluctuation field can be written as a Taylor series in the
initial Lagrangian dark matter density fluctuation field. We show that if this Lagrangian bias
is local, and the initial conditions are Gaussian, then the two-point cross-correlation between
halos and mass should be linearly proportional to the mass-mass auto-correlation function. This
statement is exact and valid on all scales; there are no higher order contributions, e.g., from terms
proportional to products or convolutions of two-point functions, which one might have thought
would appear upon truncating the Taylor series of the halo bias function. In addition, the auto-correlation
function of locally biased tracers can be written as a Taylor series in the auto-correlation function
of the mass; there are no terms involving, e.g., derivatives or convolutions. Moreover, although
the leading order coefficient, the linear bias factor of the auto-correlation function is just
the square of that for the cross-correlation, it is the same as that obtained from expanding the mean
number of halos as a function of the local density only in the large-scale limit. In principle, these
relations allow simple tests of whether or not halo bias is indeed local in Lagrangian space. We discuss
why things are more complicated in practice. We also discuss our results in light of recent work on
the renormalizability of halo bias, demonstrating that it is better to renormalize than not. We
use the Lognormal model to illustrate many of our findings.
