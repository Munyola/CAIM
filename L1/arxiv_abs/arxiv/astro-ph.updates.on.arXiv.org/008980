We report the detection of linearly polarized emission at 53 and 89 $\mu$m, from the radio-loud active
galactic nucleus (AGN) Cygnus A using HAWC+ onboard SOFIA. We measure a highly polarized core of
$11\pm3$% and $9\pm2$% with a position angle (P.A.) of polarization of $43\pm8^{\circ}$ and $39\pm7^{\circ}$
at 53 and 89 $\mu$m, respectively. We find (1) a synchrotron dominated core with a flat spectrum ($+0.21\pm0.05$)
and a turn-over at $543\pm120$ $\mu$m, which implies synchrotron emission is insignificant in
the infrared (IR), and (2) a $2-500$ $\mu$m bump peaking at $\sim40$ $\mu$m described by a blackbody
component with color temperature of $107\pm9$ K. The polarized SED has the same shape as the IR bump
of the total flux SED. We observe a change in the P.A. of polarization of $\sim20^{\circ}$ from 2 to
89 $\mu$m, which suggests a change of polarization mechanisms. The ultraviolet, optical and near-IR
polarization has been convincingly attributed to scattering by polar dust, consistent with the
usual torus scenario, though this scattered component can only be directly observed from the core
in the near-IR. By contrast, the gradual rotation by $\sim20^{\circ}$ towards the far-IR, and the
near-perfect match between the total and polarized IR bumps, indicate that dust emission from aligned
dust grains becomes dominant at $10-100$ $\mu$m, with a large polarization of 10% at a nearly constant
P.A. This result suggests that a coherent dusty and magnetic field structure dominates the $10-100$
$\mu$m emission around the AGN.
