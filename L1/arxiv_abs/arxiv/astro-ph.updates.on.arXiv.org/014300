X-rays in intermediate polars (IPs) originate in a compact region near the surface of a magnetic
white dwarf (WD) and interact with the complex environment surrounding the emission region. Here
we report a case study of two IPs, TV Col and V2731 Oph with selected archival X-ray observations (NuSTAR,
Swift, Suzaku, and XMM-Newton). For TV Col, we were successful in simultaneously accounting for
the primary X-rays, the secondary X-rays due to Compton scattering and fluorescence, and the effects
of local absorbers. In this case, we were able to demonstrate that the shock height is small, based
on the high reflection amplitude, and hence the maximum temperature of the post-shock region can
be used to derive the WD mass of 0.735+/-0.015 Msun. Despite the high specific accretion rate required
to explain the small shock height, we do not detect any spin modulation in our NuSTAR data, consistent
with the modest amount of complex absorption seen spectroscopically. We argue that our results
are robust because they are based on the joint temporal-spectral analysis of broadband X-ray data.
The spectrum of V2731 Oph is more highly absorbed. Through our analysis of the Suzaku data, we present
a spectral model with nitrogen overabundance without the previously claimed soft blackbody that
should be further explored. We have been unable to constrain reflection amplitude for V2731 Oph;
this and the detection of spin modulation above 10 keV suggest that it may have a tall shock, hence
we only derive a lower limit to the mass of its WD (> 0.9 Msun).
