The existence of the most massive cosmological objects can be used as a tool to study properties of
the Universe, such as the nature of gravity and dark sector, as well as, the Gaussianity of primordial
fluctuations. This article investigates the existence of the most massive objects in the Universe
using the Simsilun simulation, which is based on the approximation of the silent universe. The approximation
of the silent universes is based on the exact solution of the Einstein field equations with no rotation
and energy transfer. In the limit of spatial homogeneity and isotropy the silent universes reduce
to the standard FLRW models. The most distinctive feature of silent universes is the differential
expansion of space, i.e. the expansion rate depends on local conditions such as density and shear.
In this paper we show that the differential expansion of space impacts the formation and evolution
of most massive objects. We compare the predictions obtained from the Simsilun simulation with
the results obtain using the Tinker mass function. The mass function obtained from the Simsilun
simulation has a slightly higher amplitude at the high-mass end compared to the Tinker mass function.
The most massive objects expected within the Simsilun simulation are $6.3^{+1.0}_{-0.8} \, \times
10^{15} M_\odot$; for comparison the Tinker mass function predicts that the most massive object
is of the mass $4.4^{+0.8}_{-0.6} \, \times 10^{15} M_\odot$. The results of this paper highlight
the importance of the differential expansion and emphasises the need to account for this effect
when analysing the cluster data.
