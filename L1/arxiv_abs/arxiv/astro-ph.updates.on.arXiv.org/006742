The use of high-quality simulated sky catalogs is essential for the success of cosmological surveys.
The catalogs have diverse applications, such as investigating signatures of fundamental physics
in cosmological observables, understanding the effect of systematic uncertainties on measured
signals and testing mitigation strategies for reducing these uncertainties, aiding analysis
pipeline development and testing, and survey strategy optimization. The list of applications
is growing with improvements in the quality of the catalogs and the details that they can provide.
Given the importance of simulated catalogs, it is critical to provide rigorous validation protocols
that enable both catalog providers and users to assess the quality of the catalogs in a straightforward
and comprehensive way. For this purpose, we have developed the DESCQA framework for the Large Synoptic
Survey Telescope Dark Energy Science Collaboration as well as for the broader community. The goal
of DESCQA is to enable the inspection, validation, and comparison of an inhomogeneous set of synthetic
catalogs via the provision of a common interface within an automated framework. In this paper, we
present the design concept and first implementation of DESCQA. In order to establish and demonstrate
its full functionality we use a set of interim catalogs and validation tests. We highlight several
important aspects, both technical and scientific, that require thoughtful consideration when
designing a validation framework, including validation metrics and how these metrics impose requirements
on the synthetic sky catalogs.
