The degree of turbulent pressure support by residual gas motions in galaxy clusters is not well known.
The X-ray spectrometer on board Hitomi satellite has measured the turbulent velocities in the centre
of the Perseus cluster, whereas the mass modelling of combined X-ray and Sunyaev Zel'dovich observations
gives an estimate of this support in the outer regions of galaxy clusters. Cosmological simulations
may help to quantify the amount of turbulent pressure, but the estimates vary widely. In this work,
we test a new filtering technique to disentangle the bulk gas motion from the turbulent one in high-resolution
cosmological simulations of galaxy clusters using the cosmological hydro code ENZO. We focused
on the ratio of non-thermal pressure to total gas pressure as a function of cluster-centric distance.
We find that the radial behavior can be described by a simple polynomial functional form. The typical
non-thermal pressure support in the centre of clusters is $\sim$5\% increasing to $\sim$15\% in
the outskirts in line with the pressure excess found in recent X-ray observations. We also find that
the total mass recovered under the assumption of the hydrostatic equilibrium is affected by an hydrostatic
mass bias with a no-negligible contribution from residual radial accelerations of the gas, often
yielding differences compared to the real turbulent energy budget in simulations. Our study highlights
the relation between shocks and radial accelerations, and the role of gas dynamical processes in
the hydrostatic mass bias.
