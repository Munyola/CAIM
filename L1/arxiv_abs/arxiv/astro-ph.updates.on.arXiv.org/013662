We present magnetohydrodynamic simulation of the evolution from quasi-equilibrium to onset of
eruption of a twisted, prominence-forming coronal magnetic flux rope underlying a corona streamer.
The flux rope is built up by an imposed flux emergence at the lower boundary. During the quasi-static
phase of the evolution, we find the formation of a prominence-cavity system with qualitative features
resembling observations, as shown by the synthetic SDO/AIA EUV images with the flux rope observed
above the limb viewed nearly along its axis. The cavity contains substructures including ``U''-shaped
or horn-liked features extending from the prominence enclosing a central ``cavity'' on top of the
prominence. The prominence condensations form in the dips of the highly twisted field lines due
to runaway radiative cooling and the cavity is formed by the density depleted portions of the prominence-carrying
field lines extending up from the dips. The prominence ``horns'' are threaded by twisted field lines
containing shallow dips, where the prominence condensations have evaporated to coronal temperatures.
The central ``cavity'' enclosed by the horns is found to correspond to a central hot and dense core
containing twisted field lines that do not have dips. The flux rope eventually erupts as its central
part rises quasi-statically to a critical height consistent with the onset of the torus instability.
The erupting flux rope accelerates to a fast speed of nearly 900 km/s and the associated prominence
eruption shows significant rotational motion and a kinked morphology.
