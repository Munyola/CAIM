Large scale solar magnetic field topology has a great influence on the structure of the corona, heliosphera
and geomagnetic perturbations. Data obtained over the last three solar cycles have been analysed
to reveal the relationships between the photospheric field measured along the line of sight by the
WSO group at 30 levels of heliolatitudes from -75 to 75 degrees and the interplanetary magnetic field
The main aim of this first paper is to make a direct comparison between the basic structure and dynamics
of the photospheric magnetic field and components and intensity of the interplanetary magnetic
field % solar wind and geomagnetic parameters without using theoretical assumptions, models,
physical expectations, etc. The second paper by Gavryuseva, 2018d presents the raports between
different characteristics of the solar wind at the Earth orbit, and geomagnetic parameters provided
by the OMNI team. % Data obtained over the last three solar cycles have been analysed % to reveal the

groups characterized by their response to variability of the solar magnetic field latitudinal
structures on short and on long time scales.
