Lyman Limit systems (LLSs) trace the low-density circumgalactic medium and the most dense regions
of the intergalactic medium, so their number density and evolution at high redshift, just after
reionisation, are important to constrain. We present a survey for LLSs at high redshifts, $z_{\rm
LLS} =3.5$--5.4, in the homogeneous dataset of 153 optical quasar spectra at $z \sim 5$ from the Giant
Gemini GMOS survey. Our analysis includes detailed investigation of survey biases using mock spectra
which provide important corrections to the raw measurements. We estimate the incidence of LLSs
per unit redshift at $z \approx 4.4$ to be $\ell(z) = 2.6 \pm 0.4$. Combining our results with previous
surveys at $z_{\rm LLS} <4$, the best-fit power-law evolution is $\ell(z) = \ell_* [(1+z)/4]^\alpha$
with $\ell_* = 1.46 \pm 0.11$ and $\alpha = 1.70 \pm 0.22$ (68\% confidence intervals). Despite hints
in previous $z_{\rm LLS} <4$ results, there is no indication for a deviation from this single power-law
soon after reionization. Finally, we integrate our new results with previous surveys of the intergalactic
and circumgalactic media to constrain the hydrogen column density distribution function, $f(N_{\rm
HI},X)$, over 10 orders of magnitude. The data at $z \sim 5$ are not well described by the $f(N_{\rm
HI},X)$ model previously reported for $z \sim 2$--3 (after re-scaling) and a 7-pivot model fitting
the full $z \sim 2$--5 dataset is statistically unacceptable. We conclude that there is significant
evolution in the shape of $f(N_{\rm HI},X)$ over this $\sim$2 billion year period.
