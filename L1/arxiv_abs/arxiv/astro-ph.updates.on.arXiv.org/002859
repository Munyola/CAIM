Sub-halos in dark-matter-based cosmological simulations tend to be distributed approximately
isotropically around their host. The existence of highly flattened, co-orbiting planes of satellite
galaxies has therefore been identified as a possible problem for these cosmological models, but
so far studies have not considered the hosts' environments. That satellite planes are now known
around both major galaxies in the Local Group raises the question whether they are more likely around
paired hosts. In a first attempt to investigate this possibility we focus on the flattening and orbital
coherence of the 11 brightest satellite galaxies of the vast polar structure (VPOS) around the Milky
Way (MW). We search for VPOS analogs in the ELVIS suite of cosmological simulations, which consist
of 24 paired and 24 isolated host halos. We do not find significant differences between the properties
of sub-halo distributions around paired and isolated hosts. The observed flattening and the observed
orbital alignment are each reproduced by only 0.2 to 2 per cent of paired and isolated systems incorporating
the obscuration of satellites by randomly oriented galactic discs. Only one of all 4800 analyzed
realizations (0.02 per cent) reproduces both parameters simultaneously, but the average orbital
pole of this sub-halo system does not align as well with the normal to the plane fit as observed. That
the MW is part of a galaxy pair thus does not help in explaining the existence of the VPOS if the satellite
galaxies are identified with sub-halos found in dissipationless simulations.
