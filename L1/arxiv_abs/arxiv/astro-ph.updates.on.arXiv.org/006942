We present a study of the dust-to-gas ratios in five nearby galaxies NGC 628 (M74), NGC 6503, NGC 7793,
UGC 5139 (Holmberg I), and UGC 4305 (Holmberg II). Using Hubble Space Telescope broad band WFC3/UVIS
UV and optical images from the Treasury program LEGUS (Legacy ExtraGalactic UV Survey) combined
with archival HST/ACS data, we correct thousands of individual stars for extinction across these
five galaxies using an isochrone-matching (reddening-free Q) method. We generate extinction
maps for each galaxy from the individual stellar extinctions using both adaptive and fixed resolution
techniques, and correlate these maps with neutral HI and CO gas maps from literature, including
The HI Nearby Galaxy Survey (THINGS) and the HERA CO-Line Extragalactic Survey (HERACLES). We calculate
dust-to-gas ratios and investigate variations in the dust-to-gas ratio with galaxy metallicity.
We find a power law relationship between dust-to-gas ratio and metallicity, consistent with other
studies of dust-to-gas ratio compared to metallicity. We find a change in the relation when H$_2$
is not included. This implies that underestimation of $N_{H_2}$ in low-metallicity dwarfs from
a too-low CO-to-H$_2$ conversion factor $X_{CO}$ could have produced too low a slope in the derived
relationship between dust-to-gas ratio and metallicity. We also compare our extinctions to those
derived from fitting the spectral energy distribution (SED) using the Bayesian Extinction and
Stellar Tool (BEAST) for NGC 7793 and find systematically lower extinctions from SED-fitting as
compared to isochrone matching.
