In 2018-2019 the VERITAS VHE gamma-ray observatory was augmented with highspeed optical instrumentation
and continuous data recording electronics to create a sensitive Stellar Intensity Interferometry
(SII) observatory, VERITAS-SII. The primary science goal of VERITAS-SII is to perform stellar
diameter measurements and image analysis in the visible wavebands on a selection of bright (m< 6),
hot (O/B/A) stars. The VERITAS Collaboration has agreed to the deployment and operation of VERITAS-SII
during several days each month around the full moon period when VERITAS does not perform VHE gamma-ray
observations. The VERITAS-SII augmentation employs custom high-speed/low-noise focal plane
instrumentation using high quantum efficiency photomultiplier tubes, and a battery-powered,
fiber-optic controlled High Voltage supply. To reduce engineering time, VERITAS-SII uses commercially
available high-speed (250 MS/sec), continuously streaming electronics to record the time dependence
of the intensity fluctuations at each VERITAS telescope. VERITAS-SII also uses fast ( < 100 psec)
data acquisition clock synchronization over inter-telescope distances (greater than 100 m) using
a commercially available White Rabbit based timing solution. VERITAS-SII is now in full operation
at the VERITAS observatory, F.L.Whipple Observatory, Amado, AZ USA. This paper describes the design
of the instrumentation hardware used for VERITAS-SII augmentation of the VERITAS observatory,
the status of initial VERITAS-SII observations, and plans for future improvements to VERITAS-SII.
