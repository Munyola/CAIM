Debris disks are second generation dusty disks thought to be devoid of gas. However, this idea has
been challenged in the last years by gas detections in some systems. We compiled a database of 301
debris disks and collected high--resolution optical spectra for $\sim77\%$ of them. From the analysis
of these data we identified a group of 23 debris disks presenting several absorption features superimposed
to the photospheric Ca II and Na I doublets. These absorptions could be due to circumstellar material
or interstellar clouds. In order to discriminate between the two scenarios, we characterized each
feature in terms of its radial velocity, equivalent width and column density. Additionally, we
searched in the literature for local clouds in the line of sight of the stars, and looked for the presence
of similar absorption features in nearby stars. Our study concludes that while all the objects present
interstellar absorptions in their spectra, three objects show features more compatible with circumstellar
origin: HD 110058 presents a stable circumstellar absorption, while HR 4796 and c Aql present variable
absorption features likely due to exocometary activity. The minute-scale variability we detect
towards c Aql is the shortest of this kind detected so far. The detection of circumstellar features
in these objects is consistent with their near edge-on inclinations. We also provide evidence challenging
previous claims of circumstellar gas detections for HR 6507. Given the properties of the sample,
we speculate that transient gaseous events must be a common phenomenon among debris disks.
