Understanding the detailed process of cosmic reionization is one of the remaining problems in astrophysics
and cosmology. Here we construct a model of cosmic reionization that includes contribution from
high-$z$ galaxies and active galactic nuclei (AGNs), and calculate the reionization and thermal
histories with the model. To keep the model to be general and realistic, we vary the escape fraction
of ionizing photons, $f_{\rm esc}$, and the faint-end slope of the AGN luminosity function at high
redshifts, $\alpha_{\rm hz}$, within the constraints from the observed cosmic star formation
history and the observed bright-end UV luminosity functions at $z \leq 6$. Additionally, we model
the spectral energy distribution (SED) of AGNs which depends on the Eddington ratio and the black-hole
mass. By comparing the computed reionization histories with the observed \ion{H}{i} fractions
and the optical depth for Thomson scattering from Planck, we find that $\alpha_{\rm hz} > -1.5$ and
$f_{\rm esc} < 0.15$ are favored when we employ the bright-end luminosity function obtained by Giallongo
et al. Our result suggests that an AGN-dominated model with the abundance of faint-AGNs being as
large as the estimate by Giallongo et al. is allowed only if the contribution from high-z galaxies
is almost negligible, while a galaxy-dominant model is also allowed. We also find that the shape
of SED has a significant impact on the thermal history. Therefore it is expected that measurements
of the thermal state of the IGM provide useful information on properties of ionizing sources.
