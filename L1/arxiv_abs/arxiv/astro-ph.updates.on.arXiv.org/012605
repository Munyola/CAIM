The emergence of active regions (ARs) leads to various dynamic activities. Using high-resolution
and long-lasting H$\alpha$ observations from the New Vacuum Solar Telescope, we report the dynamics
of NOAA AR 12700 in its emerging phase on 26 February 2018 in detail. In this AR, constant interchange
reconnections between emerging fibrils and preexisting ones were detected. Driven by the flux
emergence, small-scale fibrils observed in H$\alpha$ wavelength continuously emerged at the
center of the AR and reconnected with the ambient preexisting fibrils, forming new longer fibrils.
We investigate three scenarios of such interchange reconnection in two hours. Specially, the third
scenario of reconnection resulted in the formation of longer fibrils that show pronounced rotation
motion. To derive the evolution of the magnetic structure during the reconnections, we perform
nonlinear force-free field extrapolations. The extrapolated three-dimensional magnetic fields
clearly depict a set of almost potential emerging loops, two preexisting flux ropes at 03:00 UT before
the second reconnection scenario, and a set of newly formed loops with less twist at 03:48 UT after
the third reconnection scenario. All of these extrapolated structures are consistent with the
fibrils detected in H$\alpha$ wavelength. The aforementioned observations and extrapolation
results suggest that the constant interchange reconnections resulted in that the magnetic twist
was redistributed from preexisting flux ropes towards the newly-formed system with longer magnetic
structure and weaker twist.
