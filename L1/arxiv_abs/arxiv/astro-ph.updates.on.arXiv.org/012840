We propose a novel approach to accurately pin down the systematics due to the peculiar velocities
of galaxies in measuring the Hubble constant from nearby galaxies in current and future gravitational-wave
(GW) standard-siren experiments. Given the precision that future GW standard-siren experiments
aim to achieve, the peculiar velocities of nearby galaxies will be a major source of uncertainty.
Unlike the conventional backward reconstruction that requires additional redshift-independent
distance indicators to recover the peculiar velocity field, we forwardly model the peculiar velocity
field by using a high-fidelity mock galaxy catalog built from high-resolution dark matter only
(DMO) N-body simulations with a physically motivated subhalo abundance matching technique without
introducing any free parameters. Our mock galaxy catalog can impressively well reproduce the observed
spectroscopic redshift space distortions (RSDs) in highly non-linear regimes down to very small
scales, which is a robust test of the velocity field of our mock galaxy catalog. Based on this mock
galaxy catalog, we accurately, for the first time, measure the peculiar velocity probability distributions
for the SDSS main galaxy samples. We find that the systematics induced by the peculiar velocities
of SDSS like galaxies on the measured Hubble constant can be reduced to below $1\%$($1\sigma$) for
GW host galaxies with a Hubble flow redshift just above $0.13$, a distance that can be well probed
by future GW experiments and galaxy surveys.
