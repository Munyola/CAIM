Understanding planet formation requires to discern how dust grows in protoplanetary disks. An
important parameter to measure in disks is the maximum dust grain size present. This is usually estimated
through measurements of the dust opacity at different millimeter wavelengths assuming optically
thin emission and dust opacity dominated by absorption. However, ALMA observations have shown
that these assumptions might not be correct in the case of protoplanetary disks, leading to overestimation
of particle sizes and to underestimation of the disk's mass. Here, we present an analysis of high
quality ALMA and VLA images of the HL~Tau protoplanetary disk, covering a wide range of wavelengths,
from 0.8~mm to 1~cm, and with a physical resolution of $\sim$7.35~au. We describe a procedure to
analyze a set of millimeter images without any assumption about the optical depth of the emission,
and including the effects of absorption and scattering in the dust opacity. This procedure allows
us to obtain the dust temperature, the dust surface density and the maximum particle size at each
radius. In the HL~Tau disk, we found that particles have already grown up to a few millimeters in size.
We detect differences in the dust properties between dark and bright rings, with dark rings containing
low dust density and small dust particles. Different features in the HL~Tau disk seem to have different
origins. Planet-disk interactions can explain substructure at the external half of the disk, but
the internal rings seem to be associated to the presence of snow lines of several molecules.
