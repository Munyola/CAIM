The majority of spiral and elliptical galaxies in the Universe host very dense and compact stellar
systems at their centres known as nuclear star clusters (NSCs). In this work we study the stellar
populations and star formation histories (SFH) of the NSCs of six nearby galaxies with stellar masses
ranging between $2$ and $8\times10^9~{\rm M_{\odot}}$ (four late-type spirals and two early-types)
with high resolution spectroscopy. Our observations are taken with the X-Shooter spectrograph
at the VLT. We make use of an empirical simple stellar population (SSP) model grid to fit composite
stellar populations to the data and recover the SFHs of the nuclei. We find that the nuclei of all late-type
galaxies experienced a prolonged SFH, while the NSCs of the two early-types are consistent with
SSPs. The NSCs in the late-type galaxies sample appear to have formed a significant fraction of their
stellar mass already more than $10$ Gyr ago, while the NSCs in the two early-type galaxies are surprisingly
younger. Stars younger than $100$ Myr are present in at least two nuclei: NGC 247 and NGC 7793, with
some evidence for young star formation in NGC 300's NSC. The NSCs of the spirals NGC 247 and NGC 300
are consistent with prolonged \in situ star formation with a gradual metallicity enrichment from
$\sim-1.5$ dex more than $10$ Gyr ago, reaching super-Solar values few hundred Myr ago. NGC 3621
appears to be very metal rich already in the early Universe and NGC 7793 presents us with a very complex
SFH, likely dominated by merging of various massive star clusters coming from different environments.
