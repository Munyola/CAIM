The ubiquitous variability of quasars across a wide range of wavelengths and timescales encodes
critical information about the structure and dynamics of the circumnuclear emitting regions that
are too small to be directly resolved, as well as detailed underlying physics of accretion and feedback
processes in these active supermassive black holes. We emphasize the importance of studying quasar
variability with time-domain spectroscopy, focusing on two science cases: (1) reverberation
mapping (RM) to measure the broad-line region sizes and black hole masses in distant quasars; (2)
spectroscopic follow-up of extreme variability quasars that dramatically change their continuum
and broad-line flux within several years. We highlight the need for dedicated optical-infrared
spectroscopic survey facilities in the coming decades to accompany wide-area time-domain imaging
surveys, including: (1) the next phase of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS-V; ~2020-2025), an
all-sky, time-domain multi-object spectroscopic survey with 2.5m-class telescopes; (2) the
planned Maunakea Spectroscopic Explorer, a dedicated 10m-class spectroscopic survey telescope
with a 1.5 sq. deg field-of-view and multiplex of thousands of fibers in both optical and near-IR
(J+H) to begin operations in 2029; (3) the Time-domain Spectroscopic Observatory (TSO), a proposed
Probe-class ~1.3m telescope at L2, with imaging and spectroscopy (R=200, 1800) in 4 bands (0.3 -
5 micron) and rapid slew capability to 90% of sky, which will extend the coverage of Hbeta to z=8.
