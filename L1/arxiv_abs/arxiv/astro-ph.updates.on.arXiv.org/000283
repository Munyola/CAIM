We study the efficiency of growing large bodies, starting from a sea of equal-sized planetesimal
seeds. This is likely one of the earlier steps of planet formation and is related to the origin of the
asteroid belt, the Kuiper belt and extra-solar debris disks. Here we study the case that the seeds
do not collide frequently enough for dynamical cooling to be important (the collisionless limit),
using a newly constructed conglomeration code, and by carefully comparing numerical results with
analytical scalings. We find that large bodies grow primarily by accreting small seeds (and not
by accreting each other). As the velocity dispersion of the small bodies (u) is increasingly excited
by the growing big bodies, growth passes from the well-known run-away stage (when u is higher than
the big bodies' hill velocity) to the newly discovered trans-hill stage (when u and big bodies both
grow, but u remains at the big bodies' hill velocity). We find, concurring with analytical understandings
developed in Lithwick (2013), as well as previous numerical studies, that a size spectrum dn/dR
~ R^{-4} results, and the formation efficiency, defined as mass fraction in bodies much greater
than the seed sizes, is ~ a few times R_sun/a, or ~10^{-3} at the distance of the Kuiper belt. This extreme
inefficiency argues against the collisionless limit for the formation of the Kuiper belt and extra-solar
debris disks. To conglomerate large bodies in those regions, the initial planetesimals may have
to be small and highly collisional.
