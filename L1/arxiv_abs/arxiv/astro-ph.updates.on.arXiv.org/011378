We quantify the star formation (SF) in the inner cores ($\mathcal{R}$/$R_{200}$$\leq$0.3) of
24 massive galaxy clusters at 0.2$\lesssim$$z$$\lesssim$0.9 observed by the $Herschel$ Lensing
Survey and the Cluster Lensing and Supernova survey with $Hubble$. These programmes, covering
the rest-frame ultraviolet to far-infrared regimes, allow us to accurately characterize stellar
mass-limited ($\mathcal{M}_{*}$$>$$10^{10}$ $M_{\odot}$) samples of star-forming cluster
members (not)-detected in the mid- and/or far-infrared. We release the catalogues with the photometry,
photometric redshifts, and physical properties of these samples. We also quantify the SF displayed
by comparable field samples from the Cosmic Assembly Near-infrared Deep Extragalactic Legacy
Survey. We find that in intermediate-$z$ cluster cores, the SF activity is suppressed with respect
the field in terms of both the fraction ($\mathcal{F}$) of star-forming galaxies (SFG) and the rate
at which they form stars ($\mathcal{SFR}$ and $s\mathcal{SFR} = \mathcal{SFR}/\mathcal{M}_{*}$).
On average, the $\mathcal{F}$ of SFGs is a factor $\sim$$2$ smaller in cluster cores than in the field.
Furthermore, SFGs present average $\mathcal{SFR}$ and $s\mathcal{SFR}$ typically $\sim$0.3
dex smaller in the clusters than in the field along the whole redshift range probed. Our results favour
long time-scale quenching physical processes as the main driver of SF suppression in the inner cores
of clusters since $z$$\sim$0.9, with shorter time-scale processes being very likely responsible
for a fraction of the missing SFG population.
