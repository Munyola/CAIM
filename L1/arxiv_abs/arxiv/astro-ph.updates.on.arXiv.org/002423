Massive quiescent galaxies at $z \approx 2$ are apparently much more compact than galaxies of comparable
mass today. How robust are these size measurements? We perform comprehensive simulations to determine
possible biases and uncertainties in fitting single-component light distributions to real galaxies.
In particular, we examine the robustness of the measurements of the luminosity, size, and other
structural parameters. We devise simulations with increasing realism to systematically disentangle
effects due to the technique (specifically using GALFIT) and the intrinsic structures of the galaxies.
By accurately capturing the detailed substructures of nearby elliptical galaxies and then rescaling
their sizes and signal-to-noise to mimic galaxies at different redshifts, we confirm that the massive
quiescent galaxies at $z \approx 2$ are significantly more compact intrinsically than their local
counterparts. Their observed compactness is not a result of missing faint outer light due to systematic
errors in modeling. In fact, we find that fitting multi-component galaxies with a single S\'ersic
profile, the procedure most commonly adopted in the literature, biases the inferred sizes higher
by up to 10% - 20%, which accentuates the amount of size evolution required. If the sky estimation
has been done robustly and the model for the point-spread function is fairly accurate, GALFIT can
retrieve the properties of single-component galaxies over a wide range of signal-to-noise ratios
without introducing any systematic errors.
