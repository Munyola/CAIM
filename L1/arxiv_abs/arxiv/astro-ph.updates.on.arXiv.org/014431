We present a novel method to uniquely constrain the collisional evolution of globular cluster (GC)
populations that are hypothesized to have recently underwent an episode of violent relaxation
due to a strong galaxy-galaxy interaction. We show via analytic methods that numerical simulations
combined with observed constraints on the GC luminosity function can be used to constrain the GC
mass function immediately after the assumed episode of violent relaxation. In order to apply our
method, we first explore the observational evidence for a collisional origin for the recently discovered
dark matter (DM)-free ultra-diffuse galaxies observed in the NGC 1052 group. We compute the timescales
for infall to the central nucleus due to dynamical friction (DF) for the GCs in NGC 1052-DF2 and NGC
1052-DF4, using the shortest of these times to constrain how long ago such an interaction could have
occurred. We find that two out of ten GCs in NGC 1052-DF2 and one out of seven in NGC 1052-DF4 have DF
timescales less than a Hubble time. We go on to quantify the initial GC numbers and densities needed
for significant collisional evolution to occur within the allotted times. Finally, we apply our
method to these galaxies, in order to illustrate its efficacy in constraining their dynamical evolution
post-violent relaxation. Our results motivate more complete observations of the GC luminosity
functions in these galaxies, which can be used to constrain the origins of the hypothesized DM-free
galaxies, by combining the method presented here with a suite of numerical simulations.
