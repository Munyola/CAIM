We present a spectroscopic study of the tidal tails and core of the Milky Way satellite Tucana III,
collectively referred to as the Tucana III stream, using the 2dF+AAOmega spectrograph on the Anglo-Australian
Telescope and the IMACS spectrograph on the Magellan/Baade Telescope. In addition to recovering
the brightest 9 previously known member stars in the Tucana III core, we identify 22 members in the
tidal tails. We observe strong evidence for a velocity gradient of 8.0 km/s/deg (or 18.3 km/s/kpc
over at least 3$^{\circ}$ (or 1.3 kpc) on the sky. Based on the continuity in velocity we confirm that
the Tucana III tails are real tidal extensions of Tucana III. The large velocity gradient of the stream
implies that Tucana III is likely on a radial orbit. We successfully obtain metallicities for 4 members
in the core and 12 members in the tails. We find that members close to the ends of the stream tend to be
more metal-poor than members in the core, indicating a possible metallicity gradient between the
center of the progenitor halo and its edge. The spread in metallicity suggests that the progenitor
of the Tucana III stream is a dwarf galaxy rather than a star cluster. Furthermore, we find that with
the precise photometry of the Dark Energy Survey data, there is a discernible color offset between
metal-rich disk stars and metal-poor stream members. This metallicity-dependent color offers
a more efficient method to recognize metal-poor targets and will increase the selection efficiency
of stream members for future spectroscopic follow-up programs on stellar streams.
