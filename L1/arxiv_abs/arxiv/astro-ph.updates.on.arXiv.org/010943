The double-degenerate model, involving the merger of double carbon-oxygen white dwarfs (CO WDs),
is one of the two classic models for the progenitors of type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). Previous studies
suggested that off-centre carbon burning would occur if the mass-accretion rate (Macc) is relatively
high during the merging process, leading to the formation of oxygen-neon (ONe) cores that may collapse
into neutron stars. However, the off-centre carbon burning is still incompletely understood,
especially when the inwardly propagating burning wave reaches the centre. In this paper, we aim
to investigate the propagating characteristics of burning waves and the subsequently evolutionary
outcomes of these CO cores. We simulated the long-term evolution of CO WDs that accrete CO-rich material
by employing the stellar evolution code MESA on the basis of the thick-disc assumption. We found
that the final outcomes of CO WDs strongly depend on Macc (Msun/yr) based on the thick-disc assumption,
which can be divided into four regions: (1) explosive carbon ignition in the centre, then SNe Ia (Macc
< 2.45*10^-6); (2) OSi cores, then neutron stars (2.45*10^-6 < Macc < 4.5*10^-6); (3) ONe cores,
then e-capture SNe (4.5*10^-6 < Macc < 1.05*10^-5); (4) off-centre oxygen and neon ignition, then
off-centre explosion or Si-Fe cores (Macc > 1.05*10^-5). Our results indicate that the final fates
of double CO WD mergers are strongly dependent on the merging processes (e.g. slow merger, fast merger,
composite merger, violent merger, etc.).
