Carbon Radio Recombination Lines trace the interface between molecular and atomic gas. We present
GMRT observations of Carbon Radio Recombination Lines (CRRL), C$\alpha$244-C$\alpha$250 towards
Cassiopeia A. We use a novel technique of stacking the emission lines in the visibility domain to
obtain, for the first time, sub-pc resolution optical depth maps of these CRRLs. The emission shows
a wide range of spatial and velocity structures, some of which are unresolved within our synthesis
beam of 0.29 pc and velocity channel of 0.55 km/s. These variations in the emission optical depth
and line width are indicative of inhomogeneity and fragmentation in the intervening Perseus Arm
gas. We compare the distribution of the CRRL emission with that of diffuse and dense molecular gas
using existing CO and H$_2$CO studies. We find that the CO emission in the -47 km/s Perseus Arm component
is primarily concentrated along an elongated structure detected in our CRRL maps, to the south of
which lies the high-density molecular clumps traced by H$_2$CO. This spatial distribution of CRRL
and molecular tracers is similar to what one would observe for a Photo Dissociation Region (PDR).
In the other Perseus Arm component centered at -37 km/s, there is evidence for high column density
(N$_{H_2}$ ~ $10^{22}$cm$^{-2}$) molecular clumps embedded in diffuse CO as well as CRRL emission
towards the center of Cassiopeia A. We propose that the CRRL emissions coincident with molecular
tracers originates from the line of sight integrated component of the C$^{+}$ envelope of the molecular
gas.
