HD 142527 is a young pre-main sequence star with properties indicative of the presence of a giant
planet or/and a low-mass stellar companion. We have analyzed an X-Shooter/Very Large Telescope
spectrum to provide accurate stellar parameters and accretion rate. The analysis of the spectrum,
together with constraints provided by the SED fitting, the distance to the star (140 +- 20 pc) and
the use of evolutionary tracks and isochrones, lead to the following set of parameters T_eff = 6550
+- 100 K, log g = 3.75 +- 0.10, L_*/L_sun = 16.3 +- 4.5, M_*/M_sun = 2.0 +- 0.3 and an age of 5.0 +- 1.5 Myr.
This stellar age provides further constrains to the mass of the possible companion estimated by
Biller et al. (2012), being in-between 0.20 and 0.35 M_sun. Stellar accretion rates obtained from
UV Balmer excess modelling, optical photospheric line veiling, and from the correlations with
several emission lines spanning from the UV to the near-IR, are consistent to each other. The mean
value from all previous tracers is 2 (+- 1) x 10^-7 M_sun yr^-1, which is within the upper limit gas
flow rate from the outer to the inner disk recently provided by Cassasus et al. (2013). This suggests
that almost all gas transferred between both components of the disk is not trapped by the possible
planet(s) in-between but fall onto the central star, although it is discussed how the gap flow rate
could be larger than previously suggested. In addition, we provide evidence showing that the stellar
accretion rate of HD 142527 has increased by a factor ~ 7 on a timescale of 2-5 years.
