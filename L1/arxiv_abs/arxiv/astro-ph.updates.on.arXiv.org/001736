The Galaxy And Mass Assembly (GAMA) survey furnishes a deep redshift catalog that, when combined
with the Wide-field Infrared Explorer ($WISE$), allows us to explore for the first time the mid-infrared
properties of $> 110, 000$ galaxies over 120 deg$^2$ to $z\simeq 0.5$. In this paper we detail
the procedure for producing the matched GAMA-$WISE$ catalog for the G12 and G15 fields, in particular
characterising and measuring resolved sources; the complete catalogs for all three GAMA equatorial
fields will be made available through the GAMA public releases. The wealth of multiwavelength photometry
and optical spectroscopy allows us to explore empirical relations between optically determined
stellar mass (derived from synthetic stellar population models) and 3.4micron and 4.6micron WISE
measurements. Similarly dust-corrected Halpha-derived star formation rates can be compared
to 12micron and 22micron luminosities to quantify correlations that can be applied to large samples
to $z<0.5$. To illustrate the applications of these relations, we use the 12micron star formation
prescription to investigate the behavior of specific star formation within the GAMA-WISE sample
and underscore the ability of WISE to detect star-forming systems at $z\sim0.5$. Within galaxy
groups (determined by a sophisticated friends-of-friends scheme), results suggest that galaxies
with a neighbor within 100$\,h^{-1} $kpc have, on average, lower specific star formation rates
than typical GAMA galaxies with the same stellar mass.
