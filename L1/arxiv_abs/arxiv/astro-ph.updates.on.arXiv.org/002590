HDE228766 is a very massive binary system hosting a secondary component, which is probably in an
intermediate evolutionary stage between an Of supergiant and an WN star. The wind of this star collides
with the wind of its O8 II companion, leading to relatively strong X-ray emission. Measuring the
orbital variations of the line-of-sight absorption toward the X-ray emission from the wind-wind
interaction zone yields information on the wind densities of both stars. X-ray spectra have been
collected at three key orbital phases to probe the winds of both stars. Optical photometry has been
gathered to set constraints on the orbital inclination of the system. The X-ray spectra reveal prominent
variations of the intervening column density toward the X-ray emission zone, which are in line with
the expectations for a wind-wind collision. We use a toy model to set constraints on the stellar wind
parameters by attempting to reproduce the observed variations of the relative fluxes and wind optical
depths at 1 keV. The lack of strong optical eclipses sets an upper limit of about 68 degrees on the orbital
inclination. The analysis of the variations of the X-ray spectra suggests an inclination in the
range 54 - 61 degrees and indicates that the secondary wind momentum ratio exceeds that of the primary
by at least a factor 5. Our models further suggest that the bulk of the X-ray emission arises from the
innermost region of the wind interaction zone, which is from a region whose outer radius, as measured
from the secondary star, lies between 0.5 and 1.5 times the orbital separation.
