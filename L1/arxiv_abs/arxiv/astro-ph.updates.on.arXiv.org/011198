Supercritical accretion onto compact objects powers a massive wind that is optically thick and
Eddington-limited. If most of the hard X-rays from the central disk are obscured by the wind, the
source will display a blackbody-like spectrum with a luminosity scaled with the mass of the compact
object. From the Chandra archive of nearby galaxies, we selected a sample of luminous and very soft
sources and excluded contaminations from foreground objects and supernova remnants. They are
found to be preferentially associated with late-type galaxies. The majority of sources in our sample
are either too hot or too luminous to be explained by nuclear burning on the surface of white dwarfs,
and are argued to be powered by accretion. The most likely explanation is that they are due to emission
from the photosphere of a wind driven by supercritical accretion onto compact objects. Their blackbody
luminosity ranges from ~10^37 to nearly 10^40 erg/s, indicative of the presence of both neutron
stars and stellar-mass black holes. The blackbody luminosity also shows a possible bimodal distribution,
albeit at low significance, peaked around the Eddington limit for neutron stars and stellar-mass
black holes, respectively. If this can be confirmed, it will be smoking gun evidence that supercritical
accretion powers thick winds. Based on a wind model, the inferred mass accretion rate of these objects
is around a few hundred times the Eddington rate, suggesting that they may be intermediate between
the canonical ultraluminous X-ray sources and SS 433 in terms of the accretion rate.
