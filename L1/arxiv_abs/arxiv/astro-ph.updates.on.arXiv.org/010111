We test the performance of the semi-analytic self-consistent Just-Jahrei{\ss} disc model (JJ
model) with the astrometric data from the Tycho-Gaia Astrometric Solution (TGAS) sub-catalogue
of the first Gaia data release (Gaia DR1), as well as the radial velocities from the fifth data release
of the Radial Velocity Experiment survey (RAVE DR5). We use a sample of 19,746 thin disc stars from
the TGAS$\times$RAVE cross-match selected in the local solar cylinder of 300 pc radius and 1 kpc
height below the Galactic plane and simulate this sample via the forward modelling technique. First,
we convert the predicted vertical density laws of the thin disc populations into a mock sample. Then
the obtained mock populations are reddened with a 3D dust map and are subjected to the selection criteria
corresponding to the RAVE and TGAS observational limitations as well as to additional cuts applied
to the data sample. We calculate the quantities of interest separately at different heights above
the Galactic plane taking into account the distance error effects separately in horizontal and
vertical directions. We investigate the simulated sample in terms of the vertical number density
profiles, Hess diagrams and velocity distribution functions. Basing on a good agreement of our
simulations with the data, we conclude that our fiducial disc model confidently reproduces the
vertical trends in the thin disc stellar population properties. Thus, it can serve as a starting
point for the future extension of the JJ model to other Galactocentric distances.
