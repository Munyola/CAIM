The FU Ori-type young stellar objects are characterized by a sudden increase in luminosity by 1$-$2
orders of magnitude, followed by slow return to the pre-outburst state on timescales of $\sim$10$-$100
yr. The outburst strongly affects the entire disk, changing its thermal structure and radiation
field. In this paper, using a detailed physical-chemical model we study the impact of the FU Ori outburst
on the disk chemical inventory. Our main goal is to identify gas-phase molecular tracers of the outburst
activity that could be observed after the outburst with modern telescopes such as ALMA and NOEMA.
We find that the majority of molecules experience a considerable increase in the total disk gas-phase
abundances due to the outburst, mainly due to the sublimation of their ices. Their return to the pre-outburst
chemical state takes different amounts of time, from nearly instantaneous to very long. Among the
former ones we identify CO, NH$_3$, C$_2$H$_6$, C$_3$H$_4$, etc. Their abundance evolution tightly
follows the luminosity curve. For CO the abundance increase does not exceed an order of magnitude,
while for other tracers the abundances increase by 2$-$5 orders of magnitude. Other molecules like
H$_2$CO and NH$_2$OH have longer retention timescales, remaining in the gas phase for $\sim10-10^3$
yr after the end of the outburst. Thus H$_2$CO could be used as an indicator of the previous outbursts
in the post-outburst FU Ori systems. We investigate the corresponding time-dependent chemistry
in detail and present the most favorable transitions and ALMA configurations for future observations.
