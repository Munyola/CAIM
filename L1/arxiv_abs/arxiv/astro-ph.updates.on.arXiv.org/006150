We present an anisotropic analysis of Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) signal from the SDSS-IV
extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS) Data Release 14 (DR14) quasar sample.
The sample consists of 147,000 quasars distributed over a redshift range of $0.8 < z < 2.2$. We apply
the redshift weights technique to the clustering of quasars in this sample and achieve a 4.6 per cent
measurement of the angular distance measurement $D_M$ at $z = 2.2$ and Hubble parameter $H$ at $z=0.8$.
We parameterize the distance-redshift relation, relative to a fiducial model, as a quadratic expansion.
The coefficients of this expansion are used to reconstruct the distance-redshift relation and
obtain distance and Hubble parameter measurements at all redshifts within the redshift range of
the sample. Reporting the result at two characteristic redshifts, we determine $D_M(z=1) = 3405\pm305
\ (r_{\rm d} / r_{\rm d, fid}) \ {\rm Mpc}$, $H(z=1) = 120.7\pm 7.3 \ (r_{\rm d,fid} / r_{\rm d}) \ {\rm
km} \ {\rm s}^{-1}{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ and $D_M(z=2) = 5325\pm249 \ (r_{\rm d} / r_{\rm d, fid}) \ {\rm
Mpc}$, $H(z=2) = 189.9\pm 32.9 \ (r_{\rm d,fid} / r_{\rm d}) \ {\rm km} \ {\rm s}^{-1}{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$.
These measurements are highly correlated. We assess the outlook of BAO analysis from the final quasar
sample by testing the method on a set of mocks that mimic the noise level in the final sample. We demonstrate
on these mocks that redshift weighting shrinks the measurement error by over 25 per cent on average.
We conclude redshift weighting can bring us closer to the cosmological goal of the final quasar sample.
