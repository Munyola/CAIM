The neutrino process that occurs in the outer stellar shells during a supernova explosion and involves
neutrino-nucleus reactions produces a range of rare, stable and radioactive isotopes. We improve
previous $\nu$-process studies by using, for the first time, the time-dependent neutrino emission
spectra, as predicted from supernova simulations, rather than a simplified parametric description
modeled after the neutron-star cooling phase. In particular, our calculations use time-dependent
neutrino spectra for all neutrino species, consider their deviation from a Fermi-Dirac distribution
and account for the neutrino emission from the neutrino burst and accretion phases. We find that
the time-dependent treatment of the neutrino emission spectra results in higher yields for the
selected nuclei produced by the $\nu$~process as compared to previous studies and also compared
to the approximation of assuming constant neutrino energies corresponding to the time-averaged
mean energy radiated in each species. The effect is largest for nuclides produced by charged-current
reactions. Our results reflect the dynamical competition between neutrino-induced reactions
and the effect of the shock passage through the star. By varying the neutrino burst luminosity and
the duration of the accretion phase, we study the impact of these early emission phases and their
uncertainties on the $\nu$-process nucleosynthesis. We find that the deviation of the neutrino
spectra from a Fermi-Dirac distribution calculated in supernova simulations has a negligible
effect on the $\nu$-process yields.
