The nature and role of the binary companion of carbon-oxygen white dwarf stars that explode as Type
Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are not yet fully understood. Past detections of circumstellar material
(CSM) that contain hydrogen for a small number of SN Ia progenitor systems suggest that at least some
have a nondegenerate companion. In order to constrain the prevalence, location, and quantity of
CSM in SN Ia systems, we performed a near-ultraviolet (NUV) survey with the Hubble Space Telescope
(HST) to look for the high-energy signature of SN Ia ejecta interacting with CSM. Our survey revealed
that SN 2015cp, a SN 1991T-like overluminous SN Ia, was experiencing late-onset interaction between
its ejecta and surrounding CSM at $664$ days after its light-curve peak. We present ground- and space-based
follow-up observations of SN 2015cp that reveal optical emission lines of H and Ca, typical signatures
of ejecta-CSM interaction. We show how SN 2015cp was likely similar to the well-studied SN Ia-CSM
event PTF11kx, making it the second case in which an unambiguously classified SN Ia was observed
to interact with a distant shell of CSM that contains hydrogen ($R_{\rm CSM} \gtrsim 10^{16}\ {\rm
cm}$). The remainder of our HST NUV images of SNe Ia were nondetections that we use to constrain the
occurrence rate of observable late-onset CSM interaction. We apply theoretical models for the
emission from ejecta-CSM interaction to our NUV nondetections, and place upper limits on the mass
and radial extent of CSM in SN Ia progenitor systems.
