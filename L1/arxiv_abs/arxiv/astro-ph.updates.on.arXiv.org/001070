The stellar mass range 8<M/Mo<12 corresponds to the most massive AGB stars and the most numerous
massive stars. It is host to a variety of supernova progenitors and is therefore very important for
galactic chemical evolution and stellar population studies. In this paper, we study the transition
from super-AGB star to massive star and find that a propagating neon-oxygen burning shell is common
to both the most massive electron capture supernova (EC-SN) progenitors and the lowest mass iron-core
collapse supernova (FeCCSN) progenitors. Of the models that ignite neon burning off-center, the
9.5Mo model would evolve to an FeCCSN after the neon-burning shell propagates to the center, as in
previous studies. The neon-burning shell in the 8.8Mo model, however, fails to reach the center
as the URCA process and an extended (0.6 Mo) region of low Ye (0.48) in the outer part of the core begin
to dominate the late evolution; the model evolves to an EC-SN. This is the first study to follow the
most massive EC-SN progenitors to collapse, representing an evolutionary path to EC-SN in addition
to that from SAGB stars undergoing thermal pulses. We also present models of an 8.75Mo super-AGB
star through its entire thermal pulse phase until electron captures on 20Ne begin at its center and
of a 12Mo star up to the iron core collapse. We discuss key uncertainties and how the different pathways
to collapse affect the pre-supernova structure. Finally, we compare our results to the observed
neutron star mass distribution.
