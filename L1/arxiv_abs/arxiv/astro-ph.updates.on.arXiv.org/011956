We revisit the effect of non-linear Landau (NL) damping on the electrostatic instability of blazar-induced
pair beams, using a realistic pair-beam distribution. We employ a simplified 2D model in ${\bf k}$-space
to study the evolution of the electric-field spectrum and to calculate the relaxation time of the
beam. We demonstrate that the 2D model is an adequate representation of the 3D physics. We find that
non-linear Landau damping, once it operates efficiently, transports essentially the entire wave
energy to small wavenumbers where wave driving is weak or absent. The relaxation time also strongly
depends on the IGM temperature, $T_\mathrm{IGM}$, and for $T_\mathrm{IGM}\ll10$ eV, and in the
absence of any other damping mechanism, the relaxation time of the pair beam is longer than the inverse
Compton (IC) scattering time. The weak late-time beam energy losses arise from the accumulation
of wave energy at small $k$, that non-linearly drains the wave energy at the resonant $\mathbf{k}$
of the pair-beam instability. Any other dissipation process operating at small $k$ would reduce
that wave-energy drain and hence lead to stronger pair-beam energy losses. As an example, collisions
reduce the relaxation time by an order of magnitude, although their rate is very small. Other non-linear
processes, such as the modulation instability, could provide additional damping of the non-resonant
waves and dramatically reduce the relaxation time of the pair beam. An accurate description of the
spectral evolution of the electrostatic waves is crucial for calculating the relaxation time of
the pair beam.
