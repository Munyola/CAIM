Accurate specification of a likelihood function is becoming increasingly difficult in many inference
problems in astronomy. As sample sizes resulting from astronomical surveys continue to grow, deficiencies
in the likelihood function lead to larger biases in key parameter estimates. These deficiencies
result from the oversimplification of the physical processes that generated the data, and from
the failure to account for observational limitations. Unfortunately, realistic models often
do not yield an analytical form for the likelihood. The estimation of a stellar initial mass function
(IMF) is an important example. The stellar IMF is the mass distribution of stars initially formed
in a given cluster of stars, a population which is not directly observable due to stellar evolution
and other disruptions and observational limitations of the cluster. There are several difficulties
with specifying a likelihood in this setting since the physical processes and observational challenges
result in measurable masses that cannot legitimately be considered independent draws from an IMF.
This work improves inference of the IMF by using an approximate Bayesian computation approach that
both accounts for observational and astrophysical effects and incorporates a physically-motivated
model for star cluster formation. The methodology is illustrated via a simulation study, demonstrating
that the proposed approach can recover the true posterior in realistic situations, and applied
to observations from astrophysical simulation data.
