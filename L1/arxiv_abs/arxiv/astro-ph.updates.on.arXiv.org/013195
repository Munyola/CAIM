Unified cosmological models have received a lot of attention in the last several years in order to
explain both the dark matter and dark energy evolution. The renowned name in this category is the
Chaplygin cosmologies which have been investigated in detailed and matched with observations
from different astronomical data. Nevertheless, the Chaplygin cosmologies are also restricted
in order to be consistent with the observational data. As a consequence, alternative unified models,
differing from Chaplygin model, are of special interest. In the present work we consider a specific
example of such a unified cosmological model, that is quantified by only a single parameter $\mu$,
hence a minimal extension of the $\Lambda$-cold dark matter cosmology. We investigate its observational
boundaries together with an analysis for the large scale of the universe. Our analysis shows that
at early time the model behaves like a dust, and as time evolves, the model behaves like a dark energy
fluid depicting a clear transition from the early decelerating phase to the late cosmic accelerating
phase. Finally, the model approaches the cosmological constant boundary in an asymptotic manner.
We have performed a robust analysis with the model keeping the focus on its behavior on the large scale
of the universe and explored the observational acceptability of the model in the context of unified
picture of the universe. Finally, we remark that for the present unified model, the estimations
of $H_0$ almost match with its local estimation and thus this leads to a possible solution of $H_0$
tension.
