We present a full 360 degree (i.e., 4$\pi$ steradian) general-relativistic ray-tracing and radiative
transfer calculations of accreting supermassive black holes. We perform state-of-the-art three-dimensional
general relativistic magnetohydrodynamical simulations using the BHAC code, subsequently post-processing
this data with the radiative transfer code RAPTOR. All relativistic and general-relativistic
effects, such as Doppler boosting and gravitational redshift, as well as geometrical effects due
to the local gravitational field and the observer's changing position and state of motion, are therefore
calculated self-consistently. Synthetic images at four astronomically-relevant observing
frequencies are generated from the perspective of an observer with a full 360-degree view inside
the accretion flow, who is advected with the flow as it evolves. As an example, we calculated images
based on recent best-fit models of observations of Sagittarius A*. These images are combined to
generate a complete 360-degree Virtual Reality movie of the surrounding environment of the black
hole and its event horizon. Our approach also enables the calculation of the local luminosity received
at a given fluid element in the accretion flow, providing important applications in, e.g., radiation
feedback calculations onto black hole accretion flows. In addition to scientific applications,
the 360-degree Virtual Reality movies we present also represent a new medium through which to communicate
black hole physics to a wider audience, serving as a powerful educational tool.
