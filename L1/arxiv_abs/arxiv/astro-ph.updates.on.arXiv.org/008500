Small bipolar magnetic features are observed to appear in the interior of individual granules in
the quiet Sun, signaling the emergence of tiny magnetic loops from the solar interior. We study the
origin of those features as part of the magnetoconvection process in the top layers of the convection
zone. Two quiet-Sun magnetoconvection models, calculated with the radiation-magnetohydrodynamic
(MHD) Bifrost code and with domain stretching from the top layers of the convection zone to the corona,
are analyzed. Using 3D visualization as well as a posteriori spectral synthesis of Stokes parameters,
we detect the repeated emergence of small magnetic elements in the interior of granules, as in the
observations. Additionally, we identify the formation of organized horizontal magnetic sheets
covering whole granules. Our approach is twofold, calculating statistical properties of the system,
like joint probability density functions (JPDFs), and pursuing individual events via visualization
tools. We conclude that the small magnetic loops surfacing within individual granules in the observations
may originate from sites at or near the downflows in the granular and mesogranular levels, probably
in the first 1 or 1.5 Mm below the surface. We also document the creation of granule-covering magnetic
sheet-like structures through the sideways expansion of a small subphotospheric magnetic concentration
picked up, and pulled out of the interior, by a nascent granule. The sheet-like structures we found
in the models may match the recent observations of Centeno et al. (2017).
