We study the correlation between the specific star formation rate of central galaxies and neighbour
galaxies, also known as 'galactic conformity', out to 20 Mpc/h using three semi-analytic models
(SAMs, one from L-GALAXIES and other two from GALFORM). The aim is to establish whether SAMs are able
to show galactic conformity using different models and selection criteria. In all the models, when
the selection of primary galaxies is based on an isolation criterion in real space, the mean fraction
of quenched galaxies around quenched primary galaxies is higher than that around star-forming
primary galaxies of the same stellar mass. The overall signal of conformity decreases when we remove
satellites selected as primary galaxies, but the effect is much stronger in GALFORM models compared
with the L-GALAXIES model. We find this difference is partially explained by the fact that in GALFORM
once a galaxy becomes a satellite remains as such, whereas satellites can become centrals at a later
time in L-GALAXIES. The signal of conformity decreases down to 60% in the L-GALAXIES model after
removing central galaxies that were ejected from their host halo in the past. Galactic conformity
is also influenced by primary galaxies at fixed stellar mass that reside in dark matter haloes of
different masses. Finally, we explore a proxy of conformity between distinct haloes. In this case
the conformity is weak beyond ~ 3 Mpc/h (<3% in L-GALAXIES, <1-2% in GALFORM models). Therefore,
it seems difficult that conformity is directly related with a long-range effect.
