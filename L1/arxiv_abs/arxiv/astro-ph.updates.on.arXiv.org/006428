We present a multi-wavelength study to probe the star formation (SF) process in the molecular cloud
linked with the G35.673-00.847 site (hereafter MCG35.6), which is traced in a velocity range of
53-62 km/s. Multi-wavelength images reveal a semi-ring-like feature (associated with ionized
gas emission) and an embedded face-on ring-like feature (without the NVSS 1.4 GHz radio emission;
where 1-sigma ~ 0.45 mJy/beam) in the MCG35.6. The semi-ring-like feature is originated by the ionizing
feedback from a star with spectral type B0.5V-B0V. The central region of the ring-like feature does
not contain detectable ionized gas emission, indicating that the ring-like feature is unlikely
to be produced by the ionizing feedback from a massive star. Several embedded Herschel clumps and
young stellar objects (YSOs) are identified in the MCG35.6, tracing the ongoing SF activities within
the cloud. The polarization information from the Planck and GPIPS data trace the plane-of-sky magnetic
field, which is oriented parallel to the major axis of the ring-like feature. At least five clumps
(having M_clump ~ 740 - 1420 M_sun) seem to be distributed in an almost regularly spaced manner along
the ring-like feature and contain noticeable YSOs. Based on the analysis of the polarization and
molecular line data, three subregions containing the clumps are found to be magnetically supercritical
in the ring-like feature. Altogether, the existence of the ring-like feature and the SF activities
on its edges can be explained by the magnetic field mediated process as simulated by Li & Nakamura
(2002).
