POLICAN is a near-infrared imaging linear polarimeter developed for the Cananea Near-infrared
Camera (CANICA) at the 2.1m telescope of the Guillermo Haro Astrophysical Observatory (OAGH) located
in Cananea, Sonora, Mexico. POLICAN is mounted ahead of CANICA and consist of a rotating super-achromatic
1-2.7 micron half-wave plate (HWP) as the modulator and a fixed wire-grid polarizer as the analyzer.
CANICA has a 1024 x 1024 HgCdTe detector with a plate scale of 0.32 arcsec/pixel and provides a field
of view of 5.5 x 5.5 arcmin^2. The polarimetric observations are carried out by modulating the incoming
light through different steps of half-wave plate angles 0, 22.5, 45, 67.5 deg, to establish linear
Stokes parameters (I, Q, and U). Image reduction consists of dark subtraction, polarimetric flat
fielding, and sky subtraction. The astrometry and photometric calibrations are performed using
the publicly available data from the Two Micron All Sky Survey. Polarimetric calibration includes
observations of globular clusters and polarization standards available in the literature. Analysis
of multiple observations of globular clusters yielded an instrumental polarization of 0.51%.
Uncertainties in polarization range from 0.1% to 10% from the brightest 7 mag to faintest 16 mag stars.
The polarimetric accuracy achieved is better than 0.5% and the position angle errors less than 5
deg for stars brighter than 13 mag in H-band. POLICAN is mainly being used to study the scattered polarization
and magnetic fields in and around star-forming regions of the interstellar medium.
