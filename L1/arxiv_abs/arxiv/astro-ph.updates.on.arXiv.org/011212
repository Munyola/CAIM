Combination of the power spectrum and bispectrum is a powerful way of breaking degeneracies between
galaxy bias and cosmological parameters, enabling us to maximize the constraining power from galaxy
surveys. Recent cosmological constraints treat the power spectrum and bispectrum on an uneven
footing: they include one-loop bias corrections for the power spectrum but not the bispectrum.
To bridge this gap, we develop the galaxy bias description up to fourth order in perturbation theory,
conveniently expressed through a basis of Galilean invariants that clearly split contributions
that are local and nonlocal in the second derivatives of the linear gravitational potential. In
addition, we consider relevant contributions from short-range nonlocality (higher-derivative
terms), stress-tensor corrections and stochasticity. To sidestep the usual renormalization
of bias parameters that complicates predictions beyond leading order, we recast the bias expansion
in terms of multipoint propagators, which take a simple form in our split-basis with loop corrections
depending only on bias parameters corresponding to nonlocal operators. We show how to take advantage
of Galilean invariance to compute the time evolution of bias and present results for the fourth-order
parameters for the first time. We also discuss the possibilities of reducing the bias parameter
space by using the evolution of bias and exploiting degeneracies between various bias contributions
in the large-scale limit. Our baseline model allows to verify these simplifications for any application
to large-scale structure data sets.
