Testing the distance-sum-rule in strong lensing systems provides an interesting method to determine
the curvature parameter $\Omega_k$ using more local objects. In this paper, we apply this method
to a quite recent data set of strong lensing systems in combination with intermediate-luminosity
quasars calibrated as standard rulers. In the framework of three types of lens models extensively
used in strong lensing studies (SIS model, power-law spherical model, and extended power-law lens
model), we show that the assumed lens model has a considerable impact on the cosmic curvature constraint,
which is found to be compatible or marginally compatible with the flat case (depending on the lens
model adopted). Analysis of low, intermediate and high-mass sub-samples defined according to
the lens velocity dispersion demonstrates that, although it is not reasonable to characterize
all lenses with a uniform model, such division has little impact on cosmic curvature inferred. Finally,
thinking about future when massive surveys will provide their yields, we simulated a mock catalog
of strong lensing systems expected to be seen by the LSST, together with a realistic catalog of quasars.
We found that with about 16000 such systems, combined with the distance information provided by
500 compact milliarcsecond radio sources seen in future radio astronomical surveys, one would
be able to constrain the cosmic curvature with an accuracy of $\Delta \Omega_k\simeq 10^{-3}$,
which is comparable to the precision of \textit{Planck} 2015 results.
