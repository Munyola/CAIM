We investigate how the stellar and gas-phase He abundances evolve as functions of time within simulated
star-forming disc galaxies with different star formation histories. We make use of a cosmological
chemodynamical simulation for galaxy formation and evolution, which includes star formation,
as well as energy and chemical enrichment feedback from asymptotic giant branch stars, core-collapse
supernovae, and Type Ia supernovae. The predicted relations between the He mass fraction, $Y$,
and the metallicity, $Z$, in the interstellar medium of our simulated disc galaxies depend on the
past galaxy star formation history. In particular, $dY/dZ$ is not constant and evolves as a function
of time, depending on the specific chemical element that we choose to trace $Z$; in particular, $dY/dX_{\text{O}}$
and $dY/dX_{\text{C}}$ increase as functions of time, whereas $dY/dX_{\text{N}}$ decreases.
In the gas-phase, we find negative radial gradients of $Y$, due to the inside-out growth of our simulated
galaxy discs as a function of time; this gives rise to longer chemical enrichment time scales in the
outer galaxy regions, where we find lower average values for $Y$ and $Z$. Finally, by means of chemical
evolution models, in the galactic bulge and inner disc, we predict steeper $Y$ versus age relations
at high $Z$ than in the outer galaxy regions. We conclude that, for calibrating the assumed $Y$-$Z$
relation in stellar models, C, N, and C+N are better proxies for the metallicity than O, because they
show steeper and less scattered relations.
