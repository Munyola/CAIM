Supernovae (SNe) are the most fascinating objects in astronomy and are intensely investigated.
However, many mysteries such as nucleosynthesis and the origin of SNe Ia remain unsolved. Although
the thermonuclear explosion of a single-degenerate white dwarf has been considered to be the origin
of SNe Ia, a merger of two white dwarfs (double-degenerate scenario) has been frequently denoted
to be more promising than a single-degenerate white dwarf. Recently the importance of observing
the MeV gamma-ray band to conclusively determine the origin has been remarked. MeV gamma-rays are
unique probes directly emitted from the exploding or merging region. It is evident that statistical
analysis based on imaging spectroscopic observations of ~100 SNe Ia with MeV gamma-rays is necessary
to obtain a definite answer. To achieve this, a telescope with a sensitivity that is 100 times that
of COMPTEL is necessary. Proper imaging spectroscopy for the MeV gamma-ray band has been established
by an electron-tracking Compton camera; hence, a concrete design of a MeV gamma-ray telescope has
been proposed in our previous work. We have studied the details of the spectroscopic feature of SNe
Ia based on the performance of a proposed telescope and found that statistical analysis can considerably
suppress fluctuations of the individual properties of SNe and reveal their intrinsic differences
in averaged light curves of SNe up to 60 Mpc. Our answer for the origin of SNe Ia extends to the case of
single-degenerate scenario and double-degenerate coexistence scenario.
