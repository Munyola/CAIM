We analyzed 200 ks of Chandra ACIS observations of the merging galaxy cluster A2142 to examine its
prominent cold fronts in detail. We find that the southern cold front exhibits well-developed Kelvin-Helmholtz
(KH) eddies seen in the sky plane. Comparing their wavelength and amplitude with those in hydrodynamic
simulations of cold fronts in viscous gas, and estimating the gas tangential velocity from centripetal
acceleration, we constrain the effective viscosity to be at most 1/5 of Spitzer isotropic viscosity,
but consistent with full Braginskii anisotropic viscosity for magnetized plasma. While the northwestern
front does not show obvious eddies, its shape and the structure of its brightness profile suggest
KH eddies seen in projection. The southern cold front continues in a spiral to the center of the cluster,
ending with another cold front only 12 kpc from the gas density peak. The cool peak itself is displaced
~30 kpc from the BCG (the biggest such offset among centrally-peaked clusters), while the X-ray
emission on a larger scale is still centered on the BCG, indicating that the BCG is at the center of
the gravitational potential and the cool gas is sloshing in it. The specific entropy index of the
gas in the peak ($K\approx49$ keV cm$^2$) makes A2142 a rare "warm core"; apparently the large displacement
of the cool peak by sloshing is the reason. Finally, we find a subtle narrow, straight channel with
a 10% drop in X-ray brightness, aligned with the southern cold front --- possibly a plasma depletion
layer in projection.
