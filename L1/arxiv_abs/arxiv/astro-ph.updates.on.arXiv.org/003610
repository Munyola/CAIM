Recently, gas giant planets in nearly circular orbits with large semimajor axes ($a \sim$ 30--1000AU)
have been detected by direct imaging. We have investigated orbital evolution in a formation scenario
for such planets, based on core accretion model: i) Icy cores accrete from planetesimals at $\lesssim$
30AU, ii) they are scattered outward by an emerging nearby gas giant to acquire highly eccentric
orbits, and iii) their orbits are circularized through accretion of disk gas in outer regions, where
they spend most of time. We analytically derived equations to describe the orbital circularization
through the gas accretion. Numerical integrations of these equations show that the eccentricity
decreases by a factor of more than 5 during the planetary mass increases by a factor of 10. Because
runaway gas accretion increases planetary mass by $\sim$ 10--300, the orbits are sufficiently
circularized. On the other hand, $a$ is reduced at most only by a factor of 2, leaving the planets in
outer regions. If the relative velocity damping by shock is considered, the circularization is
slowed down, but still efficient enough. Therefore, this scenario potentially accounts for the
formation of observed distant jupiters in nearly circular orbits. If the apocenter distances of
the scattered cores are larger than the disk sizes, their $a$ shrink to a quarter of the disk sizes;
the $a$-distribution of distant giants could reflect outer edges of the disks in a similar way that
those of hot jupiters may reflect inner edges.
