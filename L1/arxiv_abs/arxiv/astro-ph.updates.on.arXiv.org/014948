Recent developments in asteroseismology -- thanks to space-based missions such as {\it CoRoT}
and {\it Kepler} -- provide handles on those properties of stars that were either completely inaccessible
in the past or only poorly measured. Among several such properties is the surface helium abundance
of F and G stars. We used the oscillatory signature introduced by the ionization of helium in the observed
oscillation frequencies to constrain the amount of helium settling in F stars. For this purpose,
we identified three promising F stars for which the standard models of atomic diffusion predict
large settling (or complete depletion) of surface helium. Assuming turbulence at the base of envelope
convection zone slows down settling of the helium and heavy elements, we found an envelope mixed
mass of approximately $5 \times 10^{-4}$M$_\odot$ necessary to reproduce the observed amplitude
of helium signature for all the three stars. This is much larger than the mixed mass of the order of
$10^{-6}$M$_\odot$ found in the previous studies performed using the measurements of the heavy
element abundances. This demonstrates the potential of using the helium signature together with
measurements of the heavy element abundances to identify the most important physical processes
competing against atomic diffusion, allowing eventually to correctly interpret the observed
surface abundances of hot stars, consistent use of atomic diffusion in modelling both hot and cool
stars, and shed some light on the long-standing cosmological lithium problem.
