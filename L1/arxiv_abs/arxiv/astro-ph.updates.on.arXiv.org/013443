The Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO) project is a new generation multi-component
instrument, to be built at 4410 meters of altitude in the Sichuan province of China, with the aim to
study with unprecedented sensitivity the spec trum, the composition and the anisotropy of cosmic
rays in the energy range between 10$^{12}$ and 10$^{18}$ eV, as well as to act simultaneously as a
wide aperture (one stereoradiant), continuously-operated gamma ray telescope in the energy range
between 10$^{11}$ and $10^{15}$ eV. The experiment will be able of continuously surveying the TeV
sky for steady and transient sources from 100 GeV to 1 PeV, t hus opening for the first time the 100-1000
TeV range to the direct observations of the high energy cosmic ray sources. In addition, the different
observables (electronic, muonic and Cherenkov/fluorescence components) that will be measured
in LHAASO will allow to investigate origin, acceleration and propagation of the radiation through
a measurement of energy spec trum, elemental composition and anisotropy with unprecedented resolution.
The remarkable sensitivity of LHAASO in cosmic rays physics and gamma astronomy would play a key-role
in the comprehensive general program to explore the High Energy Universe. LHAASO will allow important
studies of fundamental physics (such as indirect dark matter search, Lorentz invariance violation,
quantum gravity) and solar and heliospheric physics. In this document we introduce the concept
of LHAASO and the main science goals, providing an overview of the project.
