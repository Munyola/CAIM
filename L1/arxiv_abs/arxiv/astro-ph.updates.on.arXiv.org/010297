The California-Kepler Survey (CKS) catalog contains precise stellar and planetary properties
for the \Kepler\ planet candidates, including systems with multiple detected transiting planets
("multis") and systems with just one detected transiting planet ("singles," although additional
planets could exist). We compared the stellar and planetary properties of the multis and singles
in a homogenous subset of the full CKS-Gaia catalog. We found that sub-Neptune sized singles and
multis do not differ in their stellar properties or planet radii. In particular: (1.) The distributions
of stellar properties $M_\star$, [Fe/H], and $v\mathrm{sin}i$ for the Kepler sub Neptune-sized
singles and multis are statistically indistinguishable. (2.) The radius distributions of the
sub-Neptune sized singles and multis with $P > 3$ days are indistinguishable, and both have a valley
at $\sim1.8~R_\oplus$. However, there are significantly more detected short-period ($P < 3$ days),
sub-Neptune sized singles than multis. The similarity of the host star properties, planet radii,
and radius valley for singles and multis suggests a common origin. The similar radius valley, which
is likely sculpted by photo-evaporation from the host star within the first 100 Myr, suggests that
planets in both singles and multis spend much of the first 100 Myr near their present, close-in locations.
One explanation that is consistent with the similar fundamental properties of singles and multis
is that many of the singles are members of multi-planet systems that underwent planet-planet scattering.
