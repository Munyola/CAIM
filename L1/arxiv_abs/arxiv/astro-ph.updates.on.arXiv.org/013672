The question of what triggered the nongravitational acceleration of 1I/`Oumuamua continues to
attract researchers' attention. The absence of any signs of activity notwithstanding, the prevailing
notion is that the acceleration of the stellar, cigar-like object was prompted by outgassing. However,
the Spitzer Space Telescope's failure to detect `Oumuamua not only ruled out the CO_2 and/or CO driven
activity (Trilling et al. 2018), but made the cigar shape incompatible with the optical observations.
Choice of water ice as the source of outgassing is shown to be flawed as well: (i) the water sublimation
law is demonstrably inconsistent with the observed variations in the nongravitational acceleration
derived by Micheli et al. (2018), the point that should have been assertively highlighted; and (ii)
an upper limit of the production rate of water is estimated at as low as 4 x 10^(23) molecules s^(-1),
requiring that, at most, only a small area of the surface be active. In this case the conservation
of momentum law is satisfied only when `Oumuamua's bulk density is extremely low, <0.001 g cm^(-3),
reminiscent of the formerly proposed scenario with `Oumuamua as a fragment of a dwarf interstellar
comet, possibly an embryo planetesimal, disintegrating near perihelion, with the acceleration
driven by solar radiation pressure (Sekanina 2019a) and no need for activity at all. High quality
of astrometry and Micheli et al.'s orbital analysis, whose results were confirmed by the computations
of other authors, is acknowledged.
