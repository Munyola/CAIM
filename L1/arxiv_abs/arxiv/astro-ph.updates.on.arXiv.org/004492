Exploring weakly perturbed Keplerian motion within the restricted three-body problem, Lidov
(1962) and, independently, Kozai (1962) discovered coupled oscillations of eccentricity and
inclination (the KL-cycles). Their classical studies were based on an integrable model of the secular
evolution, obtained by double averaging of the disturbing function approximated with its first
non-trivial term. This was the quadrupole term in the series expansion with respect to the ratio
of the semimajor axis of the disturbed body to that of the disturbing body. If the next (octupole)
term is kept in the expression for the disturbing function, long-term modulation of the KL-cycles
can established (Ford et al., 2000, Naoz et al., 2011, Katz et al., 2011). Specifically, flips between
the prograde and retrograde orbits become possible. Since such flips are observed only when the
perturber has a non-zero eccentricity, the term "Eccentric Kozai-Lidov Effect" (or EKL-effect)
was proposed by Lithwick and Naoz (2011) to specify such behaviour. We demonstrate that the EKL-effect
can be interpreted as a resonance phenomenon. To this end, we write down the equations of motion in
terms of "action-angle" variables emerging in the integrable Kozai-Lidov model. It turns out that
for some initial values the resonance is degenerate and the usual "pendulum" approximation is insufficient
to describe the evolution of the resonance phase. Analysis of the related bifurcations allows us
to estimate the typical time between the successive flips for different parts of the phase space.
