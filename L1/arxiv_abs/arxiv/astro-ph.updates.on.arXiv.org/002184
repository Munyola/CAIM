Understanding how black holes accrete and supply feedback to their environment is one of the outstanding
challenges of modern astrophysics. Swift J1910.2-0546 is a candidate black hole low-mass X-ray
binary that was discovered in 2012 when it entered an accretion outburst. To investigate the binary
configuration and the accretion morphology we monitored the evolution of the outburst for ~3 months
at X-ray, UV, optical (B,V,R,I), and near-infrared (J,H,K) wavelengths using Swift and SMARTS.
The source evolved from a hard to a soft X-ray spectral state with a relatively cold accretion disk
that peaked at ~0.5 keV. A Chandra/HETG spectrum obtained during this soft state did not reveal signatures
of an ionized disk wind. Both the low disk temperature and the absence of a detectable wind could indicate
that the system is viewed at relatively low inclination. The multi-wavelength light curves revealed
two notable features that appear to be related to X-ray state changes. Firstly, a prominent flux
decrease was observed in all wavebands ~1-2 weeks before the source entered the soft state. This
dip occurred in (0.6-10 keV) X-rays ~6 days later than at longer wavelengths, which could possibly
reflect the viscous time scale of the disk. Secondly, about two weeks after the source transitioned
back into the hard state, the UV emission significantly increased while the X-rays steadily decayed.
We discuss how these observations may reflect changes in the accretion flow morphology, perhaps
related to the quenching/launch of a jet or the collapse/recovery of a hot flow.
