Recent observations have shown that coronal shocks driven by coronal mass ejections can develop
and accelerate particles within several solar radii in large solar energetic particle (SEP) events.
Motivated by this, we present an SEP acceleration study including the process that a fast shock propagates
through a streamer-like magnetic field with both closed and open field lines in the low corona region.
The acceleration of protons is modeled by numerically solving the Parker transport equation with
spatial diffusion both along and across the magnetic field. We show that particles can be sufficiently
accelerated to up to several hundred MeV within 2-3 solar radii. When the shock propagates through
a streamer-like magnetic field, particles are more efficiently accelerated compared to the case
with a simple radial magnetic field, mainly due to perpendicular shock geometry and the natural
trapping effect of closed magnetic fields. Our results suggest that the coronal magnetic field
configuration is an important factor for producing large SEP events. We further show that the coronal
magnetic field configuration strongly influences the distribution of energetic particles, leading
to different locations of source regions along the shock front where most of high energy particles
are concentrated. This work may have strong implications to SEP observations. The upcoming Parker
Solar Probe will provide in situ observations for the distribution of energetic particles in the
coronal shock region, and test the results of the study.
