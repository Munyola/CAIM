As a planet ages it cools and its radius shrinks, at a rate set by the efficiency with which heat is transported
from the interior out to space. The bottleneck for this transport is at the boundary between the convective
interior and the radiative atmosphere; the opacity there sets the global cooling rate. Models of
planetary evolution are often one-dimensional, such that the radiative-convective boundary
(RCB) is defined by a single temperature, pressure, and opacity. In reality the spatially inhomogenous
stellar heating pattern and circulation in the atmosphere could deform the RCB, allowing heat from
the interior to escape more efficiently through regions with lower opacity. We present an analysis
of the degree to which the RCB could be deformed and the resultant change in the evolutionary cooling
rate. In this initial work we calculate the upper limit for this effect by comparing an atmospheric
structure in local radiative equilibrium to its 1D equivalent. We find that the cooling through
an uneven RCB could be enhanced over cooling through a uniform RCB by as much as 10-50%. We also show
that the deformation of the RCB (and the enhancement of the cooling rate) increases with a greater
incident stellar flux or a lower inner entropy. Our results indicate that this mechanism could significantly
change a planet's thermal evolution, causing it to cool and shrink more quickly than would otherwise
be expected. This may exacerbate the well known difficulty in explaining the very large radii observed
for some hot Jupiters.
