The main purpose of this work is to distinguish various holographic type dark energy (DE) models,
including the $\Lambda$HDE, HDE, NADE and RDE model, by using various diagnostic tools. The first
diagnostic tool is the Statefinder hierarchy, in which the evolution of Statefinder hierarchy
parmeter $S^{(1)}_3(z)$ and $S^{(1)}_4(z)$ are studied. The second is composite null diagnostic
(CND), in which the trajectories of $\{S^{(1)}_3, \epsilon\}$ and $\{S^{(1)}_4, \epsilon\}$
are investigated, where $\epsilon$ is the fractional growth parameter. The last is $w-w'$ analysis,
where $w$ is the equation of state for DE and the prime denotes derivative with respect to $ln a$. In
the analysis we consider two cases: varying current fractional DE density $\Omega_{de0}$ and varying
DE model parameter $C$. We find that: (1) Both the Statefinder hierarchy and the CND have qualitative
impact on $\Lambda$HDE, but only have quantitative impact on HDE. (2) $S_4^{(1)}$ can lead to larger
differences than $S_3^{(1)}$, while the CND pair has a stronger ability to distinguish different
models than the Statefinder hierarchy. (3) For the case of varying $C$, the $\{w, w'\}$ pair has qualitative
impact on $\Lambda$HDE; for the case of varying $\Omega_{de0}$, the $\{w, w'\}$ pair only has quantitative
impact; these results are different from the cases of HDE, RDE and NADE, in which the $\{w, w'\}$ pair
only has quantitative impact on these models. In conclusion, compared with HDE, RDE and NADE, the
$\Lambda$HDE model can be easily distinguished by using these diagnostic tools.
