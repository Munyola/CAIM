We present numerical simulations of active region scale flux emergence covering a time span of up
to 6 days. Flux emergence is driven by a bottom boundary condition that advects a semi-torus of magnetic
field with $1.7 \times 10^{22}$ Mx flux into the computational domain. The simulations show that,
even in the absense of twist, the magnetic flux is able the rise through the upper $15.5$ Mm of the convection
zone and emerge into the photosphere to form spots. We find that spot formation is sensitive to the
persistence of upflows at the bottom boundary footpoints, i.e. a continuing upflow would prevent
spot formation. In addition, the presence of a torus-aligned flow (such flow into the retrograde
direction is expected from angular momentum conservation during the rise of flux ropes through
the convection zone) leads to a significant asymmetry between the pair of spots, with the spot corresponding
to the leading spot on the Sun being more axisymmetric and coherent, but also forming with a delay
relative to the following spot. The spot formation phase transitions directly into a decay phase.
Subsurface flows fragment the magnetic field and lead to intrusions of almost field free plasma
underneath the photosphere. When such intrusions reach photospheric layers, the spot fragments.
The time scale for spot decay is comparable to the longest convective time scales present in the simulation
domain. We find that the dispersal of flux from a simulated spot in the first two days of the decay phase
is consistent with self-similar decay by turbulent diffusion.
