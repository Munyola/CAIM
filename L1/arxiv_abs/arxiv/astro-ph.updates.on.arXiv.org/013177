In holographic inflation, the $4D$ cosmological dynamics is postulated to be dual to the renormalization
group flow of a $3D$ Euclidean conformal field theory with marginally relevant operators. The scalar
potential of the $4D$ theory ---in which inflation is realized--- is highly constrained, with use
of the Hamilton--Jacobi equations. In multi-field holographic realizations of inflation, fields
additional to the inflaton cannot display underdamped oscillations (that is, their wavefunctions
contain no oscillatory phases independent of the momenta). We show that this result is exact, independent
of the number of fields, the field space geometry and the shape of the inflationary trajectory followed
in multi-field space. In the specific case where the multi-field trajectory is a straight line or
confined to a plane, it can be understood as the existence of an upper bound on the dynamical masses
$m$ of extra fields of the form $m \leq 3 H / 2$ up to slow roll corrections. This bound corresponds to
the analytic continuation of the well known Breitenlohner--Freedman bound found in AdS spacetimes
in the case when the masses are approximately constant. The absence of underdamped oscillations
implies that a detection of "cosmological collider" oscillatory patterns in the non-Gaussian
bispectrum would not only rule out single field inflation, but also holographic inflation or any
inflationary model based on the Hamilton--Jacobi equations. Hence, future observations have
the potential to exclude, at once, an entire class of inflationary theories, regardless of the details
involved in their model building.
