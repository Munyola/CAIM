We obtained new HST WFC3-NIR imaging in the fields of six strongly-lensed Dusty Star Forming Galaxies
(DSFGs) at z=2-4 identified by color and compactness through a new method of discovering massive
lensing clusters using Planck/Herschel. We identify the near infrared counterparts of the sub-millimeter
sources and undertake a strong lensing analysis for all six fields. One field in particular, PLCK
G165.7+67.0 (G165) at z=0.351, stands out for its exceptional lensing properties. On combining
the color and morphological information, we find eleven cases of a galaxy in the background that
appears in multiple locations in the image plane. The red and spatially-extended lensed DSFG in
G165 bisects the critical curve, incurring a high magnification factor of >/=30 and producing a
counter-image that is detected in our new longer wavelength ground- and space-based imaging data.
On undertaking a spectroscopic redshift census from ground-based observatories, we calculate
a dynamical mass from 17 cluster members of 8.8 +/- 2.3 \times 10^14 Msun that is a factor of ~3 higher
than the lensing mass within ~250 kpc. A velocity gradient is seen across the bimodal mass structure.
If real, the dynamical mass may be inflated owing to a non-spherical arrangement of mass. Taken altogether,
we suggest that this cluster with its high dark matter concentration, relatively weak X-ray flux
and low SZ decrement may potentially be explained as a pre-merger for which the intra-cluster gas
is diluted while the surface mass densities integrated along the line-of-sight remains supercritical
to strong lensing effects.
