We present robust constraints from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) on the shape and distribution
of the dark matter halo within the Milky Way (MW). Using the number density distribution and kinematics
of SDSS halo stars, we probe the dark matter distribution to heliocentric distances exceeding 10
kpc and galactocentric distances exceeding 20 kpc. Our analysis utilizes Jeans equations to generate
two-dimensional acceleration maps throughout the volume; this approach is thoroughly tested
on a cosmologically derived N-body+SPH simulation of a MW-like galaxy. We show that the known accelerations
(gradients of the gravitational potential) can be successfully recovered in such a realistic system.
Leveraging the baryonic gravitational potential derived by Bovy & Rix (2013), we show that
the gravitational potential implied by the SDSS observations cannot be explained, assuming Newtonian
gravity, by visible matter alone: the gravitational force experienced by stars at galactocentric
distances of 20 kpc is as much as three times stronger than what can be attributed to purely visible
matter. We also show that the SDSS data provide a strong constraint on the shape of the dark matter
halo potential. Within galactocentric distances of 20 kpc, the dark matter halo potential is well
described as an oblate halo with axis ratio qDM=0.7+/-0.1; this corresponds to an axis ratio qDM=0.4+/-0.1
for the dark matter density distribution. Because of our precise two-dimensional measurements
of the acceleration of the halo stars, we can reject several MOND models as an explanation of the observed
behavior.
