Recent asteroseismic advances have allowed for direct measurements of the internal rotation rates
of many sub-giant and red giant stars. Unlike the nearly rigidly rotating Sun, these evolved stars
contain radiative cores that spin faster than their overlying convective envelopes, but slower
than they would in the absence of internal angular momentum transport. We investigate the role of
internal gravity waves in angular momentum transport in evolving low mass stars. In agreement with
previous results, we find that convectively excited gravity waves can prevent the development
of strong differential rotation in the radiative cores of Sun-like stars. As stars evolve into sub-giants,
however, low frequency gravity waves become strongly attenuated and cannot propagate below the
hydrogen burning shell, allowing the spin of the core to decouple from the convective envelope.
This decoupling occurs at the base of the sub-giant branch when stars have surface temperatures
of roughly 5500 K. However, gravity waves can still spin down the upper radiative region, implying
that the observed differential rotation is likely confined to the deep core near the hydrogen burning
shell. The torque on the upper radiative region may also prevent the core from accreting high-angular
momentum material and slow the rate of core spin-up. The observed spin-down of cores on the red giant
branch cannot be totally attributed to gravity waves, but the waves may enhance shear within the
radiative region and thus increase the efficacy of viscous/magnetic torques.
