Constraints on cosmological parameters from large-scale structure have traditionally been obtained
from two-point statistics. However, non-linear structure formation renders these statistics
insufficient in capturing the full information content available, necessitating the measurement
of higher-order moments to recover information which would otherwise be lost. We construct quantities
based on non-linear and non-local transformations of weakly non-Gaussian fields that Gaussianize
the full multivariate distribution at a given order in perturbation theory. Our approach does not
require a model of the fields themselves and takes as input only the first few polyspectra, which
could be modelled or measured from simulations or data, making our method particularly suited to
observables lacking a robust perturbative description such as the weak-lensing shear. We apply
our method to simulated density fields, finding a significantly reduced bispectrum and an enhanced
correlation with the initial field. We demonstrate that our method reconstructs a large proportion
of the linear baryon acoustic oscillations, improving the information content over the raw field
by 35%. We apply the transform to toy 21cm intensity maps, showing that our method still performs
well in the presence of complications such as redshift-space distortions, beam smoothing, pixel
noise, and foreground subtraction. We discuss how this method might provide a route to constructing
a perturbative model of the fully non-Gaussian multivariate likelihood function.
