Broad emission lines in quasars enable us to "resolve" structure and kinematics of the broad line
emitting region (BLR) thought to in- volve an accretion disk feeding a supermassive black hole.
Interpretation of broad line measures within the 4DE1 formalism simplifies the apparent confusion
among such data by contrasting and unifying properties of so-called high and low accreting Population
A and B sources. H{\beta} serves as an estimator of black hole mass, Eddington ratio and source rest
frame, the latter a valuable input for Civ{\lambda}1549 studies which allow us to isolate the blueshifted
wind component. Optical and HST-UV spectra yield H{\beta} and Civ{\lambda}1549 spectra for low-luminosity
sources while VLT-ISAAC and FORS and TNG-LRS provide spectra for high Luminosity sources. New high
S/N data for Civ in high-luminosity quasars are presented here for comparison with the other previously
published data. Comparison of H{\beta} and Civ{\lambda}1549 profile widths/shifts indicates
that much of the emission from the two lines arise in regions with different structure and kinematics.
Covering a wide range of luminosity and redshift shows evidence for a correlation between Civ{\lambda}1549
blueshift and source Eddington ratio, with a weaker trend with source luminosity (similar amplitude
outflows are seen over 4 of the 5 dex luminosity range in our combined samples). At low luminosity
(z < 0.7) only Population A sources show evidence for a significant outflow while at high luminosity
the outflow signature begins to appear in Population B quasars as well.
