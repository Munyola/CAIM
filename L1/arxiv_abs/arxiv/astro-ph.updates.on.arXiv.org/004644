We present an optical and near-infrared (hereafter NIR) polarimetric study of a comet C/2013 US10
(Catalina) observed on UT 2015 December 17-18 at phase angles of $\alpha$=52.1 deg - 53.1 deg. Additionally,
we obtained an optical spectrum and multi-band images to examine the influence of gas emission.
We find that the observed optical signals are significantly influenced by gas emission, that is,
the gas-to-total intensity ratio varies from 5 to 30 % in the $R_{\rm C}$ and 3 to 18 % in the $I_{\rm
C}$ bands, depending on the position in the coma. We derive the `gas-free dust polarization degrees'
of 13.8$\pm$1.0 % in the $R_{\rm C}$ and 12.5$\pm$1.1 % in the $I_{\rm C}$ bands and a gray polarimetric
color, i.e., -8.7$\pm$9.9 % $\mu \mathrm{m}$$^{-1}$ in optical and 1.6$\pm$0.9 % $\mu \mathrm{m}$$^{-1}$
in NIR. The increments of polarization obtained from the gas correction show that the polarimetric
properties of the dust in this low-polarization comet are not different from those in high-polarization
comets. In this process, the cometocentric distance dependence of polarization has disappeared.
We also find that the $R_{\rm C}$-band polarization degree of the southeast dust tail, which consists
of large dust particles (100 $\mu \mathrm{m}$ - 1 mm), is similar to that in the outer coma where small
and large ones are mixed. Our study confirms that the dichotomy of cometary polarization does not
result from the difference of dust properties, but from depolarizing gas contamination. This conclusion
can provide a strong support for similarity in origin of comets.
