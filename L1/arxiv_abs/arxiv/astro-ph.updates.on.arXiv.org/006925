CO observations allow estimations of the gas content of molecular clouds, which trace the reservoir
of cold gas fuelling star formation, as well as to determine extinction via H$_2$ column density,
N(H$_2$). Here, we studied millimetric and optical properties at 26 supernovae (SNe) locations
of different types in a sample of 23 nearby galaxies by combining molecular $^{12}$C$^{16}$O (J
= 1 $\rightarrow$ 0) resolved maps from the EDGE survey and optical Integral Field Spectroscopy
from the CALIFA survey. We found an even clearer separation between type II and type Ibc SNe in terms
of molecular gas than what we found in the optical using H$\alpha$ emission as a proxy for current
SF rate, which reinforces the fact that SNe Ibc are more associated with SF-environments. While
A$_V$ at SN locations is similar for SNe II and SNe Ibc, and higher compared to SNe Ia, N(H$_2$) is significantly
higher for SNe Ibc than for SNe II and SNe Ia. When compared to alternative extinction estimations
directly from SN photometry and spectroscopy, we find that our SNe Ibc have also redder color excess
but showed standard Na I D absorption pseudo-equivalent widths ($\sim$1 \AA). In some cases we find
no extinction when estimated from the environment, but high amounts of extinction when measured
from SN observations, which suggests that circumstellar material or dust sublimation may be playing
a role. This work serves as a benchmark for future studies combining last generation millimeter
and optical IFS instruments to reveal the local environmental properties of extragalactic SNe.
