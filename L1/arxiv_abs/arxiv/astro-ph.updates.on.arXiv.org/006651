Ice in main belt asteroids and Near Earth Objects (NEOs) is of scientific and resource exploration
interest, but small airless bodies gradually lose their ice to space by outward diffusion. Here,
we quantitatively estimate the time it takes a porous airless body to lose all of its interior ice,
based on an analytic solution for the interior temperature field of bodies in stable orbits. Without
latent heat, the average surface temperature, which is lower than the classic effective temperature,
is representative of the body interior and hence an appropriate temperature to evaluate desiccation
time scales. In a spherically averaged model, an explicit analytic solution is obtained for the
depth to ice as a function of time and the time to complete desiccation. Half of the ice volume is lost
after 11% of this time. A bilobate structure emerges from the strong latitude dependence of desiccation
rates. Cold polar regions can harbor subsurface ice, even when the body center does not. At temperatures
above roughly 190~K, latent heat significantly retards the ice loss, and we obtain a succinct expression
for the temperature difference between the surface and the ice. In the outer main belt, nearly all
bodies 10~km in size or larger should have been able to retain ice in their interiors over the age of
the solar system. Each of the following factors favors the presence of ice inside NEOs: a semi-major
axis in the outer belt or beyond, a mantle of very low thermal inertia, a young age, or a small and stable
axis tilt.
