Fallback disks are expected to form around young neutron stars. The presence of these disks can be
revealed by their blackbody spectrum in the infrared, optical and UV bands. We present a re-reduction
of the archival optical and infrared data of the Vela pulsar, together with the existing infrared
and UV spectrum of Vela, and model their unpulsed components with the blackbody spectrum of a supernova
debris disk. We invoke the quiescent disk solution of Sunyaev and Shakura for the description of
the disk in the propeller stage and find the inner radius of the disk to be inside the light cylinder
radius. We perform a high resolution X-ray analysis with XMM-Newton and find a narrow absorption
feature at 0.57 keV which can be interpreted as K$_{\alpha}$ line of He-like oxygen (OVII). The strength
of the line indicates an element over-abundance in our line of sight exceeding the amounts that would
be expected from ISM. The spectral feature may originate from the pulsar wind nebula and may be partly
caused by the reprocessed X-ray radiation by the fallback disk. We discuss the lower-than-3 braking
index of Vela as partially due to the contribution of the propeller torques. Our results suggest
that the pulsar mechanism can work simultaneously with the propeller processes and that the debris
disks can survive the radiation pressure for at least $\sim 10^4$ years. As Vela is a relatively close
object, and a prototypical pulsar, the presence of a disk, if confirmed, may indicate the ubiquity
of debris disks around young neutron stars.
