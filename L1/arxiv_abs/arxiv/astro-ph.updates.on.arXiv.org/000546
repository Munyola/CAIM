Broad absorption line quasars (BALQs) present a large diversity in their broad absorption line
(BAL) profiles. To investigate what physical parameters underlie this diversity, we construct
a sample of BALQs which covers lambda_rest ~ 800-3000 {\AA}, based on the Sloan Digital Sky Survey
DR7 quasar catalogue. The average BAL properties are evaluated by taking the ratios of average BALQ
spectra to the average spectra of matched samples of non-BALQs, where the matching is based on various
emission properties. We find the following properties. (i) There is no detectable Lyman edge associated
with the BAL absorbing gas (tau<0.1). (ii) The known increase of average absorption depth with
the ionization potential extends to the higher ionization N V and O VI BALs. We also find that the C
IV BAL profile is controlled by two parameters. (i) The He II emission EW, which controls the typical
velocity of the C IV BAL, but does not affect the absorption depth. (ii) The spectral slope in the 1700-3000
{\AA} range (alpha_UVl), which controls the C IV peak absorption depth, but does not affect the typical
velocity. The He II EW and alpha_UVl also control the observed fraction of quasars that are BALQs.
We suggest that a lower He II EW may indicate a weaker ionizing continuum, which allows the outflow
to reach higher velocities before being overionized, possibly without a need to invoke a shielding
gas. A redder continuum may indicate a more inclined system, and a larger covering factor and larger
column of the outflow along the line of sight.
