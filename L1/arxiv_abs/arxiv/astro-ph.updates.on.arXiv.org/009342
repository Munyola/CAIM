We present CO J=4-3 line and 3 mm dust continuum observations of a 100 kpc-scale filamentary Ly{\alpha}
nebula (SSA22 LAB18) at z=3.1 using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA).
We detected the CO J=4-3 line at a systemic z(CO)=3.093 {\pm} 0.001 at 11 {\sigma} from one of the ALMA
continuum sources associated with the Ly{\alpha} filament. We estimated the CO J=4-3 luminosity
of L'CO(4-3)=(2.3\pm0.2)x10^9 K km s^{-1} pc^2 for this CO source, which is one order of magnitude
smaller than those of typical z>1 dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) of similar far-infrared
luminosity L(IR)~10^{12} Lsun. We derived a molecular gas mass of Mgas=(4.4^{+0.9}_{-0.6})x10^9
Msun and a star-formation rate of SFR=270\pm160 Msun yr^{-1}. We also estimated a gas depletion
time of {\tau}(dep)=17\pm10 Myr, being shorter than those of typical DSFGs. It is suggested that
this source is in a transition phase from DSFG to a gas-poor, early-type galaxy. From ALMA to Herschel
multi-band dust continuum observations, we measured a dust emissivity index {\beta}=2.3\pm0.2,
which is similar to those of local gas-poor, early-type galaxies. Such a high {\beta} can be reproduced
by specific chemical compositions for interstellar dust at the submillimeter wavelengths from
recent laboratory experiments. ALMA CO and multi-band dust continuum observations can constrain
the evolutionary stage of high-redshift galaxies through {\tau}(dep) and {\beta}, and thus we
can investigate dust chemical compositions even in the early Universe.
