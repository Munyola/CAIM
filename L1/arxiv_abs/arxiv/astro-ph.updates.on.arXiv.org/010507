We measure the circular velocity curve $v_{\rm c}(R)$ of the Milky Way with the highest precision
to date across Galactocentric distances of $5\leq R \leq 25$ kpc. Our analysis draws on the $6$-dimensional
phase-space coordinates of $\gtrsim 23,000$ luminous red-giant stars, for which we previously
determined precise parallaxes using a data-driven model that combines spectral data from APOGEE
with photometric information from WISE, 2MASS, and Gaia. We derive the circular velocity curve
with the Jeans equation assuming an axisymmetric gravitational potential. At the location of the
Sun we determine the circular velocity with its formal uncertainty to be $v_{\rm c}(R_{\odot})
= (229.0\pm0.2)\rm\,km\,s^{-1}$ with systematic uncertainties at the $\sim 5\%$ level. We find
that the velocity curve is gently but significantly declining at $(-1.7\pm0.1)\rm\,km\,s^{-1}\,kpc^{-1}$,
with a systematic uncertainty of $0.46\rm\,km\,s^{-1}\,kpc^{-1}$, beyond the inner $5$ kpc.
We exclude the inner $5$ kpc from our analysis due to the presence of the Galactic bar, which strongly
influences the kinematic structure and requires modeling in a non-axisymmetric potential. Combining
our results with external measurements of the mass distribution for the baryonic components of
the Milky Way from other studies, we estimate the Galaxy's dark halo mass within the virial radius
to be $M_{\rm vir} = (7.25\pm0.26)\cdot 10^{11}M_{\odot}$ and a local dark matter density of $\rho_{\rm
dm}(R_{\odot}) = 0.30\pm0.03\,\rm GeV\,cm^{-3}$.
