We present the results of a new sensitive survey of neutral hydrogen above and below the Galactic
Center with the Green Bank Telescope. The observations extend up to Galactic latitude | b | < 10 deg
with an effective angular resolution of 9.5' and an average rms brightness temperature noise of
40 mK in a 1 km/s channel. The survey reveals the existence of a population of anomalous high-velocity
clouds extending up to heights of about 1.5 kpc from the Galactic Plane and showing no signature of
Galactic rotation. These clouds have local standard of rest velocities | Vlsr | < 360 km/s and, assuming
a Galactic Center origin, they have sizes of a few tens of parsecs and neutral hydrogen masses spanning
$10-10^5 \, M_\odot$. Accounting for selection effects, the cloud population is symmetric in longitude,
latitude, and Vlsr. We model the cloud kinematics in terms of an outflow expanding from the Galactic
Center and find the population consistent with being material moving with radial velocity Vw ~ 330
km/s distributed throughout a bi-cone with opening angle $\alpha>140$ deg. This simple model implies
an outflow luminosity $Lw > 3 \times 10^{40}$ erg/s over the past 10 Myr, consistent with star formation
feedback in the inner region of the Milky Way, with a cold gas mass-loss rate $\lesssim 0.1 \, M_\odot$/yr.
These clouds may represent the cold gas component accelerated in the nuclear wind driven by our Galaxy,
although some of the derived properties challenge current theoretical models of the entrainment
process.
