We present the first results from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) on the rotational
and pulsational variability of magnetic chemically peculiar A-type stars. We analyse TESS 2-min
cadence data from sectors 1 and 2 on a sample of 83 stars. Five new rapidly oscillating Ap (roAp) stars
are announced. One of these pulsates with periods around 4.7 min, making it the shortest period roAp
star known to date. Four out of the five new roAp stars are multiperiodic. Three of these, and the singly-periodic
one show the presence of rotational mode splitting. Individual frequencies are provided in all
cases. In addition, seven previously known roAp stars are analysed. Additional modes of oscillation
are found in some stars, while in others we are able to distinguish the true pulsations from possible
aliases present in the ground-based data. We find that the pulsation amplitude in the TESS filter
is typically a factor 6 smaller than that in the $B$ filter which is usually used for ground-based
observations. For four roAp stars we set constraints on the inclination angle and magnetic obliquity,
through the application of the oblique pulsator model. We also confirm the absence of roAp-type
pulsations down to amplitude limits of 6 and 13 micromag, respectively, in two of the best characterised
non-oscillating Ap (noAp) stars. We announce 27 new rotational variables along with their rotation
periods, and provide different rotation periods for seven other stars. Finally, we discuss how
these results challenge state-of-the-art pulsation models for roAp stars.
