The galaxy cluster scaling relations are important for studying baryon physics, structure formation
and cosmology. We use a complete sample of 38 richest maxBCG clusters to study the ICM-galaxy scaling
relations based on X-ray and optical observations. The clusters are selected from the two largest
bins of optical richness in the Planck stacking work with the maxBCG richness N200 > 78. We analyze
their Chandra and XMM-Newton data to derive the X-ray properties of the ICM. While the expected cluster
temperatures should be scattered around 5-10 keV from the optical richness, the observed range
extends to temperatures as low as 1.5 keV. Meanwhile, they follow normal Lx-Tx and Lx-Yx relations,
which suggests that they are normal X-ray clusters. Moreover, the observed average Yx is consistent
with the expected Yx inferred from the Planck mean staking Ysz in the same two richest bins. However,
the scatter of the Lx-N and Yx-N relations are also large and asymmetric with more outliers towards
lower Lx or Yx. The mismatch between ICM-galaxy scaling relations can come from several factors,
including miscentering, projection, contamination of low mass systems, mass bias and covariance
bias. The mismatch is smaller when using a BCG-dominated subsample, with the outliers suffering
from the projection problem. Our results suggest that results from blind stacking should be interpreted
carefully. We also evaluate the fractions of relaxed and cool core (CC) clusters in our sample. Both
are smaller than those from SZ or X-ray selected samples.
