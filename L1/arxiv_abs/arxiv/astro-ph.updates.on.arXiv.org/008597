We analyze potential effects of an extraterrestrial civilization's use of orbiting mirrors to
illuminate the dark side of a synchronously rotating planet on planetary transit light curves.
Previous efforts to detect civilizations based on side effects of planetary-scale engineering
have focused on structures affecting the host star output (e.g. Dyson spheres). However, younger
civilizations are likely to be less advanced in their engineering efforts, yet still capable of
sending small spacecraft into orbit. Since M dwarfs are the most common type of star in the solar neighborhood,
it seems plausible that many of the nearest habitable planets orbit dim, low-mass M stars, and will
be in synchronous rotation. Logically, a civilization evolving on such a planet may be inspired
to illuminate their planet's dark side by placing a single large mirror at the L2 Lagrangian point,
or launching a fleet of small thin mirrors into planetary orbit. We briefly examine the requirements
and engineering challenges of such a collection of orbiting mirrors, then explore their impact
on transit light curves. We incorporate stellar limb darkening and model a simplistic mirror fleet's
effects for transits of Earth-like (R = 0.5 to 2 R_Earth) planets which would be synchronously rotating
for orbits within the habitable zone of their host star. Although such an installation is undetectable
in Kepler data, JWST will provide the sensitivity necessary to detect a fleet of mirrors orbiting
Earth-like habitable planets around nearby stars.
