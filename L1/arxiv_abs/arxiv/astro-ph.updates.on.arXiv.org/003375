The `Grand Tack' model proposes that the inner Solar System was sculpted by the giant planets' orbital
migration in the gaseous protoplanetary disk. Jupiter first migrated inward then Jupiter and Saturn
migrated back outward together. If Jupiter's turnaround or "tack" point was at ~1.5 AU the inner
disk of terrestrial building blocks would have been truncated at ~1 AU, naturally producing the
terrestrial planets' masses and spacing. During the gas giants' migration the asteroid belt is
severely depleted but repopulated by distinct planetesimal reservoirs that can be associated
with the present-day S and C types. The giant planets' orbits are consistent with the later evolution
of the outer Solar System. Here we confront common criticisms of the Grand Tack model. We show that
some uncertainties remain regarding the Tack mechanism itself; the most critical unknown is the
timing and rate of gas accretion onto Saturn and Jupiter. Current isotopic and compositional measurements
of Solar System bodies -- including the D/H ratios of Saturn's satellites -- do not refute the model.
We discuss how alternate models for the formation of the terrestrial planets each suffer from an
internal inconsistency and/or place a strong and very specific requirement on the properties of
the protoplanetary disk. We conclude that the Grand Tack model remains viable and consistent with
our current understanding of planet formation. Nonetheless, we encourage additional tests of
the Grand Tack as well as the construction of alternate models.
