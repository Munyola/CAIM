In cases where both components of a binary system show oscillations, asteroseismology has been
proposed as a method to identify the system. For KIC 2568888, observed with $Kepler$, we detect oscillation
modes for two red giants in a single power density spectrum. Through an asteroseismic study we investigate
if the stars have similar properties, which could be an indication that they are physically bound
into a binary system. While one star lies on the red giant branch (RGB), the other, more evolved star,
is either a RGB or asymptotic-giant-branch star. We found similar ages for the red giants and a mass
ratio close to 1. Based on these asteroseismic results we propose KIC 2568888 as a rare candidate
binary system ($\sim 0.1\%$ chance). However, when combining the asteroseismic data with ground-based
$BVI$ photometry we estimated different distances for the stars, which we cross-checked with $Gaia$
DR2. From $Gaia$ we obtained for one object a distance between and broadly consistent with the distances
from $BVI$ photometry. For the other object we have a negative parallax with a not yet reliable $Gaia$
distance solution. The derived distances challenge a binary interpretation and may either point
to a triple system, which could explain the visible magnitudes, or, to a rare chance alignment ($\sim
0.05\%$ chance based on stellar magnitudes). This probability would even be smaller, if calculated
for close pairs of stars with a mass ratio close to unity in addition to similar magnitudes, which
may indeed indicate that a binary scenario is more favourable.
