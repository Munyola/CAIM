We investigate the chemical evolution of a collapsing core that starts from a hydrostatic core and
finally form a low-mass protostar. New multiphase gas-grain models that include bulk diffusion
and photon penetration are simulated by the macroscopic Monte Carlo method in order to derive the
chemical evolution. There are two types of species in the ice bulk in the new multiphase models. Interstitial
species can diffuse and sublime at their own sublimation temperatures while normal species are
locked in the ice bulk. Photodissociation rates of icy species are reduced by the exponential decay
of UV flux within the ice mantle. Two-phase models and basic multiphase models without bulk diffusion
and photon penetration are also simulated for comparison. Our physical model for the collapsing
core is base on a one-dimensional radiation hydrodynamics model. Abundant icy radicals are produced
at around 10 K in the new multiphase models. Interstitial radicals can diffuse inside ice mantles
to form complex organic molecules (COMS) upon warming-up. Thus, COMs produced by radical recombination
at higher temperatures in the new multiphase models are more than one order of magnitude higher than
those in the two-phase and basic multiphase models. Moreover, COMs produced at around 10 K in the
new multiphase models are about one order of magnitude higher than those in the two-phase model.
Our model shows a reasonable agreement with observations toward low-mass protostars. Moreover,
molecular oxygen abundances predicted by our new multiphase models agree reasonably well with
that found in cometary materials.
