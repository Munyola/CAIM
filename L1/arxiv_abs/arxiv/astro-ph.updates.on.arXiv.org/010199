We analyze Chandra X-ray observatory data for a sample of 63 luminous infrared galaxies (LIRGs),
sampling the lower-infrared luminosity range of the Great Observatories All-Sky LIRG survey (GOALS),
which includes the most luminous infrared selected galaxies in the local universe. X-rays are detected
for 84 individual galaxies within the 63 systems, for which arcsecond resolution X-ray images,
fluxes, infrared and X-ray luminosities, spectra and radial profiles are presented. Using X-ray
and MIR selection criteria, we find AGN in (31$\pm$5)% of the galaxy sample, compared to the (38$\pm$6)%
previously found for GOALS galaxies with higher infrared luminosities (C-GOALS I). Using mid-infrared
data, we find that (59$\pm$9)% of the X-ray selected AGN in the full C-GOALS sample do not contribute
significantly to the bolometric luminosity of the host galaxy. Dual AGN are detected in two systems,
implying a dual AGN fraction in systems that contain at least one AGN of (29$\pm$14)%, compared to
the (11$\pm$10)% found for the C-GOALS I sample. Through analysis of radial profiles, we derive
that most sources, and almost all AGN, in the sample are compact, with half of the soft X-ray emission
generated within the inner $\sim 1$ kpc. For most galaxies, the soft X-ray sizes of the sources are
comparable to those of the MIR emission. We also find that the hard X-ray faintness previously reported
for the bright C-GOALS I sources is also observed in the brightest LIRGs within the sample, with $L_{\rm
FIR}>8\times10^{10}$ L$_{\odot}$.
