We study the optical evolution of the 2015 outburst in V404 Cyg, with emphasis on the peculiar nebular
phase and subsequent decay to quiescence. From the decay timescale of the Balmer emission associated
with the nebula we measure an outflow mass M_wind~4x10^{-6} Msun. Remarkably, this is ~100 times
larger than the accreted mass and ~10% of the total mass stored in the disc. The wind efficiency must
therefore be significantly larger than previous estimates for black hole transients, suggesting
that radiation pressure (in addition to other mechanisms such as Compton-heating) plays a key role
in V404 Cyg. In addition, we compare the evolution of the 2015 and 1989 outbursts and find clear similarities
(namely a large luminosity drop ~10 d after the X-ray trigger, followed by a brief nebular phase)
but also remarkable differences in decay timescales and long-term evolution of the Halpha profile.
In particular, we see evidence for a rapid disc contraction in 2015, consistent with a burst of mass
transfer. This could be driven by the response of the companion to hard X-ray illumination, most
notably during the last gigantic (super-Eddington) flare on 25 June 2015. We argue that irradiation
and consequential disc wind are key factors to understand the different outburst histories in 1989
and 2015. In the latter case, radiation pressure may be responsible for the abrupt end of the outburst
through depleting inner parts of the disc, thus quenching accretion and X-ray irradiation. We also
present a refined orbital period and updated ephemeris.
