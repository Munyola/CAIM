We investigate the mass-metallicity relations for the gaseous (MZRgas) and stellar components
(MZRstar) of local star-forming galaxies based on a representative sample from SDSS DR12. The mass-weighted
average stellar metallicities are systematically lower than the gas metallicities. This difference
in metallicity increases toward galaxies with lower masses and reaches 0.4-0.8 dex at 10^9 Msun
(depending on the gas metallicity calibration). As a result, the MZRstar is much steeper than the
MZRgas. The much lower metallicities in stars compared to the gas in low mass galaxies implies dramatic
metallicity evolution with suppressed metal enrichment at early times. The aim of this paper is
to explain the observed large difference in gas and stellar metallicity and to infer the origin of
the mass-metallicity relations. To this end we develop a galactic chemical evolution model accounting
for star formation, gas inflow and outflow. By combining the observed mass-metallicity relation
for both gas and stellar components to constrain the models, we find that only two scenarios are able
to reproduce the observations. Either strong metal outflow or a steep IMF slope at early epochs of
galaxy evolution is needed. Based on these two scenarios, for the first time we successfully reproduce
the observed MZRgas and MZRstar simultaneously, together with other independent observational
constraints in the local universe. Our model also naturally reproduces the flattening of the MZRgas
at the high mass end leaving the MZRstar intact, as seen in observational data.
