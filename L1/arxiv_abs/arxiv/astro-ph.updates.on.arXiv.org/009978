Using Shapefinders, which are ratios of Minkowski functionals, we study the morphology of neutral
hydrogen (HI) density fields, simulated using semi-numerical technique (inside-out), at various
stages of reionization. Accompanying the Shapefinders, we also employ the 'largest cluster statistic'
(LCS), originally proposed in Klypin and Shandarin (1993), to study the percolation in both neutral
and ionized hydrogen. We find that the largest ionized region is percolating below the neutral fraction
$x_{HI} \lesssim 0.728$ (or equivalently $z \lesssim 9$). The study of Shapefinders reveals that
the largest ionized region starts to become highly filamentary with non-trivial topology near
the percolation transition. During the percolation transition, the first two Shapefinders - 'thickness'
($T$) and 'breadth' ($B$) - of the largest ionized region do not vary much, while the third Shapefinder
- 'length' ($L$) - abruptly increases. Consequently, the largest ionized region tends to be highly
filamentary and topologically quite complex. The product of the first two Shapefinders, $T\times
B$, provides a measure of the 'cross-section' of a filament-like ionized region. We find that, near
percolation, the value of $T\times B$ for the largest ionized region remains stable at $\sim 7$ Mpc$^2$
(in comoving scale) while its length increases with time. Interestingly all large ionized regions
have similar cross-sections. However their length shows a power-law dependence on their volume,
$L\propto V^{0.72}$, at the onset of percolation.
