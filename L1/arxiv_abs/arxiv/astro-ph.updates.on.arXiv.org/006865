Since 2014, NASA's K2 mission has observed large portions of the ecliptic plane in search of transiting
planets and has detected hundreds of planet candidates. With observations planned until at least
early 2018, K2 will continue to identify more planet candidates. We present here 275 planet candidates
observed during Campaigns 0-10 of the K2 mission that are orbiting stars brighter than 13th magnitude
(in Kepler band) and for which we have obtained high-resolution spectra (R = 44,000). These candidates
are analyzed using the VESPA package (Morton 2012, 2015b) in order to calculate their false positive
probabilities (FPP). We find that 149 candidates are validated with a FPP less than 0.1%, 39 of which
were previously only candidates and 56 of which were previously undetected. The processes of data
reduction, candidate identification, and statistical validation are described, and the demographics
of the candidates and newly validated planets are explored. We show tentative evidence of a gap in
the planet radius distribution of our candidate sample. Comparing our sample to the Kepler candidate
sample investigated by Fulton et al. (2017), we conclude that more planets are required to quantitatively
confirm the gap with K2 candidates or validated planets. This work, in addition to increasing the
population of validated K2 planets by roughly 50% and providing new targets for follow-up observations,
will also serve as a framework for validating candidates from upcoming K2 campaigns and the Transiting
Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), expected to launch in 2018.
