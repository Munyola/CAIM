The coalescence of a compact object with a $10^{4}-10^{7} {\rm M_\odot}$ supermassive black hole
(SMBH) produces mHz gravitational waves (GWs) detectable by the future Laser Interferometer Space
Antenna (LISA). If such an inspiral occurs in the accretion disc of an active galactic nucleus (AGN),
the gas torques imprint a small deviation in the GW waveform. Here we present two-dimensional hydrodynamical
simulations with the moving-mesh code DISCO of a BH inspiraling at the GW rate in a binary system with
a mass ratio $q\!=\!M_2/M_1\!=\!10^{-3}$, embedded in an accretion disc. We assume a locally isothermal
equation of state for the gas (with Mach number $\mathcal{M}=20$) and implement a standard $\alpha$-prescription
for its viscosity (with $\alpha = 0.03$). We find disc torques on the binary that are weaker than in
previous semi-analytic toy models, and are in the opposite direction: the gas disc slows down, rather
than speeds up the inspiral. We compute the resulting deviations in the GW waveform, which scale
linearly with the mass of the disc. The SNR of these deviations accumulates mostly at high frequencies,
and becomes detectable in a 5-year LISA observation if the total phase shift exceeds a few radians.
We find that this occurs if the disc surface density exceeds $\Sigma_0 \gtrsim 10^{2-3}\rm g\,cm^{-2}$,
as may be the case in thin discs with near-Eddington accretion rates. Since the characteristic imprint
on the GW signal is strongly dependent on disc parameters, a LISA detection of an intermediate mass
ratio inspiral would probe the physics of AGN discs and migration.
