We report the discovery of an SN1988Z-like type IIn supernova KISS15s found in a low-mass star-forming
galaxy at redshift z=0.038 during the course of the Kiso Supernova Survey (KISS). KISS15s shows
long-duration optical continuum and emission line light curves, indicating that KISS15s is powered
by a continuous interaction between the expanding ejecta and dense circumstellar medium (CSM).
The H$\alpha$ emission line profile can be decomposed into four Gaussians of narrow, intermediate,
blue-shifted intermediate, and broad velocity width components, with a full width at half maximum
of $\lesssim 100$, $\sim 2,000$, and $\sim 14,000$ km s${}^{-1}$ for the narrow, intermediate,
and broad components, respectively. The presence of the blue-shifted intermediate component,
of which the line-of-sight velocity relative to the systemic velocity is about $-5,000$ km s${}^{-1}$,
suggests that the ejecta-CSM interaction region has an inhomogeneous morphology and anisotropic
expansion velocity. We found that KISS15s shows increasing infrared continuum emission, which
can be interpreted as hot dust thermal emission of $T \sim 1,200$ K from newly formed dust in a cool,
dense shell in the ejecta-CSM interaction region. The progenitor mass-loss rate, inferred from
bolometric luminosity, is $\dot{M} \sim 0.4 M_{\odot} \text{yr}^{-1} (v_{w}/40 \text{km}~\text{s}^{-1})$,
where $v_{w}$ is the progenitor's stellar wind velocity. This implies that the progenitor of KISS15s
was a red supergiant star or a luminous blue variable that had experienced a large mass-loss in the
centuries before the explosion.
