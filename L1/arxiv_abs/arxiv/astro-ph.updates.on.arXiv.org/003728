High-resolution ground-based optical speckle and near-infrared adaptive optics images are taken
to search for stars in close angular proximity to host stars of candidate planets identified by the
NASA Kepler Mission. Neighboring stars are a potential source of false positive signals. These
stars also blend into Kepler light curves, affecting estimated planet properties, and are important
for an understanding of planets in multiple star systems. Deep images with high angular resolution
help to validate candidate planets by excluding potential background eclipsing binaries as the
source of the transit signals. A study of 18 Kepler Object of Interest stars hosting a total of 28 candidate
and validated planets is presented. Validation levels are determined for 18 planets against the
likelihood of a false positive from a background eclipsing binary. Most of these are validated at
the 99% level or higher, including 5 newly-validated planets in two systems: Kepler-430 and Kepler-431.
The stellar properties of the candidate host stars are determined by supplementing existing literature
values with new spectroscopic characterizations. Close neighbors of 7 of these stars are examined
using multi-wavelength photometry to determine their nature and influence on the candidate planet
properties. Most of the close neighbors appear to be gravitationally-bound secondaries, while
a few are best explained as closely co-aligned field stars. Revised planet properties are derived
for each candidate and validated planet, including cases where the close neighbors are the potential
host stars.
