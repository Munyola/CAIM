Imaging spectroscopy in X-rays with RHESSI provide the possibility to investigate the spatial
evolution of the X-ray emitting electron distribution and therefore to study the transport effects
on energetic electrons during solar flares. We study the energy dependence of the energetic electron
scattering mean free path in the solar corona. We use the imaging spectroscopy technique with RHESSI
to study the evolution of energetic electrons distribution in different part of the magnetic loop
during the 2004 May 21 flare. These observations are compared with the radio observations of the
gyrosynchrotron radiation of the same flare by Kuznetsov and Kontar (2015), and with the predictions
of the diffusive transport model described by Kontar et al. (2014). The X-ray analysis shows a trapping
of energetic electrons in the corona and a spectral hardening of the energetic electron distribution
between the top of the loop and the footpoints. Coronal trapping of electrons is stronger for the
radio-emitting electrons than for the X-ray-emitting electrons. These observations can be explained
by the diffusive transport model derived by Kontar et al. (2014). We show that the combination of
X-ray and radio diagnostics is a powerful tool to study electron transport in the solar corona in
different energy domains. We show that the diffusive transport model can explain our observations;
and in the range 25-500 keV, the electron scattering mean free path decreases with electron energy.
We can estimate for the first time the scattering mean free path dependence on energy in the corona.
