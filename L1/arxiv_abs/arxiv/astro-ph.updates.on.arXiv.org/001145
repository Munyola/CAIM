Recent observations of the super-Earth GJ 1214b show that it has a relatively featureless transmission
spectrum. One suggestion is that these observations indicate that the planet's atmosphere is vertically
compact, perhaps due to a water-rich composition that yields a large mean molecular weight. Another
suggestion is that the atmosphere is hydrogen/helium-rich with clouds that obscure predicted
absorption features. Previous models that incorporate clouds have included their effect without
a strong physical motivation for their existence. Here, we present model atmospheres of GJ 1214b
that include physically-motivated clouds of two types. We model the clouds that form as a result
of condensation in chemical equilibrium, as they likely do on brown dwarfs, which include KCl and
ZnS for this planet. We also include clouds that form as a result of photochemistry, forming a hydrocarbon
haze layer. We use a photochemical kinetics model to understand the vertical distribution and available
mass of haze-forming molecules. We model both solar and enhanced-metallicity cloudy models and
determine the cloud properties necessary to match observations. In enhanced-metallicity atmospheres,
we find that the equilibrium clouds can match the observations of GJ 1214b if they are lofted high
into the atmosphere and have a low sedimentation efficiency (fsed=0.1). We find that models with
a variety of hydrocarbon haze properties can match the observations. Particle sizes from 0.01 to
0.25 micron can match the transmission spectrum with haze-forming efficiencies as low as 1-5%.
