We explore the stellar structure of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) disk using data from the Survey
of the MAgellanic Stellar History (SMASH) and the Dark Energy Survey. We detect a ring-like stellar
overdensity in the red clump star count map at a radius of ~6 degrees (~5.2 kpc at the LMC distance)
that is continuous over ~270 degrees in position angle and is only limited by the current data coverage.
The overdensity shows an amplitude up to 2.5 times higher than that of the underlying smooth disk.
This structure might be related to the multiple arms found by de Vaucouleurs. We find that the overdensity
shows spatial correlation with intermediate-age star clusters, but not with young (< 1 Gyr) main-sequence
stars, indicating the stellar populations associated with the overdensity are intermediate in
age or older. Our findings on the LMC overdensity can be explained by either of two distinct formation
mechanisms of a ring-like overdensity: (1) the overdensity formed out of an asymmetric one-armed
spiral wrapping around the LMC main body, which is induced by repeated encounters with the Small
Magellanic Cloud (SMC) over the last Gyr, or (2) the overdensity formed very recently as a tidal response
to a direct collision with the SMC. Although the measured properties of the overdensity alone cannot
distinguish between the two candidate scenarios, the consistency with both scenarios suggests
that the ring-like overdensity is likely a product of tidal interaction with the SMC, but not with
the Milky Way halo.
