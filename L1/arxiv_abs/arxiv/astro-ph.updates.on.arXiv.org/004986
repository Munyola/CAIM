Ejection velocity fields of asteroid families are largely unconstrained due to the fact that members
disperse relatively quickly on Myr time-scales by secular resonances and the Yarkovsky effect.
The spreading of fragments in $a$ by the Yarkovsky effect is indistinguishable from the spreading
caused by the initial ejection of fragments. By examining families $<$20 Myrs-old, we can use the
V-shape identification technique to separate family shapes that are due to the initial ejection
velocity field and those that are due to the Yarkovsky effect. $<$20 Myr-old asteroid families provide
an opportunity to study the velocity field of family fragments before they become too dispersed.
Only the Karin family's initial velocity field has been determined and scales inversely with diameter,
$D^{-1}$. We have applied the V-shape identification technique to constrain young families' initial
ejection velocity fields by measuring the curvature of their fragments' V-shape correlation in
semi-major axis, $a$, vs. $D^{-1}$ space. Curvature from a straight line implies a deviation from
a scaling of $D^{-1}$. We measure the V-shape curvature of 11 young asteroid families including
the \FYnospace, Aeolia, Brangane, Brasilia, Clarissa, Iannini, Karin, Konig, Koronis(2), Theobalda
and Veritas asteroid families. We find that the majority of asteroid families have initial ejection
velocity fields consistent with $\sim D^{-1}$ supporting laboratory impact experiments and computer
simulations of disrupting asteroid parent bodies.
