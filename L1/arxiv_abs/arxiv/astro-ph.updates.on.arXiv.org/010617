Multi-component dark matter scenarios constitute natural extensions of standard single-component
setups and offer attractive new dynamics that could be adopted to solve various puzzles of dark matter.
In this work we present and illustrate properties of a minimal UV-complete vector-fermion dark
matter model where two or three dark sector particles are stable. The model we consider is an extension
of the Standard Model (SM) by spontaneously broken extra $U(1)_X$ gauge symmetry and a Dirac fermion.
All terms in the Lagrangian which are consistent with the assumed symmetry are present, so the model
is renormalizable and consistent. To generate mass for the dark-vector $X_\mu$ the Higgs mechanism
with a complex singlet $S$ is employed in the dark sector. Dark matter candidates are the massive
vector boson $X_\mu$ and two Majorana fermions $\psi_\pm$. All the dark sector fields are singlets
under the SM gauge group. The set of three coupled Boltzmann equations has been solved numerically
and discussed. We have performed scans over the parameter space of the model implementing the total
relic abundance and direct detection constraints. The dynamics of the vector-fermion dark matter
model is very rich and various interesting phenomena appear, in particular, when the standard annihilations
of a given dark matter are suppressed then the semi-annihilations, conversions and decays within
the dark sector are crucial for the evolution of relic abundance and its present value. Possibility
of enhanced self-interaction has been also discussed.
