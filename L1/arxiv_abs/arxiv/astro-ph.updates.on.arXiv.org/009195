Clouds in the atmospheres of exoplanets confound characterization efforts by reducing, eliminating,
and distorting spectral signatures of molecular abundances. As such, interpretations of exoplanet
spectra strongly depend on the choice of cloud model, many of which are highly simplified and lack
predictive power. In this work, we use a cloud model that treat microphysical processes to simulate
potassium chloride (KCl) and zinc sulfide (ZnS) clouds in the atmosphere of the super Earth GJ 1214b
and how they vary as a function of the strength of vertical mixing and the atmospheric metallicity.
Microphysical processes control the size and spatial distribution of cloud particles, allowing
for the computation of more physical cloud distributions than simpler models. We find that the mass
and opacity of KCl clouds increase with mixing strength and metallicity, with the particle size
and spatial distribution defined by nucleation, condensation, evaporation, and transport timescales.
ZnS clouds cannot form without the presence of condensation nuclei, while heterogeneous nucleation
of ZnS on KCl reduces particle sizes compared to pure KCl cases. In order to explain the flat transmission
spectrum of GJ 1214b with homogeneously nucleated KCl clouds, the atmospheric metallicity must
be at least 1000 $\times$ solar, and the eddy diffusivity must be at least 10$^{10}$ cm$^2$ s$^{-1}$.
We predict that JWST observations of GJ 1214b may reveal the presence of methane, carbon monoxide,
and water, allowing for constraints to be placed on atmospheric metallicity and C/O ratio.
