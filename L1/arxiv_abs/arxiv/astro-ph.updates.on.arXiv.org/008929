Spectropolarimetry is a powerful technique that has provided critical support for the geometric
unification model of local active galactic nuclei. In this paper, we present optical (rest-frame
UV) Keck spectropolarimetry of five luminous obscured (Type 2) and extremely red quasars (ERQs)
at z~2.5. Three objects reach polarization fractions of >10% in the continuum. We propose a model
in which dust scattering is the dominant scattering and polarization mechanism in our targets,
though electron scattering cannot be completely excluded. Emission lines are polarized at a lower
level than is the continuum. This suggests that the emission-line region exists on similar spatial
scales as the scattering region. In three objects we detect an intriguing 90 degree swing in the polarization
position angle as a function of line-of-sight velocity in the emission lines of Ly-alpha, CIV and
NV. We interpret this phenomenon in the framework of a geometric model with an equatorial dusty scattering
region in which the material is outflowing at several thousand km/sec. Emission lines may also be
scattered by dust or resonantly. This model explains several salient features of observations
by scattering on scales of a few tens of pc. Our observations provide a tantalizing view of the inner
region geometry and kinematics of high-redshift obscured and extremely red quasars. Our data and
modeling lend strong support for toroidal obscuration and powerful outflows on the scales of the
UV emission-line region, in addition to the larger scale outflows inferred previously from the
optical emission-line kinematics.
