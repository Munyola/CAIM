Supermassive black hole (SMBH) binaries form due to galaxy mergers and minor accretion events.
When the SMBHs are accreting, they form dual or binary AGN and can give rise to double-peaked emission
lines in the optical spectra of the merger remnant. The double-peaked emission lines could also
be due to jet-ISM interaction or rotating disks. One of the best ways to confirm dual/binary AGN in
double-peaked AGN (DPAGN) is by using high resolution radio observations. We have observed a sample
of 20 DPAGN at two or more frequencies using the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA), of which one
source is already published and the remaining 19 are presented in this paper. We have detected dual
radio structures at separation of $\lesssim$ 10 kpc in three of our sample galaxies. Using the spectral
index maps and optical spectra of the sources, we have confirmed that one of them is a dual AGN (DAGN),
while the other two can be dual AGN or AGN+ star-forming nuclei pairs. Of the remaining sources, one
has a clear core-jet structure and another source could be a core-jet structure or a DAGN. The remaining
13 sources are single cores while one source is not detected at any frequency. We find that for our
dual AGN detection, the DPAGN emission lines do not originate from the dual/binary AGN. Instead,
they could be due to outflows or jets. Hence, we conclude that DPAGN identified in low resolution
SDSS spectra are not good indicators of dual/binary AGN. On the other hand, closely interacting
galaxies or merger remnants are good candidates for detecting dual/binary AGN.
