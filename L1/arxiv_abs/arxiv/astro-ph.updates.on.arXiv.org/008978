The zonal-mean atmospheric flow of an idealized terrestrial planet is analyzed using both numerical
simulations and zonally symmetric theories, focusing largely on the limit of low planetary rotation
rate. Two versions of a zonally symmetric theory are considered, the standard Held-Hou model, which
features a discontinuous zonal wind at the edge of the Hadley cell, and a variant with continuous
zonal wind but discontinuous temperature. The two models have different scalings for the boundary
latitude and zonal wind. Numerical simulations are found to have smoother temperature profiles
than either model, with no temperature or velocity discontinuities even in zonally symmetric simulations.
Continuity is achieved because of the presence of an overturning circulation poleward of the point
of maximum zonal wind, which allows the zonal velocity profile to be smoother than the original theory
without the temperature discontinuities of the variant theory. Zonally symmetric simulations
generally fall between the two sets of theoretical scalings, and have a faster polar zonal flow than
either. Three-dimensional simulations that allow for eddy motion fall closer to the scalings of
the variant model. At very low rotation rates the maximum zonal wind falls with falling planetary
rotation rate, even in the three-dimensional simulations, and collapses completely at zero rotation.
Nevertheless, the low-rotation limit of the overturning circulation is strong enough to drive
the temperature profile close to a state of nearly constant potential temperature.
