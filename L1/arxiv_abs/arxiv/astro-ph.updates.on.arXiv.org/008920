iPTF15dtg is a Type Ic supernova (SN) showing a broad light curve around maximum light, consistent
with massive ejecta if we assume a radioactive-powering scenario. We study the late-time light
curve of iPTF15dtg, which turned out to be extraordinarily luminous for a stripped-envelope (SE)
SN. We compare the observed light curves to those of other SE SNe and also with models for the $^{56}$Co
decay. We analyze and compare the spectra to nebular spectra of other SE SNe. We build a bolometric
light curve and fit it with different models, including powering by radioactivity, magnetar powering,
as well as a combination of the two. Between 150 d and 750 d past explosion, iPTF15dtg's luminosity
declined by merely two magnitudes instead of the six magnitudes expected from $^{56}$Co decay.
This is the first spectroscopically-regular SE SN showing this behavior. The model with both radioactivity
and magnetar powering provides the best fit to the light curve and appears to be the more realistic
powering mechanism. An alternative mechanism might be CSM interaction. However, the spectra of
iPTF15dtg are very similar to those of other SE SNe, and do not show signs of strong CSM interaction.
iPTF15dtg is the first spectroscopically-regular SE SN whose light curve displays such clear signs
of a magnetar contributing to the powering of the late time light curve. Given this result, the mass
of the ejecta needs to be revised to a lower value, and therefore the progenitor mass could be significantly
lower than the previously estimated $>$35 $M_{\odot}$.
