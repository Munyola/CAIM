We compare various models and approximations for non-linear mean-field dynamos in disc galaxies
to assess their applicability and accuracy, and thus to suggest a set of simple solutions suitable
to model the large-scale galactic magnetic fields in various contexts. The dynamo saturation mechanisms
considered are the magnetic helicity balance involving helicity fluxes (the dynamical $\alpha$-quenching)
and an algebraic $\alpha$-quenching. The non-linear solutions are then compared with the marginal
kinematic and asymptotic solutions. We also discuss the accuracy of the no-$z$ approximation.
Although these tools are very different in the degree of approximation and hence complexity, they
all lead to remarkably similar solutions for the mean magnetic field. In particular, we show that
the algebraic $\alpha$-quenching non-linearity can be obtained from a more physical dynamical
$\alpha$-quenching model in the limit of nearly azimuthal magnetic field. This suggests, for instance,
that earlier results on galactic disc dynamos based on the simple algebraic non-linearity are likely
to be reliable, and that estimates based on simple, even linear models are often a good starting point.
We suggest improved no-$z$ and algebraic $\alpha$-quenching models, and also incorporate galactic
outflows into a simple analytical dynamo model to show that the outflow can produce leading magnetic
spirals near the disc surface. The simple dynamo models developed are applied to estimate the magnetic
pitch angle and the arm-interarm contrast in the saturated magnetic field strength for realistic
parameter values.
