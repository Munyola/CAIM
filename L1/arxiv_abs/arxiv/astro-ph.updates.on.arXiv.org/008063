Fundamental relaxation processes in the secular evolution of a collisional star cluster of $N$-'point'
stars have been conventionally discussed based on either of collision kinetic theory (for strong
two-body encounters) and wave one (for statistical acceleration and gravitational polarization).
If combining the both theories together, one must introduce a self-consistent 'truncated' Newtonian
mean-field (m.f.) acceleration of star at position $r$ and time $t$ due to a phase-space distribution
function $f\left(r', p',t\right)$ for stars $A^{\triangle}(r,t)=-Gm\left(1-\frac{1}{N}\right)\int_{\mid
r-r' \mid > \triangle}\frac{r-r'}{\mid r-r' \mid^{3}} f\left(r',p',t\right)\text{d}^{3}{r'}\text{d}^{3}{p'},$
where $G$ is the gravitational constant and $m$ the mass of stars. The lower limit $\triangle$ of
the distance between two stars is order of the Landau distance. The truncated m.f. acceleration
is a necessary consequence due to the strong encounters and m.f. acceleration being not able to 'coexist'
at specific distance between stars. The present paper aims at initiating a star-cluster convergent
kinetic theory to self-consistently derive kinetic equations of star clusters, mathematically
non-divergent in distance- and wavenumber- spaces based on the truncated m.f. acceleration, correct
at time scales of the secular evolution. This will be achieved by focusing on mathematical formulations
of the Kandrup's generalised-Landau equation including the effect of the strong encounters and
by extending the Grad's truncated distribution function and Klimontovich's theory of non-ideal
systems.
