Electric dipole emission from rapidly spinning polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) is widely
believed as an origin of anomalous microwave emission (AME), but recently it encounters a setback
due to the non-correlation of AME with PAH abundance seen in a full-sky analysis. Microwave observations
for specific regions with well-constrained PAH features would be crucial to test the spinning dust
hypothesis. In this paper, we present physical modeling of microwave emission from spinning PAHs
from protoplanetary disks (PPDs) around Herbig Ae/Be stars and T-Tauri stars where PAH features
are well observed. Guided by the presence of 10 $\mu$m silicate features in some PPDs, we also model
microwave emission from spinning nanosilicates. Thermal emission from big dust grains is computed
using the Monte Carlo radiative transfer code (\textsc{radmc-3d}; \citealt{2012ascl.soft02015D}).
Our numerical results demonstrate that microwave emission from either spinning PAHs or spinning
nanosilicates dominates over thermal dust at frequencies $\nu< 60$ GHz, even in the presence of
significant grain growth. Finally, we attempt to fit mm-cm observational data with both thermal
dust and spinning dust for several disks around Herbig Ae/Be stars that exhibit PAH features and
find that spinning dust can successfully reproduce the observed excess microwave emission (EME).
Future radio observations with ngVLA, SKA and ALMA Band 1 would be valuable for elucidating the origin
of EME and potentially open a new window for probing nanoparticles in circumstellar disks.
