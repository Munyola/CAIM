X-ray observations of active galactic nuclei (AGN) show variability on timescales ranging from
a few hours up to a few days. Some of this variability may be associated with occultation events by
clouds in the broad line region. In this work, we aim to model the spectral and polarization variability
arising from X-ray obscuration events, serving as probes of the relativistic effects that dominate
the emission from the innermost regions. We show that asymmetries can be clearly detected in the
AGN spectra as the cloud is shading different parts of the accretion disc. We also show that these
effects can be detected in the temporal evolution of the polarization degree ($P$) and the polarization
position angle ($\Psi$). The variations in $P$ and $\Psi$ are highly dependent on the inclination
of the system, the position of the primary source and its intrinsic polarization. Considering the
disc-corona system only, for an inclination $\theta = 30^\circ$ (60$^\circ$), $P$ increases up
to $\sim 20$% (30)%, in the 4-8 keV band, when the unpolarized primary source is obscured. However,
after accounting for the contribution of parsec-scale material scattering the light in our line
of sight (narrow-line region and molecular torus), the variability is smoothed out and the polarization
degree can be reduced down to $\sim 1$% (2%). Our results suggest that the study of eclipses in AGN
with the next generation of X-ray spectral and polarimetric missions could provide unique information
on the physics and structure of the innermost regions as well as of the parsec-scale material.
