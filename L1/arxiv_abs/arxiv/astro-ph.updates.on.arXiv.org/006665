The velocity anisotropy parameter, beta, is a measure of the kinematic state of orbits in the stellar
halo which holds promise for constraining the merger history of the Milky Way (MW). We determine
global trends for beta as a function of radius from three suites of simulations, including accretion
only and cosmological hydrodynamic simulations. We find that both types of simulations are consistent
and predict strong radial anisotropy (<beta>~0.7) for Galactocentric radii greater than 10 kpc.
Previous observations of beta for the MW's stellar halo claim a detection of an isotropic or tangential
"dip" at r~20 kpc. Using the N-body+SPH simulations, we investigate the temporal persistence,
population origin, and severity of "dips" in beta. We find dips in the in situ stellar halo are long-lived,
while dips in the accreted stellar halo are short-lived and tied to the recent accretion of satellite
material. We also find that a major merger as early as z~1 can result in a present day low (isotropic
to tangential) value of beta over a wide range of radii and angular expanse. While all of these mechanisms
are plausible drivers for the beta dip observed in the MW, in the simulations, each mechanism has
a unique metallicity signature associated with it, implying that future spectroscopic surveys
could distinguish between them. Since an accurate knowledge of beta(r) is required for measuring
the mass of the MW halo, we note significant transient dips in beta could cause an overestimate of
the halo's mass when using spherical Jeans equation modeling.
