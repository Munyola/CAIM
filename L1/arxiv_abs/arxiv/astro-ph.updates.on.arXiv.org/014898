Giant outbursts of Be/X-ray binaries may occur when a Be-star disc undergoes strong eccentricity
growth due to the Kozai-Lidov (KL) mechanism. The KL effect acts on a disc that is highly inclined
to the binary orbital plane provided that the disc aspect ratio is sufficiently small. The eccentric
disc overflows its Roche lobe and material flows from the Be star disc over to the companion neutron
star causing X-ray activity. With N-body simulations and steady state decretion disc models we
explore system parameters for which a disc in the Be/X-ray binary 4U 0115+634 is KL unstable and the
resulting timescale for the oscillations. We find good agreement between predictions of the model
and the observed giant outburst timescale provided that the disc is not completely destroyed by
the outburst. This allows the outer disc to be replenished between outbursts and a sufficiently
short KL oscillation timescale. An initially eccentric disc has a shorter KL oscillation timescale
compared to an initially circular orbit disc. We suggest that the chaotic nature of the outbursts
is caused by the sensitivity of the mechanism to the distribution of material within the disc. The
outbursts continue provided that the Be star supplies material that is sufficiently misaligned
to the binary orbital plane. We generalise our results to Be/X-ray binaries with varying orbital
period and find that if the Be star disc is flared, it is more likely to be unstable to KL oscillations
in a smaller orbital period binary, in agreement with observations.
