Over the solar-activity cycle, there are extended periods where significant discrepancies occur
between the spacecraft-observed total (unsigned) open magnetic flux and that determined from
coronal models. In this article, the total open heliospheric magnetic flux is computed using two
different methods and then compared with results obtained from in-situ interplanetary magnetic-field
observations. The first method uses two different types of photospheric magnetic-field maps as
input to the Wang Sheeley Arge (WSA) model: i) traditional Carrington or diachronic maps, and ii)
Air Force Data Assimilative Photospheric Flux Transport model synchronic maps. The second method
uses observationally derived helium and extreme-ultraviolet coronal-hole maps overlaid on the
same magnetic-field maps in order to compute total open magnetic flux. The diachronic and synchronic
maps are both constructed using magnetograms from the same source, namely the National Solar Observatory
Kitt Peak Vacuum Telescope and Vector Spectromagnetograph. The results of this work show that the
total open flux obtained from observationally derived coronal holes agrees remarkably well with
that derived from WSA, especially near solar minimum. This suggests that, on average, coronal models
capture well the observed large-scale coronal-hole structure over most of the solar cycle. Both
methods show considerable deviations from total open flux deduced from spacecraft data, especially
near solar maximum, pointing to something other than poorly determined coronal-hole area specification
as the source of these discrepancies.
