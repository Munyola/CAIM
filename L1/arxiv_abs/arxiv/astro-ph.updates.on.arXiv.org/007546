We investigate the evolution of star formation rates (SFRs), stellar masses, and M/L_3.4 micron
ratios of brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) in the COSMOS survey since z ~ 1 to determine the contribution
of star formation to the growth-rate of BCG stellar mass over time. Through the spectral energy distribution
(SED) fitting of the GALEX, CFHT, Subaru, Vista, Spitzer, and Herschel photometric data available
in the COSMOS2015 catalog, we estimate the stellar mass and SFR of each BCG. We use a modified version
of the iSEDfit package to fit the SEDs of our sample with both stellar and dust emission models, as
well as constrain the impact of star formation history assumptions on our results. We find that in
our sample of COSMOS BCGs, star formation evolves similarly to that in BCGs in samples of more massive
galaxy clusters. However, compared to the latter, the magnitude of star formation in our sample
is lower by ~ 1 dex. Additionally, we find an evolution of BCG baryonic mass-to-light ratio (M/L_{3.4
micron}) with redshift which is consistent with a passively aging stellar population. We use this
to build upon Wen et al.'s (2013) low-redshift nu L_{3.4 micron}-M_{Stellar} relation, quantifying
a correlation between nu L_{3.4 micron} and M_{Stellar} to z ~ 1. By comparing our results to BCGs
in Sunyaev-Zel'dovich and X-ray-selected samples of galaxy clusters, we find evidence that the
normalization of star formation evolution in a cluster sample is driven by the mass range of the sample
and may be biased upwards by cool cores.
