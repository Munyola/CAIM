We present a [CII] 158um map of the entire M51 (including M51b) grand--design spiral galaxy observed
with the FIFI-LS instrument on SOFIA. We compare the [CII] emission with the total far--infrared
(TIR) intensity and star formation rate(SFR) surface density maps (derived using H_alpha and 24um
emission) to study the relationship between [CII] and the star formation activity in a variety of
environments within M51 on scales of 16" corresponding to ~660 pc. We find that [CII] and the SFR surface
density are well correlated in the central, spiral arm, and inter-arm regions. The correlation
is in good agreement with that found for a larger sample of nearby galaxies at kpc scales. We find that
the SFR, and [CII] and TIR luminosities in M51 are dominated by the extended emission in M51's disk.
The companion galaxy M51b, however, shows a deficit of [CII] emission compared with the TIR emission
and SFR surface density, with [CII] emission detected only in the S-W part of this galaxy. The [CII]
deficit is associated with an enhanced dust temperature in this galaxy. We interpret the faint [CII]
emission in M51b to be a result of suppressed star formation in this galaxy, while the bright mid-
and far-infrared emission, which drive the TIR and SFR values, are powered by other mechanisms.
A similar but less pronounced effect is seen at the location of the black hole in M51's center. The
observed [CII] deficit in M51b suggests that this galaxy is a valuable laboratory to study the origin
of the apparent [CII] deficit observed in ultra-luminous galaxies.
