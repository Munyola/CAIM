We present the Hubble Deep UV Legacy Survey (HDUV), a 132 orbit imaging program with the WFC3/UVIS
camera onboard the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). The HDUV extends and builds on the few previous
UV imaging surveys in the two GOODS/CANDELS-Deep fields to provide deep images over a total area
of ~100 arcmin2 in the two filters F275W and F336W. Our release also includes all the F275W imaging
data taken by the CANDELS survey, which were aligned using a novel approach and combined with the
HDUV survey data. By reaching depths of 27.5-28.0 mag (5sigma, in 0.4" apertures), these are the
deepest high-resolution UV data over such a large area taken to date. Such unique UV imaging enables
a wide range of science by the community. Among the main goals of the HDUV survey are: (1) provide a
complete sample of faint star-forming galaxies at z~1-3, (2) constrain the ionizing photon escape
fraction from galaxies at z~2-3, and (3) track the build-up of bulges and the disappearance of clumpy
disk galaxies through reliable internal stellar population properties at sub-kpc resolution
out to z~3. The addition of the HDUV data further enhances the legacy value of the two GOODS/CANDELS-Deep
fields, which now include deep 11-band HST imaging as well as very deep ancillary data from X-ray
to radio, enabling unique multi-wavelength studies. Here, we provide an overview of the survey
design, describe the data reduction, and highlight a few basic analyses on the images which are released
to the community as high level science products via the Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes (MAST).
