The excitation and damping of transversal coronal loop oscillations and quantitative relation
between damping time, damping quality (damping time per period), oscillation amplitude, dissipation
mechanism and the wake phenomena are investigated. The observed time series data with the \textit{Atmospheric
Imaging Assembly} (AIA) telescope on NASA's \textit{Solar Dynamics Observatory} (SDO) satellite
on 2015 March 2, consisting of 400 consecutive images with 12 seconds cadence in the 171 $ \rm{{\AA}}$
pass band is analyzed for evidence of transversal oscillations along the coronal loops by Lomb-Scargle
periodgram. In this analysis signatures of transversal coronal loop oscillations that are damped
rapidly were found with dominant oscillation periods in the range of $\rm{P=12.25-15.80}$ minutes.
Also, damping times and damping qualities of transversal coronal loop oscillations at dominant
oscillation periods are estimated in the range of $ \rm{\tau_d=11.76-21.46}$ minutes and $ \rm{\tau_d/P=0.86-1.49}$,
respectively. The observational results of this analysis show that damping qualities decrease
slowly with increasing the amplitude of oscillation, but periods of oscillations are not sensitive
function of amplitude of oscillations. The order of magnitude of the damping qualities and damping
times are in good agreement with previous findings and the theoretical prediction for damping of
kink mode oscillations by dissipation mechanism. Furthermore, oscillation of loop segments attenuate
with time roughly as $t^{-\alpha}$ that magnitude values of $\alpha$ for 30 different segments
change from 0.51 to 0.75.
