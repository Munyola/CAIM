The ejecta kinematics of supernova remnants (SNRs) is one of crucial clues to understand the explosion
mechanism of type Ia supernovae (SNe). In particular, the kinematic asymmetry of iron-peak elements
provides the key to understanding physical processes taking place in the core of the exploding white
dwarfs (WDs) although it has been poorly understood by observations. In this paper, we show for the
first time the asymmetric expansion structure in the line-of-sight direction of Fe ejecta in Kepler's
SNR revealed by spectral and imaging analysis using the Chandra archival data. We found that the
K$\alpha$ line centroid energy and line width is relatively lower ($<$ 6.4 keV) and narrower ($\sim$80
eV) around the center of the remnant, which implies that the majority of the Fe ejecta in the central
region is red-shifted. At the outer regions, we identify bright blue-shifted structures as it might
have been ejected as high velocity dense clumps. Taking into account the broad population of the
Fe charge states, we estimate the red-shifted velocity of ~2,000 km/s and the blue-shifted velocity
of ~3,000 km/s for each velocity structure. We also present a possibility that a portion of the Fe
ejecta near the center are interacting with the dense circumstellar medium (CSM) on the near side
of the remnant. As the origin of the asymmetric motion of the Fe ejecta, we suggest three scenarios,
(1) the asymmetric distribution of the CSM, (2) the "shadow" in Fe cast by the companion star, and
(3) the asymmetric explosion.
