An increasing number of observations of the outer regions of globular clusters (GCs) have shown
a flattening of the velocity dispersion profile and an extended surface density profile. Formation
scenarios of GCs can lead to different explanations of these peculiarities, therefore the dynamics
of stars in the outskirts of GCs are an important tool in tracing back the evolutionary history and
formation of star clusters. One possible explanation for these features is that GCs are embedded
in dark matter halos. Alternatively, these features are the result of a population of energetically
unbound stars that can be spatially trapped within the cluster, known as potential escapers (PEs).
We present a prescription for the contribution of these energetically unbound members to a family
of self-consistent, distribution function-based models, which, for brevity, we call the Spherical
Potential Escapers Stitched (SPES) models. We show that, when fitting to mock data of bound and unbound
stars from an N-body model of a tidally-limited star cluster, the SPES models correctly reproduce
the density and velocity dispersion profiles up to the Jacobi radius, and they are able to recover
the value of the Jacobi radius itself to within 20%. We also provide a comparison to the number density
and velocity dispersion profiles of the Galactic cluster 47 Tucanae. Such a case offers a proof of
concept that an appropriate modelling of PEs is essential to accurately interpret Gaia data in the
outskirts of GCs, and, in turn, to formulate meaningful present-day constraints for GC formation
scenarios in the early universe.
