On the basis of the modern understanding of MHD turbulence, we propose a new way of using synchrotron
radiation, namely using synchrotron intensity gradients for tracing astrophysical magnetic
fields. We successfully test the new technique using synthetic data obtained with the 3D MHD simulations
and provide the demonstration of the practical utility of the technique by comparing the directions
of magnetic field that are obtained with PLANCK synchrotron intensity dats to the directions obtained
with PLANCK synchrotron polarization data. We demonstrate that the synchrotron intensity gradients
(SIGs) can reliably trace magnetic field in the presence of noise and can provide detailed maps of
magnetic-field directions. We also show that the SIGs are relatively robust for tracing magnetic
fields while the low spacial frequencies of the synchrotron image are removed. This makes the SIGs
applicable to tracing of magnetic fields using interferometric data with single dish measurement
absent. We discuss the synergy of using the SIGs together with synchrotron polarization in order
to find the actual direction of the magnetic field and quantify the effects of Faraday rotation as
well as with other ways of studying astrophysical magnetic fields. We test our method in the presence
of noise and the resolution effects. We stress the complementary nature of the studies using the
SIG technique and those employing the recently-introduced velocity gradient techniques that
traces the magnetic fields using spectroscopic data.
