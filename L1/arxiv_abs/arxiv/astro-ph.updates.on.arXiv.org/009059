In recent years, several Radio-Loud Narrow-Line Seyfert 1 galaxies (RL-NLS1) possessing relativistic
jets have come into attention with their detections in Very Large Baseline Array (VLBA) and in $\gamma$-ray
observations. In this paper we attempt to understand the nature of radio-jets in NLS1s by examining
the kpc-scale radio properties of, hitherto, the largest sample of 11101 optically-selected NLS1s.
Using 1.4 GHz FIRST, 1.4 GHz NVSS, 327 MHz WENNS, and 150 MHz TGSS catalogues we find the radio-detection
of merely $\sim$ 4.5 per cent (498/11101) NLS1s, with majority (407/498 $\sim$ 81.7 per cent) of
them being RL-NLS1s. Our study yields the highest number of RL-NLS1s and it can only be a lower limit.
We find that the most of our radio-detected NLS1s are compact ($<$ 30 kpc), exhibit both flat as well
as steep radio spectra, and are distributed across a wide range of 1.4 GHz radio luminosities (10$^{22}$
$-$ 10$^{27}$ W Hz$^{-1}$). At the high end of radio luminosity our NLS1s often tend to show blazar-like
properties such as compact radio-size, flat/inverted radio spectrum, radio variability and polarization.
The diagnostic plots based on the mid-IR colours suggest that the radio emission in NLS1s is mostly
powered by AGN, while nuclear star-formation may have a significant contribution in NLS1s of low
radio luminosities. The radio luminosity versus radio-size plot infers that the radio-jets in
NLS1s are either in the early evolutionary phase or possibly remain confined within the nuclear
region due to low-power or intermittent AGN activity.
