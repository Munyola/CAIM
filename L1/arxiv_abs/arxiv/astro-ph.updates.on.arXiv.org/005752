The fourth generation of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS-IV) has been in operation since July
2014. This paper describes the second data release from this phase, and the fourteenth from SDSS
overall (making this, Data Release Fourteen or DR14). This release makes public data taken by SDSS-IV
in its first two years of operation (July 2014-2016). Like all previous SDSS releases, DR14 is cumulative,
including the most recent reductions and calibrations of all data taken by SDSS since the first phase
began operations in 2000. New in DR14 is the first public release of data from the extended Baryon
Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS); the first data from the second phase of the Apache Point
Observatory (APO) Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE-2), including stellar parameter estimates
from an innovative data driven machine learning algorithm known as "The Cannon"; and almost twice
as many data cubes from the Mapping Nearby Galaxies at APO (MaNGA) survey as were in the previous release
(N = 2812 in total). This paper describes the location and format of the publicly available data from
SDSS-IV surveys. We provide references to the important technical papers describing how these
data have been taken (both targeting and observation details) and processed for scientific use.
The SDSS website (www.sdss.org) has been updated for this release, and provides links to data downloads,
as well as tutorials and examples of data use. SDSS-IV is planning to continue to collect astronomical
data until 2020, and will be followed by SDSS-V.
