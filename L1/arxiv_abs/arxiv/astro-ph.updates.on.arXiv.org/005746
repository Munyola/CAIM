The SPICA mid and far-infrared telescope will address fundamental issues in our understanding
of star formation and ISM physics in galaxies. A particular hallmark of SPICA is the outstanding
sensitivity enabled by the cold telescope, optimized detectors, and wide instantaneous bandwidth
throughout the mid- and far-infrared. The spectroscopic, imaging and polarimetric observations
that SPICA will be able to collect will help in clarifying the complex physical mechanisms which
underlie the baryon cycle of galaxies. In particular: (i) The access to a large suite of atomic and
ionic fine-structure lines for large samples of galaxies will shed light on the origin of the observed
spread in star formation rates within and between galaxies. (ii) Observations of HD rotational
lines (out to $\sim$10 Mpc) and fine structure lines such as [CII] 158 $\mu$m (out to $\sim$100 Mpc)
will clarify the main reservoirs of interstellar matter in galaxies, including phases where CO
does not emit. (iii) Far-infrared spectroscopy of dust and ice features will address uncertainties
in the mass and composition of dust in galaxies, and the contributions of supernovae to the interstellar
dust budget will be quantified by photometry and monitoring of supernova remnants in nearby galaxies.
(iv) Observations of far-infrared cooling lines such as [OI] 63 $\mu$m from star-forming molecular
clouds in our Galaxy will evaluate the importance of shocks to dissipate turbulent energy. The paper
concludes with requirements for the telescope and instruments, and recommendations for the observing
strategy.
