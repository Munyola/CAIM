The collapsar model has proved highly successful in explaining the properties of long gamma-ray
bursts (GRBs), with the most direct confirmation being the detection of a supernova (SN) coincident
with the majority of nearby long GRBs. Within this model, a long GRB is produced by the core-collapse
of a metal-poor, rapidly rotating, massive star. The detection of some long GRBs in metal-rich environments,
and more fundamentally the three examples of long GRBs (GRB 060505, GRB 060614 and GRB 11005A) with
no coincident SN detection down to very deep limits is in strong contention with theoretical expectations.
In this paper we present MUSE observations of the host galaxy of GRB 111005A, which is the most recent
and compelling example yet of a SN-less, long GRB. At z = 0.01326, GRB 111005A is the second closest
GRB ever detected, enabling the nearby environment to be studied at an unprecedented resolution
of 100 pc^2. From the analysis of the MUSE data cube, we find GRB 111005A to have occurred within a metal-rich
environment with little signs of ongoing star formation. Spectral analysis at the position of the
GRB indicates the presence of an old stellar population (age>=10 Myr), which limits the mass of the
GRB progenitor to M_(ZAMS) < 15 Msun, in direct conflict with the collapsar model. Our deep limits
on the presence of any SN emission combined with the environmental conditions at the position of
GRB 111005A necessitate the exploration of a novel long GRB formation mechanism that is unrelated
to massive stars.
