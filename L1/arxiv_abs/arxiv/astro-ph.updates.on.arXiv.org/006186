We use a simple framework to calculate the time evolution of the composition of the fallback material
onto a supermassive black hole arising from the tidal disruption of main sequence stars. We study
stars with masses between 0.8 and 3.0 $M_\odot$, at evolutionary stages from zero-age main sequence
to terminal-age main sequence, built using the Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics
code. We show that most stars develop enhancements in nitrogen ($^{14}$N) and depletions in carbon
($^{12}$C) and oxygen ($^{16}$O) over their lifetimes, and that these features are more pronounced
for higher mass stars. We find that, in an accretion-powered tidal disruption flare, these features
become prominent only after the time of peak of the fallback rate and appear at earlier times for stars
of increasing mass. We postulate that no severe compositional changes resulting from the fallback
material should be expected near peak for a wide range of stellar masses and, as such, are unable to
explain the extreme helium-to-hydrogen line ratios observed in some TDEs. On the other hand, the
resulting compositional changes could help explain the presence of nitrogen-rich features, which
are currently only detected after peak. When combined with the shape of the light curve, the time
evolution of the composition of the fallback material provides a clear method to help constrain
the nature of the disrupted star. This will enable a better characterization of the event by helping
break the degeneracy between the mass of the star and the mass of the black hole when fitting tidal
disruption light curves.
