Short-period exoplanets can have dayside surface temperatures surpassing 2000 K, hot enough to
vaporize rock and drive a thermal wind. Small enough planets evaporate completely. We construct
a radiative-hydrodynamic model of atmospheric escape from strongly irradiated, low-mass rocky
planets, accounting for dust-gas energy exchange in the wind. Rocky planets with masses < 0.1
M_Earth (less than twice the mass of Mercury) and surface temperatures > 2000 K are found to disintegrate
entirely in < 10 Gyr. When our model is applied to Kepler planet candidate KIC 12557548b --- which
is believed to be a rocky body evaporating at a rate of dM/dt > 0.1 M_Earth/Gyr --- our model yields
a present-day planet mass of < 0.02 M_Earth or less than about twice the mass of the Moon. Mass loss
rates depend so strongly on planet mass that bodies can reside on close-in orbits for Gyrs with initial
masses comparable to or less than that of Mercury, before entering a final short-lived phase of catastrophic
mass loss (which KIC 12557548b has entered). Because this catastrophic stage lasts only up to a few
percent of the planet's life, we estimate that for every object like KIC 12557548b, there should
be 10--100 close-in quiescent progenitors with sub-day periods whose hard-surface transits may
be detectable by Kepler if the progenitors are as large as their maximal, Mercury-like sizes (alternatively,
the progenitors could be smaller and more numerous). According to our calculations, KIC 12557548b
may have lost ~70% of its formation mass; today we may be observing its naked iron core.
