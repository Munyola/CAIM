We model the projected b/a-log a distributions of CANDELS main sequence star-forming galaxies,
where a (b) is the semi-major (semi-minor) axis of the galaxy images. We find that smaller-a galaxies
are rounder at all stellar masses M and redshifts, so we include a when analyzing b/a distributions.
Approximating intrinsic shapes of the galaxies as triaxial ellipsoids and assuming a multivariate
normal distribution of galaxy size and two shape parameters, we construct their intrinsic shape
and size distributions to obtain the fractions of prolate, oblate and spheroidal galaxies in each
redshift and mass bin. We find that galaxies tend to be prolate at low m and high redshifts, and oblate
at high M and low redshifts, qualitatively consistent with van der Wel et al. (2014), implying that
galaxies tend to evolve from prolate to oblate. These results are consistent with the predictions
from simulations (Ceverino et al. 2015, Tomassetti et al. 2016) that the transition from prolate
to oblate is caused by a compaction event at a characteristic mass range, making the galaxy center
baryon dominated. We give probabilities of a galaxy's being prolate, oblate or spheroidal as a function
of its M, redshift, projected b/a and a, which can facilitate target selections of galaxies with
specific shapes at hight redshifts. We also give predicted optical depths of galaxies, which are
qualitatively consistent with the expected correlation that AV should be higher for edge-on disk
galaxies in each log a slice at low redshift and high mass bins.
