In this paper, we investigate the evolution of intermediate mass (IMBHs) and stellar single (BH)
and black hole binaries (BHBs) orbiting a supermassive black hole (SMBH) with mass $10^8$ M$_\odot$.
We focused on the possibility that IMBHs and BHBs are delivered toward the SMBH by a population of
massive star clusters (GCs), either formed locally or orbitally segregated due to dynamical friction.
Our simulations show that the GC infall process leads to an efficient segregation of compact remnants
around the SMBH, that drives an increase of the extreme-mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs) events. We
estimated an EMRIs coalescence rate of $\Gamma= 1.33$ yr$^{-1}$ Gpc$^{-3}$ at redshift $z=0$,
comparable with the value expected for strongly mass-segregated galactic nuclei. We show that
if a few IMBHs are delivered from the infalling GCs around the SMBH, their subsequent evolution leads
to at least one IMBH-SMBH merger event per galaxy, finding a merger rate $\Gamma =0.03$ yr$^{-1}$
Gpc$^{-3}$. We also investigated how an IMBH affects the evolution of a BHB: either driving its disruption,
merging with one of the components (rate $\Gamma =2$ yr$^{-1}$ Gpc$^{-3}$), or boosting the BHB
coalescence (rate $\Gamma =9.5$ yr$^{-1}$ Gpc$^{-3}$). As a further side effect, the SMBH boosts
the coalescence of delivered BHB, leading to a coalescence rate $\Gamma =1$ yr$^{-1}$ Gpc$^{-3}$.
All our simulations were run with ARGdf, an extension of the ARCHAIN few-body integrator, that implements
a treatment for close encounters, post-Newtonian terms as well as the effect of an external potential
and dynamical friction.
