The HH 211 protostellar system is currently the youngest Class 0 system found with a rotating disk.
We have mapped it at ~ 50 au (0.16") resolution, studying its magnetic field morphology with dust
polarization in continuum at 232 and 358 GHz and its kinematics in C18O J=2-1 line. A flattened envelope
extending out to ~ 400 au from the disk is detected in the continuum and C18O, slightly misaligned
with the disk by 8 degree. It is spiraling inwards and expected to transform into a rotating disk at
~ 20 au, consistent with the disk radius estimated before. It appears to have a constant specific
angular momentum and itself can result from an inside-out collapse of an extended envelope detected
before in NH$_3$. In the flattened envelope, the polarization is mainly due to the magnetically
aligned dust grains, inferring a highly pinched poloidal field morphology there. Thus, both the
kinematics and field morphology support that the flattened envelope is a pseudodisk formed as the
infalling gas is guided by the field lines to the equatorial plane. Interestingly, a point symmetric
polarization distribution is also seen in the flattened envelope, implying that the pinched field
lines also have a significant toroidal component generated by the rotation. No significant loss
of angular momentum and thus no clear magnetic braking are detected in the flattened envelope around
the disk probably because of the large misalignment between the axis of the rotation and the axis
of the magnetic field in the cloud core.
