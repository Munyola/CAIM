Giant impacts (GIs) are common in the late stage of planet formation. The Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics
(SPH) method is widely used for simulating the outcome of such violent collisions, one prominent
example being the formation of the Moon. However, a decade of numerical studies in various areas
of computational astrophysics has shown that the standard formulation of SPH suffers from several
shortcomings such as artificial surface tension and its tendency to promptly damp turbulent motions
on scales much larger than the physical dissipation scale, both resulting in the suppression of
mixing. In order to quantify how severe these limitations are when modeling GIs we carried out a comparison
of simulations with identical initial conditions performed with the standard SPH as well as with
the novel Lagrangian Meshless Finite Mass (MFM) method in the GIZMO code. We confirm the lack of mixing
between the impactor and target when SPH is employed, while MFM is capable of driving vigorous sub-sonic
turbulence and leads to significant mixing between the two bodies. Modern SPH variants with artificial
conductivity, a different formulation of the hydro force or reduced artificial viscosity, do not
improve mixing as significantly. Angular momentum is conserved similarly well in both methods,
but MFM does not suffer from spurious transport induced by artificial viscosity, resulting in a
slightly higher angular momentum of the proto-lunar disk. Furthermore, SPH initial conditions
exhibit an unphysical density discontinuity at the core-mantle boundary which is easily removed
in MFM.
