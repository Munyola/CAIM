Using 57 Radio Active Galactic nuclei (RAGN) at 0.55 $\leq$ z $\leq$ 1.3 drawn from five fields of
the Observations of Redshift Evolution in Large Scale Environments (ORELSE) survey, we study the
effect of injection of energy from outbursts of RAGN on their spectroscopically-confirmed neighboring
galaxies (SNGs). We observe an elevated fraction of quenched neighbors (fq) within 500 kpc projected
radius of RAGN in the most dense local environments compared to those of non-RAGN control samples
matched to the RAGN population in colour, stellar mass, and local environment at 2$\sigma$ significance.
Further analyses show that there are offsets at similar significance between fqs of RAGN-SNGs and
the appropriate control samples for galaxies specifically in cluster environments and those hosted
by most massive cluster galaxies, which tentatively suggests that some negative feedback from
the RAGN is occurring in these dense environments. In addition, we find that the median radio power
of RAGN increases with increasing local overdensity, an effect which may lend itself to the quenching
of neighboring galaxies. Furthermore, we find that, in the highest local overdensities, the fq
of the sub-sample of lower stellar mass RAGN-SNGs is larger than that of the higher stellar mass RAGN-SNGs
sub-sample, which indicates a more pronounced effect from RAGN on lower stellar mass galaxies.
We propose a scenario in which RAGN residing within clusters might heat the intracluster medium
(ICM) affecting both in situ star formation and any inflowing gas that remains in their neighboring
galaxies.
