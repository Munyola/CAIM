We use the Spitzer Infrared Spectrograph (IRS) to study four infalling cluster galaxies with signatures
of on-going ram-pressure stripping. H$_2$ emission is detected in all four; two show extraplanar
H$_2$ emission. The emission usually has a warm (T $\sim$ $115 - 160$K) and a hot (T $\sim$ 400 $-$ 600K)
component that is approximately two orders of magnitude less massive than the warm one. The warm
component column densities are typically $10^{19} - 10^{20}$ cm$^{-2}$ with masses of $10^6 - 10^8
M_\odot$. The warm H$_2$ is anomalously bright compared with normal star-forming galaxies and
therefore may be excited by ram-pressure. In the case of CGCG 97-073, the H$_2$ is offset from the
majority of star formation along the direction of the galaxy's motion in the cluster, suggesting
it is forming in the ram-pressure wake of the galaxy. Another galaxy, NGC 4522, exhibits a warm H$_2$
tail approximately 4 kpc in length. These results support the hypothesis that H$_2$ within these
galaxies is shock-heated from the interaction with the intracluster medium. Stripping of dust
is also a common feature of the galaxies. For NGC 4522, where the distribution of dust at 8 $\mu$m is
well resolved, knots and ripples demonstrate the turbulent nature of the stripping process. The
H$\alpha$ and 24 $\mu$m luminosities show that most of the galaxies have star formation rates comparable
to similar mass counterparts in the field. Finally, we suggest a possible evolutionary sequence
primarily related to the strength of ram-pressure a galaxy experiences to explain the varied results
observed in our sample.
