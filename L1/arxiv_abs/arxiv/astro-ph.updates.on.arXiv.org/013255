Martin & Lubow (2017) found that an initially sufficiently misaligned low mass protoplanetary
disc around an eccentric binary undergoes damped nodal oscillations of tilt angle and longitude
of ascending node. Dissipation causes evolution towards polar alignment in which the disc lies
perpendicular to the binary orbital plane with angular momentum aligned to the eccentricity vector
of the binary. We use hydrodynamic simulations and analytic methods to investigate how the mass
of the disc affects this process. A more massive disc settles into a generalised polar state at somewhat
lower levels of misalignment with respect to the binary orbital plane, in agreement with the analytic
model. We obtain analytic criteria for polar alignment of a circumbinary ring with mass that broadly
agree with the simulation results. The required level of initial misalignment angle for evolution
to the polar state increases with disc-to-binary angular momentum, $j_0$, for the moderate levels
adopted in the simulations. The analytic model suggests than this angle decreases at higher $j_0$.
Very broad misaligned discs undergo breaking, but the inner regions at least may still evolve to
a polar state. The long term evolution of the disc depends on the evolution of the binary eccentricity
that we find tends to decrease. Although the range of parameters required for polar alignment decreases
somewhat with disc mass, such alignment appears possible for a broad set of initial conditions expected
in protostellar circumbinary discs.
