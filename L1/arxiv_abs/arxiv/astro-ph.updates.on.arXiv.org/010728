The formyl radical HCO has been proposed as the basic precursor of many complex organic molecules
such as methanol (CH$_3$OH) or glycolaldehyde (CH$_2$OHCHO). Using ALMA, we have mapped, for the
first time at high angular resolution ($\sim$1$^{\prime\prime}$, $\sim$140 au), HCO towards
the Solar-type protostellar binary IRAS 16293$-$2422, where numerous complex organic molecules
have been previously detected. We also detected several lines of the chemically related species
H$_2$CO, CH$_3$OH and CH$_2$OHCHO. The observations revealed compact HCO emission arising from
the two protostars. The line profiles also show redshifted absorption produced by foreground material
of the circumbinary envelope that is infalling towards the protostars. Additionally, IRAM 30m
single-dish data revealed a more extended HCO component arising from the common circumbinary envelope.
The comparison between the observed molecular abundances and our chemical model suggests that
whereas the extended HCO from the envelope can be formed via gas-phase reactions during the cold
collapse of the natal core, the HCO in the hot corinos surrounding the protostars is predominantly
formed by the hydrogenation of CO on the surface of dust grains and subsequent thermal desorption
during the protostellar phase. The derived abundance of HCO in the dust grains is high enough to produce
efficiently more complex species such as H$_2$CO, CH$_3$OH, and CH$_2$OHCHO by surface chemistry.
We found that the main formation route of CH$_2$OHCHO is the reaction between HCO and CH$_2$OH.
