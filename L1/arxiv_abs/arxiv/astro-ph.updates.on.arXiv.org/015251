Spiral structure in disk galaxies could arise from transient modes that create conditions conducive
for their regeneration; this is the proposal of Sellwood and Carlberg, based on simulations of stellar
disks. The linear response of an axisymmetric stellar disk, to an adiabatic non-axisymmetric transient
mode, gives a final distribution function (DF) that is equal to the initial DF everywhere in phase
space, except at the Lindblad and corotation resonances where the final DF is singular. We use the
nonlinear theory of adiabatic capture into resonance to resolve the singularities and calculate
the finite changes in the DF. These take the form of axisymmetric "scars" concentrated around resonances,
whose DFs have simple general forms. Global changes in the physical properties are explored for
a cool Mestel disk: we calculate the DFs of scars, and estimate the changes in the disk angular momentum,
surface density and orbital frequencies leading to shifts of resonances. Resonant torques between
disk stars and any new linear non-axisymmetric mode are suppressed within a scar, as is epicyclic
heating. Since all the resonances of a linear mode with the same angular wavenumber and pattern speed
as its precursor lie inside the scars of the precursor, it suffers less damping. Hence, scars filter
the spectrum of noise-generated modes, promoting the renewal of a few select modes. Relic scars
sustained by a galaxy disk, due to past tidal interaction with a passing companion, may still be active
enablers of non-axisymmetric modes, such as the two-armed "grand design" spiral patterns.
