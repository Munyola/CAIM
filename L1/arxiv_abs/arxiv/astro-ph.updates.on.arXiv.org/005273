We show that the mass of a dark matter halo can be inferred from the dynamical status of its satellite
galaxies. Using 9 dark-matter simulations of halos like the Milky Way (MW), we find that the present-day
substructures in each halo follow a characteristic distribution in the phase space of orbital binding
energy and angular momentum, and that this distribution is similar from halo to halo but has an intrinsic
dependence on the halo formation history. We construct this distribution directly from the simulations
for a specific halo and extend the result to halos of similar formation history but different masses
by scaling. The mass of an observed halo can then be estimated by maximizing the likelihood in comparing
the measured kinematic parameters of its satellite galaxies with these distributions. We test
the validity and accuracy of this method with mock samples taken from the simulations. Using the
positions, radial velocities, and proper motions of 9 tracers and assuming observational uncertainties
comparable to those of MW satellite galaxies, we find that the halo mass can be recovered to within
$\sim$40%. The accuracy can be improved to within $\sim$25% if 30 tracers are used. However, the
dependence of the phase-space distribution on the halo formation history sets a minimum uncertainty
of $\sim$20% that cannot be reduced by using more tracers. We believe that this minimum uncertainty
also applies to any mass determination for a halo when the phase space information of other kinematic
tracers is used.
