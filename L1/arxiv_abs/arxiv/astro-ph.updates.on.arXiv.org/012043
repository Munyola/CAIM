We investigate the interactions of energetic hadronic particles with the media in outflows from
star-forming protogalaxies. These particles undergo pion-producing interactions which can
drive a heating effect in the outflow, while those advected by the outflow also transport energy
beyond the galaxy, heating the circumgalactic medium. We investigate how this process evolves
over the length of the outflow and calculate the corresponding heating rates in advection-dominated
and diffusion-dominated cosmic ray transport regimes. In a purely diffusive transport scenario,
we find the peak heating rate reaches $10^{-26}\;\! {\rm erg~cm}^{-3}\;\! {\rm s}^{-1}$ at the
base of the outflow where the wind is driven by core-collapse supernovae at an event rate of 0.1 $\text{yr}^{-1}$,
but does not extend beyond 2 kpc. In the advection limit, the peak heating rate is reduced to $10^{-28}\;\!
{\rm erg~cm}^{-3}\;\! {\rm s}^{-1}$, but its extent can reach to tens of kpc. Around 10% of the cosmic
rays injected into the system can escape by advection with the outflow wind, while the remaining
cosmic rays deliver an important interstellar heating effect. We apply our cosmic ray heating model
to the recent observation of the high-redshift galaxy MACS1149-JD1 and show that it could account
for the quenching of a previous starburst inferred from spectroscopic observations. Re-ignition
of later star-formation may be caused by the presence of filamentary circumgalactic inflows which
are reinstated after cosmic ray heating has subsided.
