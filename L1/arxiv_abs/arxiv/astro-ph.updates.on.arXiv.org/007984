A new sample of 204 low-mass black holes (LMBHs) in active galactic nuclei (AGNs) is presented with
black hole masses in the range of (1-20) * 10^5 M_sun. The AGNs are selected from a systematic search
among galaxies in the Seventh Data Release (DR 7) of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), and careful
analyses of their optical spectra and precise measurement of spectral parameters. Combining them
with our previous sample selected from the SDSS DR 4 makes it the largest LMBH sample so far, totaling
over 500 objects. Some of the statistical properties of the combined LMBH AGN sample are briefly
discussed, in the context of exploring the low-mass end of the AGN population. Their X-ray luminosities
follow the extension of the previously known correlation with the [O III] luminosity. The effective
optical-to-X-ray spectral indices \alpha_OX, albeit with a large scatter, are broadly consistent
with the extension of the relation with the near-UV luminosity L_2500\AA. Interestingly, a correlation
of \alpha_OX with black hole mass is also found in the sense that \alpha_OX is statistically flatter
(stronger X-ray relative to optical) for lower black hole mass. Only 26 objects, mostly radio loud,
were detected in radio at 20 cm in the FIRST survey, giving a radio loud fraction of 4%. The host galaxies
of LMBHs have stellar masses in the range of 10^8.8-10^12.4 M_sun and optical colors typical of Sbc
spirals. They are dominated by young stellar populations that seem to have undergone a continuous
star formation history.
