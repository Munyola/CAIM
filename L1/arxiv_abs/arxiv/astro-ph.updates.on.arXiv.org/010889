Wide-field optical surveys have begun to uncover large samples of fast (t_rise < 5d), luminous (M_peak
< -18), blue transients. While commonly attributed to the breakout of a supernova shock into a dense
wind, the great distances to the transients of this class found so far have hampered detailed investigation
of their properties. We present photometry and spectroscopy from a comprehensive worldwide campaign
to observe AT2018cow (ATLAS18qqn), the first fast-luminous optical transient to be found in real
time at low redshift. Our first spectra (<2 days after discovery) are entirely featureless. A very
broad absorption feature suggestive of near-relativistic velocities develops between 3-8 days,
then disappears. Broad emission features of H and He develop after >10 days. The spectrum remains
extremely hot throughout its evolution, and the photospheric radius contracts with time (receding
below R<10^14 cm after 1 month). This behaviour does not match that of any known supernova, although
a relativistic jet within a fallback supernova could explain some of the observed features. Alternatively,
the transient could originate from the disruption of a star by an intermediate-mass black hole,
although this would require long-lasting emission of highly super-Eddington thermal radiation.
In either case, AT2018cow suggests that the population of fast luminous transients represents
a new class of astrophysical event. Intensive follow-up of this event in its late phases, and of any
future events found at comparable distance, will be essential to better constrain their origins.
