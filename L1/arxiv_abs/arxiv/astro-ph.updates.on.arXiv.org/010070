High energy radiation from nonthermal particles accelerated in relativistic magnetic reconnection
is thought to be important in many astrophysical systems, ranging from blazar jets and black hole
accretion disk coronae to pulsars and magnetar flares. The presence of a substantial density of
high energy photons ($>$MeV) in these systems can make two-photon pair production ($\gamma\gamma\to
e^-e^+$) an additional source of plasma particles and can affect the radiative properties of these
objects. We present the results of novel particle-in-cell simulations that track both the radiated
synchrotron photons and the created pairs, with which we study the evolution of a two-dimensional
reconnecting current sheet in pair plasma. Synchrotron radiation from accelerated particles
in the current sheet produces hot secondary pairs in the upstream which are later advected into the
current sheet where they are reaccelerated and produce more photons. In the optically thin regime,
when most of the radiation is leaving the upstream unaffected, this process is self-regulating
and depends only on the background magnetic field and the optical depth of photons to pair production.
The extra plasma loading also affects the properties of reconnection. We study how the inflow of
the secondary plasma, with multiplicities up to several hundred, reduces the effective magnetization
of the plasma, suppressing the acceleration and thus decreasing the high energy photon spectrum
cutoff. This offers an explanation for the weak dependence of the observed gamma-ray cutoff in pulsars
on the magnetic field at the light cylinder.
