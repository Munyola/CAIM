We search for global rotation of the intracluster medium (ICM) in the galaxy cluster Abell 2107,
where previous studies have detected rotational motion in the member galaxies with a high significance
level. By fitting the centroid of the iron $K_{\alpha}$ line complex at 6.7--6.9 keV rest frame in
{\sl Chandra} ACIS-I spectra, we identify the possible rotation axis with the line that maximizes
the difference between the emission-weighted spectroscopic redshift measured in the two halves
defined by the line itself. Then, we measure the emission-weighted redshift in linear regions parallel
to the preferred rotation axis, and find a significant gradient as a function of the projected distance
from the rotation axis, compatible with a rotation pattern with maximum tangential velocity ${\tt
v}_{\rm max}=1380\pm 600$ km/s at a radius $\lambda_0\sim 160$ kpc. This result, if interpreted
in the framework of hydrostatic equilibrium, as suggested by the regular morphology of Abell 2107,
would imply a large mass correction of the order of $\Delta M = (6 \pm 4)\times 10^{13} M_\odot$ at
$\sim 160$ kpc, which is incompatible with the cluster morphology itself. A more conservative interpretation
may be provided by an unnoticed off-center, head-on collision between two comparable halos. Our
analysis confirms the peculiar dynamical nature of the otherwise regular cluster Abell 2107, but
is not able to resolve the rotation vs merger scenario, a science case that can be addressed by the
next-generation X-ray facilities carrying X-ray bolometers onboard.
