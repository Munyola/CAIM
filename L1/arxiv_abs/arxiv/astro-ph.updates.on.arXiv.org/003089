Using the semi-analytic models based on the Millennium simulation, we trace back the evolution
of the luminosity function of galaxies residing in progenitors of groups classified by the magnitude
gap at redshift zero. We determine the luminosity function of galaxies within $ 0.25R_{200}, 0.5R_{200}
$, and $R_{200}$ for galaxy groups/clusters. The bright end of the galaxy luminosity function of
fossil groups shows a significant evolution with redshift, with changes in $M^*$ by $\sim$ 1-2 mag
between $z\sim0.5$ and $z=0$ (for the central $0.5R_{200}$), suggesting that the formation of
the most luminous galaxy in a fossil group has had a significant impact on the $M^{*}$ galaxies e.g.
it is formed as a result of multiple mergers of the $ M^{*} $ galaxies within the last $\sim5$ Gyr. In
contrast, the slope of the faint end, $\alpha$, of the luminosity function shows no considerable
redshift evolution and the number of dwarf galaxies in the fossil groups exhibits no evolution,
unlike in non-fossil groups where it grows by $\sim25-42\%$ towards low redshifts. In agreement
with previous studies, we also show that fossil groups accumulate most of their halo mass earlier
than non-fossil groups. Selecting the fossils at a redshift of 1 and tracing them to a redshift 0,
we show that $80\%$ of the fossil groups ($10^{13} M_{\odot} h^{-1}<M_{200}<10^{14} M_{\odot}
h^{-1}$) will lose their large magnitude gaps. However, about $40\%$ of fossil clusters ($M_{200}>10^{14}
M_{\odot} h^{-1}$) will retain their large gaps.
