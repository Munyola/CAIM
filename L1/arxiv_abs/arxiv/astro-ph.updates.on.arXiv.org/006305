Understanding the origin of strong galactic outflows and the suppression of star formation in dwarf
galaxies is a key problem in galaxy formation. Using a set of radiation-hydrodynamic simulations
of an isolated dwarf galaxy embedded in a $10^{10}\,M_\odot$ halo, we show that the momentum transferred
from resonantly scattered Lyman-$\alpha$ (Lya) photons is an important source of stellar feedback
which can shape the evolution of galaxies. We find that Lya feedback suppresses star formation by
a factor of two in metal-poor galaxies by regulating the dynamics of star-forming clouds before
the onset of supernova explosions (SNe). This is possible because each Lya photon resonantly scatters
and imparts 10-300 times greater momentum than in the single scattering limit. Consequently, the
number of star clusters predicted in the simulations is reduced by a factor of $\sim 5$, compared
to the model without the early feedback. More importantly, we find that galactic outflows become
weaker in the presence of strong Lya radiation feedback, as star formation and associated SNe become
less bursty. We also examine a model in which radiation field is arbitrarily enhanced by a factor
of up to 10, and reach the same conclusion. The typical mass loading factors in our metal-poor dwarf
system are estimated to be $\sim5-10$ near the mid plane, while it is reduced to $\sim1$ at larger
radii. Finally, we find that the escape of ionizing radiation and hence the reionization history
of the Universe is unlikely to be strongly affected by Lya feedback.
