We study X-ray spectra of four Narrow Line Seyfert 1 galaxies (NLS1s), Mrk 110, SWIFT J2127.4+5654,
IGR J16185-5928, and WKK 4438, using Suzaku and NuSTAR data. The spectra of the four sources are reproduced
with a model consisting of a cutoff power law component, a reflection component, and a soft excess
component. The photon indices of all the sources are found to be ~ 2. The cutoff energies are constrained
to be ~ 40 keV for Mrk 110, SWIFT J2127.4+5654, and WKK 4438, whereas a lower limit of 155 keV is obtained
for IGR J16185-5928. We find that the NLS1s in our sample have systematically softer spectra and
lower cutoff energies than Broad Line Seyfert 1 galaxies reported in the literature. We also perform
spectral fittings with a model in which the cutoff power law is replaced with the thermal Comptonization
model in order to directly obtain the electron temperature of the corona (kTe). The fits give kTe
~ 10-20 keV for Mrk 110 and SWIFT J2127.4+5654, and lower limits of kTe > 18 keV for IGR J16185-5928
and kTe > 5 keV for WKK 4438. We divide the NuSTAR data of SWIFT J2127.4+5654 into three periods according
to the flux. The spectral fits in the three periods hint that kTe is the lower in the higher flux period.
The results of the four sources suggest a possible anti-correlation between kTe and the ratio of
the luminosity of Compton up-scattered photons to the Eddington luminosity. The anti-correlation
can be explained by a simple model in which electrons in the corona are cooled and heated through inverse
Compton scattering and Coulomb collisions with protons, respectively.
