We confirm, quantify, and provide a table of the coherent velocity substructure of the Milky Way
disk within 2 kpc of the Sun towards the Galactic anticenter, with 0.2 kpc resolution. We use the radial
velocities of ~340,000 F-type stars obtained with the Guoshoujing Telescope (also known as the
Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope, LAMOST), and proper motions derived
from the PPMXL catalog. The PPMXL proper motions have been corrected to remove systematic errors
by subtracting the average proper motions of galaxies and QSOs that have been confirmed in the LAMOST
spectroscopic survey, and that are within 2.5 degrees of the star's position. We provide the resulting
table of systematic offsets derived from the PPMXL proper motion measurements of extragalactic
objects identified in the LAMOST spectroscopic survey. Using the corrected phase- space stellar
sample, we find statistically significant deviations in the bulk disk velocity of 20 km/s or more
in the three dimensional velocities of Galactic disk stars. The bulk velocity varies significantly
over length scales of half a kpc or less. The rotation velocity of the disk increases by 20 km/s from
the Sun's position to 1.5 kpc outside the solar circle. Disk stars in the second quadrant, within
1 kpc of the Sun, are moving radially towards the Galactic center and vertically towards a point a
few tenths of a kpc above the Galactic plane; looking down on the disk, the stars appear to move in a
circular streaming motion with a radius of order 1 kpc.
