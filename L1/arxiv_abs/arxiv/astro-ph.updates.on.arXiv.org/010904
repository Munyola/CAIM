Massive, merging galaxy clusters often host giant, diffuse radio sources that arise from shocks
and turbulence; hence, radio observations can be useful for determining the merger state of a cluster.
In preparation for a larger study, we selected three clusters -- Abell 1319, Abell 1314, and RXC J1501.3+4220
(Z7215) -- making use of the new LOFAR Two-Metre Sky Survey (LoTSS) at 120-168 MHz, and together with
archival data, show that these clusters appear to be in pre-merging, merging, and post-merging
states, respectively. We argue that Abell 1319 is likely in its pre-merging phase, where three separate
cluster components are about to merge. There are no radio halos nor radio relics detected in this
system. Abell 1314 is a highly-disturbed, low-mass cluster which is likely in the process of merging.
This low-mass system does not show a radio halo, however, we argue that the merger activates mechanisms
that cause electron re-acceleration in the large 800 kpc radio tail associated with IC~711. In the
cluster Z7215 we discover diffuse radio emission at the cluster center, and we classify this emission
as a radio halo, although it is dimmer and smaller than expected by the radio halo power versus cluster
mass correlation. We suggest that the disturbed cluster Z7215 is in its post-merging phase. Systematic
studies of this kind over a larger sample of clusters observed with LoTSS will help constrain the
time scales involved in turbulent re-acceleration and the subsequent energy losses of the underlying
electrons.
