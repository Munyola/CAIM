By distinguishing the main arc Fraternite from the minor arcs Egalite (2,1), Liberte, Courage,
the restricted three-body system is extended to a non-conservative restricted four-body system
with the central body Neptune S, the primary body Galatea X, a minor body Fraternite F, and a test body
s. Through the equations of motion, it is shown that the locations where the force is null along the
orbit of s correspond to the locations of Egalite (2,1), Liberte, and Courage. Even if all the arcs
were captured by CER sites initially, the orbits over the CERs would be unstable for the minor arcs
due to the disturbing force of Fraternite, allowing them to be relocated to the null points. On the
other hand, the minor arcs do not have the mass to destabilize Fraternite from its CER site, which
is enlarged from 8.37 degrees to 9.7 degrees thus accounting for the Fraternite's span. In this restricted
four-body system, s is under the effects of the potentials of X and F. The potential of X drives a long
period harmonic pendulum oscillation of $(n+1)\theta_{s}$ of the test body s with respect to $n\theta_{x}$
of X centered over a local CER site with period $T=1,000\,d$, while the potential of F drives an even
longer period singular pendulum oscillation centered over Fraternite with period $T_{f}=40,000\,d$.
It is shown that the null points are the turning points of the harmonic CER oscillation, and the non-conservative
nature of this system could account for the time varying intensity, configuration, and disappearance
of the minor arcs.
