The observational diversity displayed by various Type IIn supernovae (SNe IIn) is explored and
quantified. In doing so, a more coherent picture ascribing the variety of observed SNe IIn types
to particular progenitor scenarios is sought. Carnegie Supernova Project (CSP) optical and near-infrared
light curves and visual-wavelength spectroscopy of the Type IIn SNe 2005kj, 2006aa, 2006bo, 2006qq,
and 2008fq are presented. Combined with previously published observations of the Type IIn SNe 2005ip
and 2006jd, the full CSP sample is used to derive physical parameters that describe the nature of
the interaction between the expanding SN ejecta and the circumstellar material (CSM). For each
SN of our sample, we find counterparts, identifying objects similar to SNe 1994W (SN 2006bo), 1998S
(SN 2008fq), and 1988Z (SN 2006qq). We present the unprecedented initial $u$-band plateau of SN
2006aa, and its peculiar late-time luminosity and temperature evolution. For each SN, mass-loss
rates of 10$^{-4}-10^{-2}$ $M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ are derived, assuming the CSM was formed by steady
winds. Typically wind velocities of a few hundred km s$^{-1}$ are also computed. The CSP SN IIn sample
seems to be divided into subcategories rather than to have exhibited a continuum of observational
properties. The wind and mass-loss parameters would favor a luminous blue variable progenitor
scenario. However the assumptions made to derive those parameters strongly influence the results,
and therefore, other progenitor channels behind SNe IIn cannot be excluded at this time.
