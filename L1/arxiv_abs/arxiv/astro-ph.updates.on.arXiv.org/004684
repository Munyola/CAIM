Previous studies have shown that the incidence rate of intervening strong MgII absorbers towards
GRBs were a factor of 2 - 4 higher than towards quasars. Exploring the similar sized and uniformly
selected legacy data sets XQ-100 and XSGRB, each consisting of 100 quasar and 81 GRB afterglow spectra
obtained with a single instrument (VLT/X-shooter), we demonstrate that there is no disagreement
in the number density of strong MgII absorbers with rest-frame equivalent widths $W_r^{2796} >$
1 {\AA} towards GRBs and quasars in the redshift range 0.1 < z < 5. With large and similar sample sizes,
and path length coverages of $\Delta$z = 57.8 and 254.4 for GRBs and quasars, respectively, the incidences
of intervening absorbers are consistent within 1 sigma uncertainty levels at all redshifts. For
absorbers at z < 2.3 the incidence towards GRBs is a factor of 1.5$\pm$0.4 higher than the expected
number of strong MgII absorbers in SDSS quasar spectra, while for quasar absorbers observed with
X-shooter we find an excess factor of 1.4$\pm$0.2 relative to SDSS quasars. Conversely, the incidence
rates agree at all redshifts with reported high spectral resolution quasar data, and no excess is
found. The only remaining discrepancy in incidences is between SDSS MgII catalogues and high spectral
resolution studies. The rest-frame equivalent width distribution also agrees to within 1 sigma
uncertainty levels between the GRB and quasar samples. Intervening strong MgII absorbers towards
GRBs are therefore neither unusually frequent, nor unusually strong.
