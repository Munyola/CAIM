We present the Chasing the Identification of ASCA Galactic Objects (ChIcAGO) survey, which is designed
to identify the unknown X-ray sources discovered during the ASCA Galactic Plane Survey (AGPS).
Little is known about most of the AGPS sources, especially those that emit primarily in hard X-rays
(2-10 keV) within the F_x ~ 10^-13 to 10^-11 erg cm^-2 s^-1 X-ray flux range. In ChIcAGO, the subarcsecond
localization capabilities of Chandra have been combined with a detailed multi-wavelength follow-up
program, with the ultimate goal of classifying the >100 unidentified sources in the AGPS. Overall
to date, 93 unidentified AGPS sources have been observed with Chandra as part of the ChIcAGO survey.
A total of 253 X-ray point sources have been detected in these Chandra observations within 3' of the
original ASCA positions. We have identified infrared and optical counterparts to the majority
of these sources, using both new observations and catalogs from existing Galactic plane surveys.
X-ray and infrared population statistics for the X-ray point sources detected in the Chandra observations
reveal that the primary populations of Galactic plane X-ray sources that emit in the F_x ~ 10^-13
to 10^-11 erg cm^-2 s^-1 flux range are active stellar coronae, massive stars with strong stellar
winds that are possibly in colliding-wind binaries, X-ray binaries, and magnetars. There is also
a fifth population that is still unidentified but, based on its X-ray and infrared properties, likely
comprise partly of Galactic sources and partly of active galactic nuclei.
