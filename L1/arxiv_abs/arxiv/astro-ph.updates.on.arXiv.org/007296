We conduct for the first time a theoretical investigation of the mid-infrared spectral energy distribution
(SED) produced by dust heated by an active galactic nucleus (AGN) and an extreme starburst. These
models employ an integrated modeling approach using photoionization and stellar population synthesis
models in which both the line and emergent continuum is predicted from gas exposed to the ionizing
radiation from a young starburst and an AGN. In this work, we focus on the infrared colors from the
{\it Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer}, predicting the dependence of the colors on the input
radiation field, the ISM conditions, the obscuring column, and the metallicity. We find that an
extreme starburst can mimic an AGN in two band mid-infrared color cuts employed in the literature.
However, the three band color cuts employed in the literature require starbursts with extremely
high ionization parameters or gas densities . We show that the extreme mid-IR colors seen in some
blue compact dwarf galaxies are not due to metallicity but rather a combination of high ionization
parameters and high column densities. Based on our theoretical calculations, we present a theoretical
mid-infrared color cut that will exclude even the most extreme starburst that we have modeled in
this work. The theoretical AGN demarcation region presented here can be used to identify elusive
AGN candidates for future follow-up studies with the {\it James Webb Space Telescope (JWST)}. The
full suite of simulated SEDs are available online.
