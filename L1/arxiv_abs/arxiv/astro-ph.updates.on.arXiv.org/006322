The uniformity of the intra-cluster medium (ICM) enrichment level in the outskirts of nearby galaxy
clusters suggests that chemical elements were deposited and widely spread into the intergalactic
medium before the cluster formation. This observational evidence is supported by numerical findings
from cosmological hydrodynamical simulations, as presented in Biffi et al. (2017), including
the effect of thermal feedback from active galactic nuclei. Here, we further investigate this picture,
by tracing back in time the spatial origin and metallicity evolution of the gas residing at z=0 in
the outskirts of simulated galaxy clusters. In these regions, we find a large distribution of iron
abundances, including a component of highly-enriched gas, already present at z=2. At z>1, the gas
in the present-day outskirts was distributed over tens of virial radii from the the main cluster
and had been already enriched within high-redshift haloes. At z=2, about 40% of the most Fe-rich
gas at z=0 was not residing in any halo more massive than 1e11 Msun/h in the region and yet its average
iron abundance was already 0.4, w.r.t. the solar value by Anders & Grevesse (1989). This confirms
that the in situ enrichment of the ICM in the outskirts of present-day clusters does not play a significant
role, and its uniform metal abundance is rather the consequence of the accretion of both low-metallicity
and pre-enriched (at z>2) gas, from the diffuse component and through merging substructures. These
findings do not depend on the mass of the cluster nor on its core properties.
