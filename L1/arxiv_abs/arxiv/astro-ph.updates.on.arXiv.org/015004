Terrestrial planets have been found orbiting Sun-like stars with extremely short periods --- some
as short as 4 hours. These ``ultra-short-period planets'' or ''hot Earths'' are so strongly irradiated
that any initial H/He atmosphere has probably been lost to photoevaporation. As such, the sample
of hot Earths may give us a glimpse at the rocky cores that are often enshrouded by thick H/He envelopes
on wider-orbiting planets. However, the mass and radius measurements of hot Earths have been derived
from a hodgepodge of different modeling approaches, and include several cases of contradictory
results. Here, we perform a homogeneous analysis of the complete sample of 11 known hot Earths with
an insolation exceeding 650 times that of the Earth. We combine all available data for each planet,
incorporate parallax information from {\it Gaia} to improve the stellar and planetary parameters,
and use Gaussian Process regression to account for correlated noise in the radial-velocity data.
The homogeneous analysis leads to a smaller dispersion in the apparent composition of hot Earths,
although there does still appear to be some intrinsic dispersion. Most of the planets are consistent
with an Earth-like composition (35\% iron and 65\% rock), but two planets (K2-141b and K2-229b)
show evidence for a higher iron fraction, and one planet (55\,Cnc\,e) has either a very low iron fraction
or an envelope of low-density volatiles. All of the planets are less massive than 8\,$M_\oplus$,
despite the selection bias towards more massive planets, suggesting that 8\,$M_\oplus$ is the
critical mass for runaway accretion.
