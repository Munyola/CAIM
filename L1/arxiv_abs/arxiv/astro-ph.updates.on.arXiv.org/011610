1I/'Oumuamua is the first detected interstellar interloper. We test the hypothesis that it is representative
of a background population of exo-Oort cloud objects ejected under the effect of post-main sequence
mass loss and stellar encounters. We do this by comparing the cumulative number density of interstellar
objects inferred from the detection of 1I/'Oumuamua to that expected from these two clearing processes.
We consider the 0.08--8 M$_{\odot}$ mass range, take into account the dependencies with stellar
mass, Galactocentric distance, and evolutionary state, and consider a wide range of size distributions
for the ejected objects. Our conclusion is that 1I/'Oumuamua is likely not representative of this
background population, even though there are large uncertainties in the masses and size distributions
of the exo-Oort Clouds. We discuss whether the number density of free-floating, planetary-mass
objects derived from gravitational microlensing surveys could be used as a discriminating measurement
regarding 1I/'Oumuamua's origin (given their potential common origin). We conclude that this
is challenged by the mass limitation of the surveys and the resulting uncertainty of the mass distribution
of the free floaters. The detection of interlopers may be one of the few observational constraints
of the small end of this population, with the caveat that, as we conclude here and in Moro-Mart\'{\i}n
(2018), in the case of 1I/'Oumuamua, it might not be appropriate to assume this object is representative
of an isotropic background population, which makes the derivation of a number density very challenging.
