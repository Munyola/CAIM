Theoretically, inflowing filaments of gas are one of the main causes of growth for a galaxy. Nonetheless,
observationally, probing ongoing gas accretion is challenging. As part of the Gas Stripping Phenomena
in galaxies with MUSE (GASP) program, we present the analysis of a spiral galaxy at z=0.04648 whose
characteristics indeed are consistent with a scenario in which gas accretion plays a major role.
The most salient indirect parts of evidence that support this picture are: 1) The galaxy is isolated,
its position rules out the mechanisms expected in dense environments. 2) It shows a pronounced lopsidedness
extending toward West. According to the spatially resolved star formation history, this component
was formed <6x10^8 yr ago. 3) It has many large and elongated HII regions that are indication of a fragmentation
due to disk instability. 4) The stellar and gas kinematics are quite symmetric around the same axis,
but in the gas the locus of negative velocities shows a convexity toward East, as if new gas has been
infalling with different orientation and velocity. 5) The metallicity distribution is inhomogeneous
and shows exceptionally steep gradients from the center toward the outskirts, especially in the
South-West side. 6) The luminosity weighted age is generally low (~8 Gyr) and particularly low (<7
Gyr) along a trail crossing the galaxy from South-West toward North. It might trace the path of the
accreted gas. These findings point to an inflow of gas probably proceeding from the South-West side
of the galaxy.
