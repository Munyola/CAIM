We present VLA HI observations of JO206, a prototypical ram-pressure stripped galaxy in the GASP
sample. This massive galaxy (M$_{\ast} =$ 8.5 $\times$ 10$^{10}$ M$_{\odot}$) is located at a redshift
of $z =$ 0.0513, near the centre of the low-mass galaxy cluster, IIZw108 ($\sigma \sim575$ km/s).
JO206 is characterised by a long tail ($\geq$90 kpc) of ionised gas stripped away by ram-pressure.
We find a similarly long HI tail in the same direction as the ionised gas tail and measure a total HI
mass of $3.2 \times 10^{9}$ M$_{\odot}$. This is about half the expected HI mass given the stellar
mass and surface density of JO206. A total of $1.8 \times 10^{9}$ M$_{\odot}$ (60%) of the detected
HI is in the gas stripped tail. An analysis of the star formation rate shows that the galaxy is forming
more stars compared to galaxies with the same stellar and HI mass. On average we find a HI gas depletion
time of $\sim$0.5 Gyr which is about four times shorter than that of "normal" spiral galaxies. We
performed a spatially resolved analysis of the relation between star formation rate density and
gas density in the disc and tail of the galaxy at the resolution of our HI data. The star formation efficiency
of the disc is about 10 times higher than that of the tail at fixed HI surface densities. Both the inner
and outer parts of JO206 show an enhanced star formation compared to regions of similar HI surface
density in field galaxies. The enhanced star formation is due to ram-pressure stripping during
the galaxy's first infall into the cluster.
