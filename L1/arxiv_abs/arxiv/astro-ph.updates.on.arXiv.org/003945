The 21-cm signal from the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) is expected to be detected in the next few years,
either with existing instruments or by the upcoming SKA and HERA projects. In this context there
is a pressing need for publicly available high-quality templates covering a wide range of possible
signals. These are needed both for end-to-end simulations of the up-coming instruments, as well
as to develop signal analysis methods. In this work we present such a set of templates, publicly available,
for download at https://21ssd.obspm.fr/. The database contains 21-cm brightness temperature
lightcones at high and low resolution, and several derived statistical quantities for 45 models
spanning our choice of 3D parameter space. These data are the result of fully coupled radiative hydrodynamic
high resolution ($1024^3$) simulations performed with the LICORICE code. Both X-ray and Lyman
line transfer is performed to account for heating and Wouthuysen-Field coupling fluctuations.
We also present a first exploitation of the data using the power spectrum and the Pixel Distribution
Function (PDF) as functions of redshifts, computed from lightcone data. We analyse how these two
quantities behave when varying the model parameters while taking into account the thermal noise
expected of a typical SKA survey. Finally, we show that the power spectrum and the PDF have different
-- and to some extent complementary -- abilities to distinguish between different models. This
opens the door to formulating an optimal sampling of the parameter space, dependant on the chosen
diagnostics.
