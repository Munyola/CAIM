We compare the host galaxies of 902 supernovae, including SNe Ia, SNe II and SNe Ibc, which are selected
by cross-matching the Asiago Supernova Catalog with the SDSS Data Release 7. We further selected
213 galaxies by requiring the light fraction of spectral observations $>$15%, which could represent
well the global properties of the galaxies. Among them, 135 galaxies appear on the Baldwin-Phillips-Terlevich
diagram, which allows us to compare the hosts in terms of star-forming, AGNs (including composites,
LINERs and Seyfert 2s) and "Absorp" (their related emission-lines are weak or non-existence) galaxies.
The diagrams related to parameters D$_n$(4000), H$\delta_A$, stellar masses, SFRs and specific
SFRs for the SNe hosts show that almost all SNe II and most of SNe Ibc occur in SF galaxies, which have
a wide range of stellar mass and low D$_n$(4000). The SNe Ia hosts as SF galaxies follow similar trends.
A significant fraction of SNe Ia occurs in AGNs and Absorp galaxies, which are massive and have high
D$_n$(4000). The stellar population analysis from spectral synthesis fitting shows that the hosts
of SNe II have a younger stellar population than hosts of SNe Ia. These results are compared with those
of the 689 comparison galaxies where the SDSS fiber captures less than 15% of the total light. These
comparison galaxies appear biased towards higher 12+log(O/H) ($\sim$0.1dex) at a given stellar
mass. Therefore, we believe the aperture effect should be kept in mind when the properties of the
hosts for different types of SNe are discussed.
