The high-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations (HFQPOs) that punctuate the light curves of X-ray
binary systems present a window onto the intrinsic properties of stellar-mass black holes and hence
a testbed for general relativity. One explanation for these features is that relativistic distortion
of the accretion disc's differential rotation creates a trapping region in which inertial waves
(r-modes) might grow to observable amplitudes. Local analyses, however, predict that large-scale
magnetic fields push this trapping region to the inner disc edge, where conditions may be unfavorable
for r-mode growth. We revisit this problem from a pseudo-Newtonian but fully global perspective,
deriving linearized equations describing a relativistic, magnetized accretion flow, and calculating
normal modes with and without vertical density stratification. In an unstratified model, the choice
of vertical wavenumber determines the extent to which vertical magnetic fields drive the r-modes
toward the inner edge. In a global model fully incorporating density stratification, we confirm
that this susceptibility to magnetic fields depends on disc thickness. Our calculations suggest
that in thin discs, r-modes may remain independent of the inner disc edge for vertical magnetic fields
with plasma betas as low as $\beta\approx 100-300$. We posit that the appearance of r-modes in observations
may be more determined by a competition between excitation and damping mechanisms near the ISCO
than the modification of the trapping region by magnetic fields.
