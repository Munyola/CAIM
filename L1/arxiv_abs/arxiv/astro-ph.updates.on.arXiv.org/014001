We give a physical interpretation of the formalism intrinsic degeneracies of the gravitational
lensing formalism that we derived on a mathematical basis in part IV of this series. We find that all
degeneracies occur due to the partition of the mass density along the line of sight. Usually, it is
partitioned into a background (cosmic) density and a foreground deflecting object. The latter
can be further partitioned into a main deflecting object and perturbers. Weak deflecting objects
along the line of sight are also added, either to the deflecting object or as a correction of the angular
diameter distances, perturbing the cosmological background density. A priori, this is an arbitrary
choice of reference frame and partition. They can be redefined without changing the lensing observables
which are sensitive to the integrated deflecting mass density along the entire line of sight. Reformulating
the time delay equation such that this interpretation of the degeneracies becomes easily visible,
we note that the source can be eliminated from this formulation, which simplifies reconstructions
of the deflecting mass distribution or the inference of the Hubble constant, $H_0$. Subsequently,
we list necessary conditions to break the formalism intrinsic degeneracies and discuss ways to
break them by model choices or including non-lensing observables like velocity dispersions along
the line of sight with their advantages and disadvantages. We conclude with a systematic summary
of all formalism intrinsic degeneracies and possibilities to break them.
