We present the novel design of microfabricated, silicon-substrate based mirrors for use in cryogenic
Fabry-Perot Interferometers (FPIs) for the mid-IR to sub-mm/mm wavelength regime. One side of
the silicon substrate will have a double-layer metamaterial anti-reflection coating (ARC) anisotropically
etched into it and the other side will be metalized with a reflective mesh pattern. The double-layer
ARC ensures a reflectance of less than 1% at the surface substrate over the FPI bandwidth. This low
reflectance is required to achieve broadband capability and to mitigate contaminating resonances
from the silicon surface. Two silicon substrates with their metalized surfaces facing each other
and held parallel with an adjustable separation will compose the FPI. To create an FPI with nearly
uniform finesse over the FPI bandwidth, we use a combination of inductive and capacitive gold meshes
evaporated onto the silicon substrate. We also consider the use of niobium as a superconducting
reflective mesh for long wavelengths to eliminate ohmic losses at each reflection in the resonating
cavity of the FPI and thereby increase overall transmission. We develop these silicon-substrate
based FPIs for use in ground (e.g. CCAT-prime), air (e.g. HIRMES), and future space-based telescopes
(e.g. the Origins Space Telescope concept). Such FPIs are well suited for spectroscopic imaging
with the upcoming large IR/sub-mm/mm TES bolometer detector arrays. Here we present the fabrication
and performance of multi-layer, plasma-etched, silicon metamaterial ARC, as well as models of
the mirrors and FPIs.
