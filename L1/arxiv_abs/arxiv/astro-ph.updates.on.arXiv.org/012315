We present results from the Keck Baryonic Structure Survey (KBSS) including the first detailed
measurements of the column densities, kinematics, and internal energy of metal-bearing gas within
the virial radius (35-100 physical kpc) of eight ~$L^*$ galaxies at $z\sim2$. From our full sample
of 130 metal-bearing absorbers, we infer that halo gas is kinematically complex when viewed in singly,
doubly, and triply ionized species. Broad OVI and CIV absorbers are detected at similar velocities
to the lower-ionization gas but with very different kinematic structure indicating that the circumgalactic
medium (CGM) is multi-phase. There is a high covering fraction of metal-bearing gas within 100 kpc
including highly ionized gas such as OVI; however, observations of a single galaxy probed by a lensed
background QSO suggest the size of metal-bearing clouds is small (<400 pc for all but the OVI-bearing
gas). The mass in metals found within the halo is substantial, equivalent to $\gtrsim$ 25% of the
metal mass within the interstellar medium. The gas kinematics unambiguously show that 70% of galaxies
with detected metal absorption have some unbound metal-enriched gas, suggesting galactic winds
may commonly eject gas from halos at $z\sim2$. Significant thermal broadening is detected in CGM
absorbers which dominates the internal energy of the gas. 40% of the detected gas has temperatures
in the range $10^{4.5-5.5}$ K where cooling times are short, suggesting the CGM is dynamic, with
constant heating and/or cooling to produce this short-lived thermal phase.
