Massive stars inject mechanical and radiative energy into the surrounding environment, which
stirs it up, heats the gas, produces cloud and intercloud phases in the interstellar medium, and
disrupts molecular clouds (the birth sites of new stars). Stellar winds, supernova explosions
and ionization by ultraviolet photons control the lifetimes of molecular clouds. Theoretical
studies predict that momentum injection by radiation should dominate that by stellar winds, but
this has been difficult to assess observationally. Velocity-resolved large-scale images in the
fine-structure line of ionized carbon ([C II]) provide an observational diagnostic for the radiative
energy input and the dynamics of the interstellar medium around massive stars. Here we report observations
of a one-square-degree region (about 7 parsecs in diameter) of Orion molecular core -- the region
nearest to Earth that exhibits massive-star formation -- at a resolution of 16 arcseconds (0.03
parsecs) in the [C II] line at 1.9 terahertz (158 micrometres). The results reveal that the stellar
wind originating from the massive star ${\theta}^{1}$ Orionis C has swept up the surrounding material
to create a bubble roughly four parsecs in diameter with a 2,600-solar-mass shell, which is expanding
at 13 kilometres per second. This finding demonstrates that the mechanical energy from the stellar
wind is converted very efficiently into kinetic energy of the shell and causes more disruption of
the Orion molecular core 1 than do photo-ionization and evaporation or future supernova explosions.
