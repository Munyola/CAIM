Planetary migration is a major challenge for planet formation theories. The speed of Type I migration
is proportional to the mass of a protoplanet, while the final decade of growth of a pebble-accreting
planetary core takes place at a rate that scales with the mass to the two-thirds power. This results
in planetary growth tracks (i.e., the evolution of a protoplanet's mass versus its distance from
the star) that become increasingly horizontal (migration-dominated) with rising mass of the protoplanet.
It has been shown recently that the migration torque on a protoplanet is reduced proportional to
the strength of the gas gap carved by the growing planet. Here we identify that the mass at which a planet
carves a 50% gap is approximately 2.3 times the pebble isolation mass, the latter demarking the transition
from pebble accretion to gas accretion. Gas accretion to form gas-giant planets therefore takes
place over a few astronomical units of migration after reaching first pebble isolation mass and,
shortly after, the 50% gap mass. Our results demonstrate how planetary growth can outperform migration,
both during core accretion and during gas accretion, even when pebbles are millimeter-sized and
the pebble-to-gas flux ratio through the protoplanetary disc is in the nominal range of 0.01-0.02.
Reaching a pebble isolation mass of ~10 Earth masses by accreting millimeter-sized pebbles is possible
provided that pebbles reside in a mid-plane layer with a width of approximately 10% of the gas scale-height,
a typical value inferred from observations of protoplanetary discs.
