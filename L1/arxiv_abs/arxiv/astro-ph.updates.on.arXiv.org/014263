Alternatives to the cold, collisionless dark matter (DM) paradigm in which DM behaves as a collisional
fluid generically suppress small-scale structure. Herein we use the observed population of Milky
Way (MW) satellite galaxies to constrain the collisional nature of DM, focusing on DM--baryon scattering.
We first derive conservative analytic upper limits on the velocity-independent DM--baryon scattering
cross section by translating the upper bound on the lowest mass of halos inferred to host satellites
into a characteristic cutoff scale in the linear matter power spectrum. We then confirm and improve
these results through a detailed probabilistic inference of the MW satellite population that marginalizes
over relevant astrophysical uncertainties. This yields $95\%$ confidence upper limits on the
DM--baryon scattering cross section of $6\times10^{-30}\ \rm{cm}^2$ ($10^{-27}\ \rm{cm}^2$)
for DM particle masses $m_\chi$ of $10\ \rm{keV}$ ($10\ \rm{GeV}$); these limits scale as $m_\chi^{1/4}$
for $m_\chi \ll 1\ \rm{GeV}$ and $m_\chi$ for $m_\chi \gg 1\ \rm{GeV}$. This analysis improves upon
cosmological bounds derived from cosmic-microwave-background anisotropy measurements by more
than three orders of magnitude over a wide range of DM masses, excluding regions of parameter space
previously unexplored by other methods, including direct-detection experiments. Our work reveals
a mapping between DM--baryon scattering and other alternative DM models, and we discuss the implications
of our results for warm and fuzzy DM scenarios.
