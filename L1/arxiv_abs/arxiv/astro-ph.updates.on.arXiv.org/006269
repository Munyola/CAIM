Episodic accretion has been proposed as a solution to the long-standing luminosity problem in star
formation; however, the process remains poorly understood. We present observations of line emission
from N2H+ and CO isotopologues using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA)
in the envelopes of eight Very Low Luminosity Objects (VeLLOs). In five of the sources the spatial
distribution of emission from N2H+ and CO isotopologues shows a clear anti-correlation. It is proposed
that this is tracing the CO snow line in the envelopes: N2H+ emission is depleted toward the center
of these sources in contrast to the CO isotopologue emission which exhibits a peak. The positions
of the CO snow lines traced by the N2H+ emission are located at much larger radii than those calculated
using the current luminosities of the central sources. This implies that these five sources have
experienced a recent accretion burst because the CO snow line would have been pushed outwards during
the burst due to the increased luminosity of the central star. The N2H+ and CO isotopologue emission
from DCE161, one of the other three sources, is most likely tracing a transition disk at a later evolutionary
stage. Excluding DCE161, five out of seven sources (i.e., ~70%) show signatures of a recent accretion
burst. This fraction is larger than that of the Class 0/I sources studied by J{\o}rgensen et al. (2015)
and Frimann et al. (2016) suggesting that the interval between accretion episodes in VeLLOs is shorter
than that in Class 0/I sources.
