The newest generation of integral field unit spectrographs brings three-dimensional mapping
of nearby galaxies one step closer. While the focus up to this point was mostly on stars and ionised
gas, it is also possible to look at dust in a new, more complete way. Using MUSE science verification
observations of NGC 5626, we map the interstellar matter in this dusty lenticular. We use the resolving
power of MUSE to measure the optical attenuation with a spectral resolution of 6.25 \AA, at physical
scales of 0.1-1 kpc. The integrated attenuation curve of NGC 5626 shows a smooth, slightly steeper
than Milky Way and SMC attenuation curves. Several sharp features are superimposed: we measure
lower attenuation at spectral emission lines and higher attenuation for the sodium line doublet.
No correlation was observed between sodium line strength and reddening by dust on spatially resolved
scales. Additionally, the continuum attenuation was found to be independent from the Balmer decrement
(tracing ionised gas attenuation). We model and interpret the variations in the attenuation curves
of each spatial resolution element of NGC 5626. We find that the amount and distribution of dust along
the line-of-sight is highly degenerate with any variation in the intrinsic extinction law. Our
analysis shows that the interstellar matter in NGC 5626 resides in a regular and well-settled disk.
Our results preach caution in the application of simple recipes to de-redden global galaxy spectra
and underlines the need for more realistic dust geometries when constructing such correction formulas.
