The compelling science case for the observation of B-mode polarization in the cosmic microwave
background (CMB) is driving the CMB community to expand the observed sky fraction, either by extending
survey sizes or by deploying receivers to potential new northern sites. For ground-based CMB instruments,
poorly-mixed atmospheric water vapor constitutes the primary source of short-term sky noise.
This results in short-timescale brightness fluctuations, which must be rejected by some form of
modulation. To maximize the sensitivity of ground-based CMB observations, it is useful to understand
the effects of atmospheric water vapor over timescales and angular scales relevant for CMB polarization
measurements. To this end, we have undertaken a campaign to perform a coordinated characterization
of current and potential future observing sites using scanning 183 GHz water vapor radiometers
(WVRs). So far, we have deployed two identical WVR units; one at the South Pole, Antarctica, and the
other at Summit Station, Greenland. The former site has a long heritage of ground-based CMB observations
and is the current location of the Bicep/Keck Array telescopes as well as the South Pole Telescope.
The latter site, though less well characterized, is under consideration as a northern-hemisphere
location for future CMB receivers. Data collection from this campaign began in January 2016 at South
Pole and July 2016 at Summit Station. Data analysis is ongoing to reduce the data to a single spatial
and temporal statistic that can be used for one-to-one site comparison.
