A key task of observational extragalactic astronomy is to determine where -- within galaxies of
diverse masses and morphologies -- stellar mass growth occurs, how it depends on galaxy properties
and what processes regulate star formation. Using spectroscopic indices derived from the stellar
continuum at $\sim 4000$\AA, we determine the spatially resolved star-formation histories of
980000 spaxels in 2404 galaxies in the SDSS-IV MaNGA IFU survey. We examine the spatial distribution
of star-forming, quiescent, green valley, starburst and post-starburst spaxels as a function
of stellar mass and morphology to see where and in what types of galaxy star formation is occurring.
The spatial distribution of star-formation is dependent primarily on stellar mass, with a noticeable
change in the distribution at \mstar$>10^{10}$\msun. Galaxies above this mass have an increasing
fraction of regions that are forming stars with increasing radius, whereas lower mass galaxies
have a constant fraction of star forming regions with radius. Our findings support a picture of inside-out
growth and quenching at high masses. We find that morphology (measured via concentration) correlates
with the fraction of star-forming spaxels, but not with their radial distribution. We find (post-)starburst
regions are more common outside of the galaxy centre, are preferentially found in asymmetric galaxies,
and have lower gas-phase metallicity than other regions, consistent with interactions triggering
starbursts and driving low metallicity gas into regions at $<1.5R_e$.
