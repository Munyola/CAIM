Embedded in the gaseous protoplanetary disk, Jupiter and Saturn naturally become trapped in 3:2
resonance and migrate outward. This serves as the basis of the Grand Tack model. However, previous
hydrodynamical simulations were restricted to isothermal disks, with moderate aspect ratio and
viscosity. Here we simulate the orbital evolution of the gas giants in disks with viscous heating
and radiative cooling. We find that Jupiter and Saturn migrate outward in 3:2 resonance in modest-mass
($M_{disk} \approx M_{MMSN}$, where MMSN is the "minimum-mass solar nebula") disks with viscous
stress parameter $\alpha$ between $10^{-3}$ and $10^{-2} $. In disks with relatively low-mass
($M_{disk} \lesssim M_{MMSN}$) , Jupiter and Saturn get captured in 2:1 resonance and can even migrate
outward in low-viscosity disks ($\alpha \le 10^{-4}$). Such disks have a very small aspect ratio
($h\sim 0.02-0.03$) that favors outward migration after capture in 2:1 resonance, as confirmed
by isothermal runs which resulted in a similar outcome for $h \sim 0.02$ and $\alpha \le 10^{-4}$.
We also performed N-body runs of the outer Solar System starting from the results of our hydrodynamical
simulations and including 2-3 ice giants. After dispersal of the gaseous disk, a Nice model instability
starting with Jupiter and Saturn in 2:1 resonance results in good Solar Systems analogs. We conclude
that in a cold Solar Nebula, the 2:1 resonance between Jupiter and Saturn can lead to outward migration
of the system, and this may represent an alternative scenario for the evolution of the Solar System.
