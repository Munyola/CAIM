We present photometric and morphological analysis of the behavior of sungrazing comet C/2012 S1
ISON in SOHO and STEREO images around its perihelion on 2013 November 28.779 UT. ISON brightened
gradually November 20-26 with a superimposed outburst on November 21.3-23.5. The slope of brightening
changed about November 26.7 and was significantly steeper in SOHO's orange and clear filter images
until November 27.9 when it began to flatten out, reaching a peak about November 28.1 ($r_H{\sim}17
R_\odot$), then fading before brightening again from November 28.6 ($r_H{\sim}5 R_\odot$) until
disappearing behind the occulting disc. ISON brightened continuously as it approached perihelion
while visible in all other telescopes/filters. The central condensation disappeared about November
28.5 and the leading edge became progressively more elongated until perihelion. These photometric
and morphological behaviors are reminiscent of the tens of meter sized Kreutz comets regularly
observed by SOHO and STEREO and strongly suggest that the nucleus of ISON was destroyed prior to perihelion.
This is much too small to support published gas production rates and implies significant mass loss
and/or disruption in the days and weeks leading up to perihelion. No central condensation was seen
post-perihelion. The post-perihelion lightcurve was nearly identical in all telescopes/filters
and fell slightly steeper than $r_H^{-2}$. This implies that the brightness was dominated by reflected
solar continuum off of remnant dust in the coma/tail and that any remaining active nucleus was <10
m in radius.
