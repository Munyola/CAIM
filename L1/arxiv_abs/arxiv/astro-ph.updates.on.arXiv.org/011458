Theoretical modelling and observations of AGN jets suggest that the non-thermal electrons emitting
the observed radiation should (i) carry an amount of energy comparable to the magnetic fields ($U_e\sim
U_B$), which is likely the case if the magnetic fields play a dynamically important role in the jet's
acceleration process; (ii) cool efficiently in a dynamical time ($t_{\rm cool}\lesssim t_{\rm
dyn}$), which is suggested by the fact that a large fraction of the jet's kinetic energy is promptly
converted into radiation. These expectations are at odds with the results of the simplest one-zone
Self-Synchro-Compton (SSC) model for the Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) of BL Lacs. Indeed,
the model predicts $U_e\gg U_B$ and $t_{\rm cool}\gg t_{\rm dyn}$ for most of the objects. Here we
closely investigate one of the key assumptions of this model, namely that the momentum distribution
of the non-thermal electrons is isotropic. We find that this assumption may be an oversimplification.
If the magnetic energy is dissipated via a turbulent MHD cascade, the highest energy electrons may
instead retain a small pitch angle. Since the synchrotron emissivity is suppressed when the pitch
angle is small, this effect may importantly affect the modelling of the SED. As an illustrative example,
we present an anisotropic model for the electron momentum distribution such that $U_e\sim U_B$
and $t_{\rm cool}\lesssim t_{\rm dyn}$ at the same time. Our model manages to simultaneously solve
the two problems with one only more free parameter with respect to the usual isotropic one-zone SSC
model.
