The wealth of asteroseismic data for red-giant stars and the precision with which these data have
been observed over the last decade calls for investigations to further understand the internal
structures of these stars. The aim of this work is to validate a method to measure the underlying period
spacing, coupling term and mode offset of pure gravity modes that are present in the deep interiors
of red-giant stars. We subsequently investigate the physical conditions of the evanescent zone
between the gravity mode cavity and the pressure mode cavity. We implement an alternative mathematical
description to analyse observational data and to extract the underlying physical parameters that
determine the frequencies of mixed modes. This description takes the radial order of the modes explicitly
into account, which reduces its sensitivity to aliases. Additionally, and for the first time, this
method allows us to constrain the gravity mode offset for red-giant stars. We determine the period
spacing and the coupling term for the dipole modes within a few percent of literature values. Additionally,
we find that the gravity mode offset varies on a star by star basis and should not be kept fixed in the
analysis. Furthermore, we find that the coupling factor is logarithmically related to the physical
width of the evanescent region normalised by the radius at which the evanescent zone is located.
Finally, the local density contrast at the edge of the core of red giant branch models shows a tentative
correlation with the offset. (abstract abriged)
