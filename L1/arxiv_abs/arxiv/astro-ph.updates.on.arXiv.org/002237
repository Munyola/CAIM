We present Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging observations of the site of the Type-Ia supernova
SN2011fe in the nearby galaxy M101, obtained about one year prior to the event, in a narrow band centred
on the HeII 4686 \AA{} emission line. In a "single-degenerate" progenitor scenario, the hard photon
flux from an accreting white dwarf (WD), burning hydrogen on its surface over $\sim1$ Myr should,
in principle, create a HeIII Str\"{o}mgren sphere or shell surrounding the WD. Depending on the
WD luminosity, the interstellar density, and the velocity of an outflow from the WD, the HeIII region
could appear unresolved, extended, or as a ring, with a range of possible surface brightnesses.
We find no trace of HeII 4686 \AA{} line emission in the HST data. Using simulations, we set $2\sigma$
upper limits on the HeII 4686 \AA{} luminosity of $L_{\rm HeII} < 3.4 \times 10^{34}$ erg s$^{-1}$
for a point source, corresponding to an emission region of radius $r < 1.8$ pc. The upper limit
for an extended source is $L_{\rm HeII} < 1.7 \times 10^{35}$ erg s$^{-1}$, corresponding to
an extended region with $r\sim11$ pc. The largest detectable shell, given an interstellar-medium
density of 1 cm$^{-3}$, has a radius of $\sim6$ pc. Our results argue against the presence, within
the $\sim10^5$ yr prior to the explosion, of a supersoft X-ray source of luminosity $L_{\rm bol}
\ge 3 \times 10^{37}$ erg s$^{-1}$, or of a super-Eddington accreting WD that produces an outflowing
wind capable of producing cavities with radii of 2-6 pc.
