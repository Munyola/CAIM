NGC 5905 is one of the few galaxies in which an X-ray flare was discovered by the ROSAT All Sky Survey
(RASS). This flare was supposed to have occurred due to tidal disruption of a star by the central black
hole. In this work we present analysis of multi-wavelength follow-up observations made in X-ray,
mid-infrared and radio using data obtained from the Chandra X-ray observatory, Spitzer and Giant
Meter wave Radio telescope (GMRT) respectively. The archival Chandra 2007 observations show that
the X-ray luminosity in the energy band of 0.5-2.0 keV has decreased by a factor of 200 since the peak
of the X-ray flare observed in 1990. The X-ray image reveals no centrally bright core expected in
the presence of an AGN. Diffuse X-ray emission lying close to the circum-nuclear star forming ring
is observed. The radio flux density observed with the GMRT data is similar to the flux density derived
using the VLA FIRST observation in 1997 which indicates that the radio emission is probably unaffected
by the 1990 X-ray flare. The archival Spitzer 2006 mid-infrared spectrum shows strong evidence
of nuclear star formation but does not show any clear signatures of AGN activity. Therefore, we conclude,
that there is no central AGN in NGC 5905 and reaffirm that the 1990 X-ray flare observed in this galaxy
was a tidal disruption event and not due to AGN variability. NGC 5905 represents one of the few direct
evidences that non-accreting black holes exist and hence provides an opportunity to study the post-outburst
evolution of a tidal disruption event in the nucleus of a giant low surface brightness galaxy.
