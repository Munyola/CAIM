Previous studies of the chemically peculiar Bp star 36 Lyn revealed a moderately strong magnetic
field, circumstellar material, and inhomogeneous surface abundance distributions of certain
elements. We present in this paper an analysis of 33 high-signal-to-noise ratio, high-resolution
Stokes IV observations of 36 Lyn obtained with the Narval spectropolarimeter at the Bernard Lyot
telescope at Pic du Midi Observatory. From these data, we compute new measurements of the mean longitudinal
magnetic field, Bl, using the multi-line least-squares deconvolution (LSD) technique. A rotationally
phased Bl curve reveals a strong magnetic field, with indications for deviation from a pure dipole
field. We derive magnetic maps and chemical abundance distributions from the LSD profiles, produced
using the Zeeman Doppler Imaging code InversLSD. Using a spherical harmonic expansion to characterize
the magnetic field, we find that the harmonic energy is concentrated predominantly in the dipole
mode (l = 1), with significant contribution from both the poloidal and toroidal components. This
toroidal field component is predicted theoretically, but not typically observed for Ap/Bp stars.
Chemical abundance maps reveal a helium enhancement in a distinct region where the radial magnetic
field is strong. Silicon enhancements are located in two regions, also where the radial field is
stronger. Titanium and iron enhancements are slightly offset from the helium enhancements, and
are located in areas where the radial field is weak, close to the magnetic equator.
