It has been recently suggested that the multiple concentric rings and gaps discovered by ALMA in
many protoplanetary disks may be produced by a single planet, as a result of the complex propagation
and dissipation of the multiple spiral density waves it excites in the disk. Numerical efforts to
verify this idea have largely utilized the so-called locally isothermal approximation with a prescribed
disk temperature profile. However, in protoplanetary disks this approximation does not provide
an accurate description of the density wave dynamics on scales of tens of au. Moreover, we show that
locally isothermal simulations tend to overestimate the contrast of ring and gap features, as well
as misrepresent their positions, when compared to simulations in which the energy equation is evolved
explicitly. This outcome is caused by the non-conservation of the angular momentum flux of linear
perturbations in locally isothermal disks. We demonstrate this effect using simulations of locally
isothermal and adiabatic disks (with essentially identical temperature profiles) and show how
the dust distributions, probed by mm wavelength observations, differ between the two cases. Locally
isothermal simulations may thus underestimate the masses of planets responsible for the formation
of multiple gaps and rings on scales of tens of au observed by ALMA. We suggest that caution should
be exercised in using the locally isothermal simulations to explore planet-disk interaction,
as well as in other studies of wave-like phenomena in astrophysical disks.
