Low-mass stars build a significant fraction of their total mass during short outbursts of enhanced
accretion known as FUor and EXor outbursts. FUor objects are characterized by a sudden brightening
of ~5 magnitudes at visible wavelengths within one year and remain bright for decades. EXor objects
have lower amplitude outbursts on shorter timescales. Here we discuss a 1.3 mm ALMA mini-survey
of eight outbursting sources (three FUor, four EXor, and the borderline object V1647 Ori) in the
Orion Molecular Cloud. While previous papers in this series discuss the remarkable molecular outflows
observed in the three FUor objects and V1647 Ori, here we focus on the continuum data and the differences
and similarities between the FUor and EXor populations. We find that FUor discs are significantly
more massive (~80-600 M_JUP) than the EXor objects (~0.5-40 M_JUP ). We also report that the EXor
sources lack the prominent outflows seen in the FUor population. Even though our sample is small,
the large differences in disc masses and outflow activity suggest that the two types of objects represent
different evolutionary stages. The FUor sources seem to be rather compact (Rc < 20-40 au) and to have
a smaller characteristic radius for a given disc mass when compared to T Tauri stars. V1118 Ori, the
only known close binary systemin our sample, is shown to host a disc around each one of the stellar
components. The disc around HBC 494 is asymmetric, hinting at a structure in the outer disc or the
presence of a second disc.
