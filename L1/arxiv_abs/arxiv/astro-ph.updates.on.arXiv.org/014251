Dense stellar systems such as globular clusters are believed to harbor merging binary black holes
(BHs). The evolution of such binaries is driven by interactions with other stars, most notably,
binary-single interactions. Traditionally, so-called `strong' interactions are believed to
be the driving force in this evolution. However, we recently showed that more distant, i.e., "weak"
or "secular" encounters, can have important implications for the properties of merging BH binaries
in globular clusters. This motivates more detailed understanding of the effects of secular encounters
on a binary. In another previous paper, we analytically calculated expressions for the changes
of the eccentricity and angular-momentum vectors taking into account second-order (SO) perturbation
theory, and showed that, for highly eccentric binaries, the new expressions give rise to behavior
that is not captured by first-order (FO) theory. Here, we extend our previous work to third order
(TO) perturbation theory. We also include terms up to and including octupole order. The latter are
nonzero for binaries with unequal component masses. In addition, we consider the effects of post-Newtonian
terms, and we determine the steady-state distribution due to the cumulative effect of secular encounters
by computing the associated angular-momentum diffusion coefficients, and applying the Fokker-Planck
equation. Together with our previous work, the results in this paper provide a framework for incorporating
the effects of distant encounters on binaries in models of cluster evolution, such as Monte Carlo
codes.
