We present a model for a Noise Matched Phased Array Feed (PAF) system and compare model predictions
with the measurement results. The PAF system consists of an array feed, a receiver, a beamformer
and a parabolic reflector. The novel aspect of our model is the characterization of the {\em PAF system}
by a single matrix. This characteristic matrix is constructed from the open-circuit voltage covariance
at the output of the PAF due to signal from the observing source, ground spillover noise, sky background
noise and (low-noise) amplifier (LNA) noise. The best signal-to-noise ratio on the source achievable
with the PAF system will be the maximum eigenvalue of the characteristic matrix. The voltage covariance
due to signal and spillover noise are derived by applying the Lorentz reciprocity theorem. The receiver
noise covariance and noise temperature are obtained in terms of Lange invariants such that they
are suitable for noise matching the array feed. The model predictions are compared with the measured
performance of a 1.4 GHz, 19-element, dual-polarized PAF on the Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope.
We show that the model predictions, obtained with an additional noise contribution due to the measured
losses ahead of the low-noise amplifier, compare well with the measured ratio of system temperature
to aperture efficiency as a function of frequency and as a function of offset from the boresight.
Further, our modeling indicates that the bandwidth over which this ratio is optimum can be improved
by a factor of at least two by noise matching the PAF with the LNA.
