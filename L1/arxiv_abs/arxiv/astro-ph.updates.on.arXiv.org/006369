We have conducted a $^{12}$CO(2-1) survey of several molecular gas complexes in the vicinity of
H II regions within the spiral galaxy NGC 300 using the Atacama Large Millimeter Array. Our observations
attain a resolution of 10 pc and 1 km s$^{-1}$, sufficient to fully resolve Giant Molecular Clouds
(GMCs), and are the highest to date obtained beyond the Local Group. We use the CPROPS algorithm to
identify and characterize 250 GMCs across the observed regions. GMCs in NGC 300 appear qualitatively
and quantitatively similar to those in the Milky Way disk: they show an identical scaling relationship
between size $R$ and linewidth $\Delta V$ ($\Delta V \propto R^{0.48\pm0.05}$), appear to be mostly
in virial equilibrium, and are consistent with having a constant surface density of $60$ M$_{\odot}$
pc$^{-2}$. The GMC mass spectrum is similar to those in the inner disks of spiral galaxies (including
the Milky Way). Our results suggest that global galactic properties such as total stellar mass,
morphology, and average metallicity may not play a major role in setting GMC properties, at least
within the disks of galaxies on the star-forming main sequence. Instead, GMC properties may be more
strongly influenced by local environmental factors such as the mid-plane disk pressure. In particular,
in the inner disk of NGC 300 we find this pressure to be similar to that in the local Milky Way but markedly
lower than that in the disk of M51 where GMCs are characterized by systematically higher surface
densities and a higher coefficient for the size-linewidth relation.
