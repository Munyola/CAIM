A large number (67) of the compact/ultra-compact H II regions identified in the Coordinated Radio
and Infrared Survey for High-Mass Star Formation catalogue were determined to be powered by a Lyman
continuum flux in excess of what was expected given their corresponding luminosity. In this study
we attempt to reasonably explain the Lyman excess phenomenon in as many of the 67 H II regions as possible
through a variety of observational and astrophysical means including new luminosity estimates,
new Herschel photometry, new distance determinations, the use of different models for dust and
ionized gas covering factors, and the use of different stellar calibrations. This phenomenon has
been observed before; however, the objects shown to exhibit this behaviour in the literature have
decidedly different physical properties than the regions in our sample, and thus the origin of the
excess is not the same. We find that the excess can be reproduced using OB stellar atmosphere models
that have been slightly modified in the extreme ultraviolet. Though the exact mechanism producing
the excess is still uncertain, we do find that a scaled up magnetospheric accretion model, often
used to explain similar emission from T Tauri stars, is unable to match our observations. Our results
suggest that the Lyman excess may be associated with younger H II regions, and that it is more commonly
found in early B-type stars. Our refined sample of 24 Lyman excess H II regions provides an ideal sample
for comparative studies with regular H II regions, and can act as the basis for the further detailed
study of individual regions.
