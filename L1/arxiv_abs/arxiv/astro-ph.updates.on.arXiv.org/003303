The central engines of Seyfert galaxies are thought to be enshrouded by geometrically thick gas
and dust structures. In this article, we derive observable properties for a self-consistent model
of such toroidal gas and dust distributions, where the geometrical thickness is achieved and maintained
with the help of X-ray heating and radiation pressure due to the central engine. Spectral energy
distributions (SEDs) and images are obtained with the help of dust continuum radiative transfer
calculations with RADMC-3D. For the first time, we are able to present time-resolved SEDs and images
for a physical model of the central obscurer. Temporal changes are mostly visible at shorter wavelengths,
close to the combined peak of the dust opacity as well as the central source spectrum and are caused
by variations in the column densities of the generated outflow. Due to the three-component morphology
of the hydrodynamical models -- a thin disc with high density filaments, a surrounding fluffy component
(the obscurer) and a low density outflow along the rotation axis -- we find dramatic differences
depending on wavelength: whereas the mid-infrared images are dominated by the elongated appearance
of the outflow cone, the long wavelength emission is mainly given by the cold and dense disc component.
Overall, we find good agreement with observed characteristics, especially for those models, which
show clear outflow cones in combination with a geometrically thick distribution of gas and dust,
as well as a geometrically thin, but high column density disc in the equatorial plane.
