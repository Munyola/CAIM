In this work, we reinvestigate the electron fraction $Y_{e}$ and electron Fermi energy $E_{F}(e)$
of neutron stars, based on our previous work of Li et al.(2016), in which we firstly deduced a special
solution to $E_{F}(e)$, and then obtained several useful analytical formulae for $Y_{\rm e}$ and
matter density $\rho$ within classical models and the relativistic mean field(RMF) theory using
numerically fitting. The advantages of this work include the following aspects:(1) The linear
functions are substituted for the nonlinear exponential functions used in the previous work. This
method may be more simple, and closer to realistic equation of state\,(EoS) of a neutron star(NS),
because there are linear or quasi-linear relationships between number fractions of leptons and
matter density, which can be seen by solving NS EoS; (2)we introduce a dimensionless variable $\varrho$\,($\varrho=\rho/\rho_0$,
$\rho_{0}$ is the standard saturated nuclear density), which greatly reduces the scope of the fitting
coefficients;(3)we present numerical errors including absolute and relative deviations between
the data and fit. By numerically simulating, we have obtained several analytical formulae for $Y_{e}$
and $\rho$ for both APR98 and RMF models. Combining these analytical formulae with the special solution,
we can calculate the value of $E_{\rm F}(e)$ for any given matter density. Since $Y_e$ and $E_{ F}(e)$
are important in assessing cooling rate of a NS and the possibility of kaon/pion condensation in
the NS interior, this study could be useful in the future study on the thermal evolution of a NS.
