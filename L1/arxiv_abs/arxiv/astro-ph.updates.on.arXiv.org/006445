Measuring the proximity effect and the damping wing of intergalactic neutral hydrogen in quasar
spectra during the epoch of reionization requires an estimate of the intrinsic continuum at rest-frame
wavelengths $\lambda_{\rm rest}\sim1200$-$1260$ {\AA}. In contrast to previous works which
used composite spectra with matched spectral properties or explored correlations between parameters
of broad emission lines, we opted for a non-parametric predictive approach based on principal component
analysis (PCA) to predict the intrinsic spectrum from the spectral properties at redder (i.e. unabsorbed)
wavelengths. We decomposed a sample of $12764$ spectra of $z\sim2$-$2.5$ quasars from SDSS/BOSS
into 10 red-side ($1280$ {\AA} $<\lambda_{\rm rest}<2900$ {\AA}) and 6 blue-side ($1180$ {\AA}
$<\lambda_{\rm rest}<1280$ {\AA}) PCA basis spectra, and constructed a projection matrix to predict
the blue-side coefficients from a fit to the red-side spectrum. We found that our method predicts
the blue-side continuum with $\sim6$-$12\%$ precision and $\lesssim1\%$ bias by testing on the
full training set sample. We then computed predictions for the blue-side continua of the two quasars
currently known at $z>7$: ULAS J1120+0641 ($z=7.09$) and ULAS J1342+0928 ($z=7.54$). Both of these
quasars are known to exhibit extreme emission line properties, so we individually calibrated the
precision of the continuum predictions from similar quasars in the training set. We find that both
$z>7$ quasars, and in particular ULAS J1342+0928, show signs of damping wing-like absorption at
wavelengths redward of Ly$\alpha$.
