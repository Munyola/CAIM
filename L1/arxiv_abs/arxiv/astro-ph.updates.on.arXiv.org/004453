Using forward models for representative exoplanet atmospheres and a radiometric instrument model,
we have generated synthetic observational data to explore how well the major C- and O-bearing chemical
species (CO, CO2, CH4, and H2O), important for determining atmospheric opacity and radiation balance,
can be constrained by transit measurements as a function of spectral wavelength coverage. This
work features simulations for a notional transit spectroscopy mission and compares two cases for
instrument spectral coverage (wavelength coverage from 0.5-2.5 ${\mu}$m and 0.5-5 ${\mu}$m.
The simulation is conducted on a grid with a range of stellar magnitudes and incorporates a full retrieval
of atmospheric model parameters. We consider a range of planets from sub-Neptunes to hot Jupiters
and include both low and high mean molecular weight atmospheres. We find that including the 2.5-5
${\mu}$m wavelength range provides a significant improvement in the degree of constraint on the
retrieved molecular abundances: up to ~3 orders of magnitude for a low mean molecular weight atmosphere
(${\mu}$=2.3) and up to a factor of ~6 for a high mean molecular weight atmosphere (${\mu}$=28).
These decreased uncertainties imply that broad spectral coverage between the visible and the mid-infrared
is an important tool for understanding the chemistry and composition of exoplanet atmospheres.
This analysis suggests that the JWST/NIRSpec 0.6-5 ${\mu}$m prism spectroscopy mode, or similar
wavelength coverage with possible future missions, will be an important resource for exoplanet
atmospheric characterization.
