Quadruply lensed quasars are extremely rare objects, but incredibly powerful cosmological tools.
Only few dozen are known in the whole sky. Here we present the spectroscopic confirmation of two new
quadruplets WG0214-2105 and WG2100-4452 discovered by Agnello & Spiniello (2018) within the Dark
Energy Survey (DES) public footprints. We have conducted spectroscopic follow-up of these systems
with the Southern African Large Telescope as part of a program that aims at confirming the largest
possible number of optically selected strong gravitational lensing systems in the Equatorial
and Southern Hemisphere. For both systems, we present the spectra for the sources and deflectors
that allowed us to estimate the source redshifts and unambiguously confirm their lensing nature.
For the brighter deflector (WG2100-4452), we measure the stellar velocity dispersion from the
spectrum. We also obtain photometry for both lenses, directly from DES multi-band images, isolating
the lens galaxies from the quasar images. One of the quadruplets, WG0214-2105, was also observed
by Pan-STARRS, allowing us to estimate the apparent brightness of each quasar image at two different
epochs, and thus to find evidence for flux variability. This result could suggest a microlensing
event for the faintest components, although intrinsic variability cannot be excluded with only
two epochs. Finally, we present simple lens models for both quadruplets, obtaining Einstein radii,
SIE velocity dispersions, ellipticities, and position angles of the lens systems, as well as time
delay predictions assuming a concordance cosmological model.
