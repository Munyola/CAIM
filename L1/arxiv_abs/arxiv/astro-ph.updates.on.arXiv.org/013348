The external Hartle-Thorne geometry, which describes the space-time outside a slowly-rotating
compact star, is characterized by the gravitational mass $M$, angular momentum $J$ and quadrupole
moment $Q$ of the star and gives a convenient description which, for the rotation frequencies of
more than 95 % of known pulsars, is sufficiently accurate for most purposes. We focus here on the motion
of particles in these space-times, presenting a detailed systematic analysis of the frequency
properties of radial and vertical epicyclic motion and of orbital motion. Our investigation is
motivated by X-ray observations of binary systems containing a rotating neutron star which is accreting
matter from its binary companion. In these systems, twin high-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations
are sometimes observed with a frequency ratio approaching $3:2$ or $5:4$ and these may be explained
by models involving the orbital and epicyclic frequencies of quasi-circular geodesic motion.
In our analysis, we use realistic equations of state for the stellar matter and proceed in a self-consistent
way, following the Hartle-Thorne approach in calculating both the corresponding values of $Q$,
$M$ and $J$ for the stellar model and the properties of the surrounding spacetime. Our results are
then applied to a range of geodetical models for QPOs. A key feature of our study is that it implements
the recently-discovered universal relations among neutron star parameters so that the results
can be directly used for models with different masses $M$, radii $R$ and rotational frequencies
$f_\mathrm{rot}$.
