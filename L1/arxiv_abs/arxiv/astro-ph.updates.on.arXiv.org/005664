We present the results of a spectroscopic analysis of rotational velocities in 714 M dwarf stars
observed by the SDSS III Apache Point Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE) survey. We use a template
fitting technique to estimate $v\sin{i}$ while simultaneously estimating $\log{g}$, $[\text{M}/\text{H}]$,
and $T_{\text{eff}}$. We conservatively estimate that our detection limit is 8 km s$^{-1}$. We
compare our results to M dwarf rotation studies in the literature based on both spectroscopic and
photometric measurements. Like other authors, we find an increase in the fraction of rapid rotators
with decreasing stellar temperature, exemplified by a sharp increase in rotation near the M$4$
transition to fully convective stellar interiors, which is consistent with the hypothesis that
fully convective stars are unable to shed angular momentum as efficiently as those with radiative
cores. We compare a sample of targets observed both by APOGEE and the MEarth transiting planet survey
and find no cases were the measured $v\sin{i}$ and rotation period are physically inconsistent,
requiring $\sin{i}>1$. We compare our spectroscopic results to the fraction of rotators inferred
from photometric surveys and find that while the results are broadly consistent, the photometric
surveys exhibit a smaller fraction of rotators beyond the M$4$ transition by a factor of $\sim 2$.
We discuss possible reasons for this discrepancy. Given our detection limit, our results are consistent
with a bi-modal distribution in rotation that is seen in photometric surveys.
