Light but massive cosmological neutrinos do not cluster significantly on small scales, due to their
high thermal velocities. With finite masses, cosmological neutrinos become part of the total matter
field and contribute to its smoothing. Structure formation in the presence of massive neutrinos
is therefore impeded compared to that in the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology with massless neutrinos.
Neutrinos' masses also distort the anisotropy power spectrum of cosmic microwave background (CMB).
Furthermore, a finite chemical potential $\mu$ for cosmological neutrinos, still allowed by current
data, would have a non-negligible impact on CMB and structure formation. We consistently evaluate
effects of neutrino masses and chemical potentials on the matter power spectrum by use of a neutrino-involved
N-body simulation, with cosmological parameters obtained from a Markov-Chian Moonte-Carlo (MCMC)
refitting of CMB data. Our results show that while a finite averaged neutrino mass $m_\nu$ tends
to suppress the matter power spectrum in a range of wave numbers, the neutrino degeneracy parameters
${\xi_i \equiv \mu_i /T}$ ($i=$1, 2, 3) enhance the latter, leading to a large parameter degeneracy
between $m_\nu$ and $\xi_i$. We provide an empirical formula for the effects on the matter power
spectrum in a selected range of wave numbers induced by $m_\nu$ and $\eta \equiv \sqrt{\sum_i \xi^2_i}$.
Observing a strong correlation between $m_\nu$ and $\eta$, we propose a single redshift-independent
parameter $m_\nu - \frac{4}{3}\eta^2$ to characterize the neutrino effects on the matter power
spectrum.
