Surges often appear as a result of the emergence of magnetized plasma from the solar interior. Traditionally,
they are observed in chromospheric lines such as H$\alpha$ 6563 \AA and Ca II 8542 \AA. However, whether
there is a response to the surge appearance and evolution in the Si IV lines or, in fact, in many other
transition region lines has not been studied. In this paper we analyze a simultaneous episode of
an H$\alpha$ surge and a Si IV burst that occurred on 2016 September 03 in active region AR12585. To
that end, we use coordinated observations from the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS)
and the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope (SST). For the first time, we report emission of Si IV within the
surge, finding profiles that are brighter and broader than the average. Furthermore, the brightest
Si IV patches within the domain of the surge are located mainly near its footpoints. To understand
the relation between the surges and the emission in transition region lines like Si IV, we have carried
out 2.5D radiative MHD (RMHD) experiments of magnetic flux emergence episodes using the Bifrost
code and including the non-equilibrium ionization of silicon. Through spectral synthesis we explain
several features of the observations. We show that the presence of Si IV emission patches within
the surge, their location near the surge footpoints and various observed spectral features are
a natural consequence of the emergence of magnetized plasma from the interior to the atmosphere
and the ensuing reconnection processes.
