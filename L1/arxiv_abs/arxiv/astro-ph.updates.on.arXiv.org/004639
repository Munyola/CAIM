The young, fast-spinning, X-ray pulsar J0537$-$6910 displays an extreme glitch activity, with
large spin-ups interrupting its decelerating rotation every $\sim$100 days. We present nearly
13 years of timing data from this pulsar, obtained with the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer. We discovered
22 new glitches and performed a consistent analysis of all 45 glitches detected in the complete data
span. Our results corroborate the previously reported strong correlation between glitch spin-up
size and the time to the next glitch, a relation that has not been observed so far in any other pulsar.
The spin evolution is dominated by the glitches, which occur at a rate $\sim3.5$ per year, and the
post-glitch recoveries, which prevail the entire interglitch intervals. This distinctive behaviour
provides invaluable insights into the physics of glitches. The observations can be explained with
a multi-component model which accounts for the dynamics of the neutron superfluid present in the
crust and core of neutron stars. We place limits on the moment of inertia of the component responsible
for the spin-up and, ignoring differential rotation, the velocity difference it can sustain with
the crust. Contrary to its rapid decrease between glitches, the spin-down rate increased over the
13 years, and we find the long-term braking index $n_l=-1.22(4)$, the only negative braking index
seen in a young pulsar. We briefly discuss the plausible interpretations of this result, which is
in stark contrast to the predictions of standard models of pulsar spin-down.
