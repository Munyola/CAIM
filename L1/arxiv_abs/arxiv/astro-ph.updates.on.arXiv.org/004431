We present results for the first three years of OzDES, a six-year programme to obtain redshifts for
objects in the Dark Energy Survey (DES) supernova fields using the 2dF fibre positioner and AAOmega
spectrograph on the Anglo-Australian Telescope. OzDES is a multi-object spectroscopic survey
targeting multiple types of targets at multiple epochs over a multi-year baseline, and is one of
the first multi-object spectroscopic surveys to dynamically include transients into the target
list soon after their discovery. At the end of three years, OzDES has spectroscopically confirmed
almost 100 supernovae, and has measured redshifts for 17,000 objects, including the redshifts
of 2,566 supernova hosts. We examine how our ability to measure redshifts for targets of various
types depends on signal-to-noise, magnitude, and exposure time, finding that our redshift success
rate increases significantly at a signal-to-noise of 2 to 3 per 1-Angstrom bin. We also find that
the change in signal-to-noise with exposure time closely matches the Poisson limit for stacked
exposures as long as 10 hours. We use these results to predict the redshift yield of the full OzDES
survey, as well as the potential yields of future surveys on other facilities such as the 4m Multi-Object
Spectroscopic Telescope (4MOST), the Subaru Prime Focus Spectrograph (PFS), and the Maunakea
Spectroscopic Explorer (MSE). This work marks the first OzDES data release, comprising 14,693
redshifts. OzDES is on target to obtain over a yield of approximately 5,700 supernova host-galaxy
redshifts.
