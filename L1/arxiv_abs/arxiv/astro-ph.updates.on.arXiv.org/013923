We present a novel approach aimed at identifying the key chemical elements to search for the (missing)
descendants of very massive first stars exploding as Pair Instability Supernovae (PISN). Our simple
and general method consists in a parametric study accounting for the unknowns related to early cosmic
star-formation and metal-enrichment. Our approach allow us to define the most likely [Fe/H] and
abundance ratios of long-lived stars born in inter-stellar media polluted by the nucleosynthetic
products of PISN at a > 90%, 70%, and 50% level. In agreement with previous works, we show that the descendants
of very massive first stars can be most likely found at [Fe/H]~ -2. Further, we demonstrate that to
search for an under-abundance of [(N, Cu, Zn)/Fe] < 0 is the key to identify these rare descendants.
The "killing elements" N, Zn, and Cu are not produced by PISN, so that their sub-Solar abundance with
respect to iron persists in environments polluted by further generations of normal core-collapse
supernovae up to a 50% level. We show that the star BD +80 245, which has [Fe/H]= -2.2, [N/Fe]= -0.79,
[Cu/Fe]=-0.75, and [Zn/Fe]= -0.12 can be the smoking gun of the chemical imprint from very massive
first stars. To this end we acquired new spectra for BD +80 245 and re-analysed those available from
the literature accounting for Non-Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium corrections for Cu. We discuss
how to find more of these missing descendants in ongoing and future surveys to tightly constrain
the mass distribution of the first stars.
