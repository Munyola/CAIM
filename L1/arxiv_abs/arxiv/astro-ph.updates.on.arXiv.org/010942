The faint quasars with $M_{1450}>-24$ mag are known to hold the key to the determination of the ultraviolet
emissivity for the cosmic re-ionization. But only a few have been identified so far because of the
limitations on the survey data. Here, we present the first results of the $z\sim5$ faint quasar survey
with the Infrared Medium-deep Survey (IMS), which covers $\sim100$ deg$^{2}$ areas in $J$-band
to the depths of $J_{\rm AB}\sim23$ mag. To improve selection methods, the medium-band follow-up
imaging has been carried out using the SED camera for QUasars in Early uNiverse (SQUEAN) on the Otto
Struve 2.1 m Telescope. The optical spectra of the candidates were obtained with 8-m class telescopes.
We newly discovered 10 quasars with $-25<M_{1450}<-23$ at $z\sim5$, among which three have been
missed in a previous survey using the same optical data over the same area, implying the necessity
for improvements in high redshift faint quasars selection. We derived photometric redshifts from
the medium-band data, and find that they have high accuracies of $\langle|\Delta z|/(1+z)\rangle=0.016$.
The medium-band-based approach allows us to rule out many of the interlopers that contaminate $\gtrsim20~\%$
of the broad-band-selected quasar candidates. These results suggest that the medium-band-based
approach is a powerful way to identify $z\sim5$ quasars and measure their redshifts at high accuracy
(1-2 %). It is also a cost-effective way to understand the contribution of quasars to the cosmic re-ionization
history.
