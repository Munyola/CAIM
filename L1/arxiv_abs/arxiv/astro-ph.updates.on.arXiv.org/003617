We study the evolution of close binary systems formed by a normal (solar composition), intermediate
mass donor star together with a neutron star. We consider models including irradiation feedback
and evaporation. These non-standard ingredients deeply modify the mass transfer stages of these
binaries. While models that neglect irradiation feedback undergo continuous, long standing mass
transfer episodes, models including these effect suffer a number cycles of mass transfer and detachment.
During mass transfer the systems should reveal themselves as low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs),
whereas when detached they behave as a binary radio pulsars. We show that at these stages irradiated
models are in a Roche lobe overflow (RLOF) state or in a quasi-RLOF state. Quasi-RLOF stars have a
radius slightly smaller than its Roche lobe. Remarkably, these conditions are attained for orbital
period and donor mass values in the range corresponding to a family of binary radio pulsars known
as "redbacks". Thus, redback companions should be quasi-RLOF stars. We show that the characteristics
of the redback system PSR J1723-2837 are accounted for by these models. In each mass transfer cycle
these systems should switch from LMXB to binary radio pulsar states with a timescale of \sim million
years. However, there is recent and fast growing evidence of systems switching on far shorter, human
timescales. This should be related to instabilities in the accretion disc surrounding the neutron
star and/or radio ejection, still to be included in the model having the quasi-RLOF state as a general
condition.
