We present ground-based measurements of the transmission and emission spectra of the hot-Jupiter
WASP-19b in nine spectroscopic channels from 1.25 to 2.35 microns. The measurements are based on
the combined analysis of time-series spectroscopy obtained during two complete transits and two
complete secondary eclipses of the planet. The observations were performed with the MMIRS instrument
on the Magellan II telescope using the technique of multi-object spectroscopy with wide slits.
We compare the transmission and emission data to theoretical models to constrain the composition
and thermal structure of the planet's atmosphere. Our measured transmission spectrum exhibits
a scatter that corresponds to 1.3 scale heights of the planet's atmosphere, which is consistent
with the size of spectral features predicted by theoretical models for a clear atmosphere. We detected
the secondary eclipses of the planet at significances ranging from 2.2 to 14.4 sigma. The secondary
eclipse depths, and the significances of the detections increase towards longer wavelengths.
Our measured emission spectrum is consistent with a 2250 K effectively isothermal 1-D model for
the planet's dayside atmosphere. This model also matches previously published photometric measurements
from the Spitzer Space Telescope and ground-based telescopes. These results demonstrate the important
role that ground-based observations using multi-object spectroscopy can play in constraining
the properties of exoplanet atmospheres, and they also emphasize the need for high-precision measurements
based on observations of multiple transits and eclipses.
