We explore the possibility of using UV spectroscopy in combination with broad-band photometry
as diagnostic tools for understanding the shape of the Initial Mass Function (IMF) in unresolved
stellar populations. Building on our previous work, we extend the Stochastically Lighting Up Galaxies
code (slug) to include a high-resolution UV spectral synthesiser and equivalent width calculation
capabilities. We first gain a qualitative understanding of how UV spectral features behave as the
parameters that define a star cluster in slug (mass, age, extinction, and IMF slope alpha) are changed.
We then exploit Bayesian inference techniques to recover the alpha values for clusters simulated
with slug, using mock observations of these clusters comprised of broad-band photometry and equivalent
width measurements of a selection of UV spectral features. We find some improvement when compared
to attempts using broad-band photometry alone (with the interquartile range of the alpha posterior
PDF shrinking by 32%), although we still do not yet fully break the known degeneracy between the cluster
mass and alpha. Finally, we make predictions about how effective real observations will be by quantifying
our ability to constrain alpha as a function of limiting equivalent width. We find that observations
sensitive to a modest equivalent width of 9 A are sufficient to improve the recovery of the IMF slope
parameter by 32% (interquartile range of posterior PDF median residuals), moving to 39% when we
include all the significant spectral features in the wavelength range 900-3000 A.
