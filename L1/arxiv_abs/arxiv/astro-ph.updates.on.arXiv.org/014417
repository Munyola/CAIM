The Ultra-Long Wavelength (ULW) regime of longer than 10 m (corresponding to frequencies below
30 MHz), remains as the last virtually unexplored window in radio astronomy, and is presently attracting
considerable attention as an area of potentially rewarding studies. However, the opaqueness of
the Earth's ionosphere makes the ULW celestial radio emission very difficult to detect with ground-based
instrumentation. The impact of the ionosphere on ULW radio emission depends on the Solar cycle activities
and varies with time. In addition, the ULW spectrum region is densely populated by intensive artificial
radio frequency interference (RFI). An obvious solution of these problems is to place an ULW radio
telescope in space. However, this solution is expensive and poses non-negligible technological
challenges. An alternative approach is triggered by recent studies showing that the period of post
2020 will be most suitable for exploratory ground-based ULW radio observations due to the expected
'calm' state of the ionosphere; the ionospheric cutoff-frequency could be well below 10 MHz, even
in the day time. In anticipation of this upcoming opportunity, we propose and present in this paper
a concept of an experimental ULW radio array, with the intention of setting it up in Inner Mongolia,
China. This ULW facility will use the infrastructure of the currently operational Miangtu Spectra
Radio Heliograph (MUSER). The proposed ULW array covers the frequency range from 1 to 72 MHz. This
experimental array will be used for exploratory studies of celestial radio emission in the ULW range
of the spectrum.
