In some galaxies, the stars orbiting the supermassive black hole take the form of an eccentric nuclear
disk, in which every star is on a coherent, apsidally-aligned orbit. The most famous example of an
eccentric nuclear disk is the double nucleus of Andromeda, and there is strong evidence for many
more in the local universe. Despite their apparent ubiquity however, a dynamical explanation for
their longevity has remained a mystery: differential precession should wipe out large-scale apsidal-alignment
on a short timescale. Here we identify a new dynamical mechanism which stabilizes eccentric nuclear
disks, and explain for first time the negative eccentricity gradient seen in the Andromeda nucleus.
The stabilizing mechanism drives oscillations of the eccentricity vectors of individual orbits,
both in direction (about the mean body of the disk) and in magnitude. Combined with the negative eccentricity
gradient, the eccentricity oscillations push some stars near the inner edge of the disk extremely
close to the black hole, potentially leading to tidal disruption events. Order of magnitude calculations
predict extremely high rates in recently-formed eccentric nuclear disks ($\sim0.1 - 1$ ${\rm yr}^{-1}
{\rm gal}^{-1}$). Unless the stellar disks are replenished, these rates should decrease with time
as the disk depletes in mass. If eccentric nuclear disks form during gas-rich major mergers, this
may explain the preferential occurrence of tidal disruption events in recently-merged and post-merger
(E+A/K+A) galaxies.
