We construct equilibrium models of uniformly and differentially rotating hybrid hadron-quark
stars using equations of state (EOSs) with a first-order phase transition that gives rise to a third
family of compact objects. We find that the ratio of the maximum possible mass of uniformly rotating
configurations - the supramassive limit - to the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) limit mass
is not EOS-independent, and is between 1.15 and 1.31,in contrast with the value of 1.20 previously
found for hadronic EOSs. Therefore, some of the constraints placed on the EOS from the observation
of the gravitational wave event GW170817 do not apply to hadron-quark EOSs. However, the supramassive
limit mass for the family of EOSs we treat is consistent with limits set by GW170817, strengthening
the possibility of interpreting GW170817 with a hybrid hadron-quark EOSs. We also find that along
constant angular momentum sequences of uniformly rotating stars, the third family maximum and
minimum mass models satisfy approximate EOS-independent relations, and the supramassive limit
of the third family is approximately 16.5 % larger than the third family TOV limit. For differentially
rotating spheroidal stars, we find that a lower-limit on the maximum supportable rest mass is 123
% more than the TOV limit rest mass. Finally, we verify that the recently discovered universal relations
relating angular momentum, rest mass and gravitational mass for turning-point models hold for
hybrid hadron-quark EOSs when uniform rotation is considered, but have a clear dependence on the
degree of differential rotation.
