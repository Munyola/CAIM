It has long been shown that the extreme ultraviolet spectrum of the ionizing stars of H II regions
can be estimated by comparing the observed line emission to detailed models. Because previous observations
of the Galactic Center (GC) had shown that the ionizing spectral energy distribution (SED) of the
local photon field is strange, producing both very low excitation ionized gas (indicative of ionization
by late O stars) but also widespread diffuse emission from atoms too highly ionized to be found in
normal H II regions, all the GC spectra taken by Spitzer's Infrared Spectrograph were downloaded
from the Spitzer Heritage Archive and reduced and analyzed. This paper describes H II region densities
and abundances and tabulates serendipitously discovered candidate planetary nebulae, compact
shocks, and candidate young stellar objects. Models were computed with Cloudy, using SEDs from
Starburst99 plus additional X-rays, and compared to the observed mid-infrared forbidden and hydrogen
recombination lines. Recent theories posit a sequence of star formation in the GC along streams
of gas with density enhancements caused by close encounters with the black hole, Sgr A*. The ages
inferred from the model fits do not agree with this proposed star formation sequence, with Sgr B1,
Sgr C, and the Arches Cluster being all about the same age, around 4.5 Myr old, with similar X-ray requirements.
The fits for the Quintuplet Cluster appear to give a younger age, but that could be caused by higher
energy photons from shocks from stellar winds or from a supernova.
