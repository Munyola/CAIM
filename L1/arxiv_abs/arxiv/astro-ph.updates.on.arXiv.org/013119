In this paper,we report a detailed analysis of recurrent jets originated from a location with emerging,
canceling and converging negative magnetic field at the east edge of NOAA active region AR11166
from 2011 March 09 to 10. The event presented several interesting features. First, a satellite sunspot
appeared and collided with a pre-existing opposite polarity magnetic field and caused a recurrent
solar jet event. Second, the evolution of the jets showed blowout-like nature and standard characteristics.
Third, the satellite sunspot exhibited a motion toward southeast of AR11166 and merged with the
emerging flux near the opposite polarity sunspot penumbra, which afterward, due to flux convergence
and cancellation episodes, caused recurrent jets. Fourth, three of the blowout jets associated
with coronal mass ejections (CMEs), were observed from field of view of the Solar Terrestrial Relations
Observatory. Fifth, almost all the blowout jet eruptions were accompanied with flares or with more
intense brightening in the jet base region, while almost standard jets did not manifest such obvious
feature during eruptions. The most important, the blowout jets were inclined to faster and larger
scale than the standard jets. The standard jets instead were inclined to relative longer-lasting.
The obvious shearing and twisting motions of the magnetic field may be interpreted as due to the shearing
and twisting motions for a blowout jet eruption. From the statistical results, about 30% blowout
jets directly developed into CMEs. It suggests that the blowout jets and CMEs should have a tight
relationship.
