The purpose of this paper is to show that large active regions (ARs) with different magnetic configurations
have different contributions to short-term and long-term variations of the Sun. As a case study,
the complex $\delta$-type AR 12673 and the simple $\beta$-type AR 12674 are investigated in detail.
Since the axial dipole moment at cycle minimum determines the amplitude of the subsequent cycle
and space climate, we have assimilated the individual observed magnetic configurations of these
two ARs into a surface flux transport model to compare their contributions to the axial dipole moment
$D$. We find that AR 12673 has a significant effect on $D$ at the end of the cycle, making it weaker because
of the abnormal and complicated magnetic polarities. An initial strongly positive $D$ ends up with
a strongly negative value. The flare-poor AR 12674 has a greater contribution to the long-term axial
dipole moment than the flare-rich AR 12673. We then carry out a statistical analysis of ARs larger
than 800 $\mu$Hem from 1976 to 2017. We use the flare index FI and define an axial dipole moment index
DI to quantify the effects of each AR on space weather and space climate, respectively. Whereas the
FI has a strong dependence on the magnetic configuration, the DI shows no such dependence. The DI
is mainly determined by the latitudinal location and the latitudinal separation of the positive
and negative magnetic fluxes of the ARs. Simple ARs have the same possibility as complex ARs to produce
big DI values affecting space climate.
