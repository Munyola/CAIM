The chemical influence of luminosity outbursts on the environments of young solar-type stars is
explored. Species are categorised into several types according to their response to the outburst.
The first and second types imply chemical changes only during the outburst (with slightly different
behaviours). These response types are mostly observed close to the star and are caused by icy mantle
evaporation. However, mantles recover after the outburst almost immediately. A notable exception
is benzene ice, which is accumulated on dust surfaces during and after the outburst, so that its abundance
exceeds the pre-outburst level by orders of magnitude. The third type of response is mostly seen
at the disc periphery and implies alteration of abundances during the outburst and preservation
of these `abnormal' abundances for centuries. This behaviour is typical of organic compounds,
like HCOOCH$_3$, CH$_3$CN, CH$_2$CO. Their presence in the dark disc regions can be a manifestation
of the past outburst. CO and CO$_2$ only trace past outbursts at the remote disc regions. The outburst
changes the C/O ratio, but it quickly returns to the pre-outburst value almost everywhere in the
disc. An important factor determining the sensitivity of molecular composition to the outburst
is the dust size distribution. The duration of the pre-outburst stage and of the outburst itself
influence the chemical effects, if the burst duration is shorter than 50 yr and the duration of the
quiescent phase between the bursts is shorter than 100 kyr.
