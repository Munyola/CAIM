A model for terrestrial planets, inclusive of viscous fluid behavior and featuring finite normal
stress differences, is developed. This work offers new insights for the interpretation of planetary
survey data. Evolution equations for poloidal and toroidal motions include gradients of density,
viscosity, and two normal stress moduli. The poloidal field exhibits gradients in the cubic dilation,
which couple non-isotropic pressures to the combined deformation field. In contrast, the toroidal
field exhibits vorticity gradients with magnitudes proportional to the natural time. This holds
even in the absence of material gradients. Consequently, viscosity gradients are not required
to drive toroidal motions. The toroidal field is governed by an inhomogeneous diharmonic equation,
exhibiting dynamic shear localization. The strain-energy density for this model, as a function
of temperature, is found via thermodynamics. Assuming heat transfer with characteristic diffusivity,
a radial model parameterized by thermomechanical competence is found. Shear dislocations, admissible
for thermomechanical competence greater than 1/2, are found to coincide with supershear rupture
speeds for in-plane (Mode II) cracks. This range of thermomechanical competence coincides with
depths in the crust, upper mantle and transition zone where earthquake foci are observed. Consequently,
all seismic sources must exhibit some supershearing component. Observed variations in Earth's
gravity-topography admittance and correlation spectra, and earthquake moment-depth release
are interpreted in light of this hypothetical structure.
