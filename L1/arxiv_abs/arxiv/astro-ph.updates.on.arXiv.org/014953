Accreting neutron stars are one of the main targets for continuous gravitational wave searches,
as asymmetric accretion may lead to quadrupolar deformations, or `mountains', on the crust of the
star, which source gravitational wave emission at twice the rotation frequency. The gravitational
wave torque may also impact on the spin evolution of the star, possibly dictating the currently observed
spin periods of neutron stars in Low Mass X-ray Binaries and leading to the increased spindown rate
observed during accretion in PSR J1023+0038. Previous studies have shown that deformed reaction
layers in the crust of the neutron star lead to thermal and compositional gradients that can lead
to gravitational wave emission. However, there are no realistic constraints on the level of asymmetry
that is expected. In this paper we consider a natural source of asymmetry, namely the magnetic field,
and calculate the density and pressure perturbations that are expected in the crust of accreting
neutron stars. In general we find that only the outermost reaction layers of the neutron star are
strongly perturbed. The mass quadrupole that we estimate is generally small and cannot explain
the increase of spin-down rate of PSR J1023+0038. However, if strong shallow heating sources are
present at low densities in the crust, as cooling observations suggest, these layers will be strongly
perturbed and the resulting quadrupole could explain the observed spindown of PSR J1023+0038,
and lead to observable gravitational wave signals from systems with higher accretion rates.
