We present six years of optical monitoring of the black hole candidate X-ray binary Swift J1357.2-0933,
during and since its discovery outburst in 2011. On these long timescales, the quiescent light curve
is dominated by high amplitude, short term (seconds-days) variability spanning ~ 2 magnitudes,
with an increasing trend of the mean flux from 2012 to 2017 that is steeper than in any other X-ray binary
found to date (0.17 mag/yr). We detected the initial optical rise of the 2017 outburst of Swift J1357.2-0933,
and we report that the outburst began between April 1 and 6, 2017. Such a steep optical flux rise preceding
an outburst is expected according to disk instability models, but the high amplitude variability
in quiescence is not. Previous studies have shown that the quiescent spectral, polarimetric and
rapid variability properties of Swift J1357.2-0933 are consistent with synchrotron emission
from a weak compact jet. We find that a variable optical/infrared spectrum is responsible for the
brightening: a steep, red spectrum before and soon after the 2011 outburst evolves to a brighter,
flatter spectrum since 2013. The evolving spectrum appears to be due to the jet spectral break shifting
from the infrared in 2012 to the optical in 2013, then back to the infrared by 2016-2017 while the optical
remains relatively bright. Swift J1357.2-0933 is a valuable source to study black hole jet physics
at very low accretion rates, and is possibly the only quiescent source in which the optical jet properties
can be regularly monitored.
