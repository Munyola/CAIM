We present $BVI$ surface photometry of 31 dwarf galaxy candidates discovered in a deep image stack
from the KMTNet Supernova Program of $\sim$ 30 square degrees centered on the nearby NGC 2784 galaxy
group. Our final images have a 3$\sigma$ surface brightness detection limit of $\mu_V\approx 28.5$
mag arcsec$^{-2}$. The faintest central surface brightness that we measure is $\mu_{0,V} = 26.1$
mag arcsec$^{-2}$. If these candidates are at the distance of NGC 2784, then they have absolute magnitudes
greater than $M_V = -9.5$ mag and effective radii larger than 170 pc. Their radial number density
decreases exponentially with distance from the center of NGC 2784 until it flattens beyond a radius
of 0.5 Mpc. We interpret the baseline density level to represent the background contamination and
so estimate that 22 of the 31 new candidates are dwarf members of the group. The candidate's average
color, $\langle (B-V)_0\rangle\approx 0.7$, and Sersic structural parameters are consistent
with those parameters for the dwarf populations of other groups. We find that the central population
of dwarfs is redder and brighter than the rest of the population. The measured faint end slope of the
luminosity function, $\alpha\approx-1.33$, is steeper than that of the Local Group but consistent
with published results for other groups. Such comparisons are complicated by systematic differences
among different studies, but will be simpler when the KMTNet survey, which will provide homogenous
data for 15 to 20 groups, is completed.
