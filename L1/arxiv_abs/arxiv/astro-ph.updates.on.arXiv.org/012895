Compensated isocurvature perturbations (CIPs) are opposite spatial fluctuations in the baryon
and dark matter density. They can be generated for example in the curvaton model in the early Universe
but are difficult to observe because their gravitational imprint nearly cancels. We therefore
propose a new measurement method by searching for a spatial modulation of the baryon acoustic oscillation
(BAO) scale that CIPs induce. We find that for a Euclid-like survey the sensitivity is marginally
better than the WMAP cosmic microwave background (CMB) constraint, which exploits the CIP-induced
modulation of the CMB sound horizon. For a cosmic-variance limited BAO survey using emission-line
galaxies up to $z\sim7$ the sensitivity is between stage 3 and stage 4 CMB experiments. These results
include using CIP-galaxy cross-correlations, which improves the sensitivity by a factor of $\sim2-3$
for correlated CIPs. The method could be further improved with an optimal estimator, similarly
to the CMB, and could provide a useful cross-check of other CIP probes. Finally, if CIPs exist, they
can bias cosmological measurements made assuming no CIPs. In particular, they can act as a super-sample
fluctuation of the baryon density and bias measurements of the BAO scale. For modern BAO surveys,
the largest 1$\sigma$ isotropic (2$\sigma$ radial) CIP fluctuation allowed by Planck's 95\% bound
could bias BAO measurements of $H(z)$ by 1\% (6.6\%), partially reducing the tension with the local
$H_0$ measurements from 3.1$\sigma$ to 2.7$\sigma$ (0.6$\sigma$).
