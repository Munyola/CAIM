The rest-frame UV spectra of three recent tidal disruption events (TDEs), ASASSN-14li, PTF15af
and iPTF16fnl display strong nitrogen emission lines but weak or undetectable carbon lines. In
these three objects, the upper limits of the C III] $\lambda 1908$/N III] $\lambda 1750$ ratio are
about two orders of magnitude lower than those of quasars, suggesting a high abundance ratio of [N/C].
With detailed photoionization simulations, we demonstrate that $C^{2+}$ and $N^{2+}$ are formed
in the same zone, so the C III]/N III] ratio depends only moderately on the physical conditions in
the gas and weakly on the shape of the ionizing continuum. There are smaller than $0.5$ dex variations
in the line ratio over wide ranges of gas densities and ionization parameters at a given metallicity.
This allows a robust estimate of the relative abundance ratio nitrogen to carbon. We derive a relative
abundance ratio of [N/C]$>1.5$ for ASASSN-14li, and even higher for PTF15af and iPTF16fnl. This
suggests that the broad line region in those TDE sources is made of nitrogen-enhanced core material
that falls back at later times. Based on stellar evolution models, the lower limit of the disrupted
star should be larger than 0.6M$_{\sun}$. The chemical abundance of the line emitting gas gives
a convincing evidence that the flares origin from stellar tidal disruptions. The coincidence of
the weakness of the X-ray emission with the strong broad absorption lines in PTF15af, iPTF16fnl
and the strong X-ray emission without such lines in ASASSN-li14 are in analogy to quasars with and
without broad absorption lines.
