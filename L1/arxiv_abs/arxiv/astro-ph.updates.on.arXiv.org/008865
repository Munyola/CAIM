Recent observations of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) have allowed claims for statistical
anomalies in the behaviour of the CMB fluctuations to be made. Although the statistical significance
of these remain only at the $\sim2-3\sigma$ significance level, the fact that there are many different
anomalies, several of which support a possible deviation from statistical isotropy, warrants
the search for models affording a common mechanism to generate them.The goal of this paper is to investigate
whether all these anomalies could originate from non-Gaussianity and to determine which properties
such non-Gaussian models should have. We present a simple isotropic, non-Gaussian class of toy-models
which can reproduce six heavily debated anomalies. We compare the presence of anomalies in simulated
toy-model maps as well as Gaussian maps. We find that the following anomalies which are also found
in Planck data, are commonly occuring in the toy-model maps: (1) Large scale hemispherical asymmetry
(large scale dipolar modulation), (2) small scale hemispherical asymmetry (alignment of the spatial
distribution of CMB power over all scales $\ell=[2,1500]$) , (3) a strongly non-Gaussian hot or
cold spot, (4) a low power spectrum amplitude for $\ell<30$, including specifically (5) a low quadrupole
and an unusual alignment between the quadrupole and the octopole, and (6) parity asymmetry of the
lowest multipoles. We remark that this class of toy-models resembles models of primordial non-Gaussianity
characterized by strongly scale-dependent $g_{NL}$-like trispectra.
