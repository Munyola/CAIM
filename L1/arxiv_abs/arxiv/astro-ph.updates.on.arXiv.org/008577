We present a new, probabilistic method for determining the systemic proper motions of Milky Way
(MW) ultra-faint satellites in the Dark Energy Survey (DES). We utilize the superb photometry from
the first public data release (DR1) of DES to select candidate members, and cross-match them with
the proper motions from $Gaia$ DR2. We model the candidate members with a mixture model (satellite
and MW) in spatial and proper motion space. This method does not require prior knowledge of satellite
membership, and can successfully determine the tangential motion of most of the DES satellites.
With our method we present measurements of the following satellites that lack spectroscopic follow-up:
Columba~I, Eridanus~III, Grus~II, Phoenix~II, Pictor~I, Reticulum~III, and Tucana~IV, the
majority of which are the first systemic proper motion measurements. We compare these to the predictions
of Large Magellanic Cloud satellites and to the vast polar structure. With the high precision DES
photometry we conclude that most of the newly identified member stars are very metal-poor ([Fe/H]
$\lesssim -2$) similar to other ultra-faint dwarf galaxies, while Reticulum III is likely more
metal-rich. We also find potential members in the following satellites that might indicate their
overall proper motion: Cetus~II, Kim~2/Indus~I, Horologium~II, and Tucana~V; however, due to
the small number of members in each satellite, spectroscopic follow-up observations are necessary
to determine the systemic proper motion in these satellites.
