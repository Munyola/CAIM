In the next decade, new ground-based Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) experiments such as Simons
Observatory (SO), CCAT-prime, and CMB-S4 will increase the number of detectors observing the CMB
by an order of magnitude or more, dramatically improving our understanding of cosmology and astrophysics.
These projects will deploy receivers with as many as hundreds of thousands of transition edge sensor
(TES) bolometers coupled to Superconducting Quantum Interference Device (SQUID)-based readout
systems. It is well known that superconducting devices such as TESes and SQUIDs are sensitive to
magnetic fields. However, the effects of magnetic fields on TESes are not easily predicted due to
the complex behavior of the superconducting transition, which motivates direct measurements
of the magnetic sensitivity of these devices. We present comparative four-lead measurements of
the critical temperature versus applied magnetic field of AlMn TESes varying in geometry, doping,
and leg length, including Advanced ACT (AdvACT) and POLARBEAR-2/Simons Array bolometers. Molybdenum-copper
bilayer ACTPol TESes are also tested and are found to be more sensitive to magnetic fields than the
AlMn devices. We present an observation of weak-link-like behavior in AlMn TESes at low critical
currents. We also compare measurements of magnetic sensitivity for time division multiplexing
SQUIDs and frequency division multiplexing microwave rf-SQUIDs. We discuss the implications
of our measurements on the magnetic shielding required for future experiments that aim to map the
CMB to near-fundamental limits.
