Very-high-energy (VHE; $>$ 100 GeV) gamma-ray emission from the blazar RGB J2243+203 was discovered
with the VERITAS Cherenkov telescope array, during the period between 21 and 24 December 2014. The
VERITAS energy spectrum from this source can be fit by a power law with a photon index of $4.6 \pm 0.5$,
and a flux normalization at 0.15 TeV of $(6.3 \pm 1.1) \times 10^{-10} ~ \textrm{cm}^{-2} \textrm{s}^{-1}
\textrm{TeV}^{-1}$. The integrated \textit{Fermi}-LAT flux from 1 GeV to 100 GeV during the VERITAS
detection is $(4.1 \pm 0.8) \times 10^{\textrm{-8}} ~\textrm{cm}^{\textrm{-2}}\textrm{s}^{\textrm{-1}}$,
which is an order of magnitude larger than the four-year-averaged flux in the same energy range reported
in the 3FGL catalog, ($4.0 \pm 0.1 \times 10^{\textrm{-9}} ~ \textrm{cm}^{\textrm{-2}}\textrm{s}^{\textrm{-1}}$).
The detection with VERITAS triggered observations in the X-ray band with the \textit{Swift}-XRT.
However, due to scheduling constraints \textit{Swift}-XRT observations were performed 67 hours
after the VERITAS detection, not simultaneous with the VERITAS observations. The observed X-ray
energy spectrum between 2 keV and 10 keV can be fitted with a power-law with a spectral index of $2.7
\pm 0.2$, and the integrated photon flux in the same energy band is $(3.6 \pm 0.6) \times 10^{-13}
~\textrm{cm}^{-2} \textrm{s}^{-1}$. EBL model-dependent upper limits of the blazar redshift
have been derived. Depending on the EBL model used, the upper limit varies in the range from z $<~0.9$
to z $<~1.1$.
