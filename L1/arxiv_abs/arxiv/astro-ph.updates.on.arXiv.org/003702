We take the end result of smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations of star formation which
include feedback from photoionisation and stellar winds and evolve them for a further 10Myr using
$N$-body simulations. We compare the evolution of each simulation to a control run without feedback,
and to a run with photoionisation feedback only. In common with previous work, we find that the presence
of feedback prevents the runaway growth of massive stars, and the resulting star-forming regions
are less dense, and preserve their initial substructure for longer. The addition of stellar winds
to the feedback produces only marginal differences compared to the simulations with just photoionisation
feedback. We search for mass segregation at different stages in the simulations; before feedback
is switched on in the SPH runs, at the end of the SPH runs (before $N$-body integration) and during
the $N$-body evolution. Whether a simulation is primordially mass segregated (i.e. before dynamical
evolution) depends extensively on how mass segregation is defined, and different methods for measuring
mass segregation give apparently contradictory results. Primordial mass segregation is also
less common in the simulations when star formation occurs under the influence of feedback. Further
dynamical mass segregation can also take place during the subsequent (gas-free) dynamical evolution.
Taken together, our results suggest that extreme caution should be exercised when interpreting
the spatial distribution of massive stars relative to low-mass stars in simulations.
