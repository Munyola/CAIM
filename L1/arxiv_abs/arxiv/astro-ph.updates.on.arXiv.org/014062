Observational cosmology has become an important laboratory for testing General Relativity, with
searches for modified gravity forming a significant portion of the science case for existing and
future surveys. In this paper, we illustrate how future measurements of the Cosmic Microwave Background
(CMB) temperature and polarization anisotropies can be combined with large galaxy surveys to improve
constraints on modified gravity using the technique of Sunyaev Zel'dovich (SZ) tomography. SZ
tomography uses the correlations between the kinetic/polarized SZ contributions to the small-angular
scale CMB and the distribution of structure measured in a galaxy redshift survey to reconstruct
the remote dipole and quadrupole fields, e.g. the CMB dipole and quadrupole observed throughout
the Universe. We compute the effect of a class of modifications of gravity on the remote dipole and
quadrupole fields, illustrating that these observables combine a number of the desirable features
of existing probes. We then perform a fisher forecast of constraints on a two-parameter class of
modifications of gravity for next-generation CMB experiments and galaxy surveys. By incorporating
information from the reconstructed remote dipole and quadrupole fields, we find that it is possible
to improve the constraints on this model by a factor of $\sim 3$ beyond what is possible with a galaxy
survey alone. In the absence of a prior on galaxy bias, the improvement can be far greater. We conclude
that SZ tomography is a promising method for testing gravity with future cosmological datasets.
