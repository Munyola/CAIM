An earlier analysis of the Milky Way Star Cluster (MWSC) catalogue revealed an apparent lack of old
(> 1 Gyr) open clusters in the solar neighbourhood (< 1 kpc). To fill this gap we undertook a
search for hitherto unknown star clusters, assuming that the missing old clusters reside at high
Galactic latitudes |b|> 20{\deg}. We were looking for stellar density enhancements using a
star count algorithm on the 2MASS point source catalogue. To increase the contrast between potential
clusters and the field, we applied filters in colour-magnitude space according to typical colour-magnitude
diagrams of nearby old open clusters. The subsequent comparison with lists of known objects allowed
us to select thus far unknown cluster candidates. For verification they were processed with the
standard pipeline used within the MWSC survey for computing cluster membership probabilities
and for determining structural, kinematic, and astrophysical parameters. In total we discovered
782 density enhancements, 522 of which were classified as real objects. Among them 139 are new open
clusters with ages 8.3 < log (t [yr]) < 9.7, distances d < 3 kpc, and distances from the Galactic
plane 0.3 < Z < 1 kpc. This new sample has increased the total number of known high latitude open
clusters by about 150%. Nevertheless, we still observe a lack of older nearby clusters up to 1 kpc
from the Sun. This volume is expected to still contain about 60 unknown clusters that probably escaped
our detection algorithm, which fails to detect sparse overdensities with large angular size.
