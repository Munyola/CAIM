NGC 6229 is a relatively massive outer halo globular cluster that is primarily known for exhibiting
a peculiar bimodal horizontal branch morphology. Given the paucity of spectroscopic data on this
cluster, we present a detailed chemical composition analysis of 11 red giant branch members based
on high resolution (R ~ 38,000), high S/N (> 100) spectra obtained with the MMT-Hectochelle instrument.
We find the cluster to have a mean heliocentric radial velocity of -138.1$_{-1.0}^{+1.0}$ km s$^{\rm
-1}$, a small dispersion of 3.8$_{-0.7}^{+1.0}$ km s$^{\rm -1}$, and a relatively low (M/L$_{\rm
V}$)$_{\rm \odot}$ = 0.82$_{-0.28}^{+0.49}$. The cluster is moderately metal-poor with <[Fe/H]>
= -1.13 dex and a modest dispersion of 0.06 dex. However, 18% (2/11) of the stars in our sample have
strongly enhanced [La,Nd/Fe] ratios that are correlated with a small (~0.05 dex) increase in [Fe/H].
NGC 6229 shares several chemical signatures with M 75, NGC 1851, and the intermediate metallicity
populations of omega Cen, which lead us to conclude that NGC 6229 is a lower mass iron-complex cluster.
The light elements exhibit the classical (anti-)correlations that extend up to Si, but the cluster
possesses a large gap in the O-Na plane that separates first and second generation stars. NGC 6229
also has unusually low [Na,Al/Fe] abundances that are consistent with an accretion origin. A comparison
with M 54 and other Sagittarius clusters suggests that NGC 6229 could also be the remnant core of a
former dwarf spheroidal galaxy.
