Under the assumption of a flat Lambda-CDM cosmology, recent data from the Planck satellite point
toward a Hubble constant that is in tension with that measured by gravitational lens time delays
and by the local distance ladder. Prosaically, this difference could arise from unknown systematic
uncertainties in some of the measurements. More interestingly -- if systematics were ruled out
-- resolving the tension would require a departure from the flat Lambda-CDM cosmology, introducing
for example a modest amount of spatial curvature, or a non-trivial dark energy equation of state.
To begin to address these issues, we present here an analysis of the gravitational lens RXJ1131-1231
that is improved in one particular regard: we examine the issue of systematic error introduced by
an assumed lens model density profile. We use more flexible gravitational lens models with baryonic
and dark matter components, and find that the exquisite Hubble Space Telescope image with thousands
of intensity pixels in the Einstein ring contains sufficient information to constrain these more
flexible models. The total uncertainty on the time-delay distance is 6.5% for a single system, including
the uncertainty over the two lens models considered. We thus proceed to combine our improved time-delay
distance measurements with the WMAP9 and Planck posteriors. In an open Lambda-CDM model, the data
for RXJ1131-1231 in combination with Planck favor a flat universe with Omega_k=-0.01+/-0.02 (68%
CI). In a flat wCDM model, the combination of RXJ1131-1231 and Planck yields w=-1.55^{+0.19}_{-0.21}
(68% CI).
