We use the largest sample to date of spectroscopic SN Ia distances and redshifts to look for evidence
in the Hubble diagram of large scale outflows caused by local voids suggested to exist at z<0.15.
Our sample combines data from the Pantheon sample with the Foundation survey and the most recent
release of lightcurves from the Carnegie Supernova Project to create a sample of 1295 SNe over a redshift
range of 0.01<z<2.26. We make use of an inhomogeneous and isotropic Lemaitre-Tolman-Bondi metric
to model a void in the SN Ia distance-redshift relation. We conclude that the SN luminosity distance-redshift
relation is inconsistent at the 4-5 sigma confidence level with large local underdensities (|delta|
> 20%, where the density contrast delta = Delta rho /rho) proposed in some galaxy count studies, and
find no evidence of a change in the Hubble constant corresponding to a void with a sharp edge in the
redshift range 0.023<z<0.15. With empirical precision of sigma_H_0 = 0.60%, we conclude that the
distance ladder measurement is not affected by local density contrasts, in agreement with cosmic
variance of sigma_H_0 = 0.42% predicted from simulations of large-scale structure. Given that
uncertainty in the distance ladder value is sigma_H_0=2.2%, this does not affect the Hubble tension.
We derive a 5 sigma constraint on local density contrasts on scales larger than 69 megaparsec h^-1
of delta < 27%. The presence of local structure does not appear to impede the possibility of measuring
the Hubble constant to 1% precision.
