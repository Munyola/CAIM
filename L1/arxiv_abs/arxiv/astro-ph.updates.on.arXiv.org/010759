We report the discovery of VVV-WIT-07, an unique and intriguing variable source presenting a sequence
of recurrent dips with a likely deep eclipse in July 2012. The object was found serendipitously in
the near-IR data obtained by the VISTA Variables in the V\'ia L\'actea (VVV) ESO Public Survey. Our
analysis is based on VVV variability, multicolor, and proper motion (PM) data. Complementary data
from the VVV eXtended survey (VVVX) as well as archive data and spectroscopic follow-up observations
aided in the analysis and interpretation of VVV-WIT-07. A search for periodicity in the VVV Ks-band
light curve of VVV-WIT-07 results in two tentative periods at P~322 days and P~170 days. Colors and
PM are consistent either with a reddened MS star or a pre-MS star in the foreground disk. The near-IR
spectra of VVV-WIT-07 appear featureless, having no prominent lines in emission or absorption.
Features found in the light curve of VVV-WIT-07 are similar to those seen in J1407 (Mamajek's object),
a pre-MS K5 dwarf with a ring system eclipsing the star or, alternatively, to KIC 8462852 (Boyajian's
star), an F3 IV/V star showing irregular and aperiodic dips in its light curve. Alternative scenarios,
none of which is fully consistent with the available data, are also briefly discussed, including
a young stellar object, a T Tauri star surrounded by clumpy dust structure, a main sequence star eclipsed
by a nearby extended object, a self-eclipsing R CrB variable star, and even a long-period, high-inclination
X-ray binary.
