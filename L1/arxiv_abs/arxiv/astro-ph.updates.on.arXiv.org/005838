The state of supranuclear matter in compact star remains puzzling, and it is argued that pulsars
could be strangeon stars. What if binary strangeon stars merge? This kind of merger could result
in the formation of a hyper-massive strangeon star, accompanied by bursts of gravitational waves
and electromagnetic radiation (and even strangeon kilonova explained in the paper). The tidal
polarizability of binary strangeon stars is different from that of binary neutron stars, because
a strangeon star is self-bound on surface by fundamental strong force while a neutron star by the
gravity, and their equations of state are different. Our calculation shows that the tidal polarizability
of merging binary strangeon stars is favored by GW170817. Three kinds of kilonovae (i.e., of neutron,
quark and strangeon) are discussed, and the light curve of the kilonova AT 2017gfo following GW170817
could be explained by considering the decaying strangeon nuggets and remnant star spin-down. Additionally,
the energy ejected to the fireball around the nascent remnant strangeon star, being manifested
as a Gamma-ray burst (GRB), is calculated. It is found that, after a promote burst, an X-ray plateau
could follow in a timescale of $10^{2-3}$ s. Certainly, the results could be tested also by further
observational synergies between gravitational wave detectors (e.g., aLIGO) and X-ray telescopes
(e.g., Chinese HXMT and eXTP), and especially if the detected gravitational wave form is checked
by peculiar equation of state provided by the numerical relativistical simulation.
