We use particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations to study the nonlinear evolution of ion velocity space
instabilities in an idealized problem in which a background velocity shear continuously amplifies
the magnetic field. We simulate the astrophysically relevant regime where the shear timescale
is long compared to the ion cyclotron period, and the plasma beta is ~ 1-100. The background field
amplification in our calculation is meant to mimic processes such as turbulent fluctuations or
MHD-scale instabilities. The field amplification continuously drives a pressure anisotropy
with the perpendicular pressure larger than the parallel pressure, and the plasma becomes unstable
to the mirror and ion cyclotron instabilities. In all cases, the nonlinear state is dominated by
the mirror instability, not the ion cyclotron instability, and the plasma pressure anisotropy
saturates near the threshold for the linear mirror instability. The magnetic field fluctuations
initially undergo exponential growth but saturate in a secular phase in which the fluctuations
grow on the same timescale as the background magnetic field (with \delta B ~ 0.3 <B> in the secular
phase). At early times, the ion magnetic moment is well-conserved but once the fluctuation amplitudes
exceed \delta B ~ 0.1 <B>, the magnetic moment is no longer conserved but instead changes on
a timescale comparable to that of the mean magnetic field. We discuss the implications of our results
for low-collisionality astrophysical plasmas, including the near-Earth solar wind and low-luminosity
accretion disks around black holes.
