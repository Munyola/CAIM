Cosmic filaments are the channel through which galaxy groups assemble their mass. Cosmic connectivity,
namely the number of filaments connected to a given group, is therefore expected to be an important
ingredient in shaping group properties. The local connectivity is measured in COSMOS around X-Ray
detected groups between redshift 0.5 and 1.2. To this end, large-scale filaments are extracted
using the accurate photometric redshifts of the COSMOS2015 catalogue in two-dimensional slices
of thickness 120 comoving Mpc centred on the group's redshift. The link between connectivity, group
mass and the properties of the brightest group galaxy (BGG) is investigated. The same measurement
is carried out on mocks extracted from the lightcone of the hydrodynamical simulation Horizon-AGN
in order to control systematics. More massive groups are on average more connected. At fixed group
mass in low-mass groups, BGG mass is slightly enhanced at high connectivity, while in high mass groups
BGG mass is lower at higher connectivity. Groups with a star-forming BGG have on average a lower connectivity
at given mass. From the analysis of the Horizon-AGN simulation, we postulate that different connectivities
trace different paths of group mass assembly: at high group mass, groups with higher connectivity
are more likely to have grown through a recent major merger, which might be in turn the reason for the
quenching of the BGG. Future large-field photometric surveys, such as Euclid and LSST, will be able
to confirm and extend these results by probing a wider mass range and a larger variety of environment.
