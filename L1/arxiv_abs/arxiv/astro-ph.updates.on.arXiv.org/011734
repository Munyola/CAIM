The Scattered Disk Objects (SDOs) are thought to be a small fraction of the ancient population of
leftover planetesimals in the outer solar system that were gravitationally scattered by the giant
planets and have managed to survive primarily by capture and sticking in Neptune's exterior mean
motion resonances (MMRs). In order to advance understanding of the role of MMRs in the dynamics of
the SDOs, we investigate the phase space structure of a large number of Neptune's MMRs in the semi-major
axis range 33--140~au by use of Poincar\'e sections of the circular planar restricted three body
model for the full range of particle eccentricity pertinent to SDOs. We find that, for eccentricities
corresponding to perihelion distances near Neptune's orbit, distant MMRs have stable widths that
are surprisingly large and of similar size to those of the closer-in MMRs. We identify a phase-shifted
second resonance zone that exists in the phase space at planet-crossing eccentricities but not
at lower eccentricities; this second resonance zone plays an important role in the dynamics of SDOs
in lengthening their dynamical lifetimes. Our non-perturbative measurements of the sizes of the
stable resonance zones provide an explanation for the prominence of the $N$:1 sequence of MMRs over
the $N$:2, $N$:3 sequences and other MMRs in the population statistics of SDOs, yield a theoretical
understanding of the outer boundary of SDOs at perihelion distance near 36~au, and also provide
a tool to more easily identify resonant objects.
