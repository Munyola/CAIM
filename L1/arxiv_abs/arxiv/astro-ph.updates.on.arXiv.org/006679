Optical fiber modal noise is a limiting factor for high precision spectroscopy signal-to-noise
in the near-infrared and visible. Unabated, especially when using highly coherent light sources
for wavelength calibration, modal noise can induce radial velocity (RV) errors that hinder the
discovery of low-mass (and potentially Earth-like) planets. Previous research in this field has
found sufficient modal noise mitigation through the use of an integrating sphere, but this requires
extremely bright light sources, a luxury not necessarily afforded by the next generation of high-resolution
optical spectrographs. Otherwise, mechanical agitation, which "mixes" the fiber's modal patterns
and allows the noise to be averaged over minutes-long exposures, provides some noise reduction
but the exact mechanism behind improvement in signal-to-noise and RV drift has not been fully explored
or optimized by the community. Therefore, we have filled out the parameter space of modal noise agitation
techniques in order to better understand agitation's contribution to mitigating modal noise and
to discover a better method for agitating fibers. We find that modal noise is best suppressed by the
quasi-chaotic motion of two high-amplitude agitators oscillating with varying phase for fibers
with large core diameters and low azimuthal symmetry. This work has subsequently influenced the
design of a fiber agitator, to be installed with the EXtreme PREcision Spectrograph, that we estimate
will reduce modal-noise-induced RV error to less than 3.2 cm/s.
