We investigate a global extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) wave associated with a coronal mass ejection
(CME)-driven shock on 2017 September 10. The EUV wave is transmitted by north- and south-polar coronal
holes (CHs), which is observed by the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) and Solar Terrestrial Relations
Observatory A (STEREO-A) from opposite sides of the Sun. We obtain key findings on how the EUV wave
interacts with multiple coronal structures, and on its connection with the CME-driven shock: (1)
the transmitted EUV wave is still connected with the shock that is incurvated to the Sun, after the
shock has reached the opposite side of the eruption; (2) the south CH transmitted EUV wave is accelerated
inside an on-disk, low-density region with closed magnetic fields, which implies that an EUV wave
can be accelerated in both open and closed magnetic field regions; (3) part of the primary EUV wavefront
turns around a bright point (BP) with a bipolar magnetic structure when it approaches a dim, low-density
filament channel near the BP; (4) the primary EUV wave is diffused and apparently halted near the
boundaries of remote active regions (ARs) that are far from the eruption, and no obvious AR related
secondary waves are detected; (5) the EUV wave extends to an unprecedented scale of ~360{\deg} in
latitudes, which is attributed to the polar CH transmission. These results provide insights into
the effects of coronal density and magnetic field distributions on the evolution of an EUV wave,
and into the connection between the EUV wave and the associated CME-driven shock.
