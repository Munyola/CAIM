We present Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) resolved observations of molecular
gas in galaxies up to $z=0.35$ to characterise the role of global galactic dynamics on the global
interstellar medium (ISM) properties. These observations consist of a sub-sample of 39 galaxies
taken from the Valpara\'iso ALMA Line Emission Survey (VALES). From the CO($J=1-0)$ emission line,
we quantify the kinematic parameters by modelling the velocity fields. We find that the IR luminosity
increases with the rotational to dispersion velocity ratio ($V_{\rm rot}/\sigma_v$, corrected
for inclination). We find a dependence between $V_{\rm rot}/\sigma_v$ and the [CII]/IR ratio,
suggesting that the so-called `[CII] deficit' is related to the dynamical state of the galaxies.
We find that global pressure support is needed to reconcile the dynamical mass estimates with the
stellar masses in our systems with low $V_{\rm rot}/\sigma_v$ values. The star formation rate (SFR)
is weakly correlated with the molecular gas fraction ($f_{\rm H_2}$) in our sample, suggesting
that the release of gravitational energy from cold gas may not be the main energy source of the turbulent
motions seen in the VALES galaxies. By defining a proxy of the `star formation efficiency' parameter
as the SFR divided by the CO luminosity (SFE$'\equiv$ SFR/L$'_{\rm CO}$), we find a constant SFE$'$
per crossing time ($t_{\rm cross}$). We suggest that $t_{\rm cross}$ may be the controlling timescale
in which the star formation occurs in dusty $z\sim0.03-0.35$ galaxies.
