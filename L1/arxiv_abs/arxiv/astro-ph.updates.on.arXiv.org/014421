The radius of the L chondrite parent body, its formation time, and its evolution history are determined
by fitting theoretical models to empirical data of radioisotopic chronometers for L chondrites.
A simplified evolution model for the L chondrite parent body is constructed considering sintering
of the initially porous material, temperature dependent heat conductivity, and an insulating
regolith layer. Such models are fitted to thermochronological data of five meteorites for which
precise data for the Hf-W and U-Pb-Pb thermochronometers have been published. A set of parameters
for the L chondrite parent body is found that yields excellent agreement (within error bounds) between
a thermal evolution model and thermochonological data. Empirical cooling rate data also agree
with the model results within error bounds such that there is no conflict between cooling rate data
and the onion-shell model. Two models are found to be compatible with the presently available empirical
data: One model with a radius of 115 km and a formation time of 1.89 Ma after CAI formation, another
model with 160 km radius and formation time of 1.835 Ma. The central temperature of the smaller body
remains well below the Ni,Fe-FeS eutectic melting temperature and is consistent with the apparent
non-existence of primitive achondrites related to the L chondrites. For the bigger model incipient
melting in the central core region is predicted which opens the possibility that primitive achondrites
related to L chondrites could be found.
