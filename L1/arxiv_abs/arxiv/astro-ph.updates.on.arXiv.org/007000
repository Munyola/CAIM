The detection of highly ionized metal absorption lines in the X-ray spectra of the Galactic X-ray
binaries (XRBs) implies the distribution of hot gas along the sightline toward the background sources.
However, the origin of this hot gas is still unclear: it can arise in the hot interstellar medium (ISM),
or is intrinsic to the XRBs. In this paper, we present an XMM-Newton survey of the OVII absorption
lines in the spectra of Galactic XRBs. A total of 33 XRBs were selected, with 29 low mass XRBs and 4 high
mass XRBs. At more than 3$\sigma$ threshold, OVII absorption line was detected in 16 targets, among
which 4 were newly discovered in this work. The average line equivalent width (EW) is centered around
$\sim$ 20 m\AA. Additionally we do not find strong correlations between the OVII EWs and the Galactic
neutral absorption N$_{\rm H}$, the Galactic coordinates or the distance of background targets.
Such non-correlation may suggest the contamination of the circumstellar material, or the lack
of constrains on the line Doppler-b parameter. We also find regardless the direction of the XRBs,
the OVII absorption lines were always detected when the flux of the background XRBs reach a certain
level, suggesting a uniform distribution of this hot gas. We estimate a ratio of 0.004 --- 0.4 between
hot and neutral phase of the interstellar medium. This is the second paper in the series following
Fang et al. 2015, in which we focused on the local OVII absorption lines detected in the background
AGN spectra. Detailed modeling of the hot ISM distribution will be investigated in a future paper.
