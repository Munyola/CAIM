Large, complex, active regions may produce multiple flares within a certain period of one or two
days. These flares could occur in the same location with similar morphologies, commonly referred
to as homologous flares. In 2011 September, active region NOAA 11283 produced a pair of homologous
flares on the 6th and 7th, respectively. Both of them were white-light (WL) flares, as captured by
the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory in visible continuum
at 617.3 nm which is believed to originate from the deep solar atmosphere.We investigate the WL emission
of these X-class flares with HMIs seeing-free imaging spectroscopy. The durations of impulsive
peaks in the continuum are about 4 minutes. We compare the WL with hard X-ray (HXR) observations for
the September 6 flare and find a good correlation between the continuum and HXR both spatially and
temporally. In absence of RHESSI data during the second flare on September 7, the derivative of the
GOES soft X-ray is used and also found to be well correlated temporally with the continuum. We measure
the contrast enhancements, characteristic sizes, and HXR fluxes of the twin flares, which are similar
for both flares, indicating analogous triggering and heating processes. However, the September
7 flare was associated with conspicuous sunquake signals whereas no seismic wave was detected during
the flare on September 6. Therefore, this comparison suggests that the particle bombardment may
not play a dominant role in producing the sunquake events studied in this paper.
