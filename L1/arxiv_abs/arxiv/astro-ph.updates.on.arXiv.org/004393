Quasars at high redshift provide direct information on the mass growth of supermassive black holes
and, in turn, yield important clues about how the Universe evolved since the first (Pop III) stars
started forming. Yet even basic questions regarding the seeds of these objects and their growth
mechanism remain unanswered. The anticipated launch of eROSITA and ATHENA is expected to facilitate
observations of high-redshift quasars needed to resolve these issues. In this paper, we compare
accretion-based supermassive black hole growth in the concordance LCDM model with that in the alternative
Friedmann-Robertson Walker cosmology known as the R_h=ct universe. Previous work has shown that
the timeline predicted by the latter can account for the origin and growth of the > 10^9 M_sol highest
redshift quasars better than that of the standard model. Here, we significantly advance this comparison
by determining the soft X-ray flux that would be observed for Eddington-limited accretion growth
as a function of redshift in both cosmologies. Our results indicate that a clear difference emerges
between the two in terms of the number of detectable quasars at redshift z > 6, raising the expectation
that the next decade will provide the observational data needed to discriminate between these two
models based on the number of detected high-redshift quasar progenitors. For example, while the
upcoming ATHENA mission is expected to detect ~0.16 (i.e., essentially zero) quasars at z ~ 7 in R_h=ct,
it should detect ~160 in LCDM---a quantitatively compelling difference.
