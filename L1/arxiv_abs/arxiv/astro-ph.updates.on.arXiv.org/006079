Context. Interplanetary (IP) shocks are known to be accelerators of energetic charged particles
observed in-situ in the heliosphere. However, the acceleration of near-relativistic electrons
by shocks in the interplanetary medium is often questioned. On 9 August 2011 a Corotating Interaction
Region (CIR) passed STEREO B (STB) that resulted in a flux increase in the electron and ion channels
of the Solar Electron and Proton Telescope (SEPT). Because electron measurements in the few keV
to several 100 keV range rely on the so-called magnet foil technique, which is utilized by SEPT, ions
can contribute to the electron channels. Aims. We aim to investigate whether the flux increase in
the electron channels of SEPT during the CIR event on 9 August 2011 is caused by ion contamination
only. Methods. We compute the SEPT response functions for protons and helium utilizing an updated
GEANT4 model of SEPT. The CIR energetic particle ion spectra for protons and helium are assumed to
follow a Band function in energy per nucleon with a constant helium to proton ratio. Results. Our
analysis leads to a helium to proton ratio of 16.9% and a proton flux following a Band function with
the parameters I_0 = 1.24 10^4 / (cm2 s sr MeV/nuc.), E_c = 79 keV/nuc. and spectral indices of \gamma_1
= -0.94 and \gamma_2 = -3.80 which are in good agreement with measurements by the Suprathermal Ion
Telescope (SIT) aboard STB. Conclusions. Since our results explain the SEPT measurements, we conclude
that no significant amount of electrons were accelerated between 55 keV and 425 keV by the CIR.
