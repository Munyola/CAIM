We study the evolution of cosmological perturbations around a homogeneous and isotropic background
in the framework of the non-minimal torsion-matter coupling extension of $f(T)$ gravity. We are
concerned with the effects of the non-minimal coupling term on the growth of matter overdensities.
Under the quasi-static approximation, we derive the equation which governs the evolution of matter
density perturbations, and it is shown that the effective gravitational coupling 'constant' acquires
an additional contribution due to the non-minimal matter-torsion coupling term. In this way, this
result generalizes those previously obtained for the growth of matter overdensities in the case
of minimal $f(T)$ gravity. In order to get a feeling of our results we apply them to the important case
of a power-law coupling function, which we assume to be the responsible for the late-time accelerated
expansion in the dark energy regime. Thereby, analytic solutions for the matter density perturbation
equation in the regime of dark matter dominance and the dark energy epoch are obtained, along with
a complete numerical integration of this equation. In particular, we show that this model predicts
a growth index larger than those obtained for $\Lambda$CDM model, indicating therefore a smaller
growth rate. Concomitantly, we show that the model at hand is potentially capable in alleviating
the existing $\sigma_{8}$-tension, being that it can provide us a $f\sigma_{8}$ prediction which
is $\sim 4-5$ per cent below the respective prediction of concordance model.
