Characterizing a microlensing planet is done from modeling an observed lensing light curve. In
this process, it is often confronted that solutions of different lensing parameters result in similar
light curves, causing difficulties in uniquely interpreting the lens system, and thus understanding
the causes of different types of degeneracy is important. In this work, we show that incomplete coverage
of a planetary perturbation can also result in degenerate solutions even for events where the planetary
signal is detected with a high level of statistical significance. We demonstrate the degeneracy
for an actually observed event OGLE-2012-BLG-0455/MOA-2012-BLG-206. The peak of this high-magnification
event $(A_{\rm max}\sim400)$ exhibits very strong deviation from a point-lens model with $\Delta\chi^{2}\gtrsim4000$.
From detailed modeling of the light curve, we find that the deviation can be explained by four distinct
solutions, i.e., two very different sets of solutions, each with a two-fold degeneracy. While the
two-fold (so-called ``close/wide'') degeneracy is well-understood, the degeneracy between
the radically different solutions is not previously known. The model light curves of this degeneracy
differ substantially in the parts that were not covered by observation, indicating that the degeneracy
is caused by the incomplete coverage of the perturbation. It is expected that the frequency of the
degeneracy introduced in this work will be greatly reduced with the improvement of the current lensing
survey and follow-up experiments and the advent of new surveys.
