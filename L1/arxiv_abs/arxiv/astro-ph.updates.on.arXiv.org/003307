Clouds have an important role in the atmospheres of planetary bodies. It is expected that, like all
the planetary bodies in our solar system, exoplanet atmospheres will also have substantial cloud
coverage, and evidence is mounting for clouds in a number of hot Jupiters. In order to better characterise
planetary atmospheres we need to consider the effects these clouds will have on the observed broadband
transmission spectra. Here we examine the expected cloud condensate species for hot Jupiter exoplanets
and the effects of various grain sizes and distributions on the resultant transmission spectra
from the optical to infrared, which can be used as a broad framework when interpreting exoplanet
spectra. We note that significant infrared absorption features appear in the computed transmission
spectrum, the result of vibrational modes between the key species in each condensate, which can
potentially be very constraining. While it may be hard to differentiate between individual condensates
in the broad transmission spectra, it may be possible to discern different vibrational bonds, which
can distinguish between cloud formation scenarios such as condensate clouds or photochemically
generated species. Vibrational mode features are shown to be prominent when the clouds are composed
of small sub-micron sized particles and can be associated with an accompanying optical scattering
slope. These infrared features have potential implications for future exoplanetary atmosphere
studies conducted with JWST, where such vibrational modes distinguishing condensate species
can be probed at longer wavelengths.
