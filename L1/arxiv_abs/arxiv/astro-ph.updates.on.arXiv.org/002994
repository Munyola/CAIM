The ALMA North America Prototype Antenna was awarded to the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory
(SAO) in 2011. SAO and the Academia Sinica Institute of Astronomy & Astrophysics (ASIAA), SAO's
main partner for this project, are working jointly to relocate the antenna to Greenland to carry
out millimeter and submillimeter VLBI observations. This paper presents the work carried out on
upgrading the antenna to enable operation in the Arctic climate by the GLT Team to make this challenging
project possible, with an emphasis on the unexpected telescope components that had to be either
redesigned or changed. Five-years of inactivity, with the antenna laying idle in the desert of New
Mexico, coupled with the extreme weather conditions of the selected site in Greenland have it necessary
to significantly refurbish the antenna. We found that many components did need to be replaced, such
as the antenna support cone, the azimuth bearing, the carbon fiber quadrupod, the hexapod, the HVAC,
the tiltmeters, the antenna electronic enclosures housing servo and other drive components, and
the cables. We selected Vertex, the original antenna manufacturer, for the main design work, which
is in progress. The next coming months will see the major antenna components and subsystems shipped
to a site of the US East Coast for test-fitting the major antenna components, which have been retrofitted.
The following step will be to ship the components to Greenland to carry out VLBI and single dish observations.
Antenna reassembly at Summit Station should take place during the summer of 2018.
