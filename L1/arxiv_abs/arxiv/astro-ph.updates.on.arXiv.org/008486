Many theoretical models predict that quasar driven outflows account for the observed quenching
of star formation in massive galaxies. There is growing observational evidence for quasar-launched
massive outflows at z>6, while the details of outflow-host galaxy interaction remain obscure.
In this paper, we study the feedback around the highest redshift quasar in the BlueTides simulation,
the largest volume cosmological hydrodynamic simulation so far carried out. We present predictions
for gas outflows around the brightest $z = 7.54$ quasar which hosts the most massive black hole in
the simulation volume, which has grown to black hole mass $6.7\times 10^{8}{\rm M}_\odot$ consistent
with the current record holder for high-z quasars. We introduce a method to identify and trace the
gas outflowing from the halo. We find that the total mass of the outflow gas is about $3.6\times 10^{9}{\rm
M}_\odot$, constituting 6\% of the total gas in the halo. The outflow gas contains a cold, dense molecular
component with mass about $2.6\times 10^{8}{\rm M}_\odot$, that originates from the inner region
of the halo, within a few kpc of the central black hole. The velocities of the outflow gas reach thousands
of km/s, within which the molecular component has mass averaged outward radial velocity of $1300$
km/s, consistent with observations. The averaged outflow rate is about $200-300 {\rm M}_\odot/yr$,
with the outflowing gas mainly in a hotter ($T \sim 10^7$ K) and lower density state than the average
of the host halo gas.
