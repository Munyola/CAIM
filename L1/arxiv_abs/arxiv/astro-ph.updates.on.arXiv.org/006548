In this study, we numerically investigated the orbital evolution of cometary dust particles, with
special consideration of the initial size frequency distribution (SFD) and different evolutionary
tracks according to initial orbit and particle shape. We found that close encounters with planets
(mostly Jupiter) are the dominating factor determining the orbital evolution of dust particles.
Therefore, the lifetimes of cometary dust particles (~250 thousand years) are shorter than the
Poynting-Robertson lifetime, and only a small fraction of large cometary dust particles can be
transferred into orbits with small values of a. The exceptions are dust particles from 2P/Encke
and, potentially, active asteroids that have little interaction with Jupiter. We also found that
the effect of dust shape, mass density, and SFD were not critical in the total mass supply rate to the
Interplanetary Dust Particle (IDP) cloud complex when these quantities are confined by observations
of zodiacal light brightness and SFD around the Earth's orbit. When we incorporate a population
of fluffy aggregates discovered in the Earth's stratosphere and the coma of 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko
within the initial ejection, the initial SFD measured at the comae of comets (67P and 81P/Wild 2)
can produce the observed SFD around the Earth's orbit. Considering the above effects, we derived
the probability of mutual collisions among dust particles within the IDP cloud for the first time
in a direct manner via numerical simulation and concluded that mutual collisions are mostly ignorable.
