We investigate sets of random variables that can be arranged sequentially such that a given variable
only depends conditionally on its immediate predecessor. For such sets, we show that the full joint
probability distribution may be expressed exclusively in terms of uni- and bivariate marginals.
Under the assumption that the CMB power spectrum likelihood only exhibits correlations within
a banded multipole range, \Delta l, we apply this expression to two outstanding problems in CMB likelihood
analysis. First, we derive a statistically well-defined hybrid likelihood estimator, merging
two independent (e.g., low- and high-l) likelihoods into a single expression that properly accounts
for correlations between the two. Applying this expression to the WMAP likelihood, we verify that
the effect of correlations on cosmological parameters in the transition region is negligible in
terms of cosmological parameters for WMAP; the largest relative shift seen for any parameter is
0.06\sigma. However, because this may not hold for other experimental setups (e.g., for different
instrumental noise properties or analysis masks), but must rather be verified on a case-by-case
basis, we recommend our new hybridization scheme for future experiments for statistical self-consistency
reasons. Second, we use the same expression to improve the convergence rate of the Blackwell-Rao
likelihood estimator, reducing the required number of Monte Carlo samples by several orders of
magnitude, and thereby extend it to high-l applications.
