We use simulations to build an analytic probability distribution for the asphericity in the satellite
distribution around Local Group (LG) type galaxies in the Lambda Cold Dark Matter (LCDM) paradigm.
We use this distribution to estimate the atypicality of the satellite distributions in the LG even
when the underlying simulations do not have enough systems fully resembling the LG in terms of its
typical masses, separation and kinematics. We demonstrate the method using three different simulations
(Illustris-1, Illustris-1-Dark and ELVIS) and a number of satellites ranging from 11 to 15. Detailed
results differ greatly among the simulations suggesting a strong influence of the typical DM halo
mass, the number of satellites and the simulated baryonic effects. However, there are three common
trends. First, at most $2\%$ of the pairs are expected to have satellite distributions with the same
asphericity as the LG; second, at most $80\%$ of the pairs have a halo with a satellite distribution
as aspherical as in M31; and third, at most $4\%$ of the pairs have a halo with satellite distribution
as planar as in the MW. These quantitative results place the LG at the level of a $3\sigma$ outlier
in the LCDM paradigm. We suggest that understanding the reasons for this atypicality requires quantifying
the asphericity probability distribution as a function of halo mass and large scale environment.
The approach presented here can facilitate that kind of study and other comparisons between different
numerical setups and choices to study satellites around LG pairs in simulations.
