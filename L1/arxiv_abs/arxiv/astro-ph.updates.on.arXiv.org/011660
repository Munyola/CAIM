Context. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been proven to perform fast classification
and detection on natural images and have potential to infer astrophysical parameters on the exponentially
increasing amount of sky survey imaging data. The inference pipeline can be trained either from
real human-annotated data or simulated mock observations. Until now star cluster analysis was
based on integral or individual resolved stellar photometry. This limits the amount of information
that can be extracted from cluster images. Aims. Develop a CNN-based algorithm aimed to simultaneously
derive ages, masses, and sizes of star clusters directly from multi-band images. Demonstrate CNN
capabilities on low mass semi-resolved star clusters in a low signal-to-noise ratio regime. Methods.
A CNN was constructed based on the deep residual network (ResNet) architecture and trained on simulated
images of star clusters with various ages, masses, and sizes. To provide realistic backgrounds,
M31 star fields taken from the PHAT survey were added to the mock cluster images. Results. The proposed
CNN was verified on mock images of artificial clusters and has demonstrated high precision and no
significant bias for clusters of ages $\lesssim$3Gyr and masses between 250 and 4,000 ${\rm M_\odot}$.
The pipeline is end-to-end, starting from input images all the way to the inferred parameters; no
hand-coded steps have to be performed: estimates of parameters are provided by the neural network
in one inferential step from raw images.
