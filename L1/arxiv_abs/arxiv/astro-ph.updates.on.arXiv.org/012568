The large number of new planets expected from wide-area transit surveys means that follow-up transmission
spectroscopy studies of their atmospheres will be limited by the availability of telescope assets.
We argue that telescopes covering a broad range of apertures will be required, with even 1m-class
instruments providing a potentially important contribution. Survey strategies that employ automated
target selection will enable robust population studies. As part of such a strategy, we propose a
decision metric to pair the best target to the most suitable telescope, and demonstrate its effectiveness
even when only primary transit observables are available. Transmission spectroscopy target selection
need not therefore be impeded by the bottle-neck of requiring prior follow-up observations to determine
the planet mass. The decision metric can be easily deployed within a distributed heterogeneous
network of telescopes equipped to undertake either broadband photometry or spectroscopy. We show
how the metric can be used either to optimise the observing strategy for a given telescope (e.g. choice
of filter) or to enable the selection of the best telescope to optimise the overall sample size. Our
decision metric can also provide the basis for a selection function to help evaluate the statistical
completeness of follow-up transmission spectroscopy datasets. Finally, we validate our metric
by comparing its ranked set of targets against lists of planets that have had their atmospheres successfully
probed, and against some existing prioritised exoplanet lists.
