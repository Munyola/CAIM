The classical, relativistic thin-disk theory of Novikov and Thorne (NT) predicts a maximum accretion
efficiency of 40% for an optically thick, radiatively efficient accretion disk around a maximally
spinning black hole (BH). However, when a strong magnetic field is introduced to numerical simulations
of thin disks, large deviations in efficiency are observed, in part due to mass and energy carried
by jets and winds launched by the disk or BH spin. The total efficiency of accretion can be significantly
enhanced beyond that predicted by NT but it has remained unclear how the radiative component is affected.
In order to study the effect of a dynamically relevant large-scale magnetic field on radiatively
efficient accretion, we have performed numerical 3D general relativistic - radiative - magnetohydroynamic
(GRRMHD) simulations of a disk with scale height to radius ratio of $H/R~0.1$ around a moderately
spinning BH (a=0.5) using the code HARMRAD. Our simulations are fully global and allow us to measure
the jet, wind, and radiative properties of a magnetically arrested disk (MAD) that is kept thin via
self-consistent transport of energy by radiation using the M1 closure scheme. Our fiducial disk
is MAD out to a radius of ~16R_g and the majority of the total ~13\% efficiency of the accretion flow
is carried by a magnetically driven wind. We find that the radiative efficiency is slightly suppressed
compared to NT, contrary to prior MAD GRMHD simulations with an ad hoc cooling function, but it is
unclear how much of the radiation and thermal energy trapped in the outflows could ultimately escape.
