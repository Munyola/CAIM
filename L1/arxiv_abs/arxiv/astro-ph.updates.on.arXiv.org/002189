Observations have shown that the spatial distribution of satellite galaxies is not random, but
aligned with the major axes of central galaxies. This alignment is dependent on galaxy properties,
such that red satellites are more strongly aligned than blue satellites. Theoretical work done
to interpret this phenomena has found that it is due to the non-spherical nature of dark matter halos.
However, most studies over-predict the alignment signal under the assumption that the central
galaxy shape follows the shape of the host halo. It is also not clear whether the color dependence
of alignment is due to an assembly bias or an evolution effect. In this paper we study these problems
using a cosmological N-body simulation. Subhalos are used to trace the positions of satellite galaxies.
It is found that the shape of dark matter halos are mis-aligned at different radii. If the central
galaxy shares the same shape as the inner host halo, then the alignment effect is weaker and agrees
with observational data. However, it predicts almost no dependence of alignment on the color of
satellite galaxies, though the late accreted subhalos show stronger alignment with the outer layer
of the host halo than their early accreted counterparts. We find that this is due to the limitation
of pure N-body simulations that satellites galaxies without associated subhalos ('orphan galaxies')
are not resolved. These orphan (mostly red) satellites often reside in the inner region of host halos
and should follow the shape of the host halo in the inner region.
