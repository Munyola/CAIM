The origin of thermal optical and UV emission from stellar tidal disruption flares (TDFs) remains
an open question. We present Hubble Space Telescope far-UV (FUV) observations of eight optical/UV
selected TDFs 5-10 years post-peak. Six sources are cleanly detected, showing point-like FUV emission
from the centers of their host galaxies. We discover that the light curves of TDFs from low-mass black
holes ($<10^{6.5} M_\odot$) show significant late-time flattening. Conversely, FUV light curves
from high-mass black hole TDFs are generally consistent with an extrapolation from the early-time
light curve. The observed late-time emission cannot be explained by existing models for early-time
TDF light curves (i.e. reprocessing or circularization shocks), but is instead consistent with
a viscously spreading, unobscured accretion disk. These disk models can only reproduce the observed
FUV luminosities, however, if they are assumed to be thermally and viscously stable, in contrast
to the simplest predictions of alpha-disk theory. For one TDF in our sample, we measure an upper limit
to the UV luminosity that is significantly lower than expectations from theoretical modeling and
an extrapolation of the early-time light curve. This dearth of late-time emission could be due to
a disk instability/state change absent in the rest of the sample. The disk models that explain the
late-time UV detections solve the TDF "missing energy problem" by radiating a rest-mass energy
of ~0.1 solar mass over a period of decades, primarily in extreme UV wavelengths.
