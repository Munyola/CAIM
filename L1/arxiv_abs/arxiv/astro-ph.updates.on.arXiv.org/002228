Giant planet formation in the core accretion (CA) paradigm is predicated by the formation of a core,
assembled by the coagulation of grains and later by planetesimals within a protoplanetary disc.
In contrast, in the disc instability paradigm, giant planet formation is believed to be independent
of core formation: massive self-gravitating gas fragments cool radiatively and collapse as a whole.
We show that giant planet formation in the disc instability model may be also enhanced by core formation
for reasons physically very similar to the CA paradigm. In the model explored here, efficient grain
sedimentation within an initial fragment (rather than the disc) leads to the formation of a core
composed of heavy elements. We find that massive atmospheres form around cores and undergo collapse
as a critical core mass is exceeded, analogous to CA theory. The critical mass of the core to initiate
such a collapse depends on the fragment mass and metallicity, as well as core luminosity, but ranges
from less than 1 to as much as $\sim80$ Earth masses. We therefore suggest that there are two channels
for the collapse of a gaseous fragment to planetary scales within the disc instability model: (i)
H$_2$ dissociative collapse of the entire gaseous clump, and (ii) core-assisted gas capture, as
presented here. We suggest that the first of these two is favoured in metal-poor environments and
for fragments more massive than $\sim 5-10$ Jupiter masses, whereas the second is favored in metal-rich
environments and fragments of lower mass. [Abridged]
