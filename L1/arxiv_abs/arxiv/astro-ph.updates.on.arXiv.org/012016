We present Atacama Large Millimiter/submillimiter Array (ALMA) observations of eight highly
excited CO (J$_{\rm up}>8$) lines and continuum emission in two $z\sim6$ quasars: SDSS J231038.88+185519.7
(hereafter J2310), for which CO(8-7), CO(9-8), and CO(17-16) lines have been observed, and ULAS
J131911.29+095951.4 (J1319), observed in the CO(14-13), CO(17-16) and CO(19-18) lines. The continuum
emission of both quasars arises from a compact region ($< 0.9$ kpc) of the host galaxy. We estimate
dust masses of ${\rm Log(M_{\rm dust}/M_{\odot})=9.08\pm0.06}$ and ${\rm Log(M_{\rm dust}/M_{\odot})=8.7\pm0.2}$
and dust temperatures of ${\rm T_{\rm dust}=41^{+5}_{-3}~K}$ and ${\rm T_{\rm dust}=(55\pm15)~K}$,
respectively for J2310 and J1319. Only CO(8-7) and CO(9-8) in J2310 are detected, while $3\sigma$
upper limits on luminosities are reported for the other lines of both quasars. The CO line luminosities
and upper limits measured in J2310 and J1319 are consistent with those observed in local AGN and starburst
galaxies, and other $z\sim 6$ quasars, except for SDSS J1148+5251 (J1148), the only quasar at $z=6.4$
with a previous CO(17-16) line detection. By computing the CO SLEDs normalised to the CO(6-5) line
and FIR luminosities for J2310, J1319, and J1149, we conclude that different gas heating mechanisms
(X-ray radiation and/or shocks) may explain the different CO luminosities observed in these $z\sim6$
quasar. Future J$_{\rm up}>8$ CO observations will be crucial to understand the processes responsible
for molecular gas excitation in luminous high-$z$ quasars.
