We test different physically motivated models for the spectral shape of the $\gamma$-ray emission
in a sample of 128 blazars with known redshifts detected by the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) at
energies above 50 GeV. The first nine years of LAT data in the energy range from 300 MeV to 2 TeV are analyzed
in order to extend the spectral energy coverage of the 2FHL blazars in our sample. We compare these
spectral data to four leptonic models for the production of $\gamma$-rays through Compton scattering
by a population of electrons with different spectral shapes. In the first three models we consider
Compton scattering in the Thomson regime with different acceleration mechanisms for the electrons.
In the fourth model we consider Compton scattering by a pure power law distribution of electrons
with spectral curvature due to scattering in the Klein-Nishina regime. The majority of blazar $\gamma$-ray
spectra are preferentially fit with either a power law with exponential cut-off in the Thomson regime
or a power law electron distribution with Compton scattering in the Klein-Nishina regime, while
a log-parabola with a low-energy power-law and broken power-law spectral shape in the Thomson regime
appears systematically disfavoured, which is likely a consequence of the restriction to pure Thomson
scattering which we imposed on those models. This finding may be an indication that the $\gamma$-ray
emission from FSRQs in the 2FHL catalog is dominated by Compton scattering of radiation from the
dusty torus, while in the case of BL Lac objects, it is dominated by synchrotron self-Compton radiation.
