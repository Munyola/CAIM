Aims : In this paper we aim at characterizing the properties of stars, dust and gas and their spatial
distribution in the central region of the Seyfert 2 galaxy NGC1068. Method : Our study is based on
NIR (YJH, 0.95-1.650 um, R=350) long slit spectroscopy observations of NGC 1068's central region
with 0.4" spatial resolution. On the one hand we decomposed the observed continuum emission into
three components: hot dust, stars and scattered light from the central engine to measure their contributions
at various distances from the nucleus. On the other hand, we measured fluxes and doppler shifts for
the emission lines present in our spectrum to probe the physical conditions of the Narrow Line Region.
Results : Dust and stars are the main contributors to the continuum, but scattered light from the
central engine is also detected in the very central region. Together, those three components are
well reproducing the observed continuum. The dust emission is well modeled by a 800K blackbody,
is spatially unresolved and only located in the very central region. The stellar content is ubiquitous
and harbours a 250 pc cusp centered around the nucleus, overimposed to a young stellar background.
The spectrum of the cusp is consistent with a 120 Myr single stellar population. Finally, the emission
lines exhibit a significant doppler shift, consistent with a radial outflow from the nucleus in
a biconical structure. The $\left[Fe\ II\right]$ behaviour strongly differs from other lines,
suggesting that it arises from a different structure.
