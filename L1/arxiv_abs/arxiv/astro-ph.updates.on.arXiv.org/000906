We present the results of observations toward a low-mass Class-0/I protostar, [BHB2007]#11 (afterwards
B59#11) at the nearby (d=130 pc) star forming region, Barnard 59 (B59) in the Pipe Nebula with the
Atacama Submillimeter Telescope Experiment (ASTE) 10 m telescope (~22" resolution) in CO(3--2),
HCO+, H13CO+(4--3), and 1.1 mm dust-continuum emissions. We also show Submillimeter Array (SMA)
data in 12CO, 13CO, C18O(2--1), and 1.3 mm dust-continuum emissions with ~5" resolution. From ASTE
CO(3--2) observations, we found that B59#11 is blowing a collimated outflow whose axis lies almost
on the plane of the sky. The outflow traces well a cavity-like structure seen in the 1.1 mm dust-continuum
emission. The results of SMA 13CO and C18O(2--1) observations have revealed that a compact and elongated
structure of dense gas is associated with B59#11, which is oriented perpendicular to the outflow
axis. There is a compact dust condensation with a size of 350x180 AU seen in the SMA 1.3 mm continuum
map, and the direction of its major axis is almost the same as that of the dense gas elongation. The
distributions of 13CO and C18O emission also show the velocity gradients along their major axes,
which are considered to arise from the envelope/disk rotation. From the detailed analysis of the
SMA data, we infer that B59#11 is surrounded by a Keplerian disk with a size of less than 350 AU. In addition,
the SMA CO(2--1) image shows a velocity gradient in the outflow along the same direction as that of
the dense gas rotation. We suggest that this velocity gradient shows a rotation of the outflow.
