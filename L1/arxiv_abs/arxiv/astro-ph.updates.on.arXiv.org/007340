We have obtained multi-epoch observations of 31 O-type stars in the Carina Nebula using the CHIRON
spectrograph on the CTIO/SMARTS 1.5-m telescope. We measure their radial velocities to 1--2 km
s$^{-1}$ precision and present new or updated orbital solutions for the binary systems HD 92607,
HD 93576, HDE 303312, and HDE 305536. We also compile radial velocities from the literature for 32
additional O-type and evolved massive stars in the region. The combined data set shows a mean heliocentric
radial velocity of 0.6 km s$^{-1}$. We calculate a velocity dispersion of $\le9.1$ km s$^{-1}$,
consistent with an unbound, substructured OB association. The Tr 14 cluster shows a marginally
significant 5 km s$^{-1}$ radial velocity offset from its neighbor Tr 16, but there are otherwise
no correlations between stellar position and velocity. The O-type stars in Cr 228 and the South Pillars
region have a lower velocity dispersion than the region as a whole, supporting a model of distributed
massive-star formation rather than migration from the central clusters. We compare our stellar
velocities to the Carina Nebula's molecular gas and find that Tr 14 shows a close kinematic association
with the Northern Cloud. In contrast, Tr 16 has accelerated the Southern Cloud by 10--15 km s$^{-1}$,
possibly triggering further massive-star formation. The expansion of the surrounding H II region
is not symmetric about the O-type stars in radial velocity space, indicating that the ionized gas
is constrained by denser material on the far side.
