NGC 4993 hosts a binary neutron star merger emitting gravitational waves and electromagnetic waves,
GW170817/GRB 170817A. The distance to this galaxy is not well established. We select the globular
cluster candidates from the Hubble Space Telescope/ACS F606W images of NGC 4993 in the archive,
using the structural parameters of the detected sources. The radial number density distribution
of these candidates shows a significant central concentration around the galaxy center at the galactocentric
distance $r<50''$, showing that they are mostly the members of NGC 4993. Also the luminosity function
of these candidates is fit well by a Gaussian function. Therefore the selected candidates at $r<50''$
are mostly considered to be globular clusters in NGC 4993. We derive an extinction-corrected turnover
Vega magnitude in the luminosity function of the globular clusters at $20''<r<50''$, F606W (max)$_0=
25.36\pm0.08$ ($V_0 =25.52\pm0.11$)} mag. Adopting the calibration of the turnover magnitudes
of the globular clusters, $M_V({\rm max})=-7.58\pm0.11$, we derive a distance to NGC 4993, $d=41.65\pm3.00$
Mpc ($(m-M)_0=33.10\pm0.16$). The systematic error of this method can be as large as $\pm0.3$ mag.
This value is consistent with the previous distance estimates based on the fundamental plane relation
and the gravitational wave method in the literature. The distance in this study can be used to constrain
the values of the parameters including the inclination angle of the binary system in the models of
gravitational wave analysis.
