We present a new method to determine the probability distribution of the 3-D shapes of galaxy clusters
from the 2-D images using stereology. In contrast to the conventional approach of combining different
data sets (such as X-rays, Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect and lensing) to fit a 3-D model of a galaxy cluster
for each cluster, our method requires only a single data set, such as X-ray observations or Sunyaev-Zeldovich
effect observations, consisting of sufficiently large number of clusters. Instead of reconstructing
the 3-D shape of an individual object, we recover the probability distribution function (PDF) of
the 3-D shapes of the observed galaxy clusters. The shape PDF is the relevant statistical quantity
which can be compared with the theory and used to test the cosmological models. We apply this method
to publicly available \emph{Chandra} X-ray data of 89 well resolved galaxy clusters. Assuming
ellipsoidal shapes, we find that our sample of galaxy clusters is a mixture of prolate and oblate
shapes, with a preference for oblateness with the most probable ratio of principle axes 1.4 : 1.3
: 1. The ellipsoidal assumption is not essential to our approach and our method is directly applicable
to non-ellipsoidal shapes. Our method is insensitive to the radial density and temperature profiles
of the cluster. Our method is sensitive to the changes in shape of the X-ray emitting gas from inner
to outer regions and we find evidence for variation in the 3-D shape of the X-ray emitting gas with
distance from the centre.
