To understand the galaxy population in clusters today, we should also consider the impact of previous
environments prior to cluster infall, namely preprocessing. We use YZiCS, a hydrodynamic high-resolution
zoom-in simulation of 15 clusters, and focus on the tidal stripping suffered by the dark matter halos
of cluster members due to preprocessing. We find ~48% of today's cluster members were once satellites
of other hosts. This is slightly higher than previous estimates, in part, because we consider not
just group-mass hosts, but hosts of all masses also. Thus, we find the preprocessed fraction is poorly
correlated with cluster mass and is instead related to each cluster's recent mass growth rate. Hosts
less massive than groups are significant contributors, providing more than one-third of the total
preprocessed fraction. We find that halo mass loss is a clear function of the time spent in hosts.
However, two factors can increase the mass loss rate considerably; the mass ratio of a satellite
to its host, and the cosmological epoch when the satellite was hosted. The latter means we may have
previously underestimated the role of high redshift groups. From a sample of heavily tidally stripped
members in clusters today, nearly three quarters were previously in a host. Thus, visibly disturbed
cluster members are more likely to have experienced preprocessing. Being hosted before cluster
infall enables cluster members to experience tidal stripping for extended durations compared
to direct cluster infall and at earlier epochs when hosts were more destructive.
