Since the discovery of the first extrasolar planet more than twenty years ago, we have discovered
nearly four thousand planets orbiting stars other than the Sun. Current observational instruments
(on board the Hubble Space Telescope, Spitzer, and on ground-based facilities) have allowed the
scientific community to obtain important information on the physical and chemical properties
of these planets. However, for a more in-depth characterisation of these worlds, more powerful
telescopes are needed. Thanks to the high sensitivity of their instruments, the next generation
of space observatories (e.g. JWST, ARIEL) will provide observations of unprecedented quality,
allowing us to extract far more information than what was previously possible. Such high quality
observations will provide constraints on theoretical models of exoplanet atmospheres and lead
to a greater understanding of their physics and chemistry. Important modelling efforts have been
carried out during the past few years, showing that numerous parameters and processes (such as the
elemental abundances, temperature, mixing, etc.) are likely to affect the atmospheric composition
of exoplanets and subsequently the observable spectra. In this manuscript, we review the different
parameters that can influence the molecular composition of exoplanet atmospheres. We show that
the high-precision of ARIEL observations will improve our view and characterisation of exoplanet
atmospheres. We also consider future developments that are necessary to improve atmospheric models,
driven by the need to interpret the available observations.
