The secular thickening of a self-gravitating stellar galactic disc is investigated using the dressed
collisionless Fokker-Planck equation and the inhomogeneous multicomponent Balescu-Lenard
equation. The thick WKB limits for the diffusion fluxes are found using the epicyclic approximation,
while assuming that only radially tightly wound transient spirals are sustained by the disc. This
yields simple quadratures for the drift and diffusion coefficients, providing a clear understanding
of the positions of maximum vertical orbital diffusion within the disc, induced by fluctuations
either external or due to the finite number of particles. These thick limits also offer a consistent
derivation of a thick disc Toomre parameter, which is shown to be exponentially boosted by the ratio
of the vertical to radial scale heights. Dressed potential fluctuations within the disc statistically
induce a vertical bending of a subset of resonant orbits, triggering the corresponding increase
in vertical velocity dispersion. When applied to a tepid stable tapered disc perturbed by shot noise,
these two frameworks reproduce qualitatively the formation of ridges of resonant orbits towards
larger vertical actions, as found in direct numerical simulations, but overestimates the time-scale
involved in their appearance. Swing amplification is likely needed to resolve this discrepancy,
as demonstrated in the case of razor-thin discs. Other sources of thickening are also investigated,
such as fading sequences of slowing bars, or the joint evolution of a population of giant molecular
clouds within the disc.
