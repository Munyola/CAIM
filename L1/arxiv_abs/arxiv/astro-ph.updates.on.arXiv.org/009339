SN 2008es is one of the rare cases of a Type II superluminous supernova (SLSN) showing no relatively
narrow features in its early-time spectra, and therefore its powering mechanism is under debate
between circumstellar interaction (CSI) and magnetar spin-down. Late-time data are required
for better constraints. We present optical and near-infrared (NIR) photometry obtained from Gemini,
Keck, and Palomar Observatories from 192 to 554 days after explosion. Only broad H$\alpha$ emission
is detected in a Gemini spectrum at 288 days. The line profile exhibits red-wing attenuation relative
to the early-time spectrum. In addition to the cooling SN photosphere, a NIR excess with blackbody
temperature $\sim1500$ K and radius $\sim10^{16}$ cm is observed. This evidence supports dust
condensation in the cool dense shell being responsible for the spectral evolution and NIR excess.
We favour CSI, with $\sim2$--3 $\textrm{M}_\odot$ of circumstellar material (CSM) and $\sim$10--20
$\textrm{M}_\odot$ of ejecta, as the powering mechanism, which still dominates at our late-time
epochs. Both models of uniform density and steady wind fit the data equally well, with an effective
CSM radius $\sim 10^{15}$ cm, supporting the efficient conversion of shock energy to radiation
by CSI. A low amount ($\lesssim 0.4$ $\textrm{M}_\odot$) of $^{56}$Ni is possible but cannot be
verified yet, since the light curve is dominated by CSI. The magnetar spin-down powering mechanism
cannot be ruled out, but is less favoured because it overpredicts the late-time fluxes and may be
inconsistent with the presence of dust.
