As the first and till date the only one multiple planet hosting dwarf star that is sufficiently cool
to form condensate cloud in it atmosphere, Trappist-1 provides unique opportunity to test the efficiency
of image polarimetry as a tool to detect and characterize exoplanets around L- and late M-dwarfs
and Exomoons around directly imaged self-luminous giant exoplanets. Although scattering of light
by atmospheric dust particles should produce significant amount of linear polarization in the
far optical and near infra-red, the disk-averaged net detectable polarization of the star must
be zero owing to spherical symmetry. However, the transit of its planets would give rise to significant
asymmetry and produce phase-dependent polarization with the peak polarization occurring at the
inner contact points of planetary transit ingress and egress epoch. Adopting the known stellar
and planetary physical parameters and employing a self-consistent cloudy atmosphere model of
M8 dwarf star, the transit polarization profiles and the expected amount of polarization of Trappist-1
during the transit phase of each individual planets as well as that during simultaneous transit
of two planets are presented in this paper. It is emphasized that the amount of polarization expected
is within the detection limit of a few existing facilities. If polarization is detected confirming
the prediction, time resolved image polarimetry will emerge out as a potential tool to detect and
characterize small planets around cloudy ultra-cool dwarfs.
