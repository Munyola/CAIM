The neutral atomic hydrogen (HI) content of spiral galaxies has been observed to vary with environment,
with more HI-deficient spirals residing in high density environments. This can be attributed to
environmental effects such as ram pressure stripping and tidal interactions, which remove HI from
the discs of galaxies. However, some spirals in low-density environments have also been observed
to have relatively low HI mass fractions. The low densities of the Intergalactic Medium and lack
of nearby galaxies in such environments make ram pressure stripping and tidal interactions unlikely
candidates of gas removal. What then could be making these spirals HI deficient? Obreschkow et al.
introduced a parameter-free model for the neutral atomic gas fraction ($f_{atm}$), in a symmetric
equilibrium disc as a function of the global atomic stability parameter ($q$), which depends on
specific angular momentum. In order to examine if this model accounts for HI-deficient galaxies
in low-density environments, we have used the $M_{HI} ~-$ M$_{R}$ scaling relation to select six
HI-deficient spiral galaxies and observed them with the ATCA. By measuring their $f_{atm}$ and
$q$ values we find that the galaxies owe their observed HI deficiencies to low specific angular momenta.
Additionally, we also find that the central HI hole sizes of our sample galaxies are related to their
$q$ values, following the prediction of Obreschkow et al. This result brings to light the importance
of angular momentum in understanding the physics of the interstellar medium in the discs of galaxies
and consequently their evolution.
