Using newly obtained high-resolution data ($R\sim{1\times{10}^{5}}$) from the \textit{Hubble
Space Telescope}, and archival UV data from the \textit{Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer}
we have conducted a detailed UV survey of the three hot, metal-polluted white dwarfs WD0455-282,
WD0621-376, and WD2211-495. Using bespoke model atmospheres we measured $T_{\mathrm{eff}}$,
log $g$, and photospheric abundances for these stars. In conjunction with data from Gaia we measured
masses, radii, and gravitational redshift velocities for our sample of objects. We compared the
measured photospheric abundances with those predicted by radiative levitation theory, and found
that the observed Si abundances in all three white dwarfs, and the observed Fe abundances in WD0621-376
and WD2211-495, were larger than those predicted by an order of magnitude. These findings imply
not only an external origin for the metals, but also ongoing accretion, as the metals not supported
by radiative levitation would sink on extremely short timescales. We measured the radial velocities
of several absorption features along the line of sight to the three objects in our sample, allowing
us to determine the velocities of the photospheric and interstellar components along the line of
sight for each star. Interestingly, we made detections of circumstellar absorption along the line
of sight to WD0455-282 with three velocity components. To our knowledge, this is the first such detection
of multi-component circumstellar absorption along the line of sight to a white dwarf.
