In the age of high-resolution spectroscopic stellar surveys of the Milky Way, the number of stars
with detailed abundances of multiple elements is rapidly increasing. These elemental abundances
are directly influenced by the evolutionary history of the Galaxy, but this can be difficult to interpret
without an absolute timeline of the abundance enrichment. We present age-abundance trends for
[M/H], [{\alpha}/M], and 17 individual elements using a sample of 721 solar neighbourhood Hipparcos
red giant stars observed by APOGEE. These age trends are determined through a Bayesian hierarchical
modelling method presented by Feuillet et al. (2016). We confirm that the [{\alpha}/M]- age relation
in the solar neighbourhood is steep and relatively narrow (0.20 dex age dispersion), as are the [O/M]-
and [Mg/M]-age relations. The age trend of [C/N] is steep and smooth, consistent with stellar evolution.
The [M/H]-age relation has a mean age dispersion of 0.28 dex and a complex overall structure. The
oldest stars in our sample are those with the lowest and highest metallicities, while the youngest
stars are those with solar metallicity. These results provide strong constraints on theoretical
models of Galactic chemical evolution (GCE). We compare them to the predictions of one-zone GCE
mod- els and multi-zone mixtures, both analytic and numerical. These comparisons support the hypothesis
that the solar neighbourhood is composed of stars born at a range of Galactocentric radii, and that
the most metal-rich stars likely migrated from a region with earlier and more rapid star formation
such as the inner Galaxy.
