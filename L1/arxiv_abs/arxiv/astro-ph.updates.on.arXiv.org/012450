The Cosmic Dawn Intensity Mapper (CDIM) will transform our understanding of the era of reionization
when the Universe formed the first stars and galaxies, and UV photons ionized the neutral medium.
CDIM goes beyond the capabilities of upcoming facilities by carrying out wide area spectro-imaging
surveys, providing redshifts of galaxies and quasars during reionization as well as spectral lines
that carry crucial information on their physical properties. CDIM will make use of unprecedented
sensitivity to surface brightness to measure the intensity fluctuations of reionization on large-scales
to provide a valuable and complementary dataset to 21-cm experiments. The baseline mission concept
is an 83-cm infrared telescope equipped with a focal plane of 24 \times 20482 detectors capable of
R = 300 spectro-imaging observations over the wavelength range of 0.75 to 7.5 {\mu}m using Linear
Variable Filters (LVFs). CDIM provides a large field of view of 7.8 deg2 allowing efficient wide
area surveys, and instead of moving instrumental components, spectroscopic mapping is obtained
through a shift-and-stare strategy through spacecraft operations. CDIM design and capabilities
focus on the needs of detecting faint galaxies and quasars during reionization and intensity fluctuation
measurements of key spectral lines, including Lyman-{\alpha} and H{\alpha} radiation from the
first stars and galaxies. The design is low risk, carries significant science and engineering margins,
and makes use of technologies with high technical readiness level for space observations.
