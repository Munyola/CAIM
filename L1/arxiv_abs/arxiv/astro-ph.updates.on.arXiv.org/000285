Some supernovae (SNe) show evidence for mass-loss events taking place prior to their explosions.
Measuring their pre-outburst mass-loss rates provide essential information regarding the mechanisms
that are responsible for these events. Here we present XMM-Newton and Swift X-ray observations
taken after the latest, and presumably the final, outburst of SN 2009ip. We use these observations
as well as new near infra-red and visible light spectra, and published radio and visible light observations
to put six independent order-of-magnitude constrains on the mass-loss rate of the SN progenitor
prior to the explosion. Our methods utilize: the X-ray luminosity, the bound-free absorption,
the H alpha luminosity, the SN rise-time, free-free absorption, and the bolometric luminosity
of the outburst detected prior to the explosion. Assuming spherical mass-loss with a wind density
profile, we estimate that the effective mass-loss rate from the progenitor was between 10^-3 to
10^-2 solar masses per year, over a few years prior to the explosion, with a velocity of ~1000 km/s.
This mass-loss rate corresponds to a total circum stellar matter mass of ~0.04 solar masses, within
6x10^15 cm of the SN. We note that the mass-loss rate estimate based on the H alpha luminosity is higher
by an order of magnitude. This can be explained if the narrow line H alpha component is generated at
radii larger than the shock radius, or if the CSM has an aspherical geometry. We discuss simple geometries
which are consistent with our results.
