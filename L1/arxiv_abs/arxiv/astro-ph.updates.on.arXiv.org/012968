The newly published spectra of protons and helium over time directly measured in space by the AMS-02
experiment for the period 2011--2017 provide a unique opportunity to calibrate ground-based neutron
monitors (NMs). Here, calibration of several stable sealevel NMs (Inuvik, Apatity, Oulu, Newark,
Moscow, Hermanus, Athens) was performed using these spectra. Four modern NM yield functions were
verified: Mi13 (Mishev et al., 2013), Ma16 (Mangeard et al., 2016), CM12 (Caballero-Lopez & Moraal,
2012) and CD00 (Clem & Dorman, 2000), on the basis of the cosmic-ray spectra measured by AMS-02. The
Mi13 yield function was found to realistically represent the NM response to galactic cosmic rays.
CM12 yield function leads to a small skew in the solar cycle dependence of the scaling factor. In contrast,
Ma16 and CD00 yield functions tend to overestimate the NM sensitivity to low-rigidity (<10 GV) cosmic
rays. This effect may be important for an analysis of ground level enhancements, leading to a potential
underestimate of fluxes of solar energetic particles as based on NM data. The Mi13 yield function
is recommended for quantitative analyses of NM data, especially for ground-level enhancements.
The validity the force-field approximation was studied, and it was found that it fits well the directly
measured proton spectra, within a few % for periods of low to moderate activity and up to ~10% for active
periods. The results of this work strengthen and validate the method of the cosmic-ray variability
analysis based on the NM data and yield-function formalism, and improves its accuracy.
