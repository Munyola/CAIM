In Bray and Eldridge (2016) we proposed a simple neutron star kick formula, v kick = {\alpha} ( M ejecta
/ M remnant ) + {\beta} to explain the observed 2D velocities of young single neutron stars. However,
in light of the recent analysis by Janka (2017), we have revisited our basic assumptions and our new
analysis has led to best fit kick values of alpha = 100 km per second and beta = -170 km per second. While
the changes appear significant, the revised values do not change our three fundamental findings,
namely that there is no statistically significant preference for any of the three kick orientations
nor for any of the three initial mass function (IMF) slopes tested, and that populations including
binary stars reproduced the kick distribution better than single star only populations. The reduction
of beta to a negative value, means both alpha and beta can be explained by processes widely accepted
to be present in supernovae, namely conservation of momentum and gravitational attraction. To
further test the validity of the new kick, we have created synthetic populations of runaway star
and double neutron star (DNS) binaries at solar metallicity (Z=0.020) using our best-fit kick.
We find our new kick values create runaway star velocities and DNS period distributions in agreement
with the comparable observational distributions with only the DNS eccentricities in tension with
the observations. From our DNS and BH-BH datasets we estimate a predicted DNS merger rate at Solar
metallicity of 3944 (+1570/-2371) per cubic Gpc per yr and a BH-BH merger rate of 3 (+40/-1) per cubic
Gpc per yr.
