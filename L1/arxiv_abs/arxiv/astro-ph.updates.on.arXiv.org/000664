The solar cycle and its associated magnetic activity are the main drivers behind changes in the interplanetary
environment and the Earth's upper atmosphere (commonly referred to as space weather). These changes
have a direct impact on the lifetime of space-based assets and can create hazards to astronauts in
space. In recent years there has been an effort to develop accurate solar cycle predictions (with
aims at predicting the long-term evolution of space weather), leading to nearly a hundred widely
spread predictions for the amplitude of solar cycle 24. A major contributor to the disagreement
is the lack of direct long-term databases covering different components of the solar magnetic field
(toroidal vs.\ poloidal). Here we use sunspot area and polar faculae measurements spanning a full
century (as our toroidal and poloidal field proxies), to study solar cycle propagation, memory,
and prediction. Our results substantiate predictions based on the polar magnetic fields, whereas
we find sunspot area to be uncorrelated to cycle amplitude unless multiplied by area-weighted average
tilt. This suggests that the joint assimilation of tilt and sunspot area is a better choice (with
aims to cycle prediction) than sunspot area alone, and adds to the evidence in favor of active region
emergence and decay as the main mechanism of poloidal field generation (i.e. the Babcock-Leighton
mechanism). Finally, by looking at the correlation between our poloidal and toroidal proxies across
multiple cycles, we find solar cycle memory to be limited to only one cycle.
