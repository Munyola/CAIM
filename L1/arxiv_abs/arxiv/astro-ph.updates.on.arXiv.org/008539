High Mach number shocks are ubiquitous in interstellar turbulence. The Pencil Code is particularly
well suited to the study of magnetohydrodynamics in weakly compressible turbulence and the numerical
investigation of dynamos because of its high-order advection and time evolution algorithms. However,
the high-order algorithms and lack of Riemann solver to follow shocks make it less well suited to
handling high Mach number shocks, such as those produced by supernovae (SNe). Here, we outline methods
required to enable the code to efficiently and accurately model SNe, using parameters that allow
stable simulation of SN-driven turbulence, in order to construct a physically realistic galactic
dynamo model. These include the resolution of shocks with artificial viscosity, thermal conductivity,
and mass diffusion; the correction of the mass diffusion terms; and generalization of the Courant
condition to include all source terms in the momentum and energy equations. We test our methods with
the numerical solution of the 1D Riemann shock tube (Sod 1978), also extended to a 1D adiabatic shock
with parameters and Mach number relevant to SN shock evolution, including shocks with radiative
losses. We extend our test with the 3D numerical simulation of individual SN remnant evolution for
a range of ambient gas densities typical of the interstellar medium and relate these to the analytical
solutions of Sedov-Taylor (adiabatic) and the snowplough and Cioffi et al. (1988) results incorporating
cooling and heating processes.
