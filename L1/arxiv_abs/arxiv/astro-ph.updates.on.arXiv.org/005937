The formation of satellite systems in circum-planetary discs is considered to be similar to the
formation of rocky planets in a proto-planetary disc, especially Super-Earths. Thus, it is possible
to use systems with large satellites to test formation theories that are also applicable to extrasolar
planets. Furthermore, a better understanding of the origin of satellites might yield important
information about the environment near the growing planet during the last stages of planet formation.
In this work we investigate the formation and migration of the Jovian satellites through N-body
simulations. We simulated a massive, static, low viscosity, circum-planetary disc in agreement
with the minimum mass sub-nebula model prescriptions for its total mass. In hydrodynamic simulations
we found no signs of gaps, therefore type II migration is not expected. Hence, we used analytic prescriptions
for type I migration, eccentricity and inclination damping, and performed N-body simulations
with damping forces added. Detailed parameter studies showed that the number of final satellites
is strong influenced by the initial distribution of embryos, the disc temperature, and the initial
gas density profile. For steeper initial density profiles it is possible to form systems with multiple
satellites in resonance while a flatter profile favours the formation of satellites close to the
region of the Galilean satellites. We show that the formation of massive satellites such as Ganymede
and Callisto can be achieved for hotter discs with an aspect ratio of H/r ~ 0.15 for which the ice line
was located around 30 R_J.
