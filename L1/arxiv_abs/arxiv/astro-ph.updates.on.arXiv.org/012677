We present here multi-band photometry for over 2000 Main-belt asteroids. For each target we report
the probabilistic taxonomy using the measured V-R and V-I colors in combination with a machine-learning
generated decision surface in color-color space. Through this method we classify >85% of our targets
as one the four main Bus-DeMeo complexes: S-, C-, X-, or D-type. Roughly one third of our targets have
a known associated dynamic family with 69 families represented in our data. Within uncertainty
our results show no discernible difference in taxonomic distribution between family members and
non-family members. Nine of the 69 families represented in our observed sample had 20 or more members
present and therefore we investigate the taxonomy of these families in more detail and find excellent
agreement with literature. Out of these 9 well-sampled families, our data show that the Themis,
Koronis, Hygiea, Massalia, and Eunomia families display a high degree of taxonomic homogeneity
and that the Vesta, Flora, Nysa-Polana, and Eos families show a significant level of mixture in taxonomies.
Using the taxonomic purity and the degree of dispersion in observed colors for each of the 9 well-sampled
collisional families we also speculate which of these families potentially originated from a differentiated
parent body and/or is a family with a possible undetermined nested family. Additionally, we obtained
sufficient photometric data for 433 of our targets to extract reliable rotation periods and observe
no obvious correlation between rotation properties and family membership.
