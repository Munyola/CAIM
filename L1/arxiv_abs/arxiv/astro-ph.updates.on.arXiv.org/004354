There is mounting evidence that the IceCube findings cannot be described simply invoking a single
power-law spectrum for cosmic neutrinos. We discuss which are the minimal modifications of the
spectrum that are required by the existing observations and we obtain a universal cosmic neutrino
spectrum, i.e. valid for all neutrino flavors. Our approach to such task can be outlined in three
points: 1) we rely on the throughgoing muon analysis above 200 TeV and on the high-energy starting
events (HESE) analysis below this energy, requiring the continuity of the spectrum; 2) we assume
that cosmic neutrinos are subject to three-flavor neutrino oscillations in vacuum; 3) we make no
assumption on the astrophysical mechanism of production, except for no tau neutrino component
at the source. We test our model using the information provided by HESE shower-like events and by
the lack of double pulses and resonant events. We find that a two power-law spectrum is compatible
with all observations. The model agrees with the standard picture of pion decay as a source of neutrinos,
and indicates a slight preference for a pgamma mechanism of production. We discuss the tension between
the HESE and the throughgoing muons datasets around few tens TeV, focussing on the angular distributions
of the spectra. The expected number of smoking-gun signatures of nu-tau induced events (referred
to as double pulses) is quantified: in the baseline model we predict 0.65 double pulse events in 5.7
years. Uncertainties in the predictions are quantified.
