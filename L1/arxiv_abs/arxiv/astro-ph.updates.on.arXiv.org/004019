We investigate dynamo action in global compressible solar-like convective dynamos in the framework
of mean-field theory. We simulate a solar-type star in a wedge-shaped spherical shell, where the
interplay between convection and rotation self-consistently drives a large-scale dynamo. To
analyze the dynamo mechanism we apply the test-field method for azimuthally ($\phi$) averaged
fields to determine the 27 turbulent transport coefficients of the electromotive force, of which
9 are related to the $\alpha$ tensor. This method has previously been used either in simulations
in Cartesian coordinates or in the geodynamo context and it is applied here for the first time to fully
compressible simulations of solar-like dynamos. We find that the $\phi\phi$-component of the
$\alpha$ tensor does not follow the profile expected from that of kinetic helicity. The turbulent
pumping velocities significantly alter the effective mean flows acting on the magnetic field and
therefore challenge the flux transport dynamo concept. All coefficients are significantly affected
by dynamically important magnetic fields. Quenching as well as enhancement are being observed.
This leads to a modulation of the coefficients with the activity cycle. The temporal variations
are found to be comparable to the time-averaged value and seem to be responsible for a nonlinear feedback
on the magnetic field generation. Furthermore, we quantify the validity of the Parker-Yoshimura
rule for the equatorward propagation of the mean magnetic field in the present case.
