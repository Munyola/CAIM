Reprocessed X-ray radiation carries important information about the structure and physical characteristics
of the material surrounding the supermassive black hole (SMBH) in active galactic nuclei (AGN).
We report here on a newly developed simulation platform, RefleX, which allows to reproduce absorption
and reflection by quasi-arbitrary geometries. We show here the reliability of our approach by comparing
the results of our simulations with existing spectral models such as pexrav, MYTorus and BNTorus.
RefleX implements both Compton scattering on free electrons and Rayleigh scattering and Compton
scattering on bound electrons. We show the effect of bound-electron corrections on a torus geometry
simulated like in MYTorus. We release with this paper the RefleX executable, as well as RXTorus,
a model that assumes absorption and reflection from a torus with a varying ratio of the minor to major
axis of the torus. To allow major flexibility RXTorus is also distributed in three components: absorbed
primary emission, scattered radiation and fluorescent lines. RXTorus is provided for different
values of the abundance, and with (atomic configuration) or without (free-electron configuration)
taking into account Rayleigh scattering and bound electrons. We apply the RXTorus model in both
configurations on the XMM-Newton and NuSTAR spectrum of the Compton-thick AGN NGC 424 and find that
the models are able to reproduce very well the observations, but that the assumption on the bound
or free state of the electrons has significant consequences on the fit parameters.
