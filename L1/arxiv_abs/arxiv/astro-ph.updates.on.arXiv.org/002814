Saturn's moon Iapetus has an orbit in a transition region where the Laplace surface is bending from
the equator to the orbital plane of Saturn. The orbital inclination of Iapetus to the local Laplace
plane is ~8 deg, which is unexpected, because the inclination should be ~0 if Iapetus formed from
a circumplanetary disk on the Laplace surface. It thus appears that some process has pumped up Iapetus's
inclination while leaving its eccentricity near zero (e=0.03 at present). Here we examined the
possibility that Iapetus's inclination was excited during the early solar system instability
when encounters between Saturn and ice giants occurred. We found that the dynamical effects of planetary
encounters on Iapetus's orbit sensitively depend on the distance of the few closest encounters.
In four out of ten instability cases studied here, the orbital perturbations were too large to be
plausible. In one case, Iapetus's orbit was practically unneffected. In the remaining five cases,
the perturbations of Iapetus's inclination were adequate to explain its present value. In three
of these cases, however, Iapetus's eccentricity was excited to 0.1-0.25, and it is not clear whether
it could have been damped to its present value (0.03) by some subsequent process (e.g., tides and
dynamical friction from captured irregular satellites do not seem to be strong enough). Our results
therefore imply that only 2 out of 10 instability cases (~20%) can excite Iapetus's inclination
to its present value (~30% of trials lead to >5 deg) while leaving its orbital eccentricity low.
