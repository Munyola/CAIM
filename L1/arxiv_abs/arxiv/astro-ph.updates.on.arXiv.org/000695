We present VLT/VIMOS IFU observations of an occulting galaxy pair previously discovered in HST
observations. The foreground galaxy is a low-inclination spiral disk, which causes clear attenuation
features seen against the bright bulge and disk of the background galaxy. We find redshifts of $z=0.064
\pm0.003$ and z=0.065 for the foreground and background galaxy respectively. This relatively
small difference does not rule out gravitational interaction between the two galaxies. Emission
line ratios point to a star-forming, not AGN-dominated foreground galaxy. We fit the Cardelli,
Clayton & Mathis (CCM) extinction law to the spectra of individual fibres to derive slope ($R_V$)
and normalization ($A_V$). The normalization agrees with the HST attenuation map and the slope
is lower than the Milky Way relation ($R_V<3.1$), which is likely linked to the spatial sampling
of the disk. We speculate that the values of $R_V$ point to either coherent ISM structures in the disk
larger than usual ($\sim9$ kpc) or higher starting values of $R_V$, indicative of recent processing
of the dust. The foreground galaxy is a low stellar mass spiral ($M_* \sim 3 \times 10^9 M_\odot$)
with a high dust content ($M_{\rm dust} \sim 0.5 \times 10^6 M_\odot$). The dust disk geometry visible
in the HST image would explain the observed SED properties of smaller galaxies: a lower mean dust
temperature, a high dust-to-stellar mass ratio but relatively little optical attenuation. Ongoing
efforts to find occulting pairs with a small foreground galaxies will show how common this geometry
is.
