We age-date the stellar populations associated with 12 historic nearby core-collapse supernovae
(CCSNe) and 2 supernova impostors, and from these ages, we infer their initial masses and associated
uncertainties. To do this, we have obtained new HST imaging covering these CCSNe. Using these images,
we measure resolved stellar photometry for the stars surrounding the locations of the SNe. We then
fit the color-magnitude distributions of this photometry with stellar evolution models to determine
the ages of any young existing populations present. From these age distributions, we infer the most
likely progenitor mass for all of the SNe in our sample. We find ages between 4 and 50 Myr, corresponding
to masses from 7.5 to 59 solar masses. There were no SNe that lacked a young population within 50~pc.
Our sample contains 4 type Ib/c SNe; their masses have a wide range of values, suggesting that the
progenitors of stripped-envelope SNe are binary systems. Both impostors have masses constrained
to be $\lesssim$7.5 solar masses. In cases with precursor imaging measurements, we find that age-dating
and precursor imaging give consistent progenitor masses. This consistency implies that, although
the uncertainties for each technique are significantly different, the results of both are reliable
to the measured uncertainties. We combine these new measurements with those from our previous work
and find that the distribution of 25 core-collapse SNe progenitor masses is consistent with a standard
Salpeter power-law mass function, no upper mass cutoff, and an assumed minimum mass for core-collapse
of 7.5~M$_{\odot}$.
