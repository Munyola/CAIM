To investigate the dynamics of the galaxy cluster A2142, we compile an extended catalog of 2239 spectroscopic
redshifts of sources, including newly measured 237 redshifts, within 30 arcmin from the cluster
center. With the $\sigma$-plateau algorithm from the caustic method, we identify 868 members and
a number of substructures in the galaxy distribution both in the outskirts, out to $\sim$3.5 Mpc
from the cluster center, and in the central region. In the outskirts, one substructure overlaps
a falling clump of gas previously identified in the X-ray band. These substructures suggests the
presence of multiple minor mergers, which are responsible for the complex dynamics of A2142, and
the absence of recent or ongoing major mergers. We show that the distribution of the galaxies in the
cluster core and in several substructures are consistent with the mass distribution inferred from
the weak lensing signal. Moreover, we use spatially-resolved X-ray spectroscopy to measure the
redshift of different regions of the intracluster medium within $\sim$3 arcmin from the cluster
center. We find a ring of gas near the two X-ray cold fronts identified in previous analyses and measure
a velocity of this ring of $810 \pm 330 {\rm km s^{-1}}$ larger than the cluster mean velocity. Our
analysis suggests the presence of another ring surrounding the core, whose velocity is $660 \pm
300 {\rm km s^{-1}}$ larger than the cluster velocity. These X-ray features are not associated to
any optical substructures, and support the core-sloshing scenario suggested in previous work.
