We present CN and CH band measurements for 137 RGB and AGB stars in the Galactic globular cluster M10.
Our measurements come from low resolution spectroscopy taken with the Hydra spectrograph on the
WIYN-3.5m telescope. We use these measurements to identify two populations of stars within the
cluster, a CN-normal and CN-enhanced, and find that in our sample 60% of stars are CN-enhanced. Our
large sample allows us to conduct a detailed analysis on the carbon and nitrogen abundances and the
radial distribution of each population separately. Our analysis of the radial dependence shows
that each population has the same radial distribution in the cluster, which is likely due to the cluster
being dynamically evolved. We also compare our results to other methods of classifying multiple
populations in globular clusters such as the Na-O anti-correlation and the HST pseudo-color magnitude
diagrams. We find that these three methods of identifying multiple populations are in good agreement
with each other for M10 and all lead to an estimate of the fraction of second generation stars approximately
equal to 60%. Among AGB stars, when classified by the CN band, there appears to be a lack of second generation
stars when compared to the RGB stars. However, when classified by [N/Fe], we find a similar 60% of
AGB stars in the second generation. Finally, we use the measured carbon and nitrogen abundances
in RGB stars to study the change of each element with magnitude as stars evolve up the RGB, comparing
the results to globular clusters of similar metallicity, M3 and M13.
