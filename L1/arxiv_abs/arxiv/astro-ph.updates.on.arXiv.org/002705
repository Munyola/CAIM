Deviations from a universal, MW-like, Stellar Initial Mass Function (IMF) have been reported for
distant galaxies, although the physical reason behind the observed variations is still matter
of ongoing debate. In this paper, we present an exploratory study to assess the impact of the proposed
IMF evolution on the statistical galaxy properties, as predicted by the Semi-Analytical model
of galaxy formation and evolution MORGANA. In particular, we test different dependencies for the
IMF shape, as a function of both model galaxy properties (such as star formation rate, velocity dispersion
or stellar mass) and environment, and compare the predicted stellar mass functions and star formation
rate functions with reference runs at fixed IMF. In most cases, MORGANA predictions show deviations
of the order of a few tenths of dex with respect to a run assuming an Universal Kroupa IMF. Among the
proposed IMF variations, an increasing Top-Heavy IMF at increasing star formation rates has the
largest impact on predicted galaxy properties, while most of the models assuming an increasing
Bottom-Heavy IMF at higher masses/velocity dispersion lead to variations in galaxy properties
that are of the same order as the uncertainty on the mass and star formation rate determination. By
comparing the predicted galaxy stellar mass functions, we conclude that the study of the high-mass
end can provide useful constraints to disentangle models assuming an increasing Top-Heavy IMF
in high star forming or Bottom-Heavy IMF in massive systems.
