NASA's Kepler Space Telescope has collected high-precision, high-cadence time series photometry
on 781,590 unique postage-stamp targets across 21 different fields of view. These observations
have already yielded 2,496 scientific publications by authors from 63 countries. The full data
set is now public and available from NASA's data archives, enabling continued investigations and
discoveries of exoplanets, oscillating stars, eclipsing binaries, stellar variability, star
clusters, supernovae, galaxies, asteroids, and much more. In this white paper, we discuss 21 important
data analysis projects which are enabled by the archive data. The aim of this paper is to help new users
understand where there may be important scientific gains left to be made in analyzing Kepler data,
and to encourage the continued use of the archives. With the TESS mission about to start releasing
data, the studies will inform new experiments, new surveys, and new analysis techniques. The Kepler
mission has provided an unprecedented data set with a precision and duration that will not be rivaled
for decades. The studies discussed in this paper show that many of Kepler's contributions still
lie ahead of us, owing to the emergence of complementary new data sets like Gaia, novel data analysis
methods, and advances in computing power. Kepler's unique data archive will provide new discoveries
for years to come, touching upon key aspects of each of NASA's three big astrophysics questions;
How does the universe work? How did we get here? Are we alone?
