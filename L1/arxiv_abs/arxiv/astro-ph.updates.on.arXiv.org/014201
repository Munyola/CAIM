The progenitors of Type IIP supernovae (SNe) are known to be red supergiants, but their properties
are not well determined. We employ hydrodynamical modelling to investigate the explosion characteristics
of eight Type IIP supernovae, and the properties of their progenitor stars. We create evolutionary
models using the {\sc MESA} stellar evolution code, explode these models, and simulate the optical
lightcurves using the {\sc STELLA} code. We fit the optical lightcurves, Fe II 5169\AA\ velocity,
and photospheric velocity, to the observational data. Recent research has suggested that the progenitors
of Type IIP SNe have a zero age main sequence (ZAMS) mass not exceeding $\sim18$ M$_{\odot}$. Our
fits give a progenitor ZAMS mass $\leq18$ M$_{\odot}$ for seven of the supernovae. Where previous
progenitor mass estimates exist, from various sources such as hydrodynamical modelling, multi-wavelength
observations, or semi-analytic calculations, our modelling generally tends towards the lower
mass values. This result is in contrast to results from previous hydrodynamical modelling, but
is consistent with those obtained using general-relativistic radiation-hydrodynamical codes.
We do find that one event, SN 2015ba, has a progenitor whose mass is closer to 24 M$_{\odot}$ , although
we are unable to fit it well. We also derive the amount of $^{56}$Ni required to reproduce the tail
of the lightcurve, and find values generally larger than previous estimates. Overall, we find that
it is difficult to characterize the explosion by a single parameter, and that a range of parameters
is needed.
