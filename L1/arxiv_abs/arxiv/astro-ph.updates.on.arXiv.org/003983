We apply the viscous decretion disc (VDD) model to interpret the infrared disc continuum emission
of 80 Be stars observed in different epochs. In this way, we determined 169 specific disc structures,
namely their density scale, $\rho_0$, and exponent, $n$. We found that the $n$ values range mainly
between $1.5$ and $3.5$, and $\rho_0$ varies between $10^{-12}$ and $10^{-10}\,\mathrm{g\,cm^{-3}}$,
with a peak close to the lower value. Our large sample also allowed us to firmly establish that the
discs around early-type stars are denser than in late-type stars. Additionally, we estimated the
disc mass decretion rates and found that they range between $10^{-12}$ and $10^{-9}\,\mathrm{M_{\odot}\,yr^{-1}}$.
These values are compatible with recent stellar evolution models of fast-rotating stars. One of
the main findings of this work is a correlation between the $\rho_0$ and $n$ values. In order to find
out whether these relations can be traced back to the evolution of discs or have some other origin,
we used the VDD model to calculate temporal sequences under different assumptions for the time profile
of the disc mass injection. The results support the hypothesis that the observed distribution of
disc properties is due to a common evolutionary path. In particular, our results suggest that the
timescale for disc growth, during which the disc is being actively fed by mass injection episodes,
is shorter than the timescale for disc dissipation, when the disc is no longer fed by the star and dissipates
as a result of the viscous diffusion of the disc material.
