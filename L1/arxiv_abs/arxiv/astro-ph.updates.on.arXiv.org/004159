We study the star formation activity of nearby galaxies with bars using a sample of late-type galaxies
at 0.02$\leq z \leq$ 0.05489 and $M_r <-19.5$ from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We compare the physical
properties of strongly and weakly barred galaxies with those of non-barred galaxies that have stellar
mass and redshift distributions similar to barred galaxies. We find that the star formation activity
of strongly barred galaxies probed by starburstiness, $\it{g-r}$, NUV$-r$, and mid-infrared
[3.4]$-$[12] colors is, on average, lower than that of non-barred galaxies. However, weakly barred
galaxies do not show such a difference between barred and non-barred galaxies. The amounts of atomic
and molecular gas in strongly barred galaxies are smaller than those of non-barred galaxies, and
the gas metallicity is higher in strongly barred galaxies than in non-barred galaxies. The gas properties
of weakly barred galaxies again show no difference from those of non-barred galaxies. We stack the
optical spectra of barred and non-barred galaxies in several mass bins and fit to the stacked spectra
with a spectral fitting code, STARLIGHT. We find no significant difference in stellar populations
between barred and non-barred galaxies for both strongly and weakly barred galaxies. Our results
are consistent with the idea that the star formation activity of barred galaxies is enhanced in the
past along with significant gas consumption, and is currently lower than or similar to that of non-barred
galaxies. The past star formation enhancement depends on the strength of bars.
