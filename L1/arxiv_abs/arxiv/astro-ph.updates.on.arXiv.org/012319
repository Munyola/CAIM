Neutrinos play a critical role of transporting energy and changing the lepton density within core-collapse
supernovae and neutron star mergers. The quantum kinetic equations (QKEs) combine the effects
of neutrino-matter interactions treated in classical Boltzmann transport with the neutrino flavor-changing
effects treated in neutrino oscillation calculations. We present a method for extending existing
neutrino interaction rates to full QKE source terms for use in numerical calculations. We demonstrate
the effects of absorption and emission by nucleons and nuclei, electron scattering, electron-positron
pair annihilation, nucleon-nucleon bremsstrahlung, neutrino-neutrino scattering. For the
first time, we include all these collision terms self-consistently in a simulation of the full isotropic
QKEs in conditions relevant to core-collapse supernovae and neutron star mergers. For our choice
of parameters, the long-term evolution of the neutrino distribution function proceeds similarly
with and without the oscillation term, though with measurable differences. We demonstrate that
electron scattering, nucleon-nucleon bremsstrahlung processes, and four-neutrino processes
dominate flavor decoherence in the protoneutron star (PNS), absorption dominates near the shock,
and all of the considered processes except elastic nucleon scattering are relevant in the decoupling
region. Finally, we propose an effective decoherence opacity that at most energies predicts decoherence
rates to within a factor of 10 in our model PNS and within 20% outside of the PNS.
