Models of inflationary magnetogenesis with a coupling to the electromagnetic action of the form
$f^2 F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu}$, are known to suffer from several problems. These include the strong
coupling problem, the back reaction problem and also strong constraints due to Schwinger effect.
We propose a model which resolves all these issues. In our model, the coupling function, $f$, grows
during inflation and transits to a decaying phase post inflation. This evolutionary behaviour
is chosen so as to avoid the problem of strong coupling. By assuming a suitable power law form of the
coupling function, we can also neglect back reaction effects during inflation. To avoid back reaction
post-inflation, we find that the reheating temperature is restricted to be below $ \approx 1.7 \times
10^4$ GeV. The magnetic energy spectrum is predicted to be non-helical and generically blue. The
estimated present day magnetic field strength and the corresponding coherence length taking reheating
at the QCD epoch(150 MeV) are $ 1.4 \times 10^{-12}$ G and $6.1 \times 10^{-4}$ Mpc, respectively.
This is obtained after taking account of nonlinear processing over and above the flux freezing evolution
after reheating. If we consider also the possibility of a non-helical inverse cascade, as indicated
in direct numerical simulations, the coherence length and the magnetic field strength are even
larger. In all cases mentioned above, the magnetic fields generated in our models satisfy the $\gamma$-ray
bound below a certain reheating temperature.
