Since Dirac stated his Large Number Hypothesis the space-time variation of fundamental constants
has been an active subject of research. Here we analyze the possible spatial variation of two fundamental
constants: the fine structure constant {\alpha} and the speed of light c. We study the effects of
such variations on the luminosity distance and on the peak luminosity of Type Ia supernovae (SNe
Ia). For this, we consider the change of each fundamental constant separately and discuss a dipole
model for its variation. Elaborating upon our previous work, we take into account the variation
of the peak luminosity of Type Ia supernovae resulting from the variation of each of these fundamental
constants. Furthermore, we also include the change of the energy release during the explosion,
which was not studied before in the literature. We perform a statistical analysis to compare the
predictions of the dipole model for {\alpha} and c variation with the Union2.1 and JLA compilations
of SNe Ia. For this, we also allow the nuisance parameters of the distance estimator $\mu_0$ and the
cosmological density matter $\Omega_m$ to vary. As a result of our analysis we obtain a first estimate
of the possible spatial variation of the speed of light c. On the other hand, we find that there is no
significant difference between the several phenomenological models studied here and the standard
cosmological model, in which fundamental constants do not vary at all. Thus, we conclude that the
actual set of data of Type Ia supernovae does not allow to verify the hypothetical spatial variation
of fundamental constants.
