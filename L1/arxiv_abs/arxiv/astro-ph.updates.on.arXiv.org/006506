Aerodynamic theory predicts that dust grains in protoplanetary disks will drift radially inward
on comparatively short timescales. In this context, it has long been known that the presence of a
gap opened by a planet can alter the dust dynamics significantly. In this paper, we carry out a systematic
study employing long-term numerical simulations aimed at characterizing the critical particle-size
for retention outside a gap as a function of particle size and for various key parameters defining
the protoplanetary disk model. To this end, we perform multifluid hydrodynamical simulations
in two dimensions, including different dust species, which we treat as pressureless fluids. We
initialize the dust outside of the planet's orbit and study under which conditions dust grains are
able to cross the gap carved by the planet. In agreement with previous work, we find that the permeability
of the gap depends both on dust dynamical properties and the gas disk structure: while small dust
follows the viscously accreting gas through the gap, dust grains approaching a critical size are
progressively filtered out. Moreover, we introduce and compute a depletion factor that enables
us to quantify the way in which higher viscosity, smaller planet mass, or a more massive disk can shift
this critical size to larger values. Our results indicate that gap-opening planets may act to deplete
the inner reaches of protoplanetary disks of large dust grains -- potentially limiting the accretion
of solids onto forming terrestrial planets.
