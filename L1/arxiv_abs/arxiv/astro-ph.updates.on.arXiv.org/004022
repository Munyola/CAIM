We present a first instalment of the MUSE-Wide survey, covering an area of 22.2 arcmin$^2$ (corresponding
to $\sim$20% of the final survey) in the CANDELS/Deep area of the Chandra Deep Field South. We use
the MUSE integral field spectrograph at the ESO VLT to conduct a full-area spectroscopic mapping
at a depth of 1h exposure time per 1 arcmin$^2$ pointing. We searched for compact emission line objects
using our newly developed LSDCat software based on a 3-D matched filtering approach, followed by
interactive classification and redshift measurement of the sources. Our catalogue contains 831
distinct emission line galaxies with redshifts ranging from 0.04 to 6. Roughly one third (237) of
the emission line sources are Lyman $\alpha$ emitting galaxies with $3 < z < 6$, only four of which
had previously measured spectroscopic redshifts. At lower redshifts 351 galaxies are detected
primarily by their [OII] emission line ($0.3 \lesssim z \lesssim 1.5$), 189 by their [OIII] line
($0.21 \lesssim z \lesssim 0.85$), and 46 by their H$\alpha$ line ($0.04 \lesssim z \lesssim 0.42$).
Comparing our spectroscopic redshifts to photometric redshift estimates from the literature,
we find excellent agreement for $z<1.5$ with a median $\Delta z$ of only $\sim 4 \times 10^{-4}$ and
an outlier rate of 6%, however a significant systematic offset of $\Delta z = 0.26$ and an outlier
rate of 23% for Ly$\alpha$ emitters at $z>3$. Together with the catalogue we also release 1D PSF-weighted
extracted spectra and small 3D datacubes centred on each of the 831 sources.
