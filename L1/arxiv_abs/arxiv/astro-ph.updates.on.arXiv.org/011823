Ultra diffuse galaxies are a population of extended galaxies but with relatively low luminosities.
The origin of these objects remains unclear, largely due to the observational challenges of the
low surface brightness Universe. We present here a detailed stellar population analysis of a relatively
isolated UDG, DGSAT I, based on spectroscopic data from the Keck Cosmic Web Imager integral field
unit. The star formation history of DGSAT I seems to be extended, with a mean luminosity-weighted
age of ~3 Gyr, in agreement with previous photometric studies. However, we find a very high [Mg/Fe]
abundance ratio, which is extreme even in the context of the highly alpha-enhanced massive ellipticals
and ultra-faint dwarfs. The [Mg/Fe]-enhancement of DGSAT I appears to be 10 times higher than the
most magnesium-enhanced stellar systems discovered to date, and suggests that the chemical enrichment
of this object was dominated by core-collapse supernovae. Intriguingly, this breaks the canonical
relation between [Mg/Fe] and star formation time-scale. With a measured velocity dispersion of
56 +/- 10 km/s, DGSAT I also shows a high mass-to-light ratio, which indicates that it is highly dark
matter-dominated. The metal-poor conditions of DGSAT I may have enhanced the formation of massive
stars, while at the same time, additional mechanisms are needed to prevent iron-rich yields from
being recycled into stars. These results suggest that some ultra-diffuse galaxies could have experienced
chemical enrichment episodes similar to the first building blocks of galaxies.
