We present the molecular cloud properties of N55 in the Large Magellanic Cloud using $^{12}$CO(1-0)
and $^{13}$CO(1-0) observations obtained with Atacama Large Millimeter Array. We have done a detailed
study of molecular gas properties, to understand how the cloud properties of N55 differ from Galactic
clouds. Most CO emission appears clumpy in N55, and molecular cores that have YSOs show larger linewidths
and masses. The massive clumps are associated with high and intermediate mass YSOs. The clump masses
are determined by local thermodynamic equilibrium and virial analysis of the $^{12}$CO and $^{13}$CO
emissions. These mass estimates lead to the conclusion that, (a) the clumps are in self-gravitational
virial equilibrium, and (b) the $^{12}$CO(1-0)-to-H$_2$ conversion factor, X$_{\rm CO}$, is
6.5$\times$10$^{20}$cm$^{-2}$(K km s$^{-1}$)$^{-1}$. This CO-to-H$_2$ conversion factor
for N55 clumps is measured at a spatial scale of $\sim$0.67 pc, which is about two times higher than
the X$_{\rm CO}$ value of Orion cloud at a similar spatial scale. The core mass function of N55 clearly
show a turnover below 200M$_{\odot}$, separating the low-mass end from the high-mass end. The low-mass
end of the $^{12}$CO mass spectrum is fitted with a power law of index 0.5$\pm$0.1, while for $^{13}$CO
it is fitted with a power law index 0.6$\pm$0.2. In the high-mass end, the core mass spectrum is fitted
with a power index of 2.0$\pm$0.3 for $^{12}$CO, and with 2.5$\pm$0.4 for $^{13}$CO. This power-law
behavior of the core mass function in N55 is consistent with many Galactic clouds.
