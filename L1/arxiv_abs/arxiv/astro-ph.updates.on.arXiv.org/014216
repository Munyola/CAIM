Kinematic studies have produced accurate measurements of the total dark matter mass and mean dark
matter density within the optical extent of galaxies, for large samples of objects. Here we consider
theoretical predictions for the latter quantity, $\bar{\rho}_{dm}$, measured within the isophotal
radius $R_{23.5}$, for isolated halos with universal density profiles. Through a combination
of empirical scaling relations, we show that $\bar{\rho}_{dm}$ is expected to depend weakly on
halo mass and strongly on redshift. When galaxy halos fall into larger groups or clusters they become
tidally stripped, reducing their total dark matter mass, but this process is expected to preserve
central density until an object is close to disruption. We confirm this with collisonless simulations
of cluster formation, finding that subhalos have values of $\bar{\rho}_{dm}$ close to the analytic
predictions. This suggests that $\bar{\rho}_{dm}$ may be a useful indicator of infall redshift
onto the cluster. We test this hypothesis with data from the SHIVir survey, which covers a reasonable
fraction of the Virgo cluster. We find that galaxies with high $\bar{\rho}_{dm}$ do indeed trace
the densest regions of the cluster, with a few notable exceptions. Samples selected by environment
have higher densities at a significance of 3.5-4$\sigma$, while samples selected by density are
more clustered at 3-3.5$\sigma$ significance. We conclude that halo density can be a powerful tracer
of the assembly history of clusters and their member galaxies.
