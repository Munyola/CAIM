Supernova (SN) classification and redshift estimation using photometric data only have become
very important for the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST), given the large number of SNe that
LSST will observe and the impossibility of spectroscopically following up all the SNe. We investigate
the performance of a SN classifier that uses SN colors to classify LSST SNe with the Random Forest
classification algorithm. Our classifier results in an AUC of 0.98 which represents excellent
classification. We are able to obtain a photometric SN sample containing 99$\%$ SNe Ia by choosing
a probability threshold. We estimate the photometric redshifts (photo-z) of SNe in our sample by
fitting the SN light curves using the SALT2 model with nested sampling. We obtain a mean bias ($\left<z_\mathrm{phot}-z_\mathrm{spec}\right>$)
of 0.012 with $\sigma\left( \frac{z_\mathrm{phot}-z_\mathrm{spec}}{1+z_\mathrm{spec}}\right)
= 0.0294$ without using a host-galaxy photo-z prior, and a mean bias ($\left<z_\mathrm{phot}-z_\mathrm{spec}\right>$)
of 0.0017 with $\sigma\left( \frac{z_\mathrm{phot}-z_\mathrm{spec}}{1+z_\mathrm{spec}}\right)
= 0.0116$ using a host-galaxy photo-z prior. Assuming a flat $\Lambda CDM$ model with $\Omega_m=0.3$,
we obtain $\Omega_m$ of $0.305\pm0.008$ (statistical errors only), using the simulated LSST sample
of photometric SNe Ia (with intrinsic scatter $\sigma_\mathrm{int}=0.11$) derived using our
methodology without using host-galaxy photo-z prior. Our method will help boost the power of SNe
from the LSST as cosmological probes.
