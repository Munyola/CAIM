Gas flows in and out of galaxies through their circumgalactic medium (CGM) are poorly constrained
and direct observations of this faint, diffuse medium remain challenging. We use a sample of five
$z$ $\sim$ 1-2 galaxy counterparts to Damped Lyman-$\alpha$ Absorbers (DLAs) to combine data on
cold gas, metals and stellar content of the same galaxies. We present new HST/WFC3 imaging of these
fields in 3-5 broadband filters and characterise the stellar properties of the host galaxies. By
fitting the spectral energy distribution, we measure their stellar masses to be in the range of log($M_*$/$\text{M}_{\odot}$)
$\sim$ 9.1$-$10.7. Combining these with IFU observations, we find a large spread of baryon fractions
inside the host galaxies, between 7 and 100 percent. Similarly, we find gas fractions between 3 and
56 percent. Given their star formation rates, these objects lie on the expected main sequence of
galaxies. Emission line metallicities indicate they are consistent with the mass-metallicity
relation for DLAs. We also report an apparent anti-correlation between the stellar masses and $N$(HI),
which could be due to a dust bias effect or lower column density systems tracing more massive galaxies.
We present new ALMA observations of one of the targets leading to a molecular gas mass of log($M_{\rm
mol}$/$\text{M}_{\odot}$) < 9.89. We also investigate the morphology of the DLA counterparts
and find that most of the galaxies show a clumpy structure and suggest ongoing tidal interaction.
Thanks to our high spatial resolution HST data, we gain new insights in the structural complexity
of the CGM.
