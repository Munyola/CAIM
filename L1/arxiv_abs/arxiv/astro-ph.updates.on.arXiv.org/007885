Jupiter and Saturn each have complex systems of satellites and rings. These satellites can be classified
into dynamical groups, implying similar formation scenarios. Recently, a larger number of additional
irregular satellites have been discovered around both gas giants that have yet to be classified.
The aim of this paper is to examine the relationships between the satellites and rings of the gas giants,
using an analytical technique called cladistics. Cladistics is traditionally used to examine
relationships between living organisms, the `tree of life'. In this work, we perform the first cladistical
study of objects in a planetary science context. Our method uses the orbital, physical and compositional
characteristics of satellites to classify the objects in the Jovian and Saturnian systems. We find
that the major relationships between the satellites in the two systems, such as families, as presented
in previous studies, are broadly preserved. In addition, based on our analysis of the Jovian system,
we identify a new retrograde irregular family, the Iocaste family, and suggest that the Phoebe family
of the Saturnian system can be further divided into two subfamilies. We also propose that the Saturnian
irregular families be renamed, to be consistent with the convention used in Jovian families. Using
cladistics, we are also able to assign the new unclassified irregular satellites into families.
Taken together, the results of this study demonstrate the potential use of the cladistical technique
in the investigation of relationships between orbital bodies.
