We use the synoptic maps of the photospheric magnetic field observed at Wilcox Solar Observatory,
Mount Wilson Observatory, Kitt Peak, SOHO/MDI, SOLIS/VSM, and SDO/HMI to study the distribution
of weak photospheric magnetic field values in 1974-2018. We fit the histogram distribution of weak
field values for each synoptic map of the six data-sets separately with a parametrized Gaussian
function in order to calculate the possible shift (to be called here the weak-field asymmetry) of
the maximum of the Gaussian distribution from zero. We estimate the statistical significance of
the weak-field asymmetry for each rotation. We also calculate several versions of lower-resolution
synoptic maps from the high-resolution maps and calculate their rotational weak-field asymmetries.
We find that the weak-field asymmetries increase with decreasing map resolution. A very large fraction
of weak-field asymmetries are statistically significant, with the fraction of significant weak-field
asymmetries increasing with decreasing resolution. Significant weak-field asymmetries of high-
and low-resolution maps mainly occur at the same times and have the same sign. Weak-field asymmetries
for the different data-sets and resolutions vary quite similarly in time, and their mutual correlations
are very high, especially for low-resolution maps. These results give strong evidence for weak-field
asymmetries reflecting a real feature of weak field values, which is best seen in medium- and low-resolution
synoptic maps and is most likely related to the supergranulation scale of the photospheric field.
