Spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting of stellar population synthesis models is an important
and popular way to constrain the physical parameters ---e.g., the ages, metallicities, masses
for stellar population analysis. The previous works suggest that both blue-bands and red-bands
photometry works for the SED-fitting. Either blue-domained or red-domained SED-fitting usually
lead to the unreliable or biased results. Meanwhile, it seems that extending the wavelength coverage
could be helpful. Since the Galaxy Evolution Explorer ({\it GALEX}) and Wide-field Infrared Survey
Explorer (WISE) provide the FUV/NUV and mid-infrared $W1$/$W2$ band data, we extend the SED-fitting
to a wider wavelength coverage. In our work, we analyzed the effect of adding the FUV/NUV and $W1$/$W2$
band to the optical and near-infrared $UBVRIJHK$ bands for the fitting with the Bruzual \& Charlot
2003 (BC03) models and {\sc galev} models. It is found that the FUV/NUV bands data affect the fitting
results of both ages and metallicities much more significantly than that of the WISE $W1$/$W2$ band
with the BC03 models. While for the {\sc galev} models, the effect of the WISE $W1$/$W2$ band for the
metallicity fitting seems comparable to that of {\it GALEX} FUV/NUV bands, but for age the effect
of the $W1$/$W2$ band seems less crucial than that of the FUV/NUV bands. Thus we conclude that the
{\it GALEX} FUV/NUV bands are more crucial for the SED-fitting of ages and metallicities, than the
other bands, and the high-quality UV data (with high photometry precision) are required.
