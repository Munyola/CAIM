The Dwarf Galaxy Survey (DGS) program is studying low-metallicity galaxies using 230h of far-infrared
(FIR) and submillimetre (submm) photometric and spectroscopic observations of the Herschel Space
Observatory and draws to this a rich database of a wide range of wavelengths tracing the dust, gas
and stars. This sample of 50 galaxies includes the largest metallicity range achievable in the local
Universe including the lowest metallicity (Z) galaxies, 1/50 Zsun, and spans 4 orders of magnitude
in star formation rates. The survey is designed to get a handle on the physics of the interstellar
medium (ISM) of low metallicity dwarf galaxies, especially on their dust and gas properties and
the ISM heating and cooling processes. The DGS produces PACS and SPIRE maps of low-metallicity galaxies
observed at 70, 100, 160, 250, 350, and 500 mic with the highest sensitivity achievable to date in
the FIR and submm. The FIR fine-structure lines, [CII] 158 mic, [OI] 63 mic, [OI] 145 mic, [OIII] 88
mic, [NIII] 57 mic and [NII] 122 and 205 mic have also been observed with the aim of studying the gas
cooling in the neutral and ionized phases. The SPIRE FTS observations include many CO lines (J=4-3
to J=13-12), [NII] 205 mic and [CI] lines at 370 and 609 mic. This paper describes the sample selection
and global properties of the galaxies, the observing strategy as well as the vast ancillary database
available to complement the Herschel observations. The scientific potential of the full DGS survey
is described with some example results included.
