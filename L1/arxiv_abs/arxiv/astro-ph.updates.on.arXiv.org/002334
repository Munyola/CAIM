We have obtained radial velocity measurements for 51 new globular clusters around the Sombrero
galaxy. These measurements were obtained using spectroscopic observations from the AAOmega spectrograph
on the Anglo-Australian Telescope and the Hydra spectrograph at WIYN. Combined with our own past
measurements and velocity measurements obtained from the literature we have constructed a large
database of radial velocities that contains a total of 360 confirmed globular clusters. Previous
studies' analyses of the kinematics and mass profile of the Sombrero globular cluster system have
been constrained to the inner ~9' (~24 kpc or ~5 effective radii), but our new measurements have increased
the radial coverage of the data, allowing us to determine the kinematic properties of M104 out to
~15' (~41 kpc or ~9 effective radii). We use our set of radial velocities to study the GC system kinematics
and to determine the mass profile and V-band mass-to-light profile of the galaxy. We find that the
V-band mass-to-light ratio increases from 4.5 at the center to a value of 20.9 at 41 kpc (~9 effective
radii or 15'), which implies that the dark matter halo extends to the edge of our available data set.
We compare our mass profile at 20 kpc (~4 effective radii or ~7.4') to the mass computed from x-ray
data and find good agreement. We also use our data to look for rotation in the globular cluster system
as a whole, as well as in the red and blue subpopulations. We find no evidence for significant rotation
in any of these samples.
