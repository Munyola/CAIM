Context. Stellar magnetic fields are one of the candidates often invoked to explain the missing
transport of angular momentum observed in the models of stellar interiors. However, the properties
of an internal magnetic field and the consequences of its presence on stellar evolution are largely
unknown. Aims. We study the effect of an axisymmetric internal magnetic field on the frequency of
gravity modes in rapidly rotating stars to check whether gravity modes can be used to detect and probe
such a field. Methods. Rotation is taken into account using the traditional approximation of rotation
and the effect of the magnetic field is computed using a perturbative approach. As a proof of concept,
we compute frequency shifts due to a mixed (i.e. with both poloidal and toroidal components) fossil
magnetic field for a representative model of a known magnetic, rapidly rotating, slowly pulsating
B-type star, namely HD 43317. Results. We find that frequency shifts induced by the magnetic field
scale with the square of its amplitude. A magnetic field with a near-core strength of order 150 kG
(which is consistent with the observed surface field strength of order 1 kG) leads to signatures
that are detectable in period spacings for high-radial-order gravity modes. Conclusions. The
predicted frequency shifts can be used to constrain internal magnetic fields and offers the potential
for a significant step forward in our interpretation of the observed structure of gravity-mode
period spacing patterns in rapidly rotating stars.
