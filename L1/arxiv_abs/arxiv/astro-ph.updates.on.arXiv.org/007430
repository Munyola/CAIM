Gas giant planets may form early-on during the evolution of protostellar discs, while these are
relatively massive. We study how Jupiter-mass planet-seeds (termed protoplanets) evolve in massive,
but gravitationally stable (Q>1.5), discs using radiative hydrodynamic simulations. We find
that the protoplanet initially migrates inwards rapidly, until it opens up a gap in the disc. Thereafter,
it either continues to migrate inwards on a much longer timescale or starts migrating outwards.
Outward migration occurs when the protoplanet resides within a gap with gravitationally unstable
edges, as a high fraction of the accreted gas is high angular momentum gas from outside the protoplanet's
orbit. The effect of radiative heating from the protoplanet is critical in determining the direction
of the migration and the eccentricity of the protoplanet. Gap opening is facilitated by efficient
cooling that may not be captured by the commonly used beta-cooling approximation. The protoplanet
initially accretes at a high rate (1e-3Mj/yr), and its accretion luminosity could be a few tenths
of the host star's luminosity, making the protoplanet easily observable (albeit only for a short
time). Due to the high gas accretion rate, the protoplanet generally grows above the deuterium-burning
mass-limit. Protoplanet radiative feedback reduces its mass growth so that its final mass is near
the brown dwarf-planet boundary. The fate of a young planet-seed is diverse and could vary from a
gas giant planet on a circular orbit at a few AU from the central star to a brown dwarf on an eccentric,
wide orbit.
