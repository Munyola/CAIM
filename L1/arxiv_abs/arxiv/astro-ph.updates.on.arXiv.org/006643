Towards the pre-stellar core L1544, the methanol (CH$_3$OH) emission forms an asymmetric ring
around the core centre, where CH$_3$OH is mostly in solid form, with a clear peak 4000~au to the north-east
of the dust continuum peak. As part of the NOEMA Large Project SOLIS (Seeds of Life in Space), the CH$_3$OH
peak has been spatially resolved to study its kinematics and physical structure and to investigate
the cause behind the local enhancement. We find that methanol emission is distributed in a ridge
parallel to the main axis of the dense core. The centroid velocity increases by about 0.2~km~s$^{-1}$
and the velocity dispersion increases from subsonic to transonic towards the central zone of the
core, where the velocity field also shows complex structure. This could be indication of gentle
accretion of material onto the core or interaction of two filaments, producing a slow shock. We measure
the rotational temperature and show that methanol is in local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE)
only close to the dust peak, where it is significantly depleted. The CH$_3$OH column density, $N_{tot}({\rm
CH_3OH})$, profile has been derived with non-LTE radiative transfer modelling and compared with
chemical models of a static core. The measured $N_{tot}({\rm CH_3OH})$ profile is consistent with
model predictions, but the total column densities are one order of magnitude lower than those predicted
by models, suggesting that the efficiency of reactive desorption or atomic hydrogen tunnelling
adopted in the model may be overestimated; or that an evolutionary model is needed to better reproduce
methanol abundance.
