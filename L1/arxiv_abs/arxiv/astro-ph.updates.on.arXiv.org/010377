We have analyzed the differences in positions of 9081 matched sources between the Gaia DR2 and VLBI
catalogues. The median position uncertainty of matched sources in the VLBI catalogue is a factor
of two larger than the median position uncertainty in the Gaia DR2. There are 9% matched sources with
statistically significant offsets between both catalogues. We found that reported positional
errors should be re-scaled by a factor of 1.3 for VLBI and 1.06 for Gaia, and in addition, Gaia errors
should be multiplied by the square root of chi square per degree of freedom in order to best fit the
normalized position differences to the Rayleigh distribution. We have established that the major
contributor to statistically significant position offsets is the presence of optical jets. Among
the sources for which the jet direction was determined, the position offsets are parallel to the
jet directions for 62% of the outliers. Among the matched sources with significant proper motion,
the fraction of objects with proper motion directions parallel to jets is a factor of 3 greater than
on average. Such sources have systematically higher chi square per degree of freedom. We explain
these proper motions as a manifestation of the source position jitter caused by flares that we have
predicted earlier. Therefore, the assumption that quasars are fixed points and therefore, differential
proper motions determined with respect to quasar photocenters can be regarded as absolute proper
motions, should be treated with a great caution.
