Most cosmological models predict that the universe was hot and dense at the early stages of it's evolution.
In this paper we analyse the influence of the thermal bath of Standard Model particles on the dynamics
of cosmological Higgs domain walls. This manuscript poses an~extension of our earlier work in which
we investigated the evolution of networks of Higgs domain walls neglecting the impact of temperature
variation. Using the thermally corrected effective potential of Standard Model we have found that
both the position of the local maximum $h_{max}$ separating minima and the width of domain walls
strongly depend on temperature $T$. For temperatures higher than $10^{10}\; \textrm{GeV}$ they
respectively increase proportionally and decrease inverse proportionally to the increasing
temperature. Thus, the energy scale of the problem follows the value of temperature. Our numerical
lattice simulations based on the PRS algorithm reveal that Higgs domain walls in the presence of
the background thermal bath are highly unstable and decay shortly after formation. Moreover we
have found that the fraction of horizons produced by inflation in which Higgs field expectation
value is higher then $h_{max}$ needs to be very low in order for the evolution of the~network of the
domain walls to end in the electroweak vacuum. This means that Higgs domain walls necessarily were
very rare objects and their average energy density was very small. As a result, the domain walls can
not significantly effect cosmological observables.
