We present new 12CO(1-0) observations of 59 late-type galaxies belonging to the Herschel Reference
Survey (HRS), a complete K-band-selected, volume-limited (15 <D< 25 Mpc) sample of nearby
galaxies spanning a wide range in morphological type and luminosity. We studied different recipes
to correct single-beam observations of nearby galaxies of different sizes and inclinations for
aperture effects. This was done by comparing single-beam and multiple-beam observations along
the major axis, which were corrected for aperture effects using different empirical or analytical
prescriptions, to integrated maps of several nearby galaxies, including edge-on systems observed
by different surveys. The resulting recipe is an analytical function determined by assuming that
late-type galaxies are 3D exponentially declining discs with a characteristic scale length r_CO}
= 0.2 r_24.5, where r_24.5 is the optical, g- (or B-) band isophotal radius at the 24.5 mag arcsec^-2
(25 mag arcsec^-2), as well as a scale height z_CO = 1/100 r_24.5. Our new CO data are then combined
with those available in the literature to produce the most updated catalogue of CO observations
for the HRS, now including 225 out of the 322 galaxies of the complete sample. The 3D exponential disc
integration is applied to all the galaxies of the sample to measure their total CO fluxes, which are
later transformed into molecular gas masses using a constant and a luminosity-dependent X_CO conversion
factor. We also collect HI data for 315 HRS galaxies from the literature and present it in a homogenised
form.
