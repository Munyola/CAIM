Context. In the HI line profiles in the Leiden-Argentina-Bonn (LAB) all-sky database, we have found
a population of very cold HI clouds. So far, the role of these clouds in the interstellar medium (ISM)
has remained unclear. Aims. In this paper, we attempt to confirm the existence of the narrow-line
HI emission (NHIE) clouds by using the data from the Parkes Galactic all-sky survey (GASS) and try
to find their place among other coldest constituents of the ISM. Methods. We repeat the search of
NHIE with the GASS data and derive or compile some preliminary estimates for the distribution, temperatures,
distances, linear sizes, column and number densities, masses, and the composition of NHIE clouds,
and compare these data with corresponding estimates for HI self-absorption (HISA) features, the
Planck cold clumps (CC), and infrared dark clouds (IRDC). Results. We demonstrate that from LAB
and GASS we can separate comparable NHIE complexes, and the properties of the obtained NHIE clouds
are very similar to those of HISA features, but both of these types of clouds are somewhat warmer and
more extended and have lower densities than the cores in the Planck CC and IRDC. Conclusions. We conclude
that NHIE may be the same type of clouds as HISA, but in different observing conditions, in the same
way as the Planck CC and IRDC are most likely similar ISM structures in different observing conditions
and probably in slightly different evolutionary stages. Both NHIE and HISA may be an intermediate
phase between the diffuse cold neutral medium and star-forming molecular clumps represented by
the Planck CC and IRDC.
