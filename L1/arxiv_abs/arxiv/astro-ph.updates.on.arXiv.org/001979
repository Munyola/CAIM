Full polarization measurements of 1665 and 1667-MHz OH masers at 261 sites of massive star formation
have been made with the Parkes radio telescope. Here we present the resulting spectra for 157 southern
sources, complementing our previously published 104 northerly sources. For most sites, these
are the first measurements of linear polarization, with good spectral resolution and complete
velocity coverage. Our spectra exhibit the well-known predominance of highly circularly polarized
features, interpreted as $\sigma$ components of Zeeman patterns. Focusing on the generally weaker
and rarer linear polarization, we found three examples of likely full Zeeman triplets (a linearly
polarized $\pi$ component, straddled in velocity by $\sigma$ components), adding to the solitary
example previously reported. We also identify 40 examples of likely isolated $\pi$ components,
contradicting past beliefs that $\pi$ components might be extremely rare. These were recognised
at 20 sites where a feature with high linear polarization on one transition is accompanied on the
other transition by a matching feature, at the same velocity and also with significant linear polarization.
Large velocity ranges are rare, but we find eight exceeding 25 km/s, some of them indicating high
velocity blue-shifted outflows. Variability was investigated on timescales of one year and over
several decades. More than 20 sites (of 200) show high variability (intensity changes by factors
of four or more) in some prominent features. Highly stable sites are extremely rare.
