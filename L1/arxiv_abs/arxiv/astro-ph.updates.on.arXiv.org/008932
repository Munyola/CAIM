A sample of 1161 radio galaxies with $0.01 < z < 0.7$ and $10^{21} < L_{1.4~\rm GHz} / \textrm{W Hz}^{-1}
< 10^{27}$ is selected from the Stripe 82 1-2 GHz Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array Snapshot Survey,
which covers 100 square degrees and has a 1$\sigma$ noise level of 88 $\mu$Jy beam$^{-1}$. Optical
spectra are used to classify these sources as high excitation and low excitation radio galaxies
(HERGs and LERGs), resulting in 60 HERGs, 149 LERGs and 600 `probable LERGs'. The host galaxies of
the LERGs have older stellar populations than those of the HERGs, in agreement with previous results
in the literature. We find that the HERGs tend to have higher Eddington-scaled accretion rates than
the LERGs but that there is some overlap between the two distributions. We show that the properties
of the host galaxies vary continuously with accretion rate, with the most slowly accreting sources
having the oldest stellar populations, consistent with the idea that these sources lack a supply
of cold gas. We find that 84 per cent of our sample release more than 10 per cent of their accretion power
in their jets, showing that mechanical AGN feedback is significantly underestimated in many hydrodynamical
simulations. There is a scatter of $\sim 2$ dex in the fraction of the accreted AGN power deposited
back into the ISM in mechanical form, showing that the assumption in many simulations that there
is a direct scaling between accretion rate and radio-mode feedback does not necessarily hold. We
also find that mechanical feedback is significant for many of the HERGs in our sample as well as the
LERGs.
