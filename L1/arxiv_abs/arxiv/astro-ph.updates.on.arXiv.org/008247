Terrestrial Solar System planets either have high mean molecular weight atmospheres, as with Venus,
Mars, and Earth, or no atmosphere at all, as with Mercury. We do not have sufficient observational
information to know if this is typical of terrestrial planets or a phenomenon unique to the Solar
System. The bulk of atmospheric exoplanet studies have focused on hot Jupiters and Neptunes, but
recent discoveries of small, rocky exoplanets transiting small, nearby stars provide targets
that are amenable to atmospheric study. GJ 1132b has a radius of 1.2 Earth radii and a mass of 1.6 Earth
masses, and orbits an M-dwarf 12 parsecs away from the Solar System. We present results from five
transits of GJ 1132b taken with the Magellan Clay Telescope and the LDSS3C multi-object spectrograph.
We jointly fit our five data sets when determining the best-fit transit parameters both for the white
light curve and wavelength-binned light curves. We bin the light curves into 20 nm wavelength bands
to construct the transmission spectrum. Our results disfavor a clear, 10x solar metallicity atmosphere
at 3.7 sigma confidence and a 10% H2O, 90% H2 atmosphere at 3.5 sigma confidence. Our data are consistent
with a featureless spectrum, implying that GJ 1132b has a high mean molecular weight atmosphere
or no atmosphere at all, though we do not account for the possible presence of aerosols. This result
is in agreement with theoretical work which suggests that a planet of GJ 1132b's mass and insolation
should not be able to retain a H2 envelope.
