Jupiter-family comet 289P/Blanpain was first discovered in 1819 and was then lost for $\sim200$
years, only to be rediscovered in 2003 as a small, weakly active comet. The comet is associated with
the Phoenicids, an otherwise minor meteor shower that produced significant outbursts in 1956 and
2014. The shower points to the existence of significant mass-loss events of P/Blanpain in recent
history. P/Blanpain was recovered during an apparent large outburst in 2013 July at an appreciable
heliocentric distance of 3.9 au, with brightness increase of 9 mag, making it one of the largest comet
outbursts ever observed. Here we present an analysis of archival data taken by several telescopes.
We find that the 2013 outburst has produced $\sim10^{8}$ kg of dust, which accounts for a modest fraction
($\sim1\%$) of the mass of P/Blanpain's nucleus as measured in 2004. Based on analysis of long-term
lightcurve and modeling of coma morphology, we conclude that the 2013 outburst was most likely driven
by the crystallization of amorphous water ice triggered by a spin-up disruption of the nucleus.
Dust dynamical model shows that a small fraction of the dust ejecta will reach the Earth in 2036 and
2041, but are only expected to produce minor enhancements to the Phoenicid meteor shower. The 2013
outburst of P/Blanpain, though remarkable for a comet at small sizes, does not necessary imply a
catastrophic disruption of the nucleus. The upcoming close encounter of P/Blanpain in 2020 January
will provide an opportunity to examine the current state of the comet.
