Radio detections of ultracool dwarfs provide insight into their magnetic fields and the dynamos
that maintain them, especially at the very bottom of the main sequence, where other activity indicators
dramatically weaken. Until recently, radio emission was only detected in the M and L dwarf regimes,
but this has changed with the Arecibo detection of rapid polarized flares from the T6.5 dwarf 2MASS
J10475385+2124234. Here, we report the detection of quasi-quiescent radio emission from this
source at 5.8 GHz using the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array. The luminosity is {\nu}L_{\nu} = (1.3
+- 0.4) x 10^22 erg/s, a factor of ~100 times fainter than the Arecibo flares. Our detection is the
lowest-luminosity yet achieved for an ultracool dwarf. Although the emission is fully consistent
with being steady, unpolarized, and broadband, we find tantalizing hints for variability. We exclude
the presence of short-duration flares as seen by Arecibo, although this is not unexpected given
estimates of the duty cycle. Follow-up observations of this object will offer the potential to constrain
its rotation period, electron density, and the strength and configuration of the magnetic field.
Equally important, follow-up will address the question of whether the electron cyclotron maser
instability, which is thought to produce the flares seen by Arecibo, also operates in the very different
parameter regime of the emission we detect, or whether instead this ultracool dwarf exhibits both
maser and gyrosynchrotron radiation, potentially originating from substantially different
locations.
