We present a $\approx 11.5$ year adaptive optics (AO) study of stellar variability and search for
eclipsing binaries in the central $\sim 0.4$ pc ($\sim 10''$) of the Milky Way nuclear star cluster.
We measure the photometry of 563 stars using the Keck II NIRC2 imager ($K'$-band, $\lambda_0 = 2.124
\text{ } \mu \text{m}$). We achieve a photometric uncertainty floor of $\Delta m_{K'} \sim 0.03$
($\approx 3\%$), comparable to the highest precision achieved in other AO studies. Approximately
half of our sample ($50 \pm 2 \%$) shows variability. $52 \pm 5\%$ of known early-type young stars
and $43 \pm 4 \%$ of known late-type giants are variable. These variability fractions are higher
than those of other young, massive star populations or late-type giants in globular clusters, and
can be largely explained by two factors. First, our experiment time baseline is sensitive to long-term
intrinsic stellar variability. Second, the proper motion of stars behind spatial inhomogeneities
in the foreground extinction screen can lead to variability. We recover the two known Galactic center
eclipsing binary systems: IRS 16SW and S4-258 (E60). We constrain the Galactic center eclipsing
binary fraction of known early-type stars to be at least $2.4 \pm 1.7\%$. We find no evidence of an
eclipsing binary among the young S-stars nor among the young stellar disk members. These results
are consistent with the local OB eclipsing binary fraction. We identify a new periodic variable,
S2-36, with a 39.43 day period. Further observations are necessary to determine the nature of this
source.
