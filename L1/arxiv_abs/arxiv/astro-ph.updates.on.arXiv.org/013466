w-Projection is a wide-field imaging technique that is widely used in radio synthesis arrays. Processing
the wide-field big data generated by the future Square Kilometre Array (SKA) will require significant
updates to current methods to significantly reduce the time consumed on data processing. Data loading
and gridding are found to be two major time-consuming tasks in w-projection. In this paper, we investigate
two parallel methods of accelerating w-projection processing on multiple nodes: the hybrid Message
Passing Interface (MPI) and Open Multi-Processing (OpenMP) method based on multicore Central
Processing Units (CPUs) and the hybrid MPI and Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) method
based on Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). Both methods are successfully employed and operated
in various computational environments, confirming their robustness. The experimental results
show that the total runtime of both MPI + OpenMP and MPI + CUDA methods is significantly shorter than
that of single-thread processing. MPI + CUDA generally shows faster performance when running on
multiple nodes than MPI + OpenMP, especially on large numbers of nodes. The single-precision GPU-based
processing yields faster computation than the double-precision processing; while the single-
and doubleprecision CPU-based processing shows consistent computational performance. The gridding
time remarkably increases when the support size of the convolution kernel is larger than 8 and the
image size is larger than 2,048 pixels. The present research offers useful guidance for developing
SKA imaging pipelines.
