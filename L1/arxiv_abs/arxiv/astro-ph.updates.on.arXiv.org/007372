We propose a strategy of finding strongly-lensed supernovae (SNe) by monitoring known galaxy-scale
strong-lens systems. Although being powerful tools in cosmology, galaxy evolution, and stellar
physics, strongly-lensed SNe are extremely rare. Built upon the prior knowledge of the lens nature,
our strategy will significantly boost the detection efficiency compared with a blind search. In
particular, we build a compilation of 128 galaxy-galaxy strong-lens systems from the Sloan Lens
ACS Survey (SLACS), the SLACS for the Masses Survey, and the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey
Emission-Line Lens Survey. Within this compilation, we estimate the event rates of strongly-lensed
Type Ia SN (SNIa) and core-collapse SN (CCSN) to be $1.23 \pm 0.12$ and $10.4 \pm 1.1$ per year, respectively.
The lensed SN images are expected to be widely separated with a median separation of 2 arcsec. We forecast
that a time-domain survey with a single-visit depth of 24.7 mag (5$\sigma$ for point source, $r$
band), which is the same as that of the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope, can detect in this compilation
0.58 strongly-lensed SNIa event and 2.4 strongly-lensed CCSN events every year, when a conservative,
fiducial lensing magnification factor of 5 is assumed for the most-magnified SN image. Our proposed
strategy requires no extra time or any scanning-strategy change to ongoing and scheduled high-cadence,
all-sky surveys. It also allows telescopes with much smaller field of views and limited time to deliver
a comparable yield of strongly-lensed SNe with a pencil-beam scanning strategy.
