We use models of coupled thermal evolution and photo-evaporative mass loss to understand the formation
and evolution of the Kepler-36 system. We show that the large contrast in mean planetary density
observed by Carter et al. (2012) can be explained as a natural consequence of photo-evaporation
from planets that formed with similar initial compositions. However, rather than being due to differences
in XUV irradiation between the planets, we find that this contrast is due to the difference in the
masses of the planets' rock/iron cores and the impact that this has on mass loss evolution. We explore
in detail how our coupled models depend on irradiation, mass, age, composition, and the efficiency
of mass loss. Based on fits to large numbers of coupled evolution and mass loss runs, we provide analytic
fits to understand threshold XUV fluxes for significant atmospheric loss, as a function of core
mass and mass loss efficiency. Finally we discuss these results in the context of recent studies
of the radius distribution of Kepler candidates. Using our parameter study, we make testable predictions
for the frequency of sub-Neptune sized planets. We show that 1.8-4.0 R_earth planets should become
significantly less common on orbits within 10 days and discuss the possibility of a narrow "occurrence
valley" in the radius-flux distribution. Moreover, we describe how photo-evaporation provides
a natural explanation for the recent observations of Ciardi et al. (2013) that inner planets are
preferentially smaller within the systems.
