Over-contact binaries are a subclass of eclipsing binaries whose component stars share a common
envelope apart from filling their Roche lobes. We conduct a detailed analysis of the underlying
nonlinear dynamics of about 463 over contact binary stars, classified as such in the second revision
of the eclipsing binary catalog, in the Kepler Field of view (\cite{prvsa2011kepler}). We use two
main techniques, namely the correlation dimension($D_2$), calculated from the reconstructed
dynamics and the main peak bicoherence function from Fourier transforms of the light curves of these
star systems. Our results indicate that almost all the light curves show signatures of deterministic
chaos. This will be a helpful addition in understanding the origin of variable maxima and eclipse
time variations in eclipsing binaries. We also check for correlations of the bicoherence of the
light curves and the fractal properties of the reconstructed phase space of the stars with the inherent
properties of the binary, and find that significant correlations exist between many of these properties,
the most significant among which is the correlation between the fill-out factor with correlation
dimension, $D_2$ and main peak bicoherence, $b_F(f)$. These results indicate that the nonlinear
properties of the stars change as the system evolves. These correlations seem to be the first of its
kind made between the nonlinear properties of the underlying dynamics of a class of astrophysical
objects, and its inherent physical properties.
