Context. Astrometric microlensing is an excellent tool to determine the mass of a stellar object.
By measuring the astrometric shift of a background source star in combination with precise predictions
of its unlensed position and of the lens position, gravitational lensing allows to determine the
mass of the lensing star with a precision of 1 percent, independent of any prior knowledge. Aims.
Making use of the recently published Gaia Data Release 2 (Gaia DR2) we predict astrometric microlensing
events by foreground stars of high proper motion passing by a background star in the coming years.
Methods. We compile a list of ~148.000 high-proper-motion stars within Gaia DR2 with $\mu_{tot}$
> 150 mas/yr. We then search for background stars close to their paths and calculate the dates and
separations of the closest approaches. Using color and absolute magnitude, we determine approximate
masses of the lenses. Finally, we calculate the expected astrometric shifts and magnifications
of the predicted events. Results . We detect two ongoing microlensing events by the high proper motion
stars Luyten 143-23 and Ross 322 and predict closest separations of (108.5 $\pm$ 1.4) mas in July
2018 and (125.3 $\pm$ 3.4) mas in August 2018, respectively. The respective expected astrometric
shifts are (1.74 $\pm$ 0.12) mas and (0.76 $\pm$ 0.06) mas. Furthermore, Luyten 143-23 will pass
by another star in March 2021 with a closest separation of (280.1 $\pm$ 1.1) mas, which results in
an expected shift of (0.69 $\pm$ 0.05) mas.
