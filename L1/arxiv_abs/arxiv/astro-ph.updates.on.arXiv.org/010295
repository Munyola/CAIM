We study the long-term quasi-steady evolution of the force-free magnetosphere of a magnetar coupled
to its internal magnetic field. We find that magnetospheric currents can be maintained on long timescales
of the order of thousands of years. Meanwhile, the energy, helicity and twist stored in the magnetosphere
all gradually increase over the course of this evolution, until a critical point is reached, beyond
which a force-free magnetosphere cannot be constructed. At this point, some large-scale magnetospheric
rearrangement, possibly resulting in an outburst or a flare, must occur, releasing a large fraction
of the stored energy, helicity and twist. After that, the quasi-steady evolution should continue
in a similar manner from the new initial conditions. The timescale for reaching this critical point
depends on the overall magnetic field strength and on the relative fraction of the toroidal field.
The energy stored in the force-free magnetosphere is found to be up to $\sim 30\%$ larger than the
corresponding vacuum energy. This implies that for a $10^{14}$ G field at the pole, the energy budget
available for fast magnetospheric events is of the order of a few $10^{44}$ erg. The spindown rate
is estimated to increase by up to $\sim 60\%$, since the dipole content in the magnetosphere is enhanced
by the currents present there. A rough estimate of the braking index $n$ reveals that it is systematically
$n < 3$ for the most part of the evolution, consistent with actual measurements for pulsars and early
estimates for several magnetars.
