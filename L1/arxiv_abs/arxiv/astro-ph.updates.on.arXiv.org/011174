Filament is a cool, dense structure suspended in the solar corona. The eruption of a filament is often
associated with coronal mass ejection (CME), which has an adverse effect on space weather. Hence,
the study of filament has attracted much attention in the recent past. The tilt angle of active region
(AR) magnetic bipoles is a crucial parameter in the context of the solar dynamo. It governs the conversion
efficiency of the toroidal magnetic field to poloidal magnetic field. The filament always forms
over the Polarity Inversion Lines (PILs). So the study of tilt angles of the filament can provide
valuable information about generation of magnetic field in the Sun. We study the tilt angle of filaments
and other properties of it using McIntosh archive data. We fit a straight line to each filament to
estimate its tilt angle. We study the variation of mean tilt angle with time. The latitude distribution
of positive tilt angle filaments and negative tilt angle filaments reveal that there is a dominance
of positive tilt angle filaments in the southern hemisphere and negative tilt angle filaments dominate
in the northern hemisphere. We study the variation of the mean tilt angle for low and high latitude
separately. Study of temporal variation of filament number reveals that total filament number
and low latitude filament number varies cyclically, in phase with the solar cycle. The number of
filaments in high latitude is less, and they also show a cyclic pattern in temporal variation. We
also study the north-south asymmetry of filament for different latitude criteria.
