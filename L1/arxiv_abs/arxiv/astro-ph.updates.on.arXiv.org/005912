We present results from a systematic selection of tidal disruption events (TDEs) in a wide area (4800
deg$^2$) $g+R$ band experiment by the Intermediate Palomar Transient Factory (iPTF) with a rolling
cadence of 1 and 3 days. We use photometric selection criteria to down select from a total of 493 nuclear
transients detected during the experiment to a sample of 26 blue ($g-r < 0$ mag) nuclear transients
in red host galaxies. Using Swift follow-up UV and X-ray imaging, and ground-based optical spectroscopy,
we classify 14 Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), 9 highly variable active galactic nuclei (AGNs), 2 confirmed
TDEs, and 1 potential core-collapse supernova. From our study, we measure a TDE per galaxy rate of
1.7 $^{+2.85}_{-1.27}$ $\times$10$^{-4}$ gal$^{-1}$ yr$^{-1}$ (90% CL in Poisson statistics)
using a galaxy number density estimated from the SDSS luminosity function. We find that it is possible
to filter out AGNs by employing a more stringent transient color cut ($g-r <$ $-$0.2 mag). The UV is
an important discriminator for filtering out SN contamination, since in the optical, SNe Ia can
appear as blue as TDEs in their early phases. However, the contamination from SN Ia drops significantly
with a more stringent spatial offset cut, suggesting higher precision in astrometry is essential
for separating TDEs from SNe Ia in the optical. Our most stringent optical photometric selection
criteria yields a contamination rate of 4.5:1, allowing for a manageable number of TDE candidates
for complete spectroscopic follow-up and real-time classification in the ZTF era.
