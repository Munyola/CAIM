We explore the cause of the solar cycle variabilities using a novel 3D Babcock--Leighton dynamo
model. In this model, based on the toroidal flux at the base of the convection zone, bipolar magnetic
regions (BMRs) are produced with statistical properties obtained from observed distributions.
We find that a little quenching in BMR tilt is sufficient to stabilize the dynamo growth. The randomness
and nonlinearity in the BMR emergences make the poloidal field unequal and cause some variability
in the solar cycle. However, when observed scatter of BMR tilts around Joy's law with a standard deviation
of $15^\circ$, is considered, our model produces a variation in the solar cycle, including north-south
asymmetry comparable to the observations. The morphology of magnetic fields closely resembles
observations, in particular the surface radial field possesses a more mixed polarity field. Observed
scatter also produces grand minima. In 11,650 years of simulation, 17 grand minima are detected
and $11\%$ of its time the model remained in these grand minima. When we double the tilt scatter, the
model produces correct statistics of grand minima. Importantly, the dynamo continues even during
grand minima with only a few BMRs, without requiring any additional alpha effect. The reason for
this is the downward magnetic pumping which suppresses the diffusion of the magnetic flux across
the surface. The magnetic pumping also helps to achieve 11-year magnetic cycle using the observed
BMR flux distribution, even at the high diffusivity.
