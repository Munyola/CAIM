The radio/X-ray correlation is one of the most important pieces of observational evidence of the
disk-jet connection in accreting compact objects. However, a growing number of X-ray binaries
seem to present deviations from the universal radio/X-ray correlation and the origin of these outliers
are still very much debated. In previous studies, the X-ray bolometric luminosity used in the radio/X-ray
correlation has been estimated using a narrow, soft X-ray band. We study how estimating the X-ray
bolometric luminosity using broadband observations of X-ray binaries affects the radio/X-ray
correlation. We found that the ratio between the broadband (3-200 keV) and narrowband (3-9 keV)
luminosities varies between 5-10 in the hard X-ray state. Overall, the resulting radio/X-ray correlation
slopes and normalizations did not present a very significant change suggesting that they are not
affected greatly by observational biases but are caused by real physical effects. We found that
all sources that reach high enough luminosity change their correlation slopes from the universal
slope to a much steeper one. In addition, sources in the steeper radio/X-ray track show a distinct
cutoff in the high energy X-ray spectrum at tens of keV. These results suggest that the accretion
flow presents a morphological change at a certain critical luminosity during the outburst rise
from radiatively inefficient to radiatively efficient flow that is in turn more efficient in cooling
the hot accretion flow producing the hard X-ray emission. This change could also affect to the jet
launching properties in these systems.
