Mass measurements of gravitational microlenses require one to determine the microlens parallax
$\pie$, but precise $\pie$ measurement, in many cases, is hampered due to the subtlety of the microlens-parallax
signal combined with the difficulty of distinguishing the signal from those induced by other higher-order
effects. In this work, we present the analysis of the binary-lens event OGLE-2017-BLG-0329, for
which $\pie$ is measured with a dramatically improved precision using additional data from space-based
$Spitzer$ observations. We find that while the parallax model based on the ground-based data cannot
be distinguished from a zero-$\pie$ model at 2$\sigma$ level, the addition of the $Spitzer$ data
enables us to identify 2 classes of solutions, each composed of a pair of solutions according to the
well-known ecliptic degeneracy. It is found that the space-based data reduce the measurement uncertainties
of the north and east components of the microlens-parallax vector $\pivec_{\rm E}$ by factors $\sim
18$ and $\sim 4$, respectively. With the measured microlens parallax combined with the angular
Einstein radius measured from the resolved caustic crossings, we find that the lens is composed
of a binary with components masses of either $(M_1,M_2)\sim (1.1,0.8)\ M_\odot$ or $\sim (0.4,0.3)\
M_\odot$ according to the two solution classes. The first solution is significantly favored but
the second cannot be securely ruled out based on the microlensing data alone. However, the degeneracy
can be resolved from adaptive optics observations taken $\sim 10$ years after the event.
