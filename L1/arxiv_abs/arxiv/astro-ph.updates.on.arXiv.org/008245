In the direction of l = 17.6 - 19 deg, the star-forming sites Sh 2-53 and IRAS 18223-1243 are prominently
observed, and seem to be physically detached from each other. Sh 2-53 has been investigated at the
junction of the molecular filaments, while a larger-scale environment of IRAS 18223-1243 remains
unexplored. The goal of this paper is to investigate the star formation processes in the IRAS site
(area ~0.4 deg x 0.4 deg). Based on the GRS 13CO line data, two molecular clouds, peaking at velocities
of 45 and 51 km/s, are found. In the position-velocity plots, a relatively weak 13CO emission is detected
at intermediate velocities (i.e. 47.5 - 49.5 km/s) between these two clouds, illustrating a link
between two parallel elongated velocity structures. These clouds are physically connected in
both space and velocity. The MAGPIS data at 20 cm trace free-free continuum emission toward the IRAS
18223-1243 source. Using the Spitzer and UKIDSS photometric data, we have identified infrared-excess
young stellar objects (YSOs), and have observed their groups toward the intersection zones of the
clouds. IRAS 18223-1243 is also spatially seen at an interface of the clouds. Considering these
observational findings, we propose the onset of the collision of two clouds in the IRAS site about
1 Myr ago, which triggered the birth of massive star(s) and the YSO groups. A non-uniform distribution
of the GPIPS H-band starlight mean polarization angles is also observed toward the colliding interfaces,
indicating the impact of the collision on the magnetic field morphology.
