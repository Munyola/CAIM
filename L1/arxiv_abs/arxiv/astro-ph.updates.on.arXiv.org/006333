We estimate the gravitational radiation signature of the electron/positron annihilation-driven
neutrino burst accompanying the asymmetric collapse of an initially hydrostatic, radiation-dominated
supermassive object suffering the Feynman-Chandrasekhar instability. An object with a mass $5\times10^4\,M_\odot<M<5\times10^5\,M_\odot$,
with primordial metallicity, is an optimal case with respect to the fraction of its rest mass emitted
in neutrinos as it collapses to a black hole: lower initial mass objects will be subject to scattering-induced
neutrino trapping and consequently lower efficiency in this mode of gravitational radiation generation;
while higher masses will not get hot enough to radiate significant neutrino energy before producing
a black hole. The optimal case collapse will radiate several percent of the star's rest mass in neutrinos
and, with an assumed small asymmetry in temperature at peak neutrino production, produces a characteristic
linear memory gravitational wave burst signature. The timescale for this signature, depending
on redshift, is $\sim1{\rm~s}$ to $10{\rm~s}$, optimal for proposed gravitational wave observatories
like DECIGO. Using the response of that detector, and requiring a signal-to-noise ratio SNR $>$
5, we estimate that collapse of a $\sim 5\times10^4\,M_\odot$ supermassive star could produce
a neutrino burst-generated gravitational radiation signature detectable to redshift $z\lesssim7$.
With the envisioned ultimate DECIGO design sensitivity, we estimate that the linear memory signal
from these events could be detectable with SNR $> 5$ to $z \lesssim13$.
