We present a new cosmological probe for galaxy clusters, the halo sparsity. This characterises
halos in terms of the ratio of halo masses measured at two different radii and carries cosmological
information encoded in the halo mass profile. Building upon the work of Balmes et al. (2014) we test
the properties of the sparsity using halo catalogs from a numerical N-body simulation of ($2.6$
Gpc/h)$^3$ volume with $4096^3$ particles and show that the average sparsity value can be predicted
from prior knowledge of the halo mass function. This provides a quantitative framework to infer
cosmological parameter constraints using measurements of the sparsity of galaxy clusters. We
show this point by performing a likelihood analysis of a synthetic sparsity dataset from which we
recover the input fiducial cosmology. We evaluate the sparsity for a sample of X-ray clusters with
hydrostatic mass estimates and derive constraints on the cosmic matter density $\Omega_m$ and
the normalisation amplitude of density fluctuations at the $8$ Mpc h$^{-1}$ scale, $\sigma_8$.
We find $\Omega_m=0.42\pm 0.17$ and $\sigma_8=0.80\pm 0.31$ at $1\sigma$. Future cluster surveys
may provide opportunities for precise measurements of the sparsity. We forecast cosmological
parameter errors for different sparsity observational scenarios and find that a sample of a few
hundreds clusters with mass estimate errors at a few percent level can provide competitive cosmological
parameter constraints complementary to those inferred from other cosmic probes.
