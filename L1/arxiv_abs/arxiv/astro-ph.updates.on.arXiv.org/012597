Whether High Velocity Clouds (HVCs) can form by condensation of the hot ($T \sim 10^6 \, {\rm K}$)
Galactic corona as a consequence of thermal instabilities has been controversial. Here we re-examine
this problem and we suggest that rotation of the corona might be a missing key ingredient. We do this
by studying the evolution of the models of rotating galactic coronae presented in Sormani et al.
(2018) under the presence of cooling and thermal conduction. We combine a linear stability analysis
with the results of local and global hydrodynamical simulations. We find that condensations are
likely to occur in regions where the corona has substantial rotational support. Under reasonably
general assumptions on the rotation profile of the corona, the locations where condensations are
expected are in remarkable agreement with the observed location of the major non-magellanic HVCs
complexes in our Galaxy (namely, at distances $< 15 \, \rm kpc$ from the Sun and within $30^\circ$
from the disc plane). We conclude that HVCs can form by thermal instabilities provided that (i) the
corona is rotating substantially in the inner ($R < 50 \, \rm kpc$) parts, as suggested by current
observational data and predicted by cosmological simulations of galaxy formation; (ii) close
to the disc the corona is well-represented by a nearly-equilibrium stratified rotating structure
(as opposed to a fast cooling flow). Our results also suggest that a better understanding of the disc-halo
interface, including supernova feedback, is critical to understand the origin of HVCs.
