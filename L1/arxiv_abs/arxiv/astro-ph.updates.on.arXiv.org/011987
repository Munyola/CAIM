Based on both theory and observations, a number of authors have proposed that there is a threshold
for star formation. This threshold is a characteristic density or extinction level below which
gas forms stars inefficiently, and above which star formation becomes efficient. In this paper
we use detailed simulations of turbulent, magnetised star-forming clouds, including stellar
radiation and outflow feedback, to investigate whether thresholds for star formation exist and
whether it is possible to recover them using current observational techniques. We show that the
simulations do possess a threshold, indicated by a sharp increase in star formation rate per free-fall
time $\epsilon_{\rm ff}$ at a number density $n_{\rm th}\sim 10^{6.5}$ cm$^{-3}$. Using mock observations
of the simulations at realistic resolutions, we show that plots of projected $\epsilon_{\rm ff}$
can detect the presence of a threshold, but that the resolutions typical of current dust emission
or absorption surveys are insufficient to determine its value. In contrast, proposed alternative
diagnostics based on a change in the slope of the gas surface density versus star formation rate surface
density (Kennicutt-Schmidt relation) or on the correlation between young stellar object counts
and gas mass as a function of density are ineffective at detecting thresholds even when they are present.
The signatures in these diagnostics sometimes taken as indicative of a threshold in observations,
which we generally reproduce in our mock observations, do not prove to correspond to real physical
features in the 3D gas distribution.
