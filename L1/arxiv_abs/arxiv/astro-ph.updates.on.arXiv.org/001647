We present high-quality ULTRACAM photometry of the eclipsing detached double-white dwarf binary
NLTT 11748. This system consists of a carbon/oxygen white dwarf and an extremely-low mass (<
0.2 Msun) helium-core white dwarf in a 5.6 hr orbit. To date such extremely-low mass WDs, which can
have thin, stably-burning outer layers, have been modeled via poorly-constrained atmosphere
and cooling calculations where uncertainties in the detailed structure can strongly influence
the eventual fates of these systems when mass-transfer begins. With precise (individual precision
~1%) high-cadence (~2 s) multi-color photometry of multiple primary and secondary eclipses spanning
>1.5 yr, we constrain the masses and radii of both objects in the NLTT 11748 system to a statistical
uncertainty of a few percent. However, we find that overall uncertainty in the thickness of the envelope
of the secondary carbon/oxygen white dwarf leads to a larger (~13%) systematic uncertainty in the
primary He WD's mass. Over the full range of possible envelope thicknesses we find that our primary
mass (0.136-0.162 Msun) and surface gravity (log(g)=6.32-6.38; radii are 0.0423-0.0433 Rsun)
constraints do not agree with previous spectroscopic determinations. We use precise eclipse timing
to detect the Romer delay at 7 sigma significance, providing an additional weak constraint on the
masses and limiting the eccentricity to e*cos(omega)= -4e-5 +/- 5e-5. Finally, we use multi-color
data to constrain the secondary's effective temperature (7600+/-120 K) and cooling age (1.6-1.7
Gyr).
