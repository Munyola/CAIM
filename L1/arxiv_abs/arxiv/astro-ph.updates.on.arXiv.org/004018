The cosmological coincidences between the matter and radiation energy densities at recombination
as well as between the densities of matter and the cosmological constant at present time are well
known. We point out that moreover the third intersection between the energy densities of radiation
and the cosmological constant coincides with the reionization epoch. To quantify the statistical
relevance of this concurrence, we compute the Bayes factor between the concordance cosmology with
free Thomson scattering optical depth and a model for which this parameter is inferred from imposing
a match between the time of density equality and the epoch of reionization. This is to characterize
the potential explanatory gain if one were to find a parameter-free physical connection. We find
a very strong preference for such a concurrence on the Jeffreys scale from current cosmological
observations. We furthermore discuss the effect of choice of priors, changes in reionization history,
and free sum of neutrino masses. We also estimate the impact of adding intermediate polarization
data from the Planck High Frequency Instrument and prospects for future 21 cm surveys. In the first
case, preference for the correlation remains substantial, whereas future data may give results
more decisive in pro or substantial in contra. Finally, we provide a discussion on different interpretations
of these findings. In particular, we show how a connection between the star-formation history and
the cosmological background dynamics can give rise to this concurrence.
