The sources responsible for the emission of high-energy ($\gtrsim$ 100 TeV) neutrinos detected
by IceCube are still unknown. Among the possible candidates, active galactic nuclei with relativistic
jets are often examined, since the outflowing plasma seems to offer the ideal environment to accelerate
the required parent high-energy cosmic rays. The non-detection of single point sources or -- almost
equivalently -- the absence, in the IceCube events, of multiplets originating from the same sky
position, constrains the cosmic density and the neutrino output of these sources, pointing to a
numerous population of faint sources. Here we explore the possibility that FR0 radiogalaxies,
the population of compact sources recently identified in large radio and optical surveys and representing
the bulk of radio-loud AGN population, can represent suitable candidates for neutrino emission.
Modeling the spectral energy distribution of a FR0 radiogalaxy recently associated to a $\gamma$-ray
source detected by the Large Area Telescope onboard Fermi, we derive the physical parameters of
its jet, in particular the power carried by it. We consider the possible mechanisms of neutrino production,
concluding that $p\gamma$ reactions in the jet between protons and ambient radiation is too inefficient
to sustain the required output. We propose an alternative scenario, in which protons, accelerated
in the jet, escape from it and diffuse in the host galaxy, producing neutrinos as a result of $pp$ scattering
with the interstellar gas, in strict analogy with the processes taking place in star-forming galaxies.
