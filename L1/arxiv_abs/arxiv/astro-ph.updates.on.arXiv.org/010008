Velocity dispersions have been employed as a method to measure masses of clusters. To complement
this conventional method, we explore the possibility of constraining cluster masses from the stacked
phase space distribution of galaxies at larger radii, where infall velocities are expected to have
a sensitivity to cluster masses. First, we construct a two component model of the three-dimensional
phase space distribution of haloes surrounding clusters up to 50 $h^{-1}$Mpc from cluster centres
based on $N$-body simulations. We find that the three-dimensional phase space distribution shows
a clear cluster mass dependence up to the largest scale examined. We then calculate the probability
distribution function of pairwise line-of-sight velocities between clusters and haloes by projecting
the three-dimensional phase space distribution along the line-of-sight with the effect of the
Hubble flow. We find that this projected phase space distribution, which can directly be compared
with observations, shows a complex mass dependence due to the interplay between infall velocities
and the Hubble flow. Using this model, we estimate the accuracy of dynamical mass measurements from
the projected phase space distribution at the transverse distance from cluster centres larger
than $2h^{-1}$Mpc. We estimate that, by using $1.5\times 10^5$ spectroscopic galaxies, we can
constrain the mean cluster masses with an accuracy of 14.5\% if we fully take account of the systematic
error coming from the inaccuracy of our model. This can be improved down to 5.7\% by improving the
accuracy of the model.
