Low-mass stars exhibit substantial pre-main sequence evolution during the first ~100 Myrs of their
lives. Thus, young M-type stars are prime targets for isochronal dating, especially in young moving
groups (YMGs), which contain large amounts of stars in this mass and age range. If the mass and luminosity
of a star can both be directly determined, this allows for a particularly robust isochronal analysis.
This motivates in-depth studies of low-mass binaries with spatially resolvable orbits, where
dynamical masses can be derived. Here we present the results of an observing campaign dedicated
to orbital monitoring of AB Dor Ba/Bb, which is a close M-dwarf pair within the quadruple AB Dor system.
We have acquired eight astrometric epochs with the SPHERE/ZIMPOL and NACO instruments, which we
combine with literature data to improve the robustness and precision for the orbital characterization
of the pair. We find a system mass 0.66+/-0.12 Msun and bolometric luminosities in log(L/Lsun) of
-2.02+/-0.02 and -2.11 +/- 0.02 for AB Dor Ba and Bb, respectively. These measurements are combined
with other YMG pairs in the literature to start building a framework of empirical isochrones in mass-luminosity
space. This can be used to calibrate theoretical isochrones and to provide a model-free basis for
assessing relative stellar ages. We note a tentative emerging trend where the youngest moving group
members are largely consistent with theoretical expectations, while stars in older associations
such as the AB Dor moving group appear to be systematically underluminous relative to isochronal
expectations.
