We report the results of a direct comparison between different kinetic models of collisionless
plasma turbulence in two spatial dimensions. The models considered include a first principles
fully-kinetic (FK) description, two widely used reduced models [gyrokinetic (GK) and hybrid-kinetic
(HK) with fluid electrons], and a novel reduced gyrokinetic approach (KREHM). Two different ion
beta ($\beta_i$) regimes are considered: 0.1 and 0.5. For $\beta_i=0.5$, good agreement between
the GK and FK models is found at scales ranging from the ion to the electron gyroradius, thus providing
firm evidence for a kinetic Alfv\'en cascade scenario. In the same range, the HK model produces shallower
spectral slopes, presumably due to the lack of electron Landau damping. For $\beta_i=0.1$, a detailed
analysis of spectral ratios reveals a slight disagreement between the GK and FK descriptions at
kinetic scales, even though kinetic Alfv\'en fluctuations likely still play a significant role.
The discrepancy can be traced back to scales above the ion gyroradius, where the FK and HK results
seem to suggest the presence of fast magnetosonic and ion Bernstein modes in both plasma beta regimes,
but with a more notable deviation from GK in the low-beta case. The identified practical limits and
strengths of reduced-kinetic approximations, compared here against the fully-kinetic model
on a case-by-case basis, may provide valuable insight into the main kinetic effects at play in turbulent
collisionless plasmas, such as the solar wind.
