We present an initial overview of the filamentary structure in the Orion A molecular cloud utilizing
a high angular and velocity resolution C$^{18}$O(1-0) emission map that was recently produced
as part of the CARMA-NRO Orion Survey. The main goal of this study is to build a credible method to study
varying widths of filaments which has previously been linked to star formation in molecular clouds.
Due to the diverse star forming activities taking place throughout its $\sim$20 pc length, together
with its proximity of 388 pc, the Orion A molecular cloud provides an excellent laboratory for such
an experiment to be carried out with high resolution and high sensitivity. Using the widely-known
structure identification algorithm, DisPerSE, on a 3-dimensional (PPV) C$^{18}$O cube, we identified
625 relatively short (the longest being 1.74 pc) filaments over the entire cloud. We study the distribution
of filament widths using FilChaP, a python package that we have developed and made publicly available.
We find that the filaments identified in a 2 square degree PPV cube do not overlap spatially, except
for the complex OMC-4 region that shows distinct velocity components along the line of sight. The
filament widths vary between 0.02 and 0.3 pc depending on the amount of substructure that a filament
possesses. The more substructure a filament has, the larger is its width. We also find that despite
this variation, the filament width shows no anticorrelation with the central column density which
is in agreement with previous Herschel observations.
