We present observations of fields containing eight recently discovered binary millisecond pulsars
using the telescopes at MDM Observatory. Optical counterparts to four of these systems are detected,
one of which, PSR J2214+3000, is a novel detection. Additionally, we present the fully phase-resolved
B, V, and R light curves of the optical counterparts to two objects, PSR J1810+1744 and PSR J2215+5135
for which we employ model fitting using the ELC model of Orosz & Hauschildt (2000) to measure
the unknown system parameters. For PSR J1810+1744 we find that the system parameters cannot be fit
even assuming that 100% of the spin-down luminosity of the pulsar is irradiating the secondary,
and so radial velocity measurements of this object will be required for the complete solution. However,
PSR J2215+5135 exhibits light curves that are extremely well constrained using the ELC model and
we find that the mass of the neutron star is constrained by these and the radio observations to be greater
than 1.75 solar masses at the 3-sigma level. We also find a discrepancy between the model temperature
and the measured colors of this object which we interpret as possible evidence for an additional
high-temperature source such as a quiescent disk. Given this and the fact that PSR J2214+5135 contains
a relatively high mass companion (greater than 0.1 solar masses), we propose that similar to the
binary pulsar systems PSR J1023+0038 and IGR J18245-2452, the pulsar may transition between accretion-
and rotation-powered modes.
