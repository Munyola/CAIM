Solar filaments are the largest magnetic structure that can be physically traced to the chromosphere.
The structure and evolution of solar filaments are important for our understanding of solar atmosphere
physics. In this work, we investigate a giant dark channel crossing the solar equator, which consists
of two filament channels with different chiralities. From 2016 April 22 to April 27, this giant dark
channel occupied the solar disk. Within this giant channel, a filament channel with dextral chirality
was detected in the northern hemisphere, and another filament channel with sinistral chirality
was observed in the southern hemisphere. At the junction of the two filament channels, a cusp structure
was observed associated with active region (AR) 12532 near the solar equator. The extrapolated
three-dimensional magnetic fields reveal that this cusp structure was composed of two sets of field
lines belonging to two different filament channels and was rooted on the AR positive-polarity fields.
In addition, dark material flows from filaments in the two channels to the cusp structure were detected
as well as the flux emergence and cancellation around the cusp footpoints. On 2016 May 21, after a
solar rotation, the cusp structure had disappeared, and the giant dark channel broke in the middle
where another AR, 12546, had emerged completely. We propose that the magnetic flux emergence and
cancellation around the cusp region resulted in the disappearance of the cusp structure and the
break of the giant dark channel.
