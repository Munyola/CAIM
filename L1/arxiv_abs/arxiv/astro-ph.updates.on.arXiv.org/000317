We explore the cosmological implications of the clustering wedges, xi_perp(s) and xi_para(s),
of the CMASS Data Release 9 (DR9) sample of the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS).
These clustering wedges are defined by averaging the full two-dimensional correlation function,
xi(mu,s), over the ranges 0<mu<0.5 and 0.5<mu<1, respectively. These measurements
allow us to constrain the parameter combinations D_A(z)/r_s(z_d)=9.03 +- 0.21 and cz/(r_s(z_d)H(z))
= 12.14 +- 0.43 at the mean redsfhit of the sample, z=0.57. We combine the information from the clustering
wedges with recent measurements of CMB, BAO and type Ia supernovae to obtain constraints on the cosmological
parameters of the standard LCDM model and a number of potential extensions. The information encoded
in the clustering wedges is most useful when the dark energy equation of state is allowed to deviate
from its standard LCDM value. The combination of all datasets shows no evidence of a deviation from
a constant dark energy equation of state, in which case we find w_DE = -1.013 +- 0.064, in complete
agreement with a cosmological constant. We explore potential deviations from general relativity
by constraining the growth rate f(z)=d ln D(a)/ d ln a, in which case the combination of the CMASS clustering
wedges with CMB data implies f(z=0.57)=0.719 +- 0.094, in accordance with the predictions of GR.
Our results clearly illustrate the additional constraining power of anisotropic clustering measurements
with respect to that of angle-averaged quantities.
