Ultra-wideband 3D imaging spectrometry in the millimeter-submillimeter (mm-submm) band is an
essential tool for uncovering the dust-enshrouded portion of the cosmic history of star formation
and galaxy evolution. However, it is challenging to scale up conventional coherent heterodyne
receivers or free-space diffraction techniques to sufficient bandwidths ($\geq$1 octave) and
numbers of spatial pixels (>$10^2$). Here we present the design and first astronomical spectra
of an intrinsically scalable, integrated superconducting spectrometer, which covers 332-377
GHz with a spectral resolution of $F/\Delta F \sim 380$. It combines the multiplexing advantage
of microwave kinetic inductance detectors (MKIDs) with planar superconducting filters for dispersing
the signal in a single, small superconducting integrated circuit. We demonstrate the two key applications
for an instrument of this type: as an efficient redshift machine, and as a fast multi-line spectral
mapper of extended areas. The line detection sensitivity is in excellent agreement with the instrument
design and laboratory performance, reaching the atmospheric foreground photon noise limit on
sky. The design can be scaled to bandwidths in excess of an octave, spectral resolution up to a few
thousand and frequencies up to $\sim$1.1 THz. The miniature chip footprint of a few $\mathrm{cm^2}$
allows for compact multi-pixel spectral imagers, which would enable spectroscopic direct imaging
and large volume spectroscopic surveys that are several orders of magnitude faster than what is
currently possible.
