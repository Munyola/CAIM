We present the results of the archaeological analysis of the stellar populations of a sample of ~4,000
galaxies observed by the SDSS-IV-MaNGA survey using Pipe3D. Based on this analysis we extract a
sample of ~150,000 SFRs and stellar masses that mimic a single cosmological survey covering the
redshift range between z~0 to z~7. We confirm that the Star-Forming Main Sequence holds as a tight
relation in this range of redshifts, and evolves strongly in both the zero-point and slope. This
evolution is different for the population of local star-forming (SFGs) and retired (RGs) galaxies,
with the latter presenting a stronger evolution in the zero-point and a weaker evolution in the slope.
The fraction of RGs decreases rapidly with z, particularly for those classified as RGs at z~0. Contrary
to previous studies we detect RGs well above z>1, although not all of them are progenitors of local
RGs. Finally, adopting the required corrections to make the survey complete in mass in a limited
volume, we recover the cosmic star-formation rate (SFR), stellar mass density, and average specific
SFR histories of the Universe in this wide range of look-back times, with a remarkable agreement
with the values reported by various cosmological surveys. We demonstrate that the progenitors
of local RGs were more actively forming stars in the past, contributing to most of the cosmic SFR density
at z>0.5, and to most of the cosmic stellar mass density at any redshift. They suffer a general quenching
in the SFR at z~0.35. Below this redshift the progenitors of local SFGs dominate the SFR density of
the Universe.
