We present Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations of the submillimeter
dust continuum and H2D+ 1_{10}-1_{11} emission toward two evolved, potentially protostellar
cores within the Ophiuchus molecular cloud, Oph A SM1 and SM1N. The data reveal small-scale condensations
within both cores, with mass upper limits of M <~ 0.02M_Sun (~ 20 M_Jup). The SM1 condensation
is consistent with a nearly-symmetric Gaussian source with a width of only 37 AU. The SM1N condensation
is elongated, and extends 500 AU along its major axis. No evidence for substructure is seen in either
source. A Jeans analysis indicates these sources are unlikely to fragment, suggesting that both
will form single stars. H2D+ is only detected toward SM1N, offset from the continuum peak by ~150-200
AU. This offset may be due to either heating from an undetected, young, low luminosity protostellar
source or first hydrostatic core, or HD (and consequently H2D+) depletion in the cold centre of the
condensation. We propose that SM1 is protostellar, and that the condensation detected by ALMA is
a warm (T ~ 30-50 K) accretion disk. The less concentrated emission of the SM1N condensation suggests
that it is still starless, but we cannot rule out the presence of a low-luminosity source, perhaps
surrounded by a pseudodisk. These data reveal observationally the earliest stages of the formation
of circumstellar accretion regions, and agree with theoretical predictions that disk formation
can occur very early in the star formation process, coeval with or just after the formation of a first
hydrostatic core or protostar.
