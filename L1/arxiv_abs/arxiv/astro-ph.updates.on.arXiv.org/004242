We build a full spectral-timing model for the low/hard state of black hole binaries assuming that
the spectrum of the X-ray hot flow can be described by two Comptonisation zones. Slow fluctuations
stirred up at the largest radii/softest spectral region of the flow propagate down to modulate the
faster fluctuations produced in the harder spectral region close to the black hole. The observed
spectrum and variability are produced by summing over all regions in the flow, including its emission
reflected from the truncated disc. This produces energy-dependent Fourier lags qualitatively
similar to those seen in the data. We apply this model to archival RXTE data from Cyg X-1, using the
time averaged energy spectrum together with an assumed emissivity to set the radii of the soft and
hard Compton regions. This predicts the Fourier power spectral densities and lags for any energy
bands when combined with a viscous frequency prescription. We find that the power spectra cannot
be described by any smooth model of generating fluctuations, and instead require that there are
specific radii in the flow where noise is preferentially produced. We also find that damping is required
to prevent all the variability power stirred up at large radii being propagated into the inner regions.
Even with these additions, we can fit either the power spectra at each energy, or the lags, but not
both. We conclude that either the spectra are more complex than two zone models, or that other processes
are important in forming the variability.
