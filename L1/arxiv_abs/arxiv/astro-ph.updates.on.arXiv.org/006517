We present two-dimensional particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations of the fully kinetic collisionless
magnetorotational instability (MRI) in weakly magnetized (high $\beta$) pair plasma. The central
result of this numerical analysis is the emergence of a self-induced turbulent regime in the saturation
state of the collisionless MRI, which can only be captured for large enough simulation domains.
One of the underlying mechanisms for the development of this turbulent state is the drift-kink instability
(DKI) of the current sheets resulting from the nonlinear evolution of the channel modes. The onset
of the DKI can only be observed for simulation domain sizes exceeding several linear MRI wavelengths.
The DKI, together with ensuing magnetic reconnection, activate the turbulent motion of the plasma
in the late stage of the nonlinear evolution of the MRI. At steady state, the magnetic energy has an
MHD-like spectrum with a slope of $k^{-5/3}$ for $k\rho<1$ and $k^{-3}$ for sub-Larmor scale ($k\rho>1$).
We also examine the role of the collisionless MRI and associated magnetic reconnection in the development
of pressure anisotropy. We study the stability of the system due to this pressure anisotropy, observing
the development of mirror instability during the early-stage of the MRI. We further discuss the
importance of magnetic reconnection for particle acceleration during the turbulence regime.
In particular, consistent with reconnection studies, we show that at late times the kinetic energy
presents a characteristic slope of $\epsilon^{-2}$ in the high-energy region.
