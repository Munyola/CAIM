The role of equatorial boundary condition in the structure of a force-free black hole magnetosphere
was rarely discussed, since previous studies have been focused on the the field lines entering the
horizon. However, recent high-accuracy force-free electrodynamics (FFE) simulations \cite{East2018}
show that there are both field lines entering the horizon and field lines ending up on the equatorial
current sheet within the ergosphere for asymptotic uniform field configuration. For the latter
field lines, the equatorial boundary condition is well approximated being marginally force-free,
i.e., $B^2-E^2\approx 0$, where $B$ and $E$ are the magnetic and electric field strength, respectively.
In this paper, we revisit the uniform field solution to the Kerr BH magnetosphere structure and investigate
the role of the marginally force-free equatorial boundary condition. We find this boundary condition
plays an important role in shaping the BH magnetosphere in various aspects, including the shape
of the light surface, the near-horizon field line configuration and the source of the Poynting flux.
We also propose an algorithm for numerically solving the Grad-Shafranov equation and self-consistently
imposing the marginally force-free equatorial condition. As a result, we find a good agreement
between our numerical solutions and the high-accuracy FFE simulations. We also discuss the applicability
of the marginally force-free boundary condition and the numerical algorithm proposed in this paper
for general magnetic field configurations.
