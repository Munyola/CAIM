Compact radio jets are ubiquitous in stellar-mass black-hole binaries in their hard spectral state.
Empirical relations between the radio and narrow-band X-ray fluxes have been used to understand
the connection between their accretion discs and jets. However, a narrow-band (e.g., 1--10 or 3--9
keV) X-ray flux can be a poor proxy for either the bolometric luminosity or the mass accretion rate.
Here, we study correlations between the radio and unabsorbed broad-band X-ray fluxes, the latter
providing good estimates of the bolometric flux. We consider GX 339--4, the benchmark object for
the main branch of the correlation, and H1743--322, the first source found to be an outlier of the
correlation. The obtained power-law dependencies of the radio flux on the bolometric flux have
significantly different indices from those found for the narrow X-ray bands. Also, the radio/bolometric
flux correlations for the rise of the outbursts are found to be significantly different from those
for the outburst decline. This points to a possible existence of a jet hysteresis in the radio/X-ray
source evolution, in addition to that seen in the hardness/flux diagram of low-mass X-ray binaries.
The correlation during the rise of the outbursts is similar for both GX 339--4 and H1743--322. The
correlation for the decline of the outbursts for H1743--322 lies below that of GX 339--4 at intermediate
X-ray fluxes, whereas it approaches the standard correlation at lower X-ray luminosities. We also
compare these correlations to those for the high-mass X-ray binaries Cyg X-1 and Cyg X-3.
