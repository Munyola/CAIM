We present new evidence for a variable stellar initial mass function (IMF) in massive early-type
galaxies, using high-resolution, near-infrared spectroscopy from the Folded-port InfraRed
Echellette spectrograph (FIRE) on the Magellan Baade Telescope at Las Campanas Observatory. In
this pilot study, we observe several gravity-sensitive metal lines between 1.1 $\mu$m and 1.3 $\mu$m
in eight highly-luminous ($L \sim 10 L_*$) nearby galaxies. Thanks to the broad wavelength coverage
of FIRE, we are also able to observe the Ca II triplet feature, which helps with our analysis. After
measuring the equivalent widths (EWs) of these lines, we notice mild to moderate trends between
EW and central velocity dispersion ($\sigma$), with some species (K I, Na I, Mn I) showing a positive
EW-$\sigma$ correlation and others (Mg I, Ca II, Fe I) a negative one. To minimize the effects of metallicity,
we measure the ratio $R$ = [EW(K I) / EW(Mg I)], finding a significant systematic increase in this
ratio with respect to $\sigma$. We then probe for variations in the IMF by comparing the measured
line ratios to the values expected in several IMF models. Overall, we find that low-mass galaxies
($\sigma \sim 100$ km s$^{-1}$) favor a Chabrier IMF, while high-mass galaxies ($\sigma \sim 350$
km s$^{-1}$) are better described with a steeper (dwarf-rich) IMF slope. While we note that our galaxy
sample is small and may suffer from selection effects, these initial results are still promising.
A larger sample of galaxies will therefore provide an even clearer picture of IMF trends in this regime.
