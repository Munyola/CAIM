We re-examine the observational evidence for large-scale (4 Mpc) galactic conformity in the local
Universe, as presented in Kauffmann et al. (2013). We show that a number of methodological features
of their analysis act to produce a misleadingly high amplitude of the conformity signal. These include
a weighting in favour of central galaxies in very high-density regions, the likely misclassification
of satellite galaxies as centrals in the same high-density regions, and the use of medians to characterize
bimodal distributions. We show that the large-scale conformity signal in Kauffmann et al. clearly
originates from a very small number of central galaxies in the vicinity of just a few very massive
clusters, whose effect is strongly amplified by the methodological issues that we have identified.
Some of these 'centrals' are likely misclassified satellites, but some may be genuine centrals
showing a real conformity effect. Regardless, this analysis suggests that conformity on 4 Mpc scales
is best viewed as a relatively short-range effect (at the virial radius) associated with these very
large neighbouring haloes, rather than a very long-range effect (at tens of virial radii) associated
with the relatively low-mass haloes that host the nominal central galaxies in the analysis. A mock
catalogue constructed from a recent semi-analytic model shows very similar conformity effects
to the data when analysed in the same way, suggesting that there is no need to introduce new physical
processes to explain galactic conformity on 4 Mpc scales.
