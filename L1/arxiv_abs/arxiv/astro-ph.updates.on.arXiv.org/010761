We analyse new optical spectroscopic, direct-image and X-ray observations of the recently discovered
a high proper motion cataclysmic variable V1838 Aql. The data were obtained during its 2013 superoutburst
and when the source came back to quiescence. The object was detected as a weak X-ray source ($0.01103\pm0.0014$
counts s$^{-1}$) in the plateau of the superoutburst and its flux dropped sharply at the end of the
fading stage ($0.0006\pm0.0005$ counts s$^{-1}$). An extended emission around the source was
observed up to 30 days after the peak of the superoutburst, interpreted it as a bow-shock formed by
a wind from the source. The head of the bow-shock is coinciding with the high-proper motion vector
of the source ($v_{\perp}=123\pm5$ km s$^{-1}$) at a distance of $d=202\pm7$ pc. From spectroscopic
observations in quiescence we confirmed the orbital period value $P_{\rm{orb}}=0.0545\pm 0.0026$
days, consistent with early-superhump estimates, and the following orbital parameters: $\gamma=
-21\pm3$ km s$^{-1}$ and $K_1 = 53\pm3$ km s$^{-1}$. The white dwarf is revealed when the system approaches
quiescence, which enables us to infer the effective temperature of the primary $T_{eff}=11,600\pm400$K.
The donor temperature of V1838 Aql is estimated to be $\lesssim 2200$K and suggestive of a system
approaching the period minimum. Doppler maps of the system in quiescence show the presence of the
bright hot spot in HeI line at the expected accretion disc-stream shock position and an unusual structure
of the accretion disc in H$\alpha$.
