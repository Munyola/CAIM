A key to understanding quasar unification paradigms is the emission properties of broad absorption
line quasars (BALQs). The fact that only a small fraction of quasar spectra exhibit deep absorption
troughs blueward of the broad permitted emission lines provides a crucial clue to the structure
of quasar emitting regions. To learn whether it is possible to discriminate between the BALQ and
non-BALQ populations given the observed spectral properties of a quasar, we employ two approaches:
one based on statistical methods and the other supervised machine learning classification, applied
to quasar samples from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. The features explored include continuum and
emission line properties, in particular the absolute magnitude, redshift, spectral index, line
width, asymmetry, strength, and relative velocity offsets of high-ionisation CIV $\lambda 1549$
and low-ionisation MgII $\lambda 2798$ lines. We consider a complete population of quasars, and
assume that the statistical distributions of properties represent all angles where the quasar
is viewed without obscuration. The distributions of the BALQ and non-BALQ sample properties show
few significant differences. None of the observed continuum and emission line features are capable
of differentiating between the two samples. Most published narrow disk-wind models are inconsistent
with these observations, and an alternative disk-wind model is proposed. The key feature of the
proposed model is a disk-wind filling a wide opening angle with multiple radial streams of dense
clumps.
