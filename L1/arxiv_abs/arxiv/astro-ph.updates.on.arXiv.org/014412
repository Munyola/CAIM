The flux distribution of solar analogs is required for calculating the spectral albedo of Solar
System bodies such as asteroids and trans-Neptunian objects. Ideally a solar analog should be comparably
faint as the target of interest, but only few analogs fainter than V = 9 were identified so far. Only
atmospheric parameters equal to solar guarantee a flux distribution equal to solar as well, while
only photometric colors equal to solar do not. Reddening is also a factor to consider when selecting
faint analog candidates. We implement the methodology for identifying faint analogs at the limit
of precision allowed by current spectroscopic surveys. We quantify the precision attainable for
the atmospheric parameters effective temperature ($T_{eff}$), metallicity ([Fe/H]), surface
gravity (log $g$) when derived from moderate low resolution (R=8000) spectra with S/N $\sim 100$.
We calibrated $T_{eff}$ and [Fe/H] as functions of equivalent widths of spectral indices by means
of the PCA regression. We derive log $g$, mass, radius, and age from the atmospheric parameters,
Gaia parallaxes and evolutionary tracks. We obtained $T_{eff}$/[Fe/H]/log $g$ with precision
of 97 K/0.06 dex/0.05 dex. We identify five solar analogs with $V\sim10.5$ (located at $\sim135$
pc): HIP 991, HIP 5811, HIP 69477, HIP 55619 and HIP 61835. Other six stars have $T_{eff}$ close to
solar but slightly lower [Fe/H]. Our analogs show no evidence of reddening but for four stars, which
present $E(B-V) \geq 0.06$ mag, translating to at least a 200 K decrease in photometric $T_{eff}$.
