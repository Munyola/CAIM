Gravitational waves at suitable frequencies can resonantly interact with a binary system, inducing
changes to its orbit. A stochastic gravitational-wave background causes the orbital elements
of the binary to execute a classic random walk, with the variance of orbital elements growing with
time. The lack of such a random walk in binaries that have been monitored with high precision over
long time-scales can thus be used to place an upper bound on the gravitational-wave background.
Using periastron time data from the Hulse-Taylor binary pulsar spanning ~30 years, we obtain a bound
of h_c < 7.9*10^(-14) at ~10^(-4) Hz, where h_c is the strain amplitude per logarithmic frequency
interval. Our constraint complements those from pulsar timing arrays, which probe much lower frequencies,
and ground-based gravitational-wave observations, which probe much higher frequencies. Interesting
sources in our frequency band, which overlaps the lower sensitive frequencies of proposed space-based
observatories, include white-dwarf/supermassive black-hole binaries in the early/late stages
of inspiral, and TeV scale preheating or phase transitions. The bound improves as (time span)^(-2)
and (sampling rate)^(-1/2). The Hulse-Taylor constraint can be improved to ~3.8*10^(-15) with
a suitable observational campaign over the next decade. Our approach can also be applied to other
binaries, including (with suitable care) the Earth-Moon system, to obtain constraints at different
frequencies. The observation of additional binary pulsars with the SKA could reach a sensitivity
of h_c ~ 3*10^(-17).
