In molecular clouds at temperatures as low as 10 K, all species except hydrogen and helium should
be locked in the heterogeneous ice on dust grain surfaces. Nevertheless, astronomical observations
have detected over 150 different species in the gas phase in these clouds. The mechanism by which
molecules are released from the dust surface below thermal desorption temperatures to be detectable
in the gas phase is crucial for understanding the chemical evolution in such cold clouds. Chemical
desorption, caused by the excess energy of an exothermic reaction, was first proposed as a key molecular
release mechanism almost 50 years ago. Chemical desorption can, in principle, take place at any
temperature, even below the thermal desorption temperature. Therefore, astrochemical net- work
models commonly include this process. Although there have been a few previous experimental efforts,
no infrared measurement of the surface (which has a strong advantage to quantify chemical desorption)
has been performed. Here, we report the first infrared in situ measurement of chemical desorption
during the reactions H + H2S -> HS + H2 (reaction 1) and HS + H -> H2S (reaction 2), which are key to interstellar
sulphur chemistry. The present study clearly demonstrates that chemical desorption is a more efficient
process for releasing H2S into the gas phase than was previously believed. The obtained effective
cross-section for chemical desorption indicates that the chemical desorption rate exceeds the
photodesorption rate in typical interstellar environments.
