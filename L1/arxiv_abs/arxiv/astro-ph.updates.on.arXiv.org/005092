Based on the rate of expansion of the solar wind, the plasma should cool rapidly as a function of distance
to the Sun. Observations show this is not the case. In this work, a magnetic pumping model is developed
as a possible explanation for the heating and the generation of power-law distribution functions
observed in the solar wind plasma. Most previous studies in this area focus on the role that the dissipation
of turbulent energy on microscopic kinetic scales plays in the overall heating of the plasma. However,
with magnetic pumping particles are energized by the largest scale turbulent fluctuations, thus
bypassing the energy cascade. In contrast to other models, we include the pressure anisotropy term,
providing a channel for the large scale fluctuations to heat the plasma directly. In this work a complete
set of coupled differential equations describing the evolution, and energization, of the distribution
function are derived, as well as an approximate closed form solution. Numerical simulations using
the VPIC kinetic code are applied to verify the model's analytical predictions. The results of the
model for realistic solar wind scenario are computed, where thermal streaming of particles are
important for generating a phase shift between the magnetic perturbations and the pressure anisotropy.
In turn, averaged over a pump cycle, the phase shift permits mechanical work to be converted directly
to heat in the plasma. The results of this scenario show that magnetic pumping may account for a significant
portion of the solar wind energization.
