Relatively long-period nonsynchronized planets---such as warm Jupiters---potentially retain
the primordial rotation, eccentricity, and obliquity that might encapsulate information on planetary
climate and formation processes. To date, there has not been a systematic study on climate patterns
on these planets that will significantly influence their observations. Here we investigate the
atmospheric dynamics of nonsynchronized, fast-rotating exoplanets across various radiative
timescales, eccentricities, and obliquities using a shallow water model. The dynamical pattern
can be demarcated into five regimes in terms of radiative timescale $\tau_{\rm rad}$ and obliquity
${\theta}$. An atmosphere with $\tau_{\rm rad}$ shorter than a planetary day usually exhibits
a strong day--night temperature contrast and a day-to-night flow pattern. In the intermediate
$\tau_{\rm rad}$ regime between a planetary day and a year, the atmosphere is dominated by steady
temperature and eastward jet patterns for ${\theta}$ < 18 deg but shows a strong seasonal variation
for ${\theta}$ > 18 deg because the polar region undergoes an intense heating at around the summer
solstice. If $\tau_{\rm rad}$ is longer than a year, seasonal variation is very weak. In this regime,
eastward jets are developed for ${\theta}$ < 54 deg and westward jets are developed for ${\theta}$
> 54 deg. These dynamical regimes are also applicable to the planets in eccentric orbits. The large
effects of exoplanetary obliquities on circulation patterns might offer observational signatures,
which will be investigated in Paper II of this study.
