Whilst in galaxy-size simulations, supermassive black holes (SMBH) are entirely handled by sub-grid
algorithms, computational power now allows the accretion radius of such objects to be resolved
in smaller scale simulations. In this paper, we investigate the impact of resolution on two commonly
used SMBH sub-grid algorithms; the Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton (BHL) formula for accretion onto a point
mass, and the related estimate of the drag force exerted onto a point mass by a gaseous medium. We find
that when the accretion region around the black hole scales with resolution, and the BHL formula
is evaluated using local mass-averaged quantities, the accretion algorithm smoothly transitions
from the analytic BHL formula (at low resolution) to a supply limited accretion (SLA) scheme (at
high resolution). However, when a similar procedure is employed to estimate the drag force it can
lead to significant errors in its magnitude, and/or apply this force in the wrong direction in highly
resolved simulations. At high Mach numbers and for small accretors, we also find evidence of the
advective-acoustic instability operating in the adiabatic case, and of an instability developing
around the wake's stagnation point in the quasi-isothermal case. Moreover, at very high resolution,
and Mach numbers above $\mathcal{M}_\infty \geq 3$, the flow behind the accretion bow shock becomes
entirely dominated by these instabilities. As a result, accretion rates onto the black hole drop
by about an order of magnitude in the adiabatic case, compared to the analytic BHL formula.
