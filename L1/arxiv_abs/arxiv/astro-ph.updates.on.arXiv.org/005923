We present the Data Release 14 Quasar catalog (DR14Q) from the extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic
Survey (eBOSS) of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey IV (SDSS-IV). This catalog includes all SDSS-IV/eBOSS
objects that were spectroscopically targeted as quasar candidates and that are confirmed as quasars
via a new automated procedure combined with a partial visual inspection of spectra, have luminosities
$M_{\rm i} \left[ z=2 \right] < -20.5$ (in a $\Lambda$CDM cosmology with $H_0 = 70 \ {\rm km \ s^{-1}
\ Mpc ^{-1}}$, $\Omega_{\rm M} = 0.3$, and $\Omega_{\rm \Lambda} = 0.7$), and either display at least
one emission line with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) larger than $500 \ {\rm km \ s^{-1}}$ or,
if not, have interesting/complex absorption features. The catalog also includes previously spectroscopically-confirmed
quasars from SDSS-I, II and III. The catalog contains 526,356 quasars 144,046 are new discoveries
since the beginning of SDSS-IV) detected over 9,376 deg$^2$ (2,044 deg$^2$ having new spectroscopic
data available) with robust identification and redshift measured by a combination of principal
component eigenspectra. The catalog is estimated to have about 0.5% contamination. The catalog
identifies 21,877 broad absorption line quasars and lists their characteristics. For each object,
the catalog presents SDSS five-band CCD-based photometry with typical accuracy of 0.03 mag. The
catalog also contains X-ray, ultraviolet, near-infrared, and radio emission properties of the
quasars, when available, from other large-area surveys.
