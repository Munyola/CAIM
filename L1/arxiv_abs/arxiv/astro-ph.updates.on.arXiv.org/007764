We examine the stellar haloes of the Auriga simulations, a suite of thirty cosmological magneto-hydrodynamical
high-resolution simulations of Milky Way-mass galaxies performed with the moving-mesh code AREPO.
We study halo global properties and radial profiles out to $\sim 150$ kpc for each individual galaxy.
The Auriga haloes are diverse in their masses and density profiles; mean metallicity and metallicity
gradients; ages; and shapes, reflecting the stochasticity inherent in their accretion and merger
histories. A comparison with observations of nearby late-type galaxies shows very good agreement
between most observed and simulated halo properties. However, Auriga haloes are typically too
massive. We find a connection between population gradients and mass assembly history: galaxies
with few significant progenitors have more massive haloes, possess large negative halo metallicity
gradients and steeper density profiles. The number of accreted galaxies, either disrupted or under
disruption, that contribute 90% of the accreted halo mass ranges from 2 to 15, with a median of 6.5,
and their stellar masses span over three orders of magnitude. The observed halo mass--metallicity
relation is well reproduced by Auriga and is set by the stellar mass and metallicity of the dominant
satellite contributors. This relationship is found not only for the accreted component but also
for the total (accreted + in-situ) stellar halo. Our results highlight the potential of observable
halo properties to infer the assembly history of galaxies.
