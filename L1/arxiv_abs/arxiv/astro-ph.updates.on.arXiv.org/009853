Motion of many comets is affected by non-gravitational forces caused by outgassing from their surfaces.
Outgassing also produces reactive torques resulting in cometary spin evolution. We propose that
the two processes are correlated and show that the change of cometary spin rate over its heliocentric
orbit scales linearly with the amplitude of its non-gravitational acceleration. The proportionality
constant depends on the comet size and orbital elements (semi-major axis and eccentricity) and
on the (dimensionless) lever arm parameter $\zeta$ that relates the outgassing-induced torque
and acceleration. We determine $\zeta$ for 7 comets for which both non-gravitational acceleration
and change of spin period $\Delta P$ were measured and verify this relation. This sample spanning
almost 4 decades in $\Delta P$ yields $\log\zeta=-2.21\pm 0.54$, surprisingly small value and
spread. We then apply our framework to 209 comets with measured non-gravitational accelerations
and determine the objects most likely to exhibit large spin period changes, $\Delta P\gtrsim 20$
min per orbit assuming rotation period of 10 hr and $\zeta$ comparable to our control sample. These
objects should be primary targets for future studies of cometary spin variability, further constraining
distribution of $\zeta$. Lack of comets with very high expected spin rate changes (which is not equivalent
to having the highest non-gravitational acceleration) suggests that (1) cometary fission due
to outgassing-driven spin-up must be an important process and (2) the distribution of $\zeta$ has
a lower limit $\sim 10^{-3}$.
