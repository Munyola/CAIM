We report the detection of extended Lyman-$\alpha$ emission from the host galaxy of SDSS~J2222+2745,
a strongly lensed quasar at $z = 2.8$. Spectroscopic follow-up clearly reveals extended Lyman-$\alpha$
in emission between two images of the central active galactic nucleus (AGN). We reconstruct the
lensed quasar host galaxy in the source plane by applying a strong lens model to HST imaging, and resolve
spatial scales as small as $\sim$200 parsecs. In the source plane we recover the host galaxy morphology
to within a few hundred parsecs of the central AGN, and map the extended Lyman-$\alpha$ emission
to its physical origin on one side of the host galaxy at radii $\sim$0.5-2 kpc from the central AGN.
There are clear morphological differences between the Lyman-$\alpha$ and rest-frame ultraviolet
stellar continuum emission from the quasar host galaxy. Furthermore, the relative velocity profiles
of quasar Lyman-$\alpha$, host galaxy Lyman-$\alpha$, and metal lines in outflowing gas reveal
differences in the absorbing material affecting the AGN and host galaxy. These data indicate the
presence of patchy local intervening gas in front of the central quasar and its host galaxy. This
interpretation is consistent with the central luminous quasar being obscured across a substantial
fraction of its surrounding solid angle, resulting in strong anisotropy in the exposure of the host
galaxy to ionizing radiation from the AGN. This work demonstrates the power of strong lensing-assisted
studies to probe spatial scales that are currently inaccessible by other means.
