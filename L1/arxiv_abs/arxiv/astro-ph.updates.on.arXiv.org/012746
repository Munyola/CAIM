Single-object imaging and spectroscopy on telescopes with apertures ranging from ~4 m to 40 m have
the potential to greatly enhance the cosmological constraints that can be obtained from LSST. Two
major cosmological probes will benefit greatly from LSST follow-up: accurate spectrophotometry
for nearby and distant Type Ia supernovae will expand the cosmological distance lever arm by unlocking
the constraining power of high-z supernovae; and cosmology with time delays of strongly-lensed
supernovae and quasars will require additional high-cadence imaging to supplement LSST, adaptive
optics imaging or spectroscopy for accurate lens and source positions, and IFU or slit spectroscopy
to measure detailed properties of lens systems. We highlight the scientific impact of these two
science drivers, and discuss how additional resources will benefit them. For both science cases,
LSST will deliver a large sample of objects over both the wide and deep fields in the LSST survey, but
additional data to characterize both individual systems and overall systematics will be key to
ensuring robust cosmological inference to high redshifts. Community access to large amounts of
natural-seeing imaging on ~2-4 m telescopes, adaptive optics imaging and spectroscopy on 8-40
m telescopes, and high-throughput single-target spectroscopy on 4-40 m telescopes will be necessary
for LSST time domain cosmology to reach its full potential. In two companion white papers we present
the additional gains for LSST cosmology that will come from deep and from wide-field multi-object
spectroscopy.
