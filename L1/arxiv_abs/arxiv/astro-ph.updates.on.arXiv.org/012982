We have constructed an all-sky catalog of optical AGNs with $z < 0.09$, based on optical spectroscopy,
from the parent sample of galaxies in the 2MASS Redshift Survey (2MRS), a near-complete census of
the nearby universe. Our catalog consists of 1929 broad line AGNs, and 6562 narrow line AGNs which
satisfy the \citet{Kauffmann03} criteria, of which 3607 also satisfy the \citet{Kewley01} criteria.
We also report emission line widths, fluxes, flux errors, and signal-to-noise ratios of all the
galaxies in our spectroscopic sample, allowing users to customize the selection criteria. Although
we uniformly processed the spectra of galaxies from a homogeneous parent sample, inhomogeneities
persist due to the differences in the quality of the obtained spectra, taken with different instruments,
and the unavailability of spectra for $\sim$20\% of the galaxies. We quantify how the differences
in spectral quality affect not only the AGN detection rates but also broad line to narrow line AGN
ratios. We find that the inhomogeneities primarily stem from the continuum signal-to-noise (S/N)
in the spectra near the emission lines of interest. We fit for the AGN fraction as a function of continuum
S/N and assign AGN likelihoods to galaxies which were not identified as AGNs using the available
spectra. This correction results in a catalog suitable for statistical studies. This work also
paves the way for a truly homogeneous and complete nearby AGN catalog by identifying galaxies whose
AGN status needs to be verified with higher quality spectra, quantifying the spectral quality necessary
to do so.
