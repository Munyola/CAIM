We present a spectral and timing analysis of the newly reported Galactic X-ray transient Swift J1658.2-4242
by NuSTAR and Swift. The broad-band X-ray continuum is typical of a black hole binary in the bright
hard state, with a photon-index $\Gamma=1.63\pm0.02$ and a low coronal temperature of $kT_{\rm
e}=22\pm1$ keV, corresponding to a low spectral cutoff well constrained by NuSTAR. Spectral modeling
of the relativistic disk reflection features, consisting of a broad Fe K$\alpha$ line and the Compton
reflection hump, reveals the black hole is rapidly spinning with the spin parameter of $a_{*}>0.96$,
and the inner accretion disk is viewed at a high inclination angle of $i=64^{+2}_{-3}{^\circ}$.
The high inclination is independently confirmed by dips in the light curves, which can be explained
by obscuring material located near the disk plane temporarily obscuring the central region. In
addition, we detect an absorption line in the NuSTAR spectra centered at $7.03^{+0.04}_{-0.03}$
keV. If associated with ionized Fe K absorption lines, this provides evidence for the presence of
outflowing material in the hard state of a black hole binary candidate. A timing analysis shows the
presence of a type-C QPO in the power spectrum, with frequency increasing from $\sim0.14$ Hz to $\sim0.21$
Hz during the single NuSTAR exposure. Our analysis reveals that Swift J1658.2-4242 displays characteristics
typical for a black hole binary that is viewed close to edge-on, making it a good system for studying
the accretion geometry in black hole binaries.
