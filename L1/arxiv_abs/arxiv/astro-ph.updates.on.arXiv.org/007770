The gas-stars instability criterion for infinitesimally thin disc was applied to the galaxy NGC
628. Instead of using the azimuthally averaged profiles of data the maps of the gas surface densities
(THINGS, HERACLES), of the velocity dispersions of stars (VENGA) and gas (THINGS) and of the surface
brightness of the galaxy (S$^4$G) were analyzed. All these maps were collected for the same region
with a noticeable star formation rate and were superimposed on each other. Using the data on the rotation
curve values of $Q_\mathrm{eff}$ were calculated for each pixel in the image. The areas within the
contours $Q_\mathrm{eff}<3$ were compared with the ongoing star formation regions ($\Sigma_\mathrm{SFR}>
0.007 \, M_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$kpc$^{-2}$) and showed a good coincidence between them. The Romeo-Falstad
disc instability diagnostics taking into account the thickness of the stellar and gas layers does
not change the result. If the one-fluid instability criterion is used, the coincidence is worse.
The analysis was carried out for the area $r < $ 0.5$r_{25} $. Leroy et al. (2008) using azimuthally
averaged data obtained $Q_\mathrm{eff} \approx 3-4$ for this area of the disc, which makes it stable
against non-axisymmetric perturbations and gas dissipation, and does not predict the location
of star forming regions. Since in the galaxies the distribution of hydrogen and the regions of star
formation is often patchy, the relationship between gravitational instability and star formation
should be sought using data maps rather than azimuthally averaged data.
