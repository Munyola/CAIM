Ecosystem-bedrock interactions power the biogeochemical cycles of Earth shallow crust, supporting
life, stimulating substrate transformation, and spurring evolutionary innovation. While oxidative
processes have dominated half of terrestrial history, the relative contribution of the biosphere
and its chemical fingerprints on Earth developing regolith are still poorly constrained. Here,
we report results from a long-term incipient weathering experiment. We found that the mass release
and partitioning of major elements during weathering of granite, rhyolite, schist, and basalt
was rock-specific and was regulated by ecosystem components. Element partitioning was impacted
by abiotic, microbial, plant, and mycorrhizal processes according to secondary precipitates
> exchangeable species > dissolved species > plant biomass. Biota accelerated CO2 mineralization
over abiotic controls with increasing ecosystem complexity, and significantly modified the mobilized
elements stoichiometry. Microbial and fungal components accelerated element mobilization,
while plants increased leaching and biomass retention by an order of magnitude. All biota left comparable
biosignatures in dissolved weathering products. Nevertheless, the magnitude and the allocation
of weathered fractions under abiotic and biotic treatments provides quantitative evidence for
the role of major biosphere components in the evolution of upper continental crust, presenting
critical information for large-scale biogeochemical models and for the search for stable in situ
biosignatures beyond Earth.
