We present a weak lensing analysis of the 3 GHz VLA radio survey of the COSMOS field, which we correlate
with overlapping HST-ACS optical observations using both intrinsic galaxy shape and cosmic shear
correlation statistics. After cross-matching sources between the two catalogues, we measure
the correlations of galaxy position angles and find a Pearson correlation coefficient of $0.14
\pm 0.03$. This is a marked improvement from previous studies which found very weak, or non-existent
correlations, and gives insight into the emission processes of radio and optical galaxies. We also
extract power spectra of averaged galaxy ellipticities (the primary observable for cosmic shear)
from the two catalogues, and produce optical-optical, radio-optical and radio-radio spectra.
The optical-optical auto-power spectrum was measured to a detection significance of 9.80$\sigma$
and is consistent with previous observations of the same field. For radio spectra (which we do not
calibrate, given the unknown nature of their systematics), although we do not detect significant
radio-optical (1.50$\sigma$) or radio-radio (1.45$\sigma$) $E$-mode power spectra, we do find
the $E$-mode spectra to be more consistent with the shear signal expected from previous studies
than with a null signal, and vice versa for $B$-mode and $EB$ cross-correlation spectra. Our results
give promise that future radio weak lensing surveys with larger source number densities over larger
areas will have the capability to measure significant weak lensing signals.
