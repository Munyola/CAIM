We use ~100 square deg of deep (>28.5 mag arcsec$^{-2}$ in i-band), high-quality (median 0.6 arcsec
seeing) imaging data from the Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) survey to reveal the halo mass dependence
of the surface mass density profiles and outer stellar envelopes of massive galaxies. The i-band
images from the HSC survey reach ~4 magnitudes deeper than Sloan Digital Sky Survey and enable us
to directly trace stellar mass distributions to 100 kpc without requiring stacking. We conclusively
show that, at fixed stellar mass, the stellar profiles of massive galaxies depend on the masses of
their dark matter haloes. On average, massive central galaxies with $\log M_{\star, 100\ \mathrm{kpc}}>11.6$
in more massive haloes at 0.3 < z < 0.5 have shallower inner stellar mass density profiles (within
~10-20 kpc) and more prominent outer envelopes. These differences translate into a halo mass dependence
of the mass-size relation. Central galaxies in haloes with $\log M_{\rm{Halo}}>14.0$ are ~20%
larger in $R_{\mathrm{50}}$ at fixed stellar mass. Such dependence is also reflected in the relationship
between the stellar mass within 10 and 100 kpc. Comparing to the mass--size relation, the $\log M_{\star,
100\ \rm{kpc}}$-$\log M_{\star, 10\ \rm{kpc}}$ relation avoids the ambiguity in the definition
of size, and can be straightforwardly compared with simulations. Our results demonstrate that,
with deep images from HSC, we can quantify the connection between halo mass and the outer stellar
halo, which may provide new constraints on the formation and assembly of massive central galaxies.
