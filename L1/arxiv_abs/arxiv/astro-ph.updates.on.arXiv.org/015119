Modeling fast solar wind based on the kinetic theory is an important task for scientists. In this
paper, we present a two-fluid model for fast solar wind with anisotropic Kappa-Maxwellian electrons
and Bi-Maxwellian protons. In the simulation, the energy exchange between the plasma particles
and low-frequency Alfv\'en waves is considered. A set of eleven coupled equations is derived by
applying the zeroth- to fourth-order moments of the Vlasov equation and the modified electromagnetic
Maxwell equations. A characteristic of the Kappa distribution (indicated by $\kappa$ index) is
explicit in the equation for the parallel component of the electron heat flux (parallel to the ambient
magnetic field line) and differs from the equation derived for the proton heat flux due to the different
nature of the distributions. Within the large $\kappa$ index, the equations for the two-fluid model
tend to the equations obtained by the Maxwellian distribution. Using an iterated Crank-Nicolson
method, the coupled equations are numerically solved for the fast solar wind conditions. We show
that at (0.3 - 1) AU from the Sun, the electron density, components of temperature, and components
of heat flux follow the power-law behavior. We also showed that near the Earth, the flow speed (electron
or proton) increases with decreasing $\kappa$. We concluded that applying the small $\kappa$ index
(the non-Maxwellian distribution), the extraordinary nature of the solar atmosphere, with its
temperature of several million kelvin temperature for electrons, has been captured.
