We present ages, [Fe/H] and abundances of the alpha elements Ca I, Si I, Ti I, Ti II, and light elements
Mg I, Na I, and Al I for 31 globular clusters in M31, which were obtained from high resolution, high
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR$>60$) echelle spectra of their integrated light. All abundances
and ages are obtained using our original technique for high resolution integrated light abundance
analysis of globular clusters. This sample provides a never before seen picture of the chemical
history of M31. The globular clusters are dispersed throughout the inner and outer halo, from 2.5
kpc $<$ R$_{\rm M31}$ $<$ 117 kpc. We find a range of [Fe/H] within 20 kpc of the center of M31,
and a constant [Fe/H]$\sim-1.6$ for the outer halo clusters. We find evidence for at least one massive
globular cluster in M31 with an age between 1 and 5 Gyr. The alpha-element ratios are generally similar
to Milky Way globular cluster and field star ratios. We also find chemical evidence for a late-time
accretion origin for at least one cluster, which has a different abundance pattern than other clusters
at similar metallicity. We find evidence for star-to-star abundance variations in Mg, Na, and Al
in the globular clusters in our sample, and find correlations of Ca, Mg, Na, and possibly Al abundance
ratios with cluster luminosity and velocity dispersion, which can potentially be used to constrain
globular cluster self-enrichment scenarios. Data presented here were obtained with the HIRES
echelle spectrograph on the Keck I Telescope.
