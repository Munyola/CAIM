We present the results of smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations of the disc around
the young, eccentric stellar binary HD 104237. We find that the binary clears out a large cavity in
the disc, driving a significant eccentricity at the cavity edge. This then precesses around the
binary at a rate of $\dot{\varpi} = 0.48^{\circ}T_{\mathrm{b}}^{-1}$, which for HD 104237 corresponds
to 40 years. We find that the accretion pattern into the cavity and onto the binary changes with this
precession, resulting in a periodic accretion variability driven purely by the physical parameters
of the binary and its orbit. For each star we find that this results in order of magnitude changes in
the accretion rate. We also find that the accretion variability allows the primary to accrete gas
at a higher rate than the secondary for approximately half of each precession period. Using a large
number of 3-body integrations of test particles orbiting different binaries, we find good agreement
between the precession rate of a test particle and our SPH disc precession. These rates also agree
very well with the precession rates predicted by the analytic theory of Leung & Lee (2013), showing
that their prescription can be accurately used to predict long-term accretion variability timescales
for eccentric binaries accreting from a disc. We discuss the implications of our result, and suggest
that this process provides a viable way of preserving unequal mass ratios in accreting eccentric
binaries in both the stellar and supermassive black hole regimes
