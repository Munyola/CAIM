Binarity and multiplicity appear to be a common outcome in star formation. In particular, the binary
fraction of massive (OB-type) stars can be very high. In many cases, the further stellar evolution
of these stars is affected by binary interactions at some stage during their lifetime. The origin
of this high binarity and the binary parameters are poorly understood because observational constraints
are scarce, which is predominantly due to a dearth of known young massive binary systems. We aim to
identify and describe massive young binary systems in order to fill in the gaps of our knowledge of
primordial binarity of massive stars, which is crucial for our understanding of massive star formation.
We observed the two massive young stellar objects (MYSOs) PDS 27 and PDS 37 at the highest spatial
resolution provided by VLTI/PIONIER in the H-band (1.3 mas). We applied geometrical models to fit
the observed squared visibilities and closure phases. In addition, we performed a radial velocity
analysis using published VLT/FORS2 spectropolarimetric and VLT/X-shooter spectroscopic observations.
Our findings suggest binary companions for both objects at 12 mas (30 au) for PDS 27 and at 22-28 mas
(42-54 au) for PDS 37. This means that they are among the closest MYSO binaries resolved to date. Our
data spatially resolve PDS 27 and PDS 37 for the first time, revealing two of the closest and most massive
($>$8 M$_\odot$) YSO binary candidates to date. PDS 27 and PDS 37 are rare but great laboratories
to quantitatively inform and test the theories on formation of such systems.
