We develop a physical framework for interpreting high-resolution images of pre planetary nebule
("prePNe") with pairs of candle shaped lobes. We use hydrodynamical models to infer the historical
properties of the flows injected from the nucleus that shape the lobes into standard forms. First,
we find a suitable set of parameters of a fast, collimated, tapered flow that is actively reshaped
by an exterior slow AGB wind and that nicely fits the basic shape, kinematics, mass, and momenta of
this class of prePNe. Next we vary the most influential parameters of this "baseline" model-such
as density, speed, and geometry-to see how changes in the flow parameters affect the nebular observables
after 900y. Several generic conlusions emerge, such as the injected flows that create the hollow
candle-shaped lobes must be light, "tapered", and injected considerably faster than the lobe expansion
speed. Multi-polar and starfish prePNe probably evolve from wide angle flows in which thin-shell
instabilites corrugate their leading edges. We show how the common linear relationship of Doppler
shift and position along the lobe is a robust outcome the interaction of tapered diverging streamlines
with the lobes' curved walls. Finally we probe how magnetic fields affect the basline model by adding
a toroidal field to the injected baseline flow. Examples of prePNe and PNe that may have been magnetically
shaped are listed. We conclude that the light, field-free, tapered baseline flow model is an successful
and universal pardigm for unravelling the histories of lobe formation in prePNe.
