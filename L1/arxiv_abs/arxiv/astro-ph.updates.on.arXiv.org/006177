The evolution of photospheric flow and magnetic fields before and after flares can provide important
information regarding the flare triggering and back reaction processes. However, such studies
on the flow field are rare due to the paucity of high-resolution observations covering the entire
flaring period. Here we study the structural evolution of penumbra and shear flows associated with
the 2015 June 22 M6.5 flare in NOAA AR 12371, using high-resolution imaging observation in the TiO
band taken by the 1.6~m Goode Solar Telescope at Big Bear Solar Observatory, with the aid of the differential
affine velocity estimator method for flow tracking. The accompanied photospheric vector magnetic
field changes are also analyzed using data from the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager. As a result,
we found, for a penumbral segment in the negative field adjacent to the magnetic polarity inversion
line (PIL), an enhancement of penumbral flows (up to an unusually high value of \sm2~\kms) and extension
of penumbral fibrils after the first peak of the flare hard X-ray (HXR) emission. We also found an
area at the PIL, which is co-spatial with a precursor brightening kernel, exhibits a gradual increase
of shear flow velocity (up to \sm0.9~\kms) after the flare. The enhancing penumbral and shear flow
regions are also accompanied by an increase of horizontal field and decrease of magnetic inclination
angle(measured from the solar surface). These results are discussed in the context of the theory
of back reaction of coronal restructuring on the photosphere as a result of flare energy release.
