We investigate the use of estimators of weak lensing power spectra based on a flat-sky implementation
of the Pseudo-Cl (PCl) technique, where the masked shear field is transformed without regard for
masked regions of sky. This masking mixes power, and E-convergence and B-modes. To study the accuracy
of forward-modelling and full-sky power spectrum recovery we consider both large-area survey
geometries, and small-scale masking due to stars and a checkerboard model for field-of-view gaps.
The power spectrum for the large-area survey geometry is sparsely-sampled and highly oscillatory,
which makes modelling problematic. Instead, we derive an overall calibration for large-area mask
bias using simulated fields. The effects of small-area star masks can be accurately corrected for,
while the checkerboard mask has oscillatory and spiky behaviour which leads to percent biases.
Apodisation of the masked fields leads to increased biases and a loss of information. We find that
we can construct an unbiased forward-model of the raw PCls, and recover the full-sky convergence
power to within a few percent accuracy for both Gaussian and lognormal-distributed shear fields.
Propagating this through to cosmological parameters using a Fisher-Matrix formalism, we find
we can make unbiased estimates of parameters for surveys up to 1,200 deg$^2$ with 30 galaxies per
arcmin$^2$, beyond which the percent biases become larger than the statistical accuracy. This
implies a flat-sky PCl analysis is accurate for current surveys but a Euclid-like survey will require
higher accuracy.
