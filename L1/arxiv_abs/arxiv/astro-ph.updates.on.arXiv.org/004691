The number of observed dwarf galaxies, with dark matter mass $\lesssim 10^{11}$ M$_{\odot}$ in
the Milky Way or the Andromeda galaxy does not agree with predictions from the successful $\Lambda$CDM
paradigm. To alleviate this problem there has been a conjecture that there may be suppression of
dark matter clustering on very small scales. However, the abundance of dark matter halos outside
our immediate neighbourhood (the Local Group) does seem to agree with the expected abundance from
the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm. Here we make the link between these problems and observations of weak
lensing cosmic shear, pointing out that cosmic shear can make significant statements about missing
satellites problem in a statistical way. As an example and pedagogical application we use the recently
measured small-scale matter power spectrum from a spherical-Bessel analysis of current cosmic
shear data that constrains the suppression of power on small-scales and thus indirectly estimates,
on average, the abundance of dark matter halos. In this example application we find that, on average,
in a local region of $\sim $Gpc$^3$ there is no significant small-scale power suppression implying
that suppression of small-scale power is not a viable solution to the `missing satellites problem'
or, alternatively, that there is no `missing satellites problem' for dark matter masses $> 5 \times
10^9$ M$_{\odot}$. Further analysis of current and future weak lensing surveys will provide details
on the power spectrum at scales much smaller than $k > 10h$ Mpc$^{-1}$ corresponding roughly to masses
$M < 10^9 M_{\odot}$.
