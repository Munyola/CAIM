Albeit radial migration must be a ubiquitous process in disc galaxies, its significance in the evolution
of stellar discs is not always reflected through global trends. However, there are other key observables,
such as the metallicity distribution function (MDF), that may shed some light in this matter. We
argue that the shape of the MDF not only tells us whether the stellar disc experienced radial migration,
but it also contains important clues on the structure that triggered it. Specifically, the MDF contains
information about the dynamics and morphology of the spiral pattern. To constrain the spiral parameters,
we have included a detailed chemical tagging in our simulations; this allows us to produce a restriction
of the structural parameters of the spiral arms in the Milky Way as well as a method to constrain chemical
evolution models towards the center of the Galactic disc, where no chemical model provides information.
We also found that it is unlikely that the Sun was formed near its current galactocentric position,
therefore it might be inaccurate to consider the Sun as representative of the chemical abundances
in the solar neighborhood. We also show that a stellar disc of the Milky Way, after evolving dynamically
and chemically for 5 Gyr, preserves 80% of its original global metallicity gradient despite having
suffered important heating and radial migration; this means that the presence of a metallicity
gradient in a given galaxy, does not guarantee that radial mixing has not played a role in its evolution.
