Underlying nearly every quantitative discussion of the Cygnus Loop supernova remnant is uncertainty
about its distance. Here we present optical images and spectra of nebulosities around two stars
whose mass-loss material appears to have interacted with the remnant's expanding shock front and
thus can be used to estimate the Cygnus Loop's distance. Narrow passband images reveal a small emission-line
nebula surrounding an M4 red giant near the remnant's eastern nebula NGC 6992. Optical spectra of
the nebula show it to be shock-heated with significantly higher electron densities than seen in
the remnant's filaments. This along with its strong bow-shaped morphology suggests it is likely
red giant mass-loss material shocked by passage of the Cygnus Loop's blast wave. We also identify
a B7 star located along the remnant's northwestern limb which also appears to have interacted with
the remnant's shock wave. It lies within a small arc of nebulosity in an unusually complex region
of strongly curved and distorted filaments along the remnant's northern shock front suggestive
of a localized disturbance in the shock front due to the B star's stellar winds. Based on the assumption
that these two stars lie inside the remnant, combined with an estimated distance to a molecular cloud
situated along the remnant's western limb, we propose a distance to the Cygnus Loop of 1.0 +/- 0.2
kpc. Although larger than several recent estimates of 500 - 800 pc, a distance around 1 kpc helps resolve
difficulties with the remnant's observed P(cosmic ray)/P(gas) ratio and estimated supernova
explosion energy.
