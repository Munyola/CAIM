In contrast to the converging, achromatic behaviour of axisymmetric gravitational lenses, diverging
frequency-dependent lensing occurs from refraction due to a distribution of over-dense axisymmetric
plasma along an observer's line of sight. Such plasma lenses are particularly interesting from
the point of view of astronomical observations because they can both magnify and dim the appearance
of background sources as a function of frequency. Plasma lensing is believed to be involved in a number
of separate phenomena involving the scintillation of radio pulsars, extreme scattering events
of background radio sources and may also play a role in the generation of fast radio bursts. These
lensing phenomena are believed to occur in dense environments, in which there may be many density
perturbations between an observer and background source. In this work we generalize individual
plasma lens models to produce dual component lenses using families of plasma lens models previously
studied in the literature, namely the exponential and softened power-law lenses. Similar to binary
gravitational lens models, these dual component plasma lenses feature a rich and complex critical
and caustic morphology, as well as generate more complicated light curves. We map the number of criticals
formed for a given component separation and angular size, and highlight a relevant degeneracy between
two particular models. This work provides an argument in favor of close monitoring of extreme scattering
events in progress in order to break such model degeneracies.
