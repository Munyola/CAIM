Most galaxy evolution simulations as well as a variety of observational methods assume a linear
scaling between the (galaxy-averaged) dust-to-gas ratio D and metallicity Z of the interstellar
medium (ISM). Indeed, nearby galaxies with solar or moderately sub-solar metallicities clearly
follow this trend albeit with significant scatter. However, a growing number of observations show
that the linear scaling breaks down for metal-poor galaxies (Z<0.2 Z_sun), highlighting the
need for a more sophisticated modeling of the dust-to-metal ratio of galaxies. Here we study the
co-evolution of dust and metal abundances in galaxies with the help of a dynamical, one-zone model
that incorporates dust formation and destruction processes in addition to gas inflows, outflows,
and metal enrichment. The dynamical model is consistent with various observational constraints,
including the stellar mass -- metallicity relation, the stellar mass -- halo mass relation, and
the observed Z -- D relation for both metal-poor and metal-rich galaxies. The functional form of
the Z -- D relation follows from a basic equilibrium ansatz, similar to the ideas used previously
to model the stellar mass -- metallicity relation. Galactic outflows regulate the inflow rate of
gas from the cosmic web for galaxies of a given star formation rate. The mass loading factor of outflows
thus dictates the rate at which the dust and metal content of the ISM is diluted. The stellar mass dependence
of the mass loading factor drives the evolution of metallicities, dust-to-gas ratios, and dust-to-metal
ratios in galaxies.
