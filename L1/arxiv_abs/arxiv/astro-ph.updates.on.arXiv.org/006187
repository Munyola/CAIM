Disk galaxies at intermediate redshift ($z\sim0.7$) have been found in previous work to display
more optically thick behaviour than their local counterparts in the rest-frame B-band surface
brightness, suggesting an evolution in dust properties over the past $\sim$6 Gyr. We compare the
measured luminosities of face-on and edge-on star-forming galaxies at different wavelengths
(Ultraviolet (UV), mid-infrared (MIR), far-infrared (FIR), and radio) for two well-matched samples
of disk-dominated galaxies: a local Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)-selected sample at $z\sim0.07$
and a sample of disks at $z\sim0.7$ drawn from Cosmic Evolution Survey (COSMOS). We have derived
correction factors to account for the inclination dependence of the parameters used for sample
selection. We find that typical galaxies are transparent at MIR wavelengths at both redshifts and
that the FIR and radio emission is also transparent as expected. However, reduced sensitivity at
these wavelengths limits our analysis; we cannot rule out opacity in the FIR or radio. Ultra-violet
attenuation has increased between $z\sim0$ and $z\sim0.7$, with the $z\sim0.7$ sample being a
factor of $\sim$3.4 more attenuated. The larger UV attenuation at $z\sim0.7$ can be explained by
more clumpy dust around nascent star-forming regions. There is good agreement between the fitted
evolution of the normalisation of the SFR$_{\text{UV}}$ versus 1-cos(i) trend (interpreted as
the clumpiness fraction) and the molecular gas fraction/dust fraction evolution of galaxies found
out to $z<1$.
