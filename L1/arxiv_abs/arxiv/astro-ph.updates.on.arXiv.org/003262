Strong ionization on close-in extrasolar giant planets suggests that their atmospheres may be
affected by ion drag and resistive heating arising from wind-driven electrodynamics. Recent models
of ion drag on these planets, however, are based on thermal ionization only and do not include the
upper atmosphere above the 1 mbar level. These models are also based on simplified equations of resistive
MHD that are not always valid in extrasolar planet atmospheres. We show that photoionization dominates
over thermal ionization over much of the dayside atmosphere above the 100 mbar level, creating an
upper ionosphere dominated by ionization of H and He and a lower ionosphere dominated by ionization
of metals such as Na, K, and Mg. The resulting dayside electron densities on close-in exoplanets
are higher than those encountered in any planetary ionosphere of the solar system, and the conductivities
are comparable to the chromosphere of the Sun. Based on these results and assumed magnetic fields,
we constrain the conductivity regimes on close-in EGPs and use a generalized Ohm's law to study the
basic effects of electrodynamics in their atmospheres. We find that ion drag is important above
the 10 mbar level where it can also significantly alter the energy balance through resistive heating.
Due to frequent collisions of the electrons and ions with the neutral atmosphere, however, ion drag
is largely negligible in the lower atmosphere below the 10 mbar level for a reasonable range of planetary
magnetic moments [abridged].
