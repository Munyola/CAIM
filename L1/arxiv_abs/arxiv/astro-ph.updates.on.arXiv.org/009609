The compositions of stars are a critical diagnostic tool for many topics in astronomy such as the
evolution of our Galaxy, the formation of planets, and the uniqueness of the Sun. Previous spectroscopic
measurements indicate a large intrinsic variation in the elemental abundance patterns of stars
with similar overall metal content. However, systematic errors arising from inaccuracies in stellar
models are known to be a limiting factor in such studies, and thus it is uncertain to what extent the
observed diversity of stellar abundance patterns is real. Here we report the abundances of 30 elements
with precisions of 2% for 79 Sun-like stars within 100 parsecs. Systematic errors are minimized
in this study by focusing on solar twin stars and performing a line-by-line differential analysis
using high-resolution, high-signal-to-noise spectra. We resolve [X/Fe] abundance trends in
galactic chemical evolution at precisions of $10^{-3}$ dex Gyr$^{-1}$ and reveal that stars with
similar ages and metallicities have nearly identical abundance patterns. Contrary to previous
results, we find that the ratios of carbon-to-oxygen and magnesium-to-silicon in solar metallicity
stars are homogeneous to within 10% throughout the solar neighborhood, implying that exoplanets
may exhibit much less compositional diversity than previously thought. Finally, we demonstrate
that the Sun has a subtle deficiency in refractory material relative to >80% of solar twins (at 2$\sigma$
confidence), suggesting a possible signpost for planetary systems like our own.
