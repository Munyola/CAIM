We report new infrared measurements of the supermassive black hole at the Galactic Center, Sgr A*,
over a decade that was previously inaccessible at these wavelengths. This enables a variability
study that addresses variability timescales that are ten times longer than earlier published studies.
Sgr A* was initially detected in the near-infrared with adaptive optics observations in 2002. While
earlier data exists in form of speckle imaging (1995 - 2005), Sgr A* was not detected in the initial
analysis. Here, we improved our speckle holography analysis techniques. This has improved the
sensitivity of the resulting speckle images by up to a factor of three. Sgr A* is now detectable in
the majority of epochs covering 7 years. The brightness of Sgr A* in the speckle data has an average
observed K magnitude of 16.0, which corresponds to a dereddened flux density of $3.4$ mJy. Furthermore,
the flat power spectral density (PSD) of Sgr A* between $\sim$80 days and 7 years shows its uncorrelation
in time beyond the proposed single power-law break of $\sim$245 minutes. We report that the brightness
and its variability is consistent over 22 years. This analysis is based on simulations using Witzel
et al. (2018) model to characterize infrared variability from 2006 to 2016. Finally, we note that
the 2001 periapse of the extended, dusty object G1 had no apparent effect on the near-infrared emission
from accretion flow onto Sgr A*. The result is consistent with G1 being a self-gravitating object
rather than a disrupting gas cloud.
