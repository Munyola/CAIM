The transient Swift J1644+57 is believed to have been produced by an unlucky star wandering too close
to a supermassive black hole (BH) leading to a tidal disruption event. This unusual flare displayed
highly super-Eddington X-ray emission which likely originated in a relativistic, collimated
jet. This presents challenges to modern accretion and jet theory as upper limits of prior BH activity,
which we obtain from the radio afterglow of this event, imply that both the pre-disruption BH and
stellar magnetic fluxes fall many orders of magnitude short of what is required to power the observed
X-ray luminosity. We argue that a pre-existing, "fossil" accretion disc can contain a sufficient
reservoir of magnetic flux and that the stellar debris stream is capable of dragging this flux into
the BH. To demonstrate this, we perform local, 3D magnetohydrodynamic simulations of the disc--stream
interaction and demonstrate that the interface between the two is unstable to mixing. This mixing
entrains a sufficient amount of fossil disc magnetic flux into the infalling stellar debris to power
the jet. We argue that the interaction with the fossil disc can have a pronounced effect on the structure
and dynamics of mass fallback and likely the resulting transient. Finally, we describe possible
ramifications of these interactions on unresolved problems in tidal disruption dynamics, in particular,
the efficiency of debris circularization, and effects of the disruption on the preexisting black
hole system. Animations online: this http URL
