In this catalog, we present the results of a systematic study of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) with reliable
redshift estimates detected in the triggered mode of the Konus-Wind (KW) experiment during the
period from 1997 February to 2016 June. The sample consists of 150 GRBs (including twelve short/hard
bursts) and represents the largest set of cosmological GRBs studied to date over a broad energy band.
From the temporal and spectral analyses of the sample, we provide the burst durations, the spectral
lags, the results of spectral fits with two model functions, the total energy fluences, and the peak
energy fluxes. Based on the GRB redshifts, which span the range 0.1 <= z <= 5, we estimate the rest-frame,
isotropic-equivalent energy and peak luminosity. For 32 GRBs with reasonably-constrained jet
breaks we provide the collimation-corrected values of the energetics. We consider the behavior
of the rest-frame GRB parameters in the hardness-duration and hardness-intensity planes, and
confirm the "Amati" and "Yonetoku" relations for Type II GRBs. The correction for the jet collimation
does not improve these correlations for the KW sample. We discuss the influence of instrumental
selection effects on the GRB parameter distributions and estimate the KW GRB detection horizon,
which extends to z ~ 16.6, stressing the importance of GRBs as probes of the early Universe. Accounting
for the instrumental bias, we estimate the KW GRB luminosity evolution, luminosity and isotropic-energy
functions, and the evolution of the GRB formation rate, which are in general agreement with those
obtained in previous studies.
