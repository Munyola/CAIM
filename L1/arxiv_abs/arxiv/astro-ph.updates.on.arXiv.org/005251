We present and analyse quasi-simultaneous multi-epoch spectral energy distributions (SEDs)
of seven reverberation-mapped AGNs for which accurate black hole mass measurements and suitable
archival data are available from the 'AGN Watch' monitoring programs. We explore the potential
of optical-UV and X-ray data, obtained within 2 days, to provide more accurate SED-based measurements
of individual AGN and quantify the impact of source variability on key measurements typically used
to characterise the black hole accretion process plus on bolometric correction factors at 5100
{\AA}, 1350 {\AA} and for the 2-10 keV X-ray band, respectively. The largest SED changes occur on
long timescales (>1 year). For our small sample, the 1 micron to 10 keV integrated accretion luminosity
typically changes by 10% on short time-scales (over 20 days), by ~30% over a year, but can change by
100% or more for individual AGN. The EUV gap is the most uncertain part of the intrinsic SED, introducing
a ~25% uncertainty in the accretion-induced luminosity, relative to the model independent interpolation
method that we adopt. That aside, our analysis shows that the uncertainty in the accretion-induced
luminosity, the Eddington luminosity ratio and the bolometric correction factors can be reduced
(by a factor of two or more) by use of SEDs built from data obtained within 20 days. However, mass accretion
rate and mass accretion efficiency are mostly limited by the unknown EUV emission and the unknown
details of the central engine and our aspect angle.
