Recent radio astronomical observations have revealed that HC$_{5}$N, the second shortest cyanopolyyne
(HC$_{2n+1}$N), is abundant around some massive young stellar objects (MYSOs), which is not predicted
by classical carbon-chain chemistry. For example, the observed HC$_{5}$N abundance toward the
G28.28$-$0.36 MYSO is higher than that in L1527, which is one of the warm carbon chain chemistry (WCCC)
sources, by more than one order of magnitude (Taniguchi et al., 2017). In this paper, we present chemical
simulations of hot-core models with a warm-up period using the astrochemical code Nautilus. We
find that the cyanopolyynes are formed initially in the gas phase and accreted onto the bulk and surface
of granular ice mantles during the lukewarm phase, which occurs at $25 < T < 100$ K. In slow warm-up
period models, the peak abundances occur as the cyanopolyynes desorb from dust grains after the
temperature rises above 100 K. The lower limits of the abundances of HC$_{5}$N, CH$_{3}$CCH, and
CH$_{3}$OH observed in the G28.28$-$0.36 MYSO can be reproduced in our hot-core models, after their
desorption from dust grains. Moreover, previous observations suggested chemical diversity in
envelopes around different MYSOs. We discuss possible interpretations of relationships between
stages of the star-formation process and such chemical diversity, such as the different warm-up
timescales. This timescale depends not only on the mass of central stars but also on the relationship
between the size of warm regions and their infall velocity.
