We identify new clusters and characterize previously unknown Planck Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) sources
from the first Planck catalogue of SZ sources (PSZ1). The results presented here correspond to an
optical follow-up observational programme developed during approximately one year (2014) at
Roque de los Muchachos Observatory, using the 2.5m Isaac Newton telescope, the 3.5m Telescopio
Nazionale Galileo, the 4.2m William Herschel telescope and the 10.4m Gran Telescopio Canarias.
We characterize 115 new PSZ1 sources using deep optical imaging and spectroscopy. We adopt robust
criteria in order to consolidate the SZ counterparts by analysing the optical richness, the 2D galaxy
distribution, and velocity dispersions of clusters. Confirmed counterparts are considered to
be validated if they are rich structures, well aligned with the Planck PSZ1 coordinate and show relatively
high velocity dispersion. Following this classification, we confirm 53 clusters, which means
that 46% of this PSZ1 subsample has been validated and characterized with this technique. Sixty-two
SZ sources (54% of this PSZ1 subset) remain unconfirmed. In addition, we find that the fraction of
unconfirmed clusters close to the galactic plane (at |b|<25deg) is greater than that at higher galactic
latitudes (|b|>25deg), which indicates contamination produced by radio emission of galactic
dust and gas clouds on these SZ detections. In fact, in the majority of the cases, we detect important
galactic cirrus in the optical images, mainly in the SZ target located at low galactic latitudes,
which supports this hypothesis.
