As indicated by their special characteristics, the cold classical Kuiper belt objects (KBOs) formed
and survived at 42-47 au. Notably, they show a large fraction of equal-size binaries whose formation
is probably related to the accretion of KBOs themselves. These binaries are uncommon in other --hot,
resonant, scattered-- populations, which are thought to have been implanted from the massive disk
below 30 au to >30 au during Neptune's migration. Here we highlight the possibility that equal-size
binaries formed in the disk but were subsequently removed by impacts and/or dynamical effects (e.g.,
scattering encounters with Neptune). We determine the dependence of these processes on the size
and separation of binary components. Our results indicate that tighter binaries, if they formed
in the massive disk, have relatively good chances of survival (unless the disk was long-lived).
In contrast, the widest binaries in the hot population, such as 2002 VF130, have a very low survival
probability (<1%) even if the massive disk was short-lived. They may represent a trace of lucky survivors
of a much larger population of the original disk binaries, or they formed at ~30-40~au and dodged
the impact- and encounter-related perturbations that we studied here. We find that all known satellites
of the largest KBOs would survive during the dynamical implantation of these bodies in the Kuiper
belt. The low orbital eccentricities of Pluto's small moons may have been excited by impacts and/or
encounters of the Pluto system to Neptune.
