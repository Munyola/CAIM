EUV waves are large-scale disturbances in the solar corona initiated by coronal mass ejections.
However, solar EUV images show only the wave fronts projections along the line-of-sight of the spacecraft.
We perform 3D reconstructions of EUV wave front heights using multi-point observations from STEREO-A
and STEREO-B, and study their evolution to properly estimate the EUV wave kinematics. We develop
two different methods to solve the matching problem of the EUV wave crest on pairs of STEREO-A/-B
images by combining epipolar geometry with the investigation of perturbation profiles. The proposed
approaches are applicable at the early and maximum stage of the event when STEREO-A/-B see different
facets of the EUV wave, but also at the later stage when the wave front becomes diffusive and faint.
The techniques developed are demonstrated on two events observed at different separation of the
STEREO spacecraft (42$^\circ$ and 91$^\circ$). For the 7 December 2007 event, we find that the emission
of the EUV wave front mainly comes from a height range up to 90-104 Mm, decreasing later to 7-35 Mm.
Including the varying height of the EUV wave front allows us to correct the wave kinematics for the
projection effects, resulting in velocities in the range 217-266 km/s. For the 13 February 2009
event, the wave front height doubled from 54 to 93 Mm over 10 min, and the velocity derived is 205-208
km/s. In the two events under study, the corrected speeds differ by up to 25% from the uncorrected
ones, depending on the wave front height evolution.
