One of the most spectacular predictions of the general theory of relativity is the black hole, an
object that plays a central role in modern physics [1,2,3] and astrophysics [4,5]. Black holes are,
however, plagued by fundamental paradoxes that remain unresolved to this day. First, the black
hole event horizon is teleological in nature [6], which means that we need to know the entire future
space-time of the universe to determine the current location of the horizon. This is essentially
impossible. Second, any information carried by infalling matter is lost once the material falls
through the event horizon. Even though the black hole may later evaporate by emitting Hawking radiation
[7], the lost information does not reappear, which has the rather serious and disturbing consequence
that quantum unitarity is violated [8]. Here we propose that the above paradoxes are restricted
to a particular idealized model of collapse first studied in the 1930s [9, 10] in which the event horizon,
which defines the boundary of the black hole, forms initially, and the singularity in the interior
of the black hole forms at a later time. In contrast, gravitational collapse from more reasonable
and/or physically more realistic initial conditions often leads to models in which the event horizon
and the singularity form simultaneously. We show that this apparently simple modification mitigates
the causality and teleological paradoxes and at the same time lends support to two recently proposed
solutions to the information paradox, namely, the "firewall" [11] and "classical chaos" [12].
