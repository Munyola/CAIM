The properties of the first galaxies, expected to drive the Cosmic Dawn (CD) and the Epoch of Reionization
(EoR), are encoded in the 3D structure of the cosmic 21-cm signal. Parameter inference from upcoming
21-cm observations promises to revolutionize our understanding of these unseen galaxies. However,
prior inference was done using models with several simplifying assumptions. Here we introduce
a flexible, physically-motivated parametrization for high-$z$ galaxy properties, implementing
it in the public code 21cmFAST. In particular, we allow their star formation rates and ionizing escape
fraction to scale with the masses of their host dark matter halos, and directly compute inhomogeneous,
sub-grid recombinations in the intergalactic medium. Combining current Hubble observations
of the rest-frame UV luminosity function (UV LFs) at high-$z$ with a mock 1000h 21-cm observation
using the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Arrays (HERA), we constrain the parameters of our model
using a Monte Carlo Markov Chain sampler of 3D simulations, 21CMMC. We show that the amplitude and
scaling of the stellar mass with halo mass is strongly constrained by LF observations, while the
remaining galaxy properties are constrained mainly by 21-cm observations. The two data sets compliment
each other quite well, mitigating degeneracies intrinsic to each observation. All eight of our
astrophysical parameters are able to be constrained at the level of $\sim 10\%$ or better. The updated
versions of 21cmFAST and 21CMMC used in this work are publicly available.
