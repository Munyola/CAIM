One of the popular models for the low/hard state of Black Hole Binaries is that the standard accretion
disk is truncated and the hot inner region produces via Comptonization, the hard X-ray flux. This
is supported by the value of the high energy photon index, which is often found to be small $\sim$ 1.7
($<$ 2) implying that the hot medium is seed photons starved. On the other hand, the suggestive presence
of a broad relativistic Fe line during the hard state would suggest that the accretion disk is not
truncated but extends all the way to the inner most stable circle orbit. In such a case, it is a puzzle
why the hot medium would remain photon starved. The broad Fe line should be accompanied by a broad
smeared reflection hump at $\sim$ 30 keV and it may be that this additional component makes the spectrum
hard and the intrinsic photon index is larger, i.e. $>$ 2. This would mean that the medium is not photon
deficient, reconciling the presence of a broad Fe line in the observed hard state. To test this hypothesis,
we have analyzed the RXTE observations of GX 339-4 from the four outbursts during 2002-2011 and identify
the observations when the system was in the hard state and showed a broad Fe line. We have then attempted
to fit these observations with models, which include smeared reflection to understand whether
the intrinsic photon index can indeed be large. We find that, while for some observations the inclusion
of reflection does increase the photon index, there are hard state observations with broad Fe line
that have photon indices less than 2.
