Overcontact binary stars are systems of two stars where the component stars are in contact with each
other. This implies that they share a common envelope of gas. In this work we seek signatures of nonlinearity
and chaos in these stars by using time series analysis techniques. We use three main techniques,
namely the correlation dimension,f (\alpha) spectrum and the bicoherence. The former two are calculated
from the reconstructed dynamics, while the latter is calculated from the Fourier transforms of
the time series of intensity variations(light curves) of these stars. Our dataset consists of data
from 463 overcontact binary stars in the Kepler field of view [1]. Our analysis indicates nonlinearity
and signatures of chaos in almost all the light curves. We also explore whether the underlying nonlinear
properties of the stars are related to their physical properties like fill-out-factor, a measure
of the extend of contact between the components of an overcontact binary system . We observe that
significant correlations exist between the fill out factor and the nonlinear quantifiers. This
correlation is more pronounced in specific subcategories constructed based on the mass ratios
and effective temperatures of the binaries. The correlations observed can be indicative of variations
in the nonlinear properties of the star as it ages. We believe that this study relating nonlinear
and astrophysical properties of binary stars is the first of its kind and is an important starting
point for such studies in other astrophysical objects displaying nonlinear dynamical behaviour.
