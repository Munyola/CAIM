Bright Be star beta CMi has been identified as a non-radial pulsator on the basis of space photometry
with the MOST satellite and also as a single-line spectroscopic binary with a period of 170.4 d. The
purpose of this study is to re-examine both these findings, using numerous electronic spectra from
the Dominion Astrophysical Observatory, Ond\v{r}ejov Observatory, Universit\"atssterwarte
Bochum, archival electronic spectra from several observatories, and also the original MOST satellite
photometry. We measured the radial velocity of the outer wings of the double Halpha emission in all
spectra at our disposal and were not able to confirm significant radial-velocity changes. We also
discuss the problems related to the detection of very small radial-velocity changes and conclude
that while it is still possible that the star is a spectroscopic binary, there is currently no convincing
proof of it from the radial-velocity measurements. Wavelet analysis of the MOST photometry shows
that there is only one persistent (and perhaps slightly variable) periodicity of 0.617 d of the light
variations, with a double-wave light curve, all other short periods having only transient character.
Our suggestion that this dominant period is the star's rotational period agrees with the estimated
stellar radius, projected rotational velocity and with the orbital inclination derived by two
teams of investigators. New spectral observations obtained in the whole-night series would be
needed to find out whether some possibly real, very small radial-velocity changes cannot in fact
be due to rapid line-profile changes.
