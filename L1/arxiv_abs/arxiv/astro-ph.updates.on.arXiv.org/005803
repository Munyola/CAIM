We present optical photometry (i- and Z-band) and low-resolution spectroscopy (640-1015 nm) of
very faint candidate members (J = 20.2-21.2 mag) of the Pleiades star cluster (120 Myr). The main
goal is to address their cluster membership via photometric, astrometric, and spectroscopic studies,
and to determine the properties of the least massive population of the cluster through the comparison
of the data with younger and older spectral counterparts and state-of-the art model atmospheres.
We confirm three bona-fide Pleiades members that have extremely red optical and infrared colors,
effective temperatures of ~1150 K and ~1350 K, and masses in the interval 11-20 Mjup, and one additional
likely member that shares the same motion as the cluster but does not appear to be as red as the other
members with similar brightness. This latter object requires further near-infrared spectroscopy
to fully address its membership in the Pleiades. The optical spectra of two bona-fide members were
classified as L6-L7 and show features of KI, a tentative detection of CsI, hydrides and water vapor
with an intensity similar to high-gravity dwarfs of related classification despite their young
age. The properties of the Pleiades L6-L7 members clearly indicate that very red colors of L dwarfs
are not a direct evidence of ages younger than ~100 Myr. We also report on the determination of the
bolometric corrections for the coolest Pleiades members. These data can be used to interpret the
observations of the atmospheres of exoplanets orbiting stars.
