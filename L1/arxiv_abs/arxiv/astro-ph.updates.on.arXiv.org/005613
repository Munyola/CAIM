Fossil galaxy systems are classically thought to be the end result of galaxy group/cluster evolution,
as galaxies experiencing dynamical friction sink to the center of the group potential and merge
into a single, giant elliptical that dominates the rest of the members in both mass and luminosity.
Most fossil systems discovered lie within $z < 0.2$, which leads to the question: what were these
systems' progenitors? Such progenitors are expected to have imminent or ongoing major merging
near the brightest group galaxy (BGG) that, when concluded, will meet the fossil criteria within
the look back time. Since strong gravitational lensing preferentially selects groups merging
along the line of sight, or systems with a high mass concentration like fossil systems, we searched
the CASSOWARY survey of strong lensing events with the goal of determining if lensing systems have
any predisposition to being fossil systems or progenitors. We find that $\sim$13% of lensing groups
are identified as traditional fossils while only $\sim$3% of non-lensing control groups are. We
also find that $\sim$23% of lensing systems are traditional fossil progenitors compared to $\sim$17%
for the control sample. Our findings show that strong lensing systems are more likely to be fossil/pre-fossil
systems than comparable non-lensing systems. Cumulative galaxy luminosity functions of the lensing
and non-lensing groups also indicate a possible, fundamental difference between strong lensing
and non-lensing systems' galaxy populations with lensing systems housing a greater number of bright
galaxies even in the outskirts of groups.
