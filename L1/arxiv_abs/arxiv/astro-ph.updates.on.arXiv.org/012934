We investigated the time-variability and spectral properties of the eclipsing X-ray source Circinus
Galaxy X-1 (GG X-1), using Chandra, XMM-Newton and ROSAT. We phase-connected the lightcurves observed
over 20 years, and obtained a best-fitting period $P = (25,970.0 \pm 0.1)$ s $\approx$7.2 hr, and
a period derivative $\dot{P}/P = ( 10.2\pm4.6) \times 10^{-7}$ yr$^{-1}$. The X-ray lightcurve
shows asymmetric eclipses, with sharp ingresses and slow, irregular egresses. The eclipse profile
and duration vary substantially from cycle to cycle. We show that the X-ray spectra are consistent
with a power-law-like component, absorbed by neutral and ionized Compton-thin material, and by
a Compton-thick, partial-covering medium, responsible for the irregular dips. The high X-ray/optical
flux ratio rules out the possibility that CG X-1 is a foreground Cataclysmic Variable; in agreement
with previous studies, we conclude that it is the first example of a compact ultraluminous X-ray
source fed by a Wolf-Rayet star or stripped Helium star. Its unocculted luminosity varies between
$\approx$4 $\times 10^{39}$ erg s$^{-1}$ and $\approx$3 $\times 10^{40}$ erg s$^{-1}$. Both the
donor star and the super-Eddington compact object drive powerful outflows: we suggest that the
occulting clouds are produced in the wind-wind collision region and in the bow shock in front of the
compact object. Among the rare sample of Wolf-Rayet X-ray binaries, CG X-1 is an exceptional target
for studies of super-critical accretion and close binary evolution; it is also a likely progenitor
of gravitational wave events.
