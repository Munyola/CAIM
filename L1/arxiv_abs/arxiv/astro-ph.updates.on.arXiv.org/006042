We present and characterize the catalog of galaxy shape measurements that will be used for cosmological
weak lensing measurements in the Wide layer of the first year of the Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) survey.
The catalog covers an area of 136.9 deg$^2$ split into six fields, with a mean $i$-band seeing of $0.58$
arcsec and $5\sigma$ point-source depth of $i\sim 26$. Given conservative galaxy selection criteria
for first year science, the depth and excellent image quality results in unweighted and weighted
source number densities of 24.6 and 21.8 arcmin$^{-2}$, respectively. We define the requirements
for cosmological weak lensing science with this catalog, then focus on characterizing potential
systematics in the catalog using a series of internal null tests for problems with point-spread
function (PSF) modeling, shear estimation, and other aspects of the image processing. We find that
the PSF models narrowly meet requirements for weak lensing science with this catalog, with fractional
PSF model size residuals of approximately $0.003$ (requirement: 0.004) and the PSF model shape
correlation function $\rho_1<3\times 10^{-7}$ (requirement: $4\times 10^{-7}$) at 0.5$^\circ$
scales. A variety of galaxy shape-related null tests are statistically consistent with zero, but
star-galaxy shape correlations reveal additive systematics on $>1^\circ$ scales that are sufficiently
large as to require mitigation in cosmic shear measurements. Finally, we discuss the dominant systematics
and the planned algorithmic changes to reduce them in future data reductions.
