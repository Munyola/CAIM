We show that mid-infrared data from the all-sky WISE survey can be used as a robust photometric redshift
indicator for powerful radio AGN, in the absence of other spectroscopic or multi-band photometric
information. Our work is motivated by a desire to extend the well-known K-z relation for radio galaxies
to the wavelength range covered by the all-sky WISE mid-infrared survey. Using the LARGESS radio
spectroscopic sample as a training set, and the mid-infrared colour information to classify radio
sources, we generate a set of redshift probability distributions for the hosts of high-excitation
and low-excitation radio AGN. We test the method using spectroscopic data from several other radio
AGN studies, and find good agreement between our WISE-based redshift estimates and published spectroscopic
redshifts out to z ~ 1 for galaxies and z ~ 3-4 for radio-loud QSOs. Our chosen method is also compared
against other classification methods and found to perform reliably. This technique is likely to
be particularly useful in the analysis of upcoming large-area radio surveys with SKA pathfinder
telescopes, and our code is publicly available. As a consistency check, we show that our WISE-based
redshift estimates for sources in the 843 MHz SUMSS survey reproduce the redshift distribution
seen in the CENSORS study up to z ~ 2. We also discuss two specific applications of our technique for
current and upcoming radio surveys; an interpretation of large scale HI absorption surveys, and
a determination of whether low-frequency peaked spectrum sources lie at high redshift.
