We use all the published data in radio, optical and X-ray bands to analysis and model afterglows of
GW/GRB 170817A. Our analysis is based on a phenomenological gamma-ray burst generator model which
we previously used to study the prompt gamma-ray emission of this important transient. The data
is fit with a 3-component model. Taking into account relativistic beaming, we interpret the model
as approximately presenting the profile of a relativistic structured jet with a rapidly declining
Lorentz from our line of sight, where it is ultra-relativistic, to outer boundaries where it becomes
a mildly relativistic cocoon with a Lorentz factor of $\sim 1.2$. The ultra-relativistic core of
the jet has a Lorentz factor of $\gtrsim 100$, which is consistent with properties of the jet obtained
from the prompt gamma-ray. This shows that after prompt internal shocks the remnant of the jet retains,
in some extend, its internal collimation and coherence. According to this model slow rise of afterglows
is associated to low column density of the jet when external shocks began, and to low density of circum-burst
material and its long distance from the merger. The latter caused thinning of the jet through expansion
and energy dissipation. We discuss consequences of these observations for origin and physical
properties of circum-burst material around Binary Neutron Stars (BNS). The model also confirms
our previous analysis, which showed that an outflow with a Lorentz factor of $\sim 2-5$ cannot explain
the afterglows without an additional X-ray source or significant absorption of optical/IR photons.
