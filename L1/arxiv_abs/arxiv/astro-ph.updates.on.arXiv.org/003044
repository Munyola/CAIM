[abridged] Here we present the analysis of multifrequency data gathered for the FRII radio galaxy
PKS B1358-113, hosted in the brightest cluster galaxy of Abell 1836. The galaxy harbors one of the
most massive black holes known to date and our analysis of the optical data reveals that this black
hole is only weakly active. Based on new Chandra and XMM-Newton X-ray observations and archival
radio data we derive the preferred range for the jet kinetic luminosity $\sim (0.5-3) \times 10^{45}$
erg s$^{-1}$. This is above the values implied by various scaling relations proposed for radio sources
in galaxy clusters, being instead very close to the maximum jet power allowed for the given accretion
rate. We constrain the radio source lifetime as $\sim 40-70$ Myrs, and the total amount of deposited
jet energy $\sim (2-8) \times 10^{60}$\,ergs. The detailed analysis of the X-ray data provides
indication for the presence of a bow-shock driven by the expanding radio lobes into the Abell 1836
cluster environment, with the corresponding Mach number $\sim 2-4$. This, together with the recently
growing evidence that powerful FRII radio galaxies may not be uncommon in the centers of clusters
at higher redshifts, supports the idea that jet-induced shock heating may indeed play an important
role in shaping the properties of clusters, galaxy groups, and galaxies in formation. We speculate
on a possible bias against detecting jet-driven shocks in poorer environments, resulting from
an inefficient electron heating at the shock front, combined with a relatively long electron-ion
equilibration timescale.
