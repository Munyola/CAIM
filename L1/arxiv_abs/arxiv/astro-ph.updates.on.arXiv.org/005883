Modelling the distribution of neutral hydrogen (HI) in dark matter halos is important for studying
galaxy evolution in the cosmological context. We compute the abundance and clustering properties
of HI-selected galaxies using halo models constrained by data from the ALFALFA survey. We apply
an MCMC-based statistical analysis to constrain the model parameters through two different approaches.
In the first approach, we describe the HI content of galaxies in dark matter halos directly, using
a halo occupation distribution (HOD) for the number counts of HI galaxies. We find that a significant
number of low mass ($m_{\rm HI} \lesssim 10^{9.5} M_{\odot}$) galaxies must be satellites. In the
second, more novel approach, we infer the HI-dark matter connection at the massive end ($m_{\rm
HI} > 10^{9.5} M_{\odot}$) $\textit{indirectly}$, using optical properties of low-redshift
galaxies as an intermediary. In particular, we use a previously calibrated optical HOD describing
the luminosity- and colour-dependent clustering of SDSS galaxies and describe the HI content using
a statistical scaling relation between the optical properties and HI mass. The resulting best-fit
scaling relation identifies massive HI galaxies primarily with optically faint blue centrals,
consistent with expectations from galaxy formation models. Our results will be useful in making
forecasts for future observations of HI galaxies with upcoming radio telescopes like the SKA, as
well as in exploring synergies between SKA and optical surveys such as Euclid and LSST.
