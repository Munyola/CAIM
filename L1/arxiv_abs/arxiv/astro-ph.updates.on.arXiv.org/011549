We present a suite of 18 synthetic sky catalogs designed to support science analysis of galaxies
in the Dark Energy Survey Year 1 (DES Y1) data. For each catalog, we use a computationally efficient
empirical approach, ADDGALS, to embed galaxies within light-cone outputs of three dark matter
simulations that resolve halos with masses above ~5x10^12 h^-1 m_sun at z <= 0.32 and 10^13 h^-1 m_sun
at z~2. The embedding method is tuned to match the observed evolution of galaxy counts at different
luminosities as well as the spatial clustering of the galaxy population. Galaxies are lensed by
matter along the line of sight --- including magnification, shear, and multiple images --- using
CALCLENS, an algorithm that calculates shear with 0.42 arcmin resolution at galaxy positions in
the full catalog. The catalogs presented here, each with the same LCDM cosmology (denoted Buzzard),
contain on average 820 million galaxies over an area of 1120 square degrees with positions, magnitudes,
shapes, photometric errors, and photometric redshift estimates. We show that the weak-lensing
shear catalog, redMaGiC galaxy catalogs and redMaPPer cluster catalogs provide plausible realizations
of the same catalogs in the DES Y1 data by comparing their magnitude, color and redshift distributions,
angular clustering, and mass-observable relations, making them useful for testing analyses that
use these samples. We make public the galaxy samples appropriate for the DES Y1 data, as well as the
data vectors used for cosmology analyses on these simulations.
