The Gaia mission has opened a new window into the internal kinematics of young star clusters at the
sub-km/s level, with implications for our understanding of how star clusters form and evolve. We
use a sample of 28 clusters and associations with ages from $\sim$1-5 Myr, where cluster members
are already known from previous X-ray, optical, and infrared studies. Proper motions from Gaia
DR2 reveal that 70% of these clusters show signs of expansion, with typical expansion velocities
of $\sim$0.5 km/s. Furthermore, in many expanding associations, there is a positive radial gradient
in the expansion velocity. We consider NGC 6530 and the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC) as prototypes
for systems with and without expansion. Velocity dispersions among the sample clusters and associations
range from $\sigma_{1D}=1$-3 km/s. NGC 6530 is gravitationally unbound, with $\sigma_{1D}=2.2\pm0.2$
km/s and expansion velocity 0.9 km/s, while the denser ONC is consistent with virial equilibrium,
having $\sigma_{1D}=1.8\pm0.1$ km/s and a Gaussian velocity distribution. The ONC also has a nearly
constant velocity dispersion as a function of radius, but another non-expanding cluster, NGC 6231,
has a velocity dispersion that decreases with radius. For those star-forming regions that contain
multiple clusters or subclusters, we examine the kinematics of the individual groups and find that
there is no evidence for ongoing coalescence of these groups. We compare our results to a cluster
formation simulation, and comment on the implications for cluster assembly and the role of gas expulsion
in cluster dissipation.
