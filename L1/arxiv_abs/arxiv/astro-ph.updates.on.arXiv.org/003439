The equatorial current sheet in pulsar magnetospheres is often regarded as an ideal site for particle
acceleration via relativistic reconnection. Using 2D spherical particle-in-cell simulations,
we investigate particle acceleration in the axisymmetric pulsar magnetosphere as a function of
the injected plasma multiplicity and magnetization. We observe a clear transition from a highly
charge-separated magnetosphere for low plasma injection with little current and spin-down power,
to a nearly force-free solution for high plasma multiplicity characterized by a prominent equatorial
current sheet and high spin-down power. We find significant magnetic dissipation close to the Y-point,
up to about 30% in the high-multiplicity regime. Additional dissipation occurs at larger distances
where the kink instability deforms the layer significantly. The simulations unambiguously demonstrate
that the dissipated Poynting flux is efficiently channeled to the particles in the sheet, close
to the Y-point within about 1-2 light cylinder radii from the star. The mean particle energy in the
sheet is given by the upstream plasma magnetization at the light cylinder. The study of particle
orbits shows that all energetic particles originate from the boundary layer between the open and
the closed field lines. Energetic positrons always stream outward, while high-energy electrons
precipitate back towards the star through the sheet and along the separatrices, which may result
in auroral-like emission. Our results suggest that the current sheet and the separatrices may be
the main source of high-energy radiation in young pulsars.
