To understand the formation and composition of planetary systems it is important to study their
host stars composition since both are formed in the same stellar nebula. In this work we analyze the
behaviour of chemical abundances of Cu, Zn, Sr, Y, Zr, Ba, Ce, Nd and Eu in the large and homogeneous
HARPS-GTO planet search sample ($R \sim$ 115000). This sample is composed of 120 stars hosting high-mass
planets, 29 stars hosting exclusively Neptunians and Super-Earths and 910 stars without detected
giant planets. We compare the [X/Fe] ratios of such elements in different metallicity bins and we
find that planet hosts present higher abundances of Zn for [Fe/H]$<$--0.1 dex. On the other hand,
Ba, Sr, Ce and Zr abundances are underabundant in stars with planets, with a bigger difference for
stars only hosting low-mass planets. However, most of the offsets found can be explained by differences
in stellar parameters and by the fact that planet hosts at low metallicity mostly belong to the Galactic
thick disk. Only in the case of Ba we find a statistically significant (3$\sigma$) underabundance
of 0.03 dex for low-mass planet hosts. The origin of these elements is quite complex due to their evolution
during the history of the Galaxy. Therefore, it is necessary to understand and characterize the
stellar populations to which planet hosts belong in order to do a fair comparison with stars without
detected planets. This work demonstrates that the effects of Galactic chemical evolution and not
the presence of planets mostly account for the differences we find.
