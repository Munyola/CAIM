The Luminous Infrared Galaxy NGC1614 hosts a prominent circumnuclear ring of star formation. However,
the nature of the dominant emitting mechanism in its central ~100 pc is still under debate. We present
sub-arcsecond angular resolution radio, mid-infrared, Pa-alpha, optical, and X-ray observations
of NGC1614, aimed at studying in detail both the circumnuclear ring and the nuclear region. The 8.4
GHz continuum emission traced by the Very Large Array (VLA) and the Gemini/T-ReCS 8.7 micron emission,
as well as the Pa-alpha line emission, show remarkable morphological similarities within the star-forming
ring, suggesting that the underlying emission mechanisms are tightly related. We used an HST/NICMOS
Pa-alpha map of similar resolution to our radio maps to disentangle the thermal free-free and non-thermal
synchrotron radio emission, from which we obtained the intrinsic synchrotron power-law for each
individual region within the central kpc of NGC1614. The radio ring surrounds a relatively faint,
steep-spectrum source at the very center of the galaxy, suggesting that the central source is not
powered by an AGN, but rather by a compact (r < 90 pc) starburst. Chandra X-ray data also show that
the central kpc region is dominated by starburst activity, without requiring the existence of an
AGN. We also used publicly available infrared data to model-fit the spectral energy distribution
of both the starburst ring and a putative AGN in NGC1614. In summary, we conclude that there is no need
to invoke an AGN to explain the observed bolometric properties of the galaxy.
