When a star approaches a black hole closely, it may be pulled apart by gravitational forces in a tidal
disruption event (TDE). The flares produced by TDEs are unique tracers of otherwise quiescent supermassive
black holes (SMBHs) located at the centre of most galaxies. In particular, the appearance of such
flares and the subsequent decay of the light curve are both sensitive to whether the star is partially
or totally destroyed by the tidal field. However, the physics of the disruption and the fall-back
of the debris are still poorly understood. We are here modelling the hydrodynamical evolution of
realistic stars as they approach a SMBH on parabolic orbits, using for the first time the moving-mesh
code AREPO, which is particularly well adapted to the problem through its combination of quasi-Lagrangian
behaviour, low advection errors, and high accuracy typical of mesh-based techniques. We examine
a suite of simulations with different impact parameters, allowing us to determine the critical
distance at which the star is totally disrupted, the energy distribution and the fallback rate of
the debris, as well as the hydrodynamical evolution of the stellar remnant in the case of a partial
disruption. Interestingly, we find that the internal evolution of the remnant's core is strongly
influenced by persistent vortices excited in the tidal interaction. These should be sites of strong
magnetic field amplification, and the associated mixing may profoundly alter the subsequent evolution
of the tidally pruned star.
