Gravity-induced non-Gaussianity in the large-scale structure of the Universe, characterised
by higher-order statistics such as the bispectrum (three-point cumulant), is expected to contain
rich cosmological information. A measurement of the bispectrum will not only improve the cosmological
constraints, but also give us the possibility to probe gravity on cosmological scales. In this paper,
we present a framework to numerically calculate the one-loop matter bispectrum based on standard
perturbation theory (SPT). This approach allows general modifications to the standard $\Lambda$CDM
model to be easily implemented. We demonstrate the performance of the bispectrum calculation in
three representative cases, namely the Vainshtein-screened Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati (DGP)
model, the chameleon-screened Hu-Sawicki $f(R)$ model and the phenomenological dark scattering
(DS) momentum-exchange model. The predicted bispectra are then compared with measured results
from a set of cosmological $N$-body simulations, and the impact of possible systematics arising
from simplified or approximate treatments in the perturbative calculation is studied in detail.
We find that the one-loop bispectrum calculation offers significantly more information on general
screening and momentum exchange effects than the leading-order bispectrum calculation. Further,
the accuracy of the one-loop prediction is shown to be comparable to non-linear fitting formulas
over a wide range of wavenumbers ($k\lesssim0.3\,h$$\mbox{Mpc}^{-1}$) even at lower redshifts,
$z\lesssim 1$.
