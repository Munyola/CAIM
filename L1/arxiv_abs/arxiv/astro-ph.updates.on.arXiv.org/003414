Turbulence is ubiquitous in the interstellar medium (ISM) of the Milky Way and other spiral galaxies.
The energy source for this turbulence has been much debated with many possible origins proposed.
The universality of turbulence, its reported large-scale driving, and that it occurs also in starless
molecular clouds, challenges models invoking any stellar source. A more general process is needed
to explain the observations. In this work we study the role of galactic spiral arms. This is accomplished
by means of three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations which follow the dynamical evolution
of interstellar diffuse clouds (100cm-3) interacting with the gravitational potential field
of the spiral pattern. We find that the tidal effects of the arm's potential on the cloud result in
internal vorticity, fragmentation and hydrodynamical instabilities. The triggered turbulence
result in large-scale driving, on sizes of the ISM inhomogeneities, i.e. as large as 100pc, and efficiencies
in converting potential energy into turbulence in the range 10 to 25 percent per arm crossing. This
efficiency is much higher than those found in previous models. The statistics of the turbulence
in our simulations are strikingly similar to the observed power spectrum and Larson scaling relations
of molecular clouds and the general ISM. The dependency found from different models indicate that
the ISM turbulence is mainly related to local spiral arm properties, such as its mass density and
width. This correlation seems in agreement with recent high angular resolution observations of
spiral galaxies, e.g. M51 and M33.
