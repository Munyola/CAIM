We present the results of our power spectral analysis for the BL Lac object OJ 287, utilizing the Fermi-LAT
survey at high-energy gamma-rays, the Swift-XRT data in X-rays, several ground-based telescopes
and the Kepler satellite in optical, and single-dish GHz-band radio telescopes. The multiwavelength
light curves of the source are modeled in terms of a continuous-time auto regressive moving average
(CARMA) process. Due to the inclusion of the Kepler data, we were able to construct for the first time
the optical variability power spectrum without any gaps across ~ 6 dex in temporal frequencies.
Our analysis reveals that the power spectra derived at radio frequencies are of a pure red-noise
type on the timescales ranging from tens of years down to months. The overall optical power spectrum
is also consistent with a red noise on the variability timescales ranging from 117 years down to hours,
with no hints for any quasi-periodic oscillations, but instead a break near variability timescales
~ 1 day. The power spectrum derived at X-ray photon energies resembles the radio and optical power
spectra on the analogous timescales. Finally, the high-energy gamma-ray power spectrum of OJ 287
is noticeably different from the radio, optical, and X-ray power spectra of the source: we have detected
the characteristic relaxation timescale in the Fermi-LAT data, corresponding to ~ 100 days, such
that on the timescales longer than this, the power spectrum is consistent with an uncorrelated (white)
noise, while on the shorter variability timescales with a correlated (colored) noise.
