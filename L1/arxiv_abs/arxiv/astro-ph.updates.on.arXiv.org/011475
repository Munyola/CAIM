We aim to determine the distributions of molecular SiS and CS in the circumstellar envelopes of oxygen-rich
asymptotic giant branch stars and how these distributions differ between stars that lose mass at
different rates. In this study we analyse ALMA observations of SiS and CS emission lines for three
oxygen-rich galactic AGB stars: IK Tau, with a moderately high mass-loss rate of $5\times10^{-6}$M$_\odot$
yr$^{-1}$, and W Hya and R Dor with low mass loss rates of $\sim1\times10^{-7}$M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$.
These molecules are usually more abundant in carbon stars but the high sensitivity of ALMA allows
us to detect their faint emission in the low mass-loss rate AGB stars. The high spatial resolution
of ALMA also allows us to precisely determine the spatial distribution of these molecules in the
circumstellar envelopes. We run radiative transfer models to calculate the molecular abundances
and abundance distributions for each star. We find a spread of peak SiS abundances with $\sim10^{-8}$
for R Dor, $\sim10^{-7}$ for W Hya, and $\sim3\times10^{-6}$ for IK Tau relative to H$_2$. We find
lower peak CS abundances of $\sim7\times10^{-9}$ for R Dor, $\sim7\times10^{-8}$ for W Hya and
$\sim4\times10^{-7}$ for IK Tau, with some stratifications in the abundance distributions. For
IK Tau we also calculate abundances for the detected isotopologues: C$^{34}$S, $^{29}$SiS, $^{30}$SiS,
Si$^{33}$S, Si$^{34}$S, $^{29}$Si$^{34}$S, and $^{30}$Si$^{34}$S. Overall the isotopic ratios
we derive for IK Tau suggest a lower metallicity than solar.
