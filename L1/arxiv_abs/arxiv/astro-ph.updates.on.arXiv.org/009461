We carry out spatially resolved spectral analysis with a physical scale of $\sim$10 pc in X-ray for
the superbubble 30 Dor C, which has the largest diameter of $\sim$80 pc and the brightest non-thermal
emission in superbubbles for the first time. We aim at investigating spatial variation of the physical
properties of non-thermal emission as detected in some supernova remnants in order to study particle
acceleration in a superbubble. We demonstrated that non-thermal components are detected in all
the regions covering the entire field of 30 Dor C. The spectra in the west region of 30 Dor C can be described
with a combination of the thermal and non-thermal components while the spectra in the east region
can be fitted with the non-thermal component alone. The photon index and absorption corrected intensity
in 2-10 keV of the non-thermal component show spatial variation from $\sim$2.0 to $\sim$3.7 and
(4-130) $\times$ 10$^{-8}$ erg~s$^{-1}$~cm$^{-2}$~str$^{-1}$, respectively, and the negative
correlation between the non-thermal physical properties is observed. The temperature and normalization
of the thermal component also vary within a range of $\sim$0.2-0.3 keV and $\sim$0.2-7 $\times$
10$^{17}$ cm$^{-5}$ str$^{-1}$, respectively, and the positive correlation between the photon
index and the normalization is also detected. We revealed the correlations in a supperbubble for
the first time as is the case in SNRs, which suggests the possibility that the same acceleration mechanism
works also in the supperbubble.
