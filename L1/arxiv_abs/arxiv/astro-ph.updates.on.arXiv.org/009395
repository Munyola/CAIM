White dwarfs are excellent forensic tools for studying end-of-life issues surrounding low- and
intermediate-mass stars, and the old, solar-metallicity open star cluster Messier 67 is a proven
laboratory for the study of stellar evolution for solar-type stars. In this paper, we present a detailed
spectroscopic study of brighter (M_g < 12.4) white dwarfs in Messier 67, and, in combination with
previously-published proper motion membership determinations, we identify a clean, representative
sample of cluster white dwarfs, including 13 members with hydrogen-dominated atmospheres, at
least one of which is a candidate double degenerate, and 5 members with helium-dominated atmospheres.
Using this sample we test multiple predictions surrounding the final stages of stellar evolution
in solar type stars. In particular, the stochasticity of the integrated mass lost by ~1.5 solar mass
stars is less than 7% of the white dwarf remnant mass. We identify white dwarfs likely resulting from
binary evolution, including at least one blue straggler remnant and two helium core white dwarfs.
We observe no evidence of a significant population of helium core white dwarfs formed by enhanced
mass loss on the red giant branch of the cluster. The distribution of white dwarf atmospheric compositions
is fully consistent with that in the field, limiting proposed mechanisms for the suppression of
helium atmosphere white dwarf formation in star clusters. In short, the white dwarf population
of Messier 67 is fully consistent with basic predictions of single- and multiple-star stellar evolution
theories for solar metallicity stars.
