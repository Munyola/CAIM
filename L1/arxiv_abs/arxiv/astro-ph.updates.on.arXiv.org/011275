We have designed the Extremely Luminous Quasar Survey (ELQS) to provide a highly complete census
of unobscured UV-bright quasars during the cosmic noon, $z=2.8-5.0$. Here we report the discovery
of 70 new quasars in the ELQS South Galactic Cap (ELQS-S) quasar sample, doubling the number of known
extremely luminous quasars in $4,237.3\,\rm{deg}^2$ of the SDSS footprint. These observations
conclude the ELQS and we present the properties of the full ELQS quasar catalog, containing 407 quasars
over $11,838.5\,\rm{deg}^2$. Our novel ELQS quasar selection strategy resulted in unprecedented
completeness at the bright end and allowed us to discover 109 new quasars in total. This marks an increase
of $\sim36\%$ (109/298) to the known population at these redshifts and magnitudes, while we further
are able to retain a selection efficiency of $\sim80\%$. On the basis of 166 quasars from the full
ELQS quasar catalog, who adhere to the uniform criteria of the 2MASS point source catalog, we measure
the bright-end quasar luminosity function (QLF) and extend it one magnitude brighter than previous
studies. Assuming a single power law with exponential density evolution for the functional form
of the QLF, we retrieve the best fit parameters from a maximum likelihood analysis. We find a steep
bright-end slope of $\beta\approx-4.1$ and we can constrain the bright-end slope to $\beta\leq-3.4$
with $99\%$ confidence. The density is well modeled by the exponential redshift evolution, resulting
in a moderate decrease with redshift ($\gamma\approx-0.4$).
