The simultaneous detection of gravitational and electromagnetic waves from a binary neutron star
merger has both solidified the link between neutron star mergers and short-duration gamma-ray
bursts (GRBs) and demonstrated the ability of astronomers to follow-up the gravitational wave
detection to place constraints on the ejecta from these mergers as well as the nature of the GRB engine
and its surroundings. As the sensitivity of aLIGO and VIRGO increases, it is likely that a growing
number of such detections will occur in the next few years, leading to a sufficiently-large number
of events to constrain the populations of these GRB events. While long-duration GRBs originate
from massive stars and thus are located near their stellar nurseries, binary neutron stars may merge
on much longer timescales, and thus may have had time to migrate appreciably. The strength and character
of the electromagnetic afterglow emission of binary neutron star mergers is a sensitive function
of the circum-merger environment. Though the explosion sites of short GRBs have been explored in
the literature, the question has yet to be fully addressed in its cosmological context. We present
cosmological simulations following the evolution of a galaxy cluster including star formation
combined with binary population synthesis models to self-consistently track the locations and
environmental gas densities of compact binary merger sites throughout the cosmic web. We present
probability distributions for densities as a function of redshift and discuss model sensitivity
to population synthesis model assumptions.
