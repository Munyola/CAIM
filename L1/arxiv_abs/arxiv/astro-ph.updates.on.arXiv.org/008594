We develop a practical methodology to remove modes from a galaxy survey power spectrum that are associated
with systematic errors. We apply this to the BOSS CMASS sample, to see if it removes the excess power
previously observed beyond the best-fit $\Lambda$CDM model on very large scales. We consider several
possible sources of data contamination, and check whether they affect the number of targets that
can be observed and the power spectrum measurements. We describe a general framework for how such
knowledge can be transformed into template fields. Mode subtraction can then be used to remove these
systematic contaminants at least as well as applying corrective weighting to the observed galaxies,
but benefits from giving an unbiased power. Even after applying templates for all known systematics,
we find a large-scale power excess, but this is reduced compared with that observed using the weights
provided by the BOSS team. This excess is at much larger scales than the BAO scale and does not affect
the main results of BOSS. However, it will be important for the measurement of a scale-dependent
bias due to primordial non-Gaussianity. The excess is beyond that allowed by any simple model of
non-Gaussianity matching Planck data, and is not matched in other surveys. We show that this power
excess can further be reduced but is still present using "phenomenological" templates, designed
to consider further potentially unknown sources of systematic contamination. As all discrepant
angular modes can be removed using "phenomenological" templates, the potentially remaining contaminant
acts radially.
