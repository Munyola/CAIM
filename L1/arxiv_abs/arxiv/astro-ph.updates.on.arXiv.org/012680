In the present paper, we explore to apply the GRAVITY at The Very Large Telescope Interferometry
(VLTI) with unprecedented spatial resolution to identify close binaries of supermassive black
holes (CB-SMBHs) in active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Each SMBH is assumed to be separately surrounded
by their own broad-line regions (BLRs) composed of clouds with virialized motion. Composition
of the binary orbital motion and the virial motion of clouds in each BLR intrinsically determines
the projected velocity fields and hence differential phase curves, which are obviously different
from that of a single BLR. We calculate emission line profiles and differential phase curves of CB-SMBHs
applied to the GRAVITY. For the simplest case with three parallel angular momentum of two BLRs and
the orbital, a phase platform generally appears in the phase curves. For other combinations of the
angular momentum, the platform is replaced by new peaks and valleys variously depending on the situations.
Given a combination, phase curves are also sensitive to changes of parameters of binary system.
All these features are easily distinguished from the well-known $S$-shaped phase curves of a single
BLR so that the GRAVITY is expected to reveal signals of CB-SMBH from candidates of AGNs. With joint
observations of reverberation mapping campaigns, we can reliably identify CB-SMBHs, in the meanwhile
their orbital parameters could be measured. This is anticipated for future detection of low-frequency
gravitational waves as well as test of their properties.
