Estimating the mass of a supermassive black hole (SMBH) in an active galactic nucleus (AGN) usually
relies on the assumption that the broad line region (BLR) is virialized. However, this assumption
seems invalid in BLR models that consists of an accretion disk and its wind. The disk is likely Keplerian
and therefore virialized. However, the wind material must, beyond a certain point, be dominated
by an outward force that is stronger than gravity. Here, we analyze hydrodynamic simulations of
four different disk winds: an isothermal wind, a thermal wind from an X-ray heated disk, and two line-driven
winds, one with and the other without X-ray heating and cooling. For each model, we check whether
gravity governs the flow properties, by computing and analyzing the volume-integrated quantities
that appear in the virial theorem: internal, kinetic, and gravitational energies, We find that
in the first two models, the winds are non-virialized whereas the two line-driven disk winds are
virialized up to a relatively large distance. The line-driven winds are virialized because they
accelerate slowly so that the rotational velocity is dominant and the wind base is very dense. For
the two virialized winds, the so-called projected virial factor scales with inclination angle
as $1/ \sin^2{i}$. Finally, we demonstrate that an outflow from a Keplerian disk becomes unvirialized
more slowly when it conserves the gas specific angular momentum -- as in the models considered here,
than when it conserves the angular velocity -- as in the so-called magneto-centrifugal winds.
