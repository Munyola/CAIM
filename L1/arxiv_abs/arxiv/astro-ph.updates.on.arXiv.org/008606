Detailed modeling of the recent star formation histories (SFHs) of post-starburst (or "E+A") galaxies
is impeded by the degeneracy between the time elapsed since the starburst ended (post-burst age),
the fraction of stellar mass produced in the burst (burst strength), and the burst duration. To resolve
this issue, we combine GALEX ultraviolet photometry, SDSS photometry and spectra, and new stellar
population synthesis models to fit the SFHs of 532 post-starburst galaxies. In addition to an old
stellar population and a recent starburst, 48% of the galaxies are best fit with a second recent burst.
Lower stellar mass galaxies (log M$_\star$/M$_\odot<10.5$) are more likely to experience two
recent bursts, and the fraction of their young stellar mass is more strongly anti-correlated with
their total stellar mass. Applying our methodology to other, younger post-starburst samples,
we identify likely progenitors to our sample and examine the evolutionary trends of molecular gas
and dust content with post-burst age. We discover a significant (4$\sigma$) decline, with a 117-230
Myr characteristic depletion time, in the molecular gas to stellar mass fraction with the post-burst
age. The implied rapid gas depletion rate of 2-150 M$_\odot$yr$^{-1}$ cannot be due to current star
formation, given the upper limits on the current SFRs in these post-starbursts. Nor are stellar
winds or SNe feedback likely to explain this decline. Instead, the decline points to the expulsion
or destruction of molecular gas in outflows, a possible smoking gun for AGN feedback.
