Using recent compilations of detailed X-ray observations and spectral models of exceptional quality,
we record the electron cyclotron resonance absorption (ECRA) features that have been detected
in 45 pulsating high-mass X-ray binaries (HMXBs) and ultraluminous X-ray (ULX) sources harboring
neutron stars, although seven of these detections are still questionable and another 21 are single
and/or not independently confirmed. From the comprehensive catalogs of Jaisawal \& Naik and Staubert
et al. and from several additional recent observations, we produce two lists of HMXB ECRA sources:
a list of 17 sources in which multiple ECRA lines or single very low-energy lines are seen, in which
we can reasonably assume that the lowest energy reveals the fundamental cyclotron level for each
source; and a `contaminated' list of 38 sources including the 21 detections of single ECRA lines
that may (not) be higher-level harmonics. Both lists confirm a previous result that we have obtained
independently by modeling the propeller lines of Magellanic HMXB pulsars: the surface dipolar
magnetic fields $B_*$ of HMXB neutron stars are segregated around five distinct values with $B_*
= 0.28\pm 0.08, 0.55\pm 0.11, 1.3\pm 0.37, 3.0\pm 0.68$, and $7.9\pm 3.1$, in units of TG. An explanation
of this phenomenon is currently lacking. We have found no correlation between these $B_*$ values
and the corresponding observed spin periods, spin period derivatives, orbital periods, maximum
X-ray luminosities, neutron star masses, or companion star masses.
