We make a comparison for twelve dark energy (DE) models by using current cosmological observations,
including type Ia supernova, baryon acoustic oscillations, and cosmic microwave background.
To perform a systematic and comprehensive analysis, we consider three statistics methods of SNIa,
including magnitude statistic (MS), flux statistic (FS), and improved flux statistic (IFS), as
well as two kinds of BAO data. In addition, Akaike information criteria (AIC) and Bayesian information
criteria (BIC) are used to assess the worth of each model. We find that: (1) The twelve models can be
divided into four grades by performing cosmology-fits. The cosmological constant model, which
is most favored by current observations, belongs to grade one; $\alpha$DE, constant $w$ and generalized
Chaplygin gas models belong to grade two; Chevalliear-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parametrization,
Wang parametrization, doubly coupled massive gravity, new generalized Chaplygin gas and holographic
DE models belong to grade three; Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati and Ricci DE models, which are excluded
by current observations, belong to grade four. (2) For parameter estimation, adopting IFS yields
the biggest $\Omega_m$ and the smallest $h$ for all the models. In contrast, using different BAO
data does not cause significant effect. (3) IFS has the strongest constraint ability on various
DE models. For examples, adopting IFS yields the smallest value of $\Delta$AIC for all the models;
in addition, making use of this technique yields the biggest figure of merit for CPL and Wang parametrizations.
