We present an analytical model to investigate the production of pebbles and their radial transport
through a protoplanetary disk (PPD) with magnetically driven winds. While most of the previous
analytical studies in this context assume that the radial turbulent coefficient is equal to the
vertical dust diffusion coefficient, in the light of the results of recent numerical simulations,
we relax this assumption by adopting effective parametrisations of the turbulent coefficients
involved in terms of the strength of the magnetic fields driving the wind. Theoretical studies have
already pointed out that even in the absence of winds, these coefficients are not necessarily equal,
though its consequences regarding pebble production have not been explored. In this paper, we investigate
the evolution of the pebble production line, the radial mass flux of the pebbles and their corresponding
surface density as a function of the plasma parameter at the disk midplane. Our analysis explicitly
demonstrates that the presence of magnetically-driven winds in a PPD leads to considerable reduction
of the rate and duration of the pebble delivery. We show that when the wind is strong, the core growth
in mass due to the pebble accretion is so slow that it is unlikely that a core could reach a pebble isolation
mass during a PPD lifetime. When the mass of a core reaches this critical value, pebble accretion
is halted due to core-driven perturbations in the gas. With decreasing wind strength, however,
pebble accretion may, in a shorter time, increase the mass of a core to the pebble isolation mass.
