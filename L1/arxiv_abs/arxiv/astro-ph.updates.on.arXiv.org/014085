We present a convenient, all-in-one framework for the scientific analysis of fully reduced, (integral-field)
spectroscopic data. The GIST pipeline (Galaxy IFU Spectroscopy Tool) is entirely written in Python3
and conducts all steps from the preparation of input data, over the scientific analysis to the production
of publication-quality plots. In its basic setup, it extracts stellar kinematics, performs an
emission-line analysis and derives stellar population properties from full spectral fitting
as well as via the measurement of absorption line-strength indices by exploiting the well-known
pPXF and GandALF routines, where the latter has now been implemented in Python. The pipeline is not
specific to any instrument or analysis technique and provides easy means of modification and further
development, as of its modular code architecture. An elaborate, Python-native parallelisation
is implemented and tested on various machines. The software further features a dedicated visualization
routine with a sophisticated graphical user interface. This allows an easy, fully-interactive
plotting of all measurements, spectra, fits, and residuals, as well as star formation histories
and the weight distribution of the models. The pipeline has successfully been applied to both low
and high-redshift data from MUSE, PPAK (CALIFA), and SINFONI, as well as to simulated data for HARMONI@ELT
and WEAVE and is currently being used by the TIMER, Fornax3D, and PHANGS collaborations. We demonstrate
its capabilities by applying it to MUSE TIMER observations of NGC 1433.
