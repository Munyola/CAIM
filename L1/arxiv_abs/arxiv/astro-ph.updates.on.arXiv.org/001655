The Robo-AO Kepler Planetary Candidate Survey is designed to observe every Kepler planet candidate
host star with laser adaptive optics imaging to search for blended nearby stars, which may be physically
associated companions and/or responsible for transit false positives. In this paper we present
the results from the 2012 observing season, searching for stars close to 715 representative Kepler
planet candidate hosts. We find 53 companions, 44 of which are new discoveries. We detail the Robo-AO
survey data reduction methods including a method of using the large ensemble of target observations
as mutual point-spread-function references, along with a new automated companion-detection
algorithm designed for large adaptive optics surveys. Our survey is sensitive to objects from 0.15"
to 2.5" separation, with contrast ratios up to delta-m~6. We measure an overall nearby-star-probability
for Kepler planet candidates of 7.4% +/- 1.0%, and calculate the effects of each detected nearby
star on the Kepler-measured planetary radius. We discuss several KOIs of particular interest,
including KOI-191 and KOI-1151, which are both multi-planet systems with detected stellar companions
whose unusual planetary system architecture might be best explained if they are ''coincident multiple''
systems, with several transiting planets shared between the two stars. Finally, we detect 2.6-sigma
evidence for <15d-period giant planets being 2-3 times more likely be found in wide stellar binaries
than smaller close-in planets and all sizes of further-out planets.
