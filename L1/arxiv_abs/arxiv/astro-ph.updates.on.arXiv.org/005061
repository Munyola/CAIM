The neutron stars in low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) are usually thought to be weakly magnetized
objects accreting matter from their low-mass companions in the form of a disk. Albeit weak as compared
to those in young neutron-star systems, the neutron-star magnetospheres in LMXBs can play an important
role in determining the correlations between spectral and temporal properties. Parallel tracks
appearing in the plane of kilohertz (kHz) quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) frequency versus X-ray
flux can be used as a tool to study the magnetosphere-disk interaction in neutron-star LMXBs. For
dynamically important weak fields, the formation of a non-Keplerian magnetic boundary layer at
the innermost disk truncated near the surface of the neutron star is highly likely. Such a boundary
region may harbor oscillatory modes of frequencies in the kHz range. We generate parallel tracks
using the boundary region model of kHz QPOs. We also present the direct application of our model to
the reproduction of the observed parallel tracks of individual sources such as 4U 1608--52, 4U 1636--53,
and Aql X-1. We reveal how the radial width of the boundary layer must vary in the long-term flux evolution
of each source to regenerate the parallel tracks. The run of the radial width looks similar for different
sources and can be fitted by a generic model function describing the average steady behavior of the
boundary region in the long term. The parallel tracks then correspond to the possible quasi-steady
states the source can occupy around the average trend.
