We describe our nonlinear emulation (i.e., interpolation) framework that combines the halo occupation
distribution (HOD) galaxy bias model with $N$-body simulations of nonlinear structure formation,
designed to accurately predict the projected clustering and galaxy-galaxy lensing signals from
luminous red galaxies (LRGs) in the redshift range $0.16 < z < 0.36$ on comoving scales $0.6 < r_p <
30$ $h^{-1}$ Mpc. The interpolation accuracy is $\lesssim 1-2$ per cent across the entire physically
plausible range of parameters for all scales considered. We correctly recover the true value of
the cosmological parameter $S_8 = (\frac{\sigma_8}{0.8228}) (\frac{\Omega_{\text{m}}}{0.3107})^{0.6}$
from mock measurements produced via subhalo abundance matching (SHAM)-based lightcones designed
to approximately match the properties of the SDSS LOWZ galaxy sample. Applying our model to the Baryon
Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) Data Release 14 (DR14) LOWZ galaxy clustering and the
galaxy-shear cross-correlation measurements of Singh et al. (2018), made with Sloan Digital Sky
Survey (SDSS) Data Release 8 (DR8) imaging, we perform a prototype cosmological analysis marginalizing
over $w$CDM cosmological parameters and galaxy HOD parameters. We obtain a 4.4 per cent measurement
of $S_8 = 0.847 \pm 0.037$, in $3.5\sigma$ tension with the Planck cosmological results of $1.00
\pm 0.02$. We discuss the possibility of underestimated systematic uncertainties or astrophysical
effects that could explain this discrepancy.
