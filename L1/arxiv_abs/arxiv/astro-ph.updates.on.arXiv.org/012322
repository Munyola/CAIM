The precise knowledge of the positions of space debris objects and in particular of defunct satellites
is fundamental for satellite operations. Several studies showed that it is possible to improve
the accuracy of the orbit determination results by fusing different types of observables, i.e.
classical astrometric positions and range measurements. Particularly promising in the space
debris field are the ranges provided by a satellite laser ranging system. The factors that limit
the applicability of the satellite laser ranging (SLR) techniques are the altitude of the target,
the accuracy of the predicted ephemeris of the target, the energy of the laser pulse, and the laser
field of view. In this paper we will show a way to overcome the mentioned challenges by using a night-tracking
camera for the real time correction of the pointing of the SLR system (active tracking), and for the
simultaneous acquisition of measurements used to improve the orbits and to study the attitude of
the target. After presenting the basic functionalities, the performance of the night-tracking
camera, and the procedure to acquire the measurements, we will also show the potential of this tool
to allow improving orbits in real-time. This study is carried out for defunct or recently decommissioned
satellites. Only real angular/laser measurements provided by the sensors of the Swiss Optical
Ground Station and Geodynamics Observatory Zimmerwald (SwissOGS) owned by the Astronomical Institute
of the University of Bern (AIUB) are used.
