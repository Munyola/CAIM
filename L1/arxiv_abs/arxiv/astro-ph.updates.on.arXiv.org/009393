SBS0335-052E, one of the most metal-poor (Z ~ 3-4% Z$_{\odot}$) HeII-emitter starbursts known
in the nearby universe, is studied using optical VLT/MUSE spectroscopic and Chandra X-ray observations.
We spatially resolved the spectral map of the nebular HeII$\lambda$4686 emission from which we
derived for the first time the total HeII-ionizing energy budget of SBS0335-052E. The nebular HeII
line is indicative of a quite hard ionizing spectrum with photon energies > 4 Ryd, and is observed
to be more common at high-z than locally. Our study rules out a significant contribution from X-ray
sources and shocks to the HeII photoionization budget, indicating that the He$^{+}$ excitation
is mainly due to hot stellar continua. We discovered a new WR knot, but we also discard single WR stars
as the main responsible for the HeII ionization. By comparing observations with current models,
we found that the HeII-ionization budget of SBS0335-052E can only be produced by either single,
rotating metal-free stars or a binary population with Z ~ 10$^{-5}$ and a 'top-heavy' IMF. This discrepancy
between the metallicity of such stars and that of the HII regions in SBS0335-052E is similar to results
obtained by Kehrig et al. (2015) for the very metal-deficient HeII-emitting galaxy IZw18. These
results suggest that the HeII ionization is still beyond the capabilities of state-of-the-art
models. Extremely metal-poor, high-ionizing starbursts in the local universe, like SBS0335-052E,
provide unique laboratories for exploring in detail the extreme conditions likely prevailing
in the reionization era.
