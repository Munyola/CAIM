The emission line ratios [OIII]5007/H-beta and [NII]6584/H-alpha have been adopted as an empirical
way to distinguish between the fundamentally different mechanisms of ionization in emission-line
galaxies. However, detailed interpretation of these diagnostics requires calculations of the
internal structure of the emitting HII regions, and these calculations depend on the assumptions
one makes about the relative importance of radiation pressure and stellar winds. In this paper we
construct a grid of quasi-static HII region models to explore how choices about these parameters
alter HII regions' emission line ratios. We find that, when radiation pressure is included in our
models, HII regions reach a saturation point beyond which further increases in the luminosity of
the driving stars does not produce any further increase in effective ionization parameter, and
thus does not yield any further alteration in an HII region's line ratio. We also show that, if stellar
winds are assumed to be strong, the maximum possible ionization parameter is quite low. As a result
of this effect, it is inconsistent to simultaneously assume that HII regions are wind-blown bubbles
and that they have high ionization parameters; some popular HII region models suffer from this inconsistency.
Our work in this paper provides a foundation for a companion paper in which we embed the model grids
we compute here within a population synthesis code that enables us to compute the integrated line
emission from galactic populations of HII regions.
