NebulaBayes is a new Bayesian code that implements a general method of comparing observed emission-line
fluxes to photoionization model grids. The code enables us to extract robust, spatially resolved
measurements of abundances in the extended narrow line regions (ENLRs) produced by Active Galactic
Nuclei (AGN). We observe near-constant ionization parameters but steeply radially-declining
pressures, which together imply that radiation pressure regulates the ENLR density structure
on large scales. Our sample includes four `pure Seyfert' galaxies from the S7 survey that have extensive
ENLRs. NGC2992 shows steep metallicity gradients from the nucleus into the ionization cones. An
{\it inverse} metallicity gradient is observed in ESO138-G01, which we attribute to a recent gas
inflow or minor merger. A uniformly high metallicity and hard ionizing continuum are inferred across
the ENLR of Mrk573. Our analysis of IC5063 is likely affected by contamination from shock excitation,
which appears to soften the inferred ionizing spectrum. The peak of the ionizing continuum E_peak
is determined by the nuclear spectrum and the absorbing column between the nucleus and the ionized
nebula. We cannot separate variation in this intrinsic E_peak from the effects of shock or HII region
contamination, but E_peak measurements nevertheless give insights into ENLR excitation. We demonstrate
the general applicability of NebulaBayes by analyzing a nuclear spectrum from the non-active galaxy
NGC4691 using a HII region grid. The NLR and HII region model grids are provided with NebulaBayes
for use by the astronomical community.
