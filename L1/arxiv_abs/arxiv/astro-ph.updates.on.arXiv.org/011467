Located at Dome A, the highest point of the Antarctic plateau, the Chinese Kunlun station is considered
to be one of the best ground-based photometric sites because of its extremely cold, dry, and stable
atmosphere(Saunders et al. 2009). A target can be monitored from there for over 40 days without diurnal
interruption during a polar winter. This makes Kunlun station a perfect site to search for short-period
transiting exoplanets. Since 2008, an observatory has been built at Kunlun station and three telescopes
are working there. Using these telescopes, the AST3 project has been carried out over the last six
years with a search for transiting exoplanets as one of its key programs (CHESPA). In the austral
winters of 2016 and 2017, a set of target fields in the Southern CVZ of TESS (Ricker et al. 2009) were
monitored by the AST3-II telescope. In this paper, we introduce the CHESPA and present the first
data release containing photometry of 26,578 bright stars (m_i < 15). The best photometric precision
at the optimum magnitude for the survey is around 2 mmag. To demonstrate the data quality, we also
present a catalog of 221 variables with a brightness variation greater than 5 mmag from the 2016 data.
Among these variables, 179 are newly identified periodic variables not listed in the AAVSO databasea),
and 67 are listed in the Candidate Target List(Stassun et al. 2017). These variables will require
careful attention to avoid false-positive signals when searching for transiting exoplanets.
Dozens of new transiting exoplanet candidates will be also released in a subsequent paper(Zhang
et al. 2018b).
