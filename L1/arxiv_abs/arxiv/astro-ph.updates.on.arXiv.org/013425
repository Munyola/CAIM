In this paper we present new optical observations of NGC 185 galaxy that are intended to reveal the
status of supernova remnants (SNRs) in this dwarf elliptical companion of Andromeda galaxy. Previously,
it was reported that this galaxy hosts one SNR. Our deep photometric study with the 2-m telescope
at Rozhen National Astronomical Observatory using narrow-band H$\alpha$ and [SII] filters has
revealed complex structure of the interstellar medium in the center of the galaxy. In fact, these
new observations imply the presence of more than one SNR. To confirm the classification of the SNR
candidates and to study the kinematics of the detected nebulae, we carried out spectroscopic observations
using the SCORPIO multi-mode spectrograph at the 6-m telescope at Special Astrophysical Observatory
of the Russian Academy of Science, both in low and high resolution modes. We also searched the archival
X-ray and radio data for counterparts to the candidate SNRs identified by our optical observations.
Our observation detected enhanced [SII]/H$\alpha$ and [SII]/H$\alpha$ line ratios, as well as
relatively high expansion velocities of the observed nebulae, motivating the classification
of these sources as SNRs. We have found that NGC 185 hosts at least two optical SNRs confirmed with
both photometric and spectral observations, and possible one HII region. Archival XMM-Newton
observations indicate the presence of an extended source in projection of one of optical SNRs, whereas
the archival VLA radio image shows weak, unresolved emission in the center of NGC 185.
