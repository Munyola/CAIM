We observed Brackett $\alpha$ 4.05$\mu$m emission towards the supernebula in NGC 5253 with NIRSPEC
on Keck II in adaptive optics mode, NIRSPAO, to probe feedback from its exciting embedded super star
cluster (SSC). NIRSPEC's Slit-Viewing Camera was simultaneously used to image the K-band continuum
at $\sim$$0.1''$ resolution. We register the IR continuum with HST imaging, and find that the visible
clusters are offset from the K-band peak, which coincides with the Br $\alpha$ peak of the supernebula
and its associated molecular cloud. The spectra of the supernebula exhibit Br $\alpha$ emission
with a strong, narrow core. The linewidths are 65-76 km s$^{-1}$, FWHM, comparable to those around
individual ultra-compact HII regions within our Galaxy. A weak, broad (FWHM$\simeq$150-175 km
s$^{-1}$) component is detected on the base of the line, which could trace a population of sources
with high-velocity winds. The core velocity of Br $\alpha$ emission shifts by +13 km s$^{-1}$ from
NE to SW across the supernebula, possibly indicating a bipolar outflow from an embedded object,
or linked to a foreground redshifted gas filament. The results can be explained if the supernebula
comprises thousands of ionized wind regions around individual massive stars, stalled in their
expansion due to critical radiative cooling and unable to merge to drive a coherent cluster wind.
Based on the absence of an outflow with large mass loss, we conclude that feedback is currently ineffective
at dispersing gas, and the SSC retains enriched material out of which it may continue to form stars.
