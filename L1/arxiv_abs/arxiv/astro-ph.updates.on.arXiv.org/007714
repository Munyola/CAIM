The light curves of Type IIn supernovae are dominated by the radiative energy released through the
interaction of the supernova shockwaves with their dense circumstellar medium (CSM). The ultraluminous
Type IIn supernova SN 2010jl exhibits an infrared emission component that is in excess of the extrapolated
UV-optical spectrum as early as a few weeks post-explosion. This emission has been attributed by
some as evidence for rapid formation of dust in the cooling postshock CSM. We investigate the physical
processes that may inhibit or facilitate the formation of dust in the CSM. When only radiative cooling
is considered, the temperature of the dense shocked gas rapidly drops below the dust condensation
temperature. However, by accounting for the heating of the postshock gas by the downstream radiation
from the shock, we show that dust formation is inhibited until the radiation from the shock weakens,
as the shock propagates into the less dense outer regions of the CSM. In SN 2010jl dust formation can
therefore only commence after day 380. Only the IR emission since that epoch can be attributed to
the newly formed CSM dust. Observations on day 460 and later show that the IR luminosity exceeds the
UV-optical luminosity. The post-shock dust cannot extinct the radiation emitted by the expanding
SN shock. Therefore, its IR emission must be powered by an interior source, which we identify with
the reverse shock propagating through the SN ejecta. IR emission before day 380 must therefore be
an IR echo from preexisting CSM dust.
