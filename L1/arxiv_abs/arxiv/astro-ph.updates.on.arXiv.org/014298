We present the discovery of TYC9191-519-1b (TOI-150b, TIC 271893367) and HD271181b (TOI-163b,
TIC 179317684), two hot Jupiters initially detected using 30-minute cadence Transiting Exoplanet
Survey Satellite TESS photometry from Sector 1 and thoroughly characterized through follow-up
photometry (CHAT, Hazelwood, LCO/CTIO, El Sauce, TRAPPIST-S), high-resolution spectroscopy
(FEROS, CORALIE) and speckle imaging (Gemini/DSSI), confirming the planetary nature of the two
signals. A simultaneous joint fit of photometry and radial velocity using a new fitting package
juliet reveals that TOI-150b is a $1.254\pm0.016\ R_J$, massive ($2.61^{+0.19}_{-0.12}\ M_J$)
hot Jupiter in a $5.857$-day orbit, while TOI-163b is an inflated ($R_P$ = $1.478^{+0.022}_{-0.029}
R_J$, $M_P$ = $1.219\pm0.11 M_J$) hot Jupiter on a $P$ = $4.231$-day orbit; both planets orbit F-type
stars. A particularly interesting result is that TOI-150b shows an eccentric orbit ($e=0.262^{+0.045}_{-0.037}$),
which is quite uncommon among hot Jupiters. We estimate that this is consistent, however, with the
circularization timescale which is slightly larger than the age of the system. These two hot Jupiters
are both prime candidates for further characterization --- in particular, both are excellent candidates
for determining spin-orbit alignments via the Rossiter-McLaughlin (RM) effect and for characterizing
atmospheric thermal structures using secondary eclipse observations considering they are both
located closely to the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) Continuous Viewing Zone (CVZ).
