A plateau phase in the X-ray afterglow is observed in a significant fraction of gamma-ray bursts
(GRBs). Previously, it has been found that there exists a correlation among three key parameters
concerning the plateau phase, i.e., the end time of the plateau phase in the GRB rest frame ($T_{a}$),
the corresponding X-ray luminosity at the end time ($L_{X}$) and the isotropic energy of the prompt
GRB ($E_{\gamma,\rm{iso}}$). In this study, we systematically search through all the \emph{Swift}
GRBs with a plateau phase that occurred between 2005 May and 2018 August. We collect 174 GRBs, with
redshifts available for all of them. For the whole sample, the correlation between $L_{X}$, $T_{a}$
and $E_{\gamma,\rm{iso}}$ is confirmed, with the best fit relation being $L_{X}\propto T_{a}^{-0.92}E_{\gamma,\rm{iso}}^{0.83}$.
Such an updated three-parameter correlation still supports that the central leftover after GRBs
is probably a millisecond magnetar. It is interesting to note that short GRBs with duration less
than 2 s in our sample also follow the same correlation, which hints that the merger production of
two neutron stars could be a high mass magnetar, but not necessarily a black hole. Moreover, GRBs
having an ``internal'' plateau (i.e., with a following decay index being generally smaller than
-3) also obey this correlation. It further strengthens the idea that the internal plateau is due
to the delayed collapse of a high mass neutron star into a black hole. The updated three-parameter
correlation indicates that GRBs with a plateau phase may act as a standard candle for cosmology study.
