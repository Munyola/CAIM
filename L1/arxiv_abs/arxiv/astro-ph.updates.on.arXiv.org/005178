Massive black hole (MBH) binaries, formed as a result of galaxy mergers, are expected to harden by
dynamical friction and three body stellar scatterings, until emission of gravitational waves
(GWs) leads to their final coalescence. According to recent simulations, MBH binaries can efficiently
harden via stellar encounters only when the host geometry is triaxial, even if only modestly, as
angular momentum diffusion allows an efficient repopulation of the binary loss cone. In this paper,
we carry out a suite of N-body simulations of equal-mass galaxy collisions, varying the initial
orbits and density profiles for the merging galaxies and running simulations both with and without
central MBHs. We find that the presence of a MBH binary in the remnant makes the system maximally triaxial
within the binary sphere of influence and nearly oblate, aligned with the galaxy merger plane, within
a radius enclosing 100 MBH masses. We never find binary hosts to be prolate on any scale. The decaying
MBHs slightly enhance the tangential anisotropy in the centre of the remnant due to angular momentum
injection and the slingshot ejection of stars on nearly radial orbits. This latter effect results
in about 1% of the remnant stars being expelled from the galactic nucleus. Finally, we do not find
any strong connection between the remnant morphology and the binary hardening rate, which depends
only on the inner density slope of the remnant galaxy. Our results suggest that MBH binaries are able
to coalesce within a few Gyr, even if their host systems retain an axisymmetric shape beyond the binary
sphere of influence.
