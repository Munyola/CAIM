The relative magnetic helicity is a quantity that is often used to describe the level of entanglement
of non-isolated magnetic fields, such as the magnetic field of solar active regions.The aim of this
paper is to investigate how different kinds of photospheric boundary flows accumulate relative
magnetic helicity in the corona and if and how-well magnetic helicity related quantities identify
the onset of an eruption. We use a series of three-dimensional, parametric magnetohydrodynamic
simulations of the formation and eruption of magnetic flux ropes. All the simulations are performed
on the same grid, using the same parameters, but they are characterized by different driving photospheric
flows, i.e., shearing, convergence, stretching, peripheral- and central- dispersion flows.
For each of the simulations, the instant of the onset of the eruption is carefully identified by using
a series of relaxation runs. We find that magnetic energy and total relative helicity are mostly
injected when shearing flows are applied at the boundary, while the magnetic energy and helicity
associated with the coronal electric currents increase regardless of the kind of photospheric
flows. We also find that, at the onset of the eruptions, the ratio between the non-potential magnetic
helicity and the total relative magnetic helicity has the same value for all the simulations, suggesting
the existence of a threshold in this quantity. Such threshold is not observed for other quantities
as, for example, those related to the magnetic energy.
