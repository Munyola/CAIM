Only star clusters that are sufficiently compact and massive survive largely unharmed beyond 10
Myr. However, their compactness means a high stellar density which can lead to strong gravitational
interactions between the stars. As young stars are often initially surrounded by protoplanetary
disks and later on potentially by planetary systems, the question arises to what degree these strong
gravitational interactions influence planet formation and the properties of planetary systems.
Here, we perform simulations of the evolution of compact high-mass clusters like Trumpler 14 and
Westerlund 2 from the embedded to the gas-free phase and study the influence of stellar interactions.
We concentrate on the development of the mean disk size in these environments. Our simulations show
that in high-mass open clusters $80-90\%$ of all disks/planetary systems should be smaller than
50 AU just due to the strong stellar interactions in these environments. Already in the initial phases,
3-4 close fly-bys lead to typical disk sizes within the range of 18-27 AU. Afterwards, the disk sizes
are altered only to a small extent. Our findings agree with the recent observation that the disk sizes
in the once dense environment of the Upper Scorpio OB association, NGC~2362, and h/$\chi$Persei
are at least three times smaller in size than, for example, in Taurus. We conclude that the observed
planetary systems in high-mass open clusters should also be on average smaller than those found
around field stars; in particular, planets on wide orbits are expected to be extremely rare in such
environments.
