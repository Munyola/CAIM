Almost every helium atom in the Universe was created just a few minutes after the Big Bang through
a process commonly referred to as Big Bang Nucleosynthesis. The amount of helium that was made during
Big Bang Nucleosynthesis is determined by the combination of particle physics and cosmology. The
current leading measures of the primordial helium abundance (Y_P) are based on the relative strengths
of H I and He I emission lines emanating from star-forming regions in local metal-poor galaxies.
As the statistical errors on these measurements improve, it is essential to test for systematics
by developing independent techniques. Here we report the first determination of the primordial
helium abundance based on a near-pristine intergalactic gas cloud that is seen in absorption against
the light of a background quasar. This gas cloud, observed when the Universe was just one-third of
its present age (z_abs = 1.724), has a metal content ~100 times less than the Sun, and ~30 per cent less
metals than the most metal-poor H II region currently known where a determination of the primordial
helium abundance is afforded. We conclude that the helium abundance of this intergalactic gas cloud
is Y = 0.250^{+0.033}_{-0.025}, which agrees with the Standard Model primordial value, Y_P = 0.24672
+/- 0.00017. Our determination of the primordial helium abundance is not yet as precise as that derived
using metal-poor galaxies, but our method has the potential to offer a competitive test of physics
beyond the Standard Model during Big Bang Nucleosynthesis.
