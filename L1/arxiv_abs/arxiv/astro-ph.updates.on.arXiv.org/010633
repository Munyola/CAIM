The origin and nature of the ultrahigh energy cosmic rays remains a mystery. However, considerable
progress has been achieved in past years due to observations performed by the Pierre Auger Observatory
and Telescope Array. Above $10^{18}$ eV the observed energy spectrum presents two features: a hardening
of the slope at $\sim 10^{18.6}$ eV, which is known as the ankle, and a suppression at $\sim 10^{19.6}$
eV. The composition inferred from the experimental data, interpreted by using the current high
energy hadronic interaction models, seems to be light below the ankle, showing a trend to heavier
nuclei for increasing values of the primary energy. Also, the anisotropy information is consistent
with an extragalactic origin of this light component that would dominate the spectrum below the
ankle. Therefore, the models that explain the ankle as the transition from the galactic and extragalactic
components are disfavored by present data. Recently, it has been proposed that this light component
originates from the photodisintegration of more energetic and heavier nuclei in the source environment.
The formation of the ankle can also be explained by this mechanism. In this work we study in detail
this general scenario but in the context of the central region of active galaxies. In this case, the
cosmic rays are accelerated near the supermassive black hole present in the central region of these
types of galaxies, and the photodisintegration of heavy nuclei takes place in the radiation field
that surrounds the supermassive black hole.
