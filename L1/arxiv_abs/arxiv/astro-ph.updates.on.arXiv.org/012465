Recent photometric results have identified a new population among globular cluster stars. This
population, referred to as the ``extended P1'', has been suggested to be the manifestation of a new
abundance pattern where the initial mass fraction of He changes among cluster stars that share the
same CNO values. The current paradigm for the formation of the multiple stellar populations in globular
clusters assumes that variations in He are the product of chemical ``enrichment'' by the ashes of
the CNO-cycle (which changes He and other elements like C, N and O simultaneously). We obtained MIKE@Magellan
spectra of six giant stars in NGC 2808, a cluster with one of the strongest examples of the extended
P1 population. We provide the first complete characterization of the light elements abundances
for the stars along a significant range of the extended P1 photometric group. The stars from our sample
appear to be homogeneous in C, N, O, Na, Mg and Al. The lack of a significant change in these products
of the CNO-cycle, suggest that unlike the rest of the populations identified to date, the photometric
changes responsible for the extended P1 feature are a consequence of an alternative mechanism.
Our measurements, are consistent with the interpretations where the changes of the He mass fraction
among these stars could be consequence of p-p chain nucleosynthesis (which could increase the He
in stars without affecting heavier elements). Having said that, direct measurements of He are necessary
to conclude if variations of this element are present among extended P1 stars.
