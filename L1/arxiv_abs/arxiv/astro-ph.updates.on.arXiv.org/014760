The detection of gravitational waves has offered us the opportunity to explore the dynamical and
strong-field regime of gravity. Because matched filtering is more sensitive to variations in the
gravitational waveform phase than the amplitude, many tests of gravity with gravitational waves
have been carried out using only the former. Such studies cannot probe the non-Einsteinian effects
that may enter only in the amplitude. Besides, if not accommodated in the waveform template, a non-Einsteinian
effect in the amplitude may induce systematic errors on other parameters such as the luminosity
distance. In this paper, we derive constraints on a few modified theories of gravity (Einstein-dilaton-Gauss-Bonnet
gravity, scalar-tensor theories, and varying-$G$ theories), incorporating both phase and amplitude
corrections. We follow the model-independent approach of the parametrized post-Einsteinian
formalism. We perform Fisher analyses with Monte-Carlo simulations using the LIGO/Virgo posterior
samples. We find that the contributions from amplitude corrections can be comparable to the ones
from the phase corrections in case of massive binaries like GW150914. Also, constraints derived
by incorporating both phase and amplitude corrections differ from the ones with phase corrections
only by 4\% at most, which supports many of the previous studies that only considered corrections
in the phase. We further derive reliable constraints on the time-evolution of a scalar field in a
scalar-tensor theory for the first time with gravitational waves.
