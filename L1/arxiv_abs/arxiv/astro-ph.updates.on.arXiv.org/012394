We present stellar wind modelling of the hot Jupiter host HD189733, and predict radio emission from
the stellar wind and the planet, the latter arising from the interaction of the stellar wind with
the planetary magnetosphere. Our stellar wind models incorporate surface stellar magnetic field
maps at the epochs Jun/Jul 2013, Sep 2014, and Jul 2015 as boundary conditions. We find that the mass-loss
rate, angular momentum-loss rate, and open magnetic flux of HD189733 vary by 9%, 40%, and 19% over
these three epochs. Solving the equations of radiative transfer, we find that from 10 MHz-100 GHz
the stellar wind emits fluxes in the range of $10^{-3}$-$5$ $\mu$Jy, and becomes optically thin
above 10 GHz. Our planetary radio emission model uses the radiometric Bode's law, and neglects the
presence of a planetary atmosphere. For assumed planetary magnetic fields of 1-10 G, we estimate
that the planet emits at frequencies of 2-25 MHz, with peak flux densities of $\sim10^2$ mJy. We find
that the planet orbits through regions of the stellar wind that are optically thick to the emitted
frequency from the planet. As a result, unattenuated planetary radio emission can only propagate
out of the system and reach the observer for 67% of the orbit for a 10 G planetary field, corresponding
to when the planet is approaching and leaving primary transit. We also find that the plasma frequency
of the stellar wind is too high to allow propagation of the planetary radio emission below 21 MHz.
This means a planetary field of at least 8 G is required to produce detectable radio emission.
