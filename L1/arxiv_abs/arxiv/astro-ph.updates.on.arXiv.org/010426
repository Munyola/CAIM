We present a detailed analysis of the absorption properties of one of the tidal gas streams around
the Whale galaxy NGC4631 in the direction of the quasar 2MASSJ12421031+3214268. Our study is based
on ultraviolet spectral data obtained with the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS) onboard the Hubble
Space Telescope (HST) and 21cm-data from the HALOGAS project and the Green Bank Telescope (GBT).
We detect strong HI Ly alpha absorption in the velocity range +550 to +800 km s^-1 related to gas from
a NGC4631 tidal stream known as Spur 2. We measure a column density of log N(HI)=18.68pm0.15, indicating
that the quasar sightline traces the outer boundary of Spur 2 as seen in the 21cm data. Metal absorption
in Spur 2 is detected in the lines of OI, CII, SiII, and SiIII in a complex absorption pattern that reflects
the multi-phase nature of the gas. We find that the average neutral gas fraction in Spur 2 towards
2MASSJ12421031+3214268 is only 14 percent. This implies that ionized gas dominates the total mass
of Spur 2, which then may comprise more than 10^9 M_sun. No significant depletion of Si is observed,
showing that Spur 2 does not contain significant amounts of dust. From the measured OI/HI column-density
ratio we determine an alpha abundance in Spur 2 of 0.13pm0.07 solar ([alpha/H]=-0.90pm 0.16), which
is substantially lower than what is observed in the NGC4631 disk. The low metallicity and low dust
content suggest that Spur 2 represents metal-deficient gas stripped off a gas-rich satellite galaxy
during a recent encounter with NGC4631.
