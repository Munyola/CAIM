I consider a Jovian planet on a highly eccentric orbit around its host star, a situation produced
by secular interactions with its planetary or stellar companions. The tidal interactions at every
periastron passage exchange energy between the orbit and the planet's degree-2 fundamental-mode.
Starting from zero energy, the f-mode can diffusively grow to large amplitudes if its one-kick energy
gain > 10^-5 of the orbital energy. This requires a pericentre distance of < 4 tidal radii (or 1.6 Roche
radii). If the f-mode has a non-negligible initial energy, diffusive evolution can occur at a lower
threshold. The first effect can stall the secular migration as the f-mode can absorb orbital energy
and decouple the planet from its secular perturbers, parking all migrating jupiters safely outside
the zone of tidal disruption. The second effect leads to rapid orbit circularization as it allows
an excited f-mode to continuously absorb orbital energy as the orbit eccentricity decreases. So
without any explicit dissipation, other than the fact that the f-mode will damp nonlinearly when
its amplitude reaches unity, the planet can be transported from a few AU to ~ 0.2 AU in ~ 10^4 yrs. Such
a rapid circularization is equivalent to a dissipation factor Q ~ 1, and it explains the observed
deficit of super-eccentric Jovian planets. Lastly, the repeated f-mode breaking likely deposit
energy and angular momentum in the outer envelope, and avoid thermally ablating the planet. Overall,
this work boosts the case for forming hot Jupiters through high-eccentricity secular migration.
