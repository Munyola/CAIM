By comparing the dynamical and lensing masses of early-type lens galaxies, one can constrain both
the cosmological parameters and the density profiles of galaxies. We explore the constraining
power on cosmological parameters and the effect of the lens mass model in this method with 161 galaxy-scale
strong lensing systems, which is currently the largest sample with both high resolution imaging
and stellar dynamical data. We assume a power-law mass model for the lenses, and consider three different
parameterizations for $\gamma$ (i.e., the slope of the total mass density profile) to include the
effect of the dependence of $\gamma$ on redshift and surface mass density. When treating $\delta$
(i.e., the slope of the luminosity density profile) as a universal parameter for all lens galaxies,
we find the limits on the cosmological parameter $\Omega_m$ are quite weak and biased, and also heavily
dependent on the lens mass model in the scenarios of parameterizing $\gamma$ with three different
forms. When treating $\delta$ as an observable for each lens, the unbiased estimate of $\Omega_m$
can be obtained only in the scenario of including the dependence of $\gamma$ on both the redshift
and the surface mass density, that is $\Omega_m = 0.381^{+0.185}_{-0.154}$ at 68\% confidence
level in the framework of a flat $\Lambda$CDM model. We conclude that the significant dependencies
of $\gamma$ on both the redshift and the surface mass density, as well as the intrinsic scatter of
$\delta$ among the lenses, need to be properly taken into account in this method.
