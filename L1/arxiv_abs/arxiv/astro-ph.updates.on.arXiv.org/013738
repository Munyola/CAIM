Characteristic signatures that X-ray reverberation from an extended corona can manifest in the
observed PSD of AGN are investigated. The presence of two X-ray blobs illuminating an accretion
disc can cause the interference between two reprocessing-echo components and produce distinct
physical features in the PSD. The oscillatory structures (e.g., dips and humps) are seen but, contrarily
to the lamp-post case, the strongest dip is not always the one at the lowest frequency. Instead, we
find the frequency where the strongest dip is seen associates to the lower-source height while the
lowest frequency where the first dip appears links with the upper-source height. This is because
the reverberation timescales increase with the source height. Accurate modelling of the PSD then
helps put constraints to the lower and upper limit of the corona extent. Furthermore, the reverberation
signatures are less pronounced with increasing number of sources that do not produce reflection
(e.g., additional X-rays from fast, relativistic outflows). The amplitude of the oscillations
also depends on the amount of dilution contributed by the X-ray sources, thus encodes information
about their relative brightness. Due to stronger dilutions, robust detection of these signatures
with the current observations will become even more difficult if the corona is extended. Future
observations made by Athena will enable us to fit these characteristics in statistically significant
details, and to reveal the nature of the disc-corona system.
