Context. Recent observations of the massive young stellar object S255 NIRS 3 have revealed a large
increase in both methanol maser flux density and IR emission, which have been interpreted as the
result of an accretion outburst, possibly due to instabilities in a circumstellar disk. This indicates
that this type of accretion event could be common in young/forming early-type stars and in their
lower mass siblings, and supports the idea that accretion onto the star may occur in a non-continuous
way. Aims. As accretion and ejection are believed to be tightly associated phenomena, we wanted
to confirm the accretion interpretation of the outburst in S255 NIRS 3 by detecting the corresponding
burst of the associated thermal jet. Methods. We monitored the radio continuum emission from S255
NIRS 3 at four bands using the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array. The millimetre continuum emission
was also observed with both the Northern Extended Millimeter Array of IRAM and the Atacama Large
Millimeter/submillimeter Array. Results. We have detected an exponential increase in the radio
flux density from 6 to 45 GHz starting right after July 10, 2016, namely about 13 months after the estimated
onset of the IR outburst. This is the first ever detection of a radio burst associated with an IR accretion
outburst from a young stellar object. The flux density at all observed centimetre bands can be reproduced
with a simple expanding jet model. At millimetre wavelengths we infer a marginal flux increase with
respect to the literature values and we show this is due to free-free emission from the radio jet.
