Non-radial modes are excited in classical pulsators, both in Cepheids and in RR Lyrae stars. Firm
evidence come from the first overtone pulsators, in which additional shorter period mode is detected
with characteristic period ratio falling in between 0.60 and 0.65. In the case of first overtone
Cepheids three separate sequences populated by nearly 200 stars are formed in the Petersen diagram,
i.e. the diagram of period ratio versus longer period. In the case of first overtone RR Lyrae stars
(RRc stars) situation is less clear. A dozen or so such stars are known which form a clump in the Petersen
diagram without any obvious structure. Interestingly, all first overtone RR Lyrae stars for which
precise space-borne photometry is available show the additional mode, which suggests that its
excitation is common. Motivated by these results we searched for non-radial modes in the OGLE-III
photometry of RRc stars from the Galactic bulge. We report the discovery of 147 stars, members of
a new group of double-mode, radial-non-radial mode pulsators. They form a clear and tight sequence
in the Petersen diagram, with period ratios clustering around 0.613 with a signature of possible
second sequence with higher period ratio (0.631). The scatter in period ratios of the already known
stars is explained as due to population effects. Judging from the results of space observations
this still mysterious form of pulsation must be common among RRc stars and with our analysis of the
OGLE data we just touch the tip of the iceberg.
