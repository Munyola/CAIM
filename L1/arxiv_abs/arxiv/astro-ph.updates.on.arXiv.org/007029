We analyze an axisymmetric magnetohydrodynamics configuration, describing the morphology of
a purely differentially rotating thin plasma disk, in which linear and non-linear perturbations
are triggered associated with microscopic magnetic structures. We study the evolution of the non-stationary
correction in the limit in which the co-rotation condition (i.e., the dependence of the disk angular
velocity on the magnetic flux function) is preserved and the poloidal velocity components are neglected.
The main feature we address here is the influence of ideal (finite electron inertia) and collisional
(resistivity, viscosity, and thermal conductivity) effects on the behavior of the flux function
perturbation and of the associated small-scale modifications in the disk. We analyze two different
regimes in which resistivity or viscosity dominates and study the corresponding linear and non-linear
behaviors of the perturbation evolution, i.e., when the backreaction magnetic field is negligible
or comparable to the background one, respectively. We demonstrate that when resistivity dominates,
a radial oscillating morphology (crystalline structure) emerges and it turns out to be damped in
time, in both the linear and non-linear regimes, but in such a way that the resulting transient can
be implemented in the description of relevant astrophysical processes, for instance, associated
with jet formation or cataclysmic variables. When the viscosity effect dominates the dynamics,
only the non-linear regime is available and a very fast instability is triggered.
