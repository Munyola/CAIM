We report new Atacama Large Millimeter/sub-millimeter Array (ALMA) Band 3 observations at 2.75
mm of the TD around SR 24S with an angular resolution of $\sim$0.11''$\times$ 0.09'' and a peak signal-to-noise
ratio of $\sim24$. We detect an inner disk and a mostly symmetric ring-like structure that peaks
at $\sim$0.32'', that is $\sim$37 au at a distance of $\sim$114.4 pc. The full width at half maximum
of this ring is $\sim$28 au. We analyze the observed structures by fitting the dust continuum visibilities
using different models for the intensity profile, and compare with previous ALMA observations
of the same disk at 0.45 mm and 1.30 mm. We qualitatively compare the results of these fits with theoretical
predictions of different scenarios for the formation of a cavity or large gap. The comparison of
the dust continuum structure between different ALMA bands indicates that photoevaporation and
dead zone can be excluded as leading mechanisms for the cavity formation in SR 24S disk, leaving the
planet scenario (single or multiple planets) as the most plausible mechanism. We compared the 2.75
mm emission with published (sub-)centimeter data and find that the inner disk is likely tracing
dust thermal emission. This implies that any companion in the system should allow dust to move inwards
throughout the gap and replenish the inner disk. In the case of one single planet, this puts strong
constraints on the mass of the potential planet inside the cavity and the disk viscosity of about
$\lesssim$5 $M_{\rm{Jup}}$ and $\alpha\sim10^{-4}-10^{-3}$, respectively.
