We present the characterization of 5 new short-period low-mass eclipsing binaries from the WFCAM
Transit Survey. The analysis was performed by using the photometric WFCAM J-mag data and additional
low- and intermediate-resolution spectroscopic data to obtain both orbital and physical properties
of the studied sample. The light curves and the measured radial velocity curves were modeled simultaneously
with the JKTEBOP code, with Markov chain Monte Carlo simulations for the error estimates. The best-model
fit have revealed that the investigated detached binaries are in very close orbits, with orbital
separations of $2.9 \leq a \leq 6.7$ $R_{\odot}$ and short periods of $0.59 \leq P_{\rm orb} \leq
1.72$ d, approximately. We have derived stellar masses between $0.24$ and $0.72$ $M_{\odot}$ and
radii ranging from $0.42$ to $0.67$ $R_{\odot}$. The great majority of the LMEBs in our sample has
an estimated radius far from the predicted values according to evolutionary models. The components
with derived masses of $M < 0.6$ $M_{\odot}$ present a radius inflation of $\sim$$9\%$ or more. This
general behavior follows the trend of inflation for partially-radiative stars proposed previously.
These systems add to the increasing sample of low-mass stellar radii that are not well-reproduced
by stellar models. They further highlight the need to understand the magnetic activity and physical
state of small stars. Missions like TESS will provide many such systems to perform high-precision
radius measurements to tightly constrain low-mass stellar evolution models.
