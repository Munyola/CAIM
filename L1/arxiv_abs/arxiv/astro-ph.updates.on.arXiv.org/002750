We present a model of the photodissociation regions of NGC 4038, which is part of the Antennae galaxies.
We have considered one-dimensional slabs of uniform density all having a maximum $A_V=10\,{\rm
mag}$, interacting with plane-parallel radiation. The density range in our simulations spans
four orders of magnitude ($100\le n\le 10^6\,{\rm cm}^{-3}$) and the UV field strength spans more
than three orders of magnitude ($10\le\chi\le10^{4.5}$ multiples of the ${\rm Draine}$ field),
from which we generated a grid of about 1400 simulations. We compare our results with Herschel SPIRE-FTS,
CSO and ISO-LWS observations of eight CO transition lines ($J=1-0$ to $8-7$) and the [CI] 609\mu
m and [OI] 146\mu m fine structure lines. We find that the molecular and atomic emission lines trace
different gas components of NGC 4038, thus single emission models are insufficient to reproduce
the observed values. In general, low-$J$ CO transition lines correspond to either low density regions
interacting with low UV field strengths, or high density regions interacting with high UV field
strengths. Higher $J$ CO transition lines are less dependent on the UV field strength and are fitted
by gas with density $n\sim10^{4.5}-10^{5.2}\,{\rm cm}^{-3}$. We find that the observed fine structure
line ratio of [CI] 609\mu m/[OI] 146\mu m is reproduced by clouds subject to weaker UV fields compared
to the CO lines. We make estimates of the $X_{\rm CO}$ factor which relates the CO emission with the
column density of molecular hydrogen, and find that it is less than the canonical Milky Way value.
