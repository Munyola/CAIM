Canonization of F(R) theory of gravity to explore Noether symmetry is performed treating R - 6(\frac{\ddot
a}{a} + \frac{\dot a^2}{a^2} + \frac{k}{a^2}) = 0 as a constraint of the theory in Robertson-Walker
space-time, which implies that R is taken as an auxiliary variable. Although it yields correct field
equations, Noether symmetry does not allow linear term in the action, and as such does not produce
a viable cosmological model. Here, we show that this technique of exploring Noether symmetry does
not allow even a non-linear form of F(R), if the configuration space is enlarged by including a scalar
field in addition, or taking anisotropic models into account. Surprisingly enough, it does not
reproduce the symmetry that already exists in the literature (A. K. Sanyal, B. Modak, C. Rubano and
E. Piedipalumbo, Gen.Relativ.Grav.37, 407 (2005), arXiv:astro-ph/0310610 ) for scalar tensor
theory of gravity in the presence of R^2 term. Thus, R can not be treated as an auxiliary variable and
hence Noether symmetry of arbitrary form of F(R) theory of gravity remains obscure. However, there
exists in general, a conserved current for F(R) theory of gravity in the presence of a non-minimally
coupled scalar-tensor theory (A. K. Sanyal, Phys.Lett.B624, 81 (2005), arXiv:hep-th/0504021
and Mod.Phys.Lett.A25, 2667 (2010), arXiv:0910.2385 [astro-ph.CO]). Here, we briefly expatiate
the non-Noether conserved current and cite an example to reveal its importance in finding cosmological
solution for such an action, taking F(R) \propto R^{3/2}.
