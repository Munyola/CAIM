Transit timing variations (TTVs) are a valuable tool to determine the masses and orbits of transiting
planets in multi-planet systems. TTVs can be readily modeled given knowledge of the interacting
planets' orbital configurations and planet-star mass ratios, but such models are highly nonlinear
and difficult to invert. Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods are often used to explore the posterior
distribution for model parameters, but, due to the high correlations between parameters, nonlinearity,
and potential multi-modality in the posterior, many samplers perform very inefficiently. Therefore,
we assess the performance of several MCMC samplers that use varying degrees of geometric information
about the target distribution. We generate synthetic datasets from multiple models, including
the TTVFaster model and a simple sinusoidal model, and test the efficiencies of various MCMC samplers.
We find that sampling efficiency can be greatly improved for all models by sampling from a parameter
space transformed using an estimate of the covariance and means of the target distribution. No one
sampler performs the best for all datasets, but several samplers, such as Differential Evolution
Monte Carlo and Geometric adaptive Monte Carlo, have consistently efficient performance. For
datasets with near Gaussian posteriors, Hamiltonian Monte Carlo samplers with 2 or 3 leapfrog steps
obtained the highest efficiencies. Based on differences in effective sample sizes per time, we
show that the right choice of sampler can improve sampling efficiencies by several orders of magnitude.
