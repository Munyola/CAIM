Many isolated white dwarfs (WDs) show spectral evidence of atmospheric metal pollution. Since
heavy element sedimentation timescales are short, this most likely indicates ongoing accretion.
Accreted metals encounter a variety of mixing processes at the WD surface: convection, gravitational
sedimentation, overshoot, and thermohaline instability. We present MESA WD models that explore
each of these processes and their implications for inferred accretion rates. We provide diffusion
timescales for many individual metals, and we quantify the regimes in which thermohaline mixing
dominates over gravitational sedimentation in setting the effective settling rate of the heavy
elements. We build upon and confirm earlier work finding that accretion rates as high as $10^{13}
\, \rm g \, s^{-1}$ are needed to explain observed pollution in DA WDs for $T_{\rm eff} > 15,000 \, \rm
K$, and we provide tabulated results from our models that enable accretion rate inferences from
observations of polluted DA WDs. If these rates are representative of young WDs, we estimate that
the total mass of planetesimal material accreted over a WD lifetime may be as high as $10^{28} \, \rm
g$, though this estimate is susceptible to potential selection biases and uncertainties about
the nature of disk processes that supply accretion to the WD surface. We also find that polluted DB
WDs experience much less thermohaline mixing than DA WDs, and we do not expect thermohaline instability
to be active for polluted DB WDs with $T_{\rm eff} < 18,000 \, \rm K$.
