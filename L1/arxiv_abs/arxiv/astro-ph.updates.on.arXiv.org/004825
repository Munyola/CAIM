Understanding the effects of dust extinction is important to properly interpret observations.
The optical total-to-selective extinction ratio, Rv = Av/E(B-V), is widely used to describe extinction
variations in ultraviolet and optical bands. Since the Rv=3.1 extinction curve adequately represents
the average extinction law of diffuse regions in the Milky Way, it is commonly used to correct observational
measurements along sightlines toward diffuse regions in the interstellar medium. However, the
Rv value may vary even along different diffuse interstellar medium sightlines. In this paper, we
investigate the optical--mid-infrared (mid-IR) extinction law toward a very diffuse region at
l = 165 in the Galactic plane, which was selected based on a CO emission map. Adopting red clump stars
as extinction tracers, we determine the optical-to-mid-IR extinction law for our diffuse region
in the two APASS bands (B, V), the three XSTPS-GAC bands (g, r, i), the three 2MASS bands (J, H, Ks, and
the two WISE bands (W1, W2). Specifically, 18 red clump stars were selected from the APOGEE--RC catalog
based on spectroscopic data in order to explore the diversity of the extinction law. We find that
the optical extinction curves exhibit appreciable diversity. The corresponding Rv ranges from
1.7 to 3.8, while the mean Rv value of 2.8 is consistent with the widely adopted average value of 3.1
for Galactic diffuse clouds. There is no apparent correlation between Rv value and color excess
E(B-V) in the range of interest, from 0.2 to 0.6 mag, or with specific visual extinction per kiloparsec,
AV/d.
