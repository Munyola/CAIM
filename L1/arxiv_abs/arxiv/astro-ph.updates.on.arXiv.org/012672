These lecture notes are based on a tutorial given in 2017 at a plasma physics winter school in Les Houches.
Their aim is to provide a self-contained graduate-student level introduction to the theory and
modelling of the dynamo effect in turbulent fluids and plasmas, blended with a review of current
research in the field. The primary focus is on the physical and mathematical concepts underlying
different (turbulent) branches of dynamo theory, with some astrophysical, geophysical and experimental
context disseminated throughout the document. The text begins with an introduction to the rationale,
observational and historical roots of the subject, and to the basic concepts of magnetohydrodynamics
relevant to dynamo theory. The next two sections discuss the fundamental phenomenological and
mathematical aspects of (linear and nonlinear) small- and large-scale MHD dynamos. These sections
are complemented by an overview of a selection of current active research topics in the field, including
the numerical modelling of the geo- and solar dynamos, shear dynamos driven by turbulence with zero
net helicity, and MHD-instability-driven dynamos such as the magnetorotational dynamo. The difficult
problem of a unified, self-consistent statistical treatment of small and large-scale dynamos
at large magnetic Reynolds numbers is also discussed throughout the text. Finally, an excursion
is made into the relatively new but increasingly popular realm of magnetic-field generation in
weakly-collisional plasmas. A short discussion of the outlook and challenges for the future of
the field concludes the presentation.
