A complete understanding of the onset and subsequent evolution of confined flares has not been achieved.
Earlier studies mainly analyzed disk events so as to reveal their magnetic topology and cause of
confinement. In this study, taking advantage of a tandem of instruments working at different wavelengths
of X-rays, EUVs, and microwaves, we present dynamic details of a confined flare observed on the northwestern
limb of the solar disk on July 24th, 2016. The entire dynamic evolutionary process starting from
its onset is consistent with a loop-loop interaction scenario. The X-ray profiles manifest an intriguing
double-peak feature. From spectral fitting, it is found that the first peak is non-thermally dominated
while the second peak is mostly multi-thermal with a hot (~10 MK) and a super-hot (~30 MK) component.
This double-peak feature is unique in that the two peaks are clearly separated by 4 minutes, and the
second peak reaches up to 25-50 keV; in addition, at energy bands above 3 keV the X-ray fluxes decline
significantly between the two peaks. This, together with other available imaging and spectral
data, manifest a two-stage energy release process. A comprehensive analysis is carried out to investigate
the nature of this two-stage process. We conclude that the second stage with the hot and super-hot
sources mainly involves direct heating through loop-loop reconnection at a relatively high altitude
in the corona. The uniqueness of the event characteristics and complete data set make the study a
nice addition to present literature on solar flares.
