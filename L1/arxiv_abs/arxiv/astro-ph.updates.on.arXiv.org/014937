We investigate an interacting dark sector scenario in which the vacuum energy is free to interact
with cold dark matter (CDM), which itself is assumed to cluster under the sole action of gravity,
i.e. it is in free fall (geodesic), as in $\Lambda$CDM. The interaction is characterised by a dimensionless
coupling $q_{\rm V}$ that we constrain using cosmic microwave background data from the Planck 2015
data release, along with baryon acoustic oscillation, redshift space distortion and Type Ia supernova
measurements. We present the full linear perturbation theory of this interacting scenario and
use MCMC sampling to study five different cases: two cases in which we have $\Lambda$CDM evolution
in the distant past, until a set redshift $z_{\rm trans}$, below which the interaction switches
on and $q_{\rm V}$ is the single sampled parameter, with $z_{\rm trans}$ fixed at $z_{\rm trans}=3000$
and $z_{\rm trans}=0.9$ respectively; a case where we allow this transition redshift to vary along
with $q_{\rm V}$; a case in which the vacuum energy is zero for $z>z_{\rm trans}$ and then begins to
grow once the interaction switches on; and the final case in which we bin $q_{\rm V}(z)$ in four redshift
bins to investigate the possibility of a dynamical interaction, reconstructing the redshift evolution
of the function using Gaussian processes. We find that, in all cases where the high redshift evolution
is not modified, the results are compatible with a vanishing coupling, thus finding no significant
deviation from $\Lambda$CDM.
