The Galactic Center supermassive black hole Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*) is one of the most promising
targets to study the dynamics of black hole accretion and outflow via direct imaging with very long
baseline interferometry (VLBI). At 3.5 mm (86 GHz), the emission from Sgr A* is resolvable with the
Global Millimeter VLBI Array (GMVA). We present the first observations of Sgr A* with the phased
Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) joining the GMVA. Our observations achieve
an angular resolution of ~87{\mu}as, improving upon previous experiments by a factor of two. We
reconstruct a first image of the unscattered source structure of Sgr A* at 3.5 mm, mitigating effects
of interstellar scattering. The unscattered source has a major axis size of 120 $\pm$ 34{\mu}as
(12 $\pm$ 3.4 Schwarzschild radii), and a symmetrical morphology (axial ratio of 1.2$^{+0.3}_{-0.2}$),
which is further supported by closure phases consistent with zero within 3{\sigma}. We show that
multiple disk-dominated models of Sgr A* match our observational constraints, while the two jet-dominated
models considered are constrained to small viewing angles. Our long-baseline detections to ALMA
also provide new constraints on the scattering of Sgr A*, and we show that refractive scattering
effects are likely to be weak for images of Sgr A* at 1.3 mm with the Event Horizon Telescope. Our results
provide the most stringent constraints to date for the intrinsic morphology and refractive scattering
of Sgr A*, demonstrating the exceptional contribution of ALMA to millimeter VLBI.
