We report the results of sub-parsec scale submillimeter observations towards an embedded high-mass
young stellar object in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) with ALMA. Complementary infrared data
obtained with the AKARI satellite and the Gemini-South telescope are also presented. The target
infrared point source is spatially resolved into two dense molecular cloud cores; one is associated
with a high-mass young stellar object (YSO core), while another is not associated with an infrared
source (East core). The two cores are dynamically associated but show different chemical characteristics.
Emission lines of CS, C33S, H2CS, SO, SO2, CH3OH, H13CO+, H13CN, SiO, and dust continuum are detected
from the observed region. Tentative detection of HDS is also reported. The first detection of CH3OH
in the SMC has a strong impact on our understanding of the formation of complex organic molecules
in metal-poor environments. The gas temperature is estimated to be ~10 K based on the rotation analysis
of CH3OH lines. The fractional abundance of CH3OH gas in the East core is estimated to be (0.5-1.5)
x 10^(-8), which is comparable with or marginally higher than those of similar cold sources in our
Galaxy despite a factor of five lower metallicity in the SMC. This work provides observational evidence
that an organic molecule like CH3OH, which are largely formed on grain surfaces, can be produced
even in a significantly lower metallicity environment compared to the solar neighborhood. A possible
origin of cold CH3OH gas in the observed dense core is discussed.
