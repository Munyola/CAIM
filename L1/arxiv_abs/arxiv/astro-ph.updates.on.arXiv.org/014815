High cadence transient surveys are able to capture supernovae closer to their first light than before.
Applying analytical models to such early emission, we can constrain the progenitor stars properties.
In this paper, we present observations of SN2018fif (ZTF18abokyfk). The supernova was discovered
close to first light and monitored by the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) and the Neil Gehrels Swift
Observatory. Early spectroscopic observations suggest that the progenitor of SN2018fif was surrounded
by relatively small amounts of circumstellar material (CSM) compared to all previous cases. This
particularity, coupled with the high cadence multiple-band coverage, makes it a good candidate
to investigate using shock-cooling models. We employ the SOPRANOS code, an implementation of the
model by Sapir & Waxman (2017). Compared with previous implementations, SOPRANOS has the advantage
of including a careful account of the limited temporal validity domain of the shock-cooling model.
We find that the progenitor of SN2018fif was a large red supergiant, with a radius of R=1174_{-81}^{+208}
solar radii, and an ejected mass of M=5.6_{-1.0}^{+9.1} solar masses. Our model also gives information
on the explosion epoch, the progenitor inner structure, the shock velocity and the extinction.
The large radius differs from previously modeled objects, and the difference could be either intrinsic
or due to the relatively small amount of CSM around SN2018fif, perhaps making it a "cleaner" candidate
for applying shock-cooling analytical models.
