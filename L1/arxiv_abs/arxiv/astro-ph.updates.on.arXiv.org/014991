We present a VLT/X-Shooter spectroscopy of the Lyman continuum (LyC) emitting galaxy 'Ion2' at
z=3.2121 and compare it to that of the recently discovered strongly lensed LyC-emitter at z=2.37,
known as the 'Sunburst' arc. Three main results emerge from the X-Shooter spectrum: (a) the Lya has
three distinct peaks with the central one at the systemic redshift, indicating a ionised tunnel
through which both Lya and LyC radiation escape; (b) the large O32 oxygen index ([OIII]4959-5007
/ [OII]3727-3729) of 9.18(-1.32/+1.82) is compatible to those measured in local (z~0.4) LyC leakers;
(c) there are narrow nebular high-ionisation metal lines with \sigma_v < 20 km/s, which confirms
the presence of young hot, massive stars. The HeII1640 appears broad, consistent with a young stellar
component including Wolf-Rayet stars. Similarly, the Sunburst LyC-emitter shows a triple-peaked
Lya profile and from VLT/MUSE spectroscopy the presence of spectral features arising from young
hot and massive stars. The strong lensing magnification, (\mu > 20), suggests that this exceptional
object is a gravitationally-bound star cluster observed at a cosmological distance, with a stellar
mass M <~ 10^7 Msun and an effective radius smaller than 20 pc. Intriguingly, sources like Sunburst
but without lensing magnification might appear as Ion2-like galaxies, in which unresolved massive
star clusters dominate the ultraviolet emission. This work supports the idea that dense young star
clusters can contribute to the ionisation of the IGM through holes created by stellar feedback.
