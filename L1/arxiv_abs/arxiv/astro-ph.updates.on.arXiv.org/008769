Luminous tracers of large-scale structure are not entirely representative of the distribution
of mass in our Universe. As they arise from the highest peaks in the matter density field, the spatial
distribution of luminous objects is biased towards those peaks. On large scales, where density
fluctuations are mild, this bias simply amounts to a constant offset in the clustering amplitude
of the tracer, known as linear bias. In this work we focus on the relative bias between galaxies and
galaxy clusters that are located inside and in the vicinity of cosmic voids, extended regions of
relatively low density in the large-scale structure of the Universe. With the help of hydro-dynamical
simulations we verify that the relation between galaxy and cluster overdensity around voids remains
linear. Hence, the void-centric density profiles of different tracers can be linked by a single
multiplicative constant. This amounts to the same value as the relative linear bias between tracers
for the largest voids in the sample. For voids of small sizes, which typically arise in higher density
regions, this constant has a higher value, possibly showing an environmental dependence similar
to that observed for the linear bias itself. We confirm our findings by analysing mocks and data obtained
during the first year of observations by the Dark Energy Survey. As a side product, we present the
first catalogue of three-dimensional voids extracted from a photometric survey with a controlled
photo-z uncertainty. Our results will be relevant in forthcoming analyses that attempt to use voids
as cosmological probes.
