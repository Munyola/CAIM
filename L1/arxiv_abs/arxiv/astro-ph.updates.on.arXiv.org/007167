We present a catalogue of 38 spectroscopically detected strong galaxy-galaxy gravitational lens
candidates identified in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey IV (SDSS-IV). We were able to simulate narrow-band
images for 8 of them demonstrating evidence of multiple images. Two of our systems are compound lens
candidates, each with 2 background source-planes. One of these compound systems shows clear lensing
features in the narrow-band image. Our sample is based on 2812 galaxies observed by the Mapping Nearby
Galaxies at APO (MaNGA) integral field unit (IFU). This Spectroscopic Identification of Lensing
Objects (SILO) survey extends the methodology of the Sloan Lens ACS Survey (SLACS) and BOSS Emission-Line
Survey (BELLS) to lower redshift and multiple IFU spectra. We searched ~ 1.5 million spectra, of
which 3065 contained multiple high signal-to-noise background emission-lines or a resolved [OII]
doublet, that are included in this catalogue. Upon manual inspection, we discovered regions with
multiple spectra containing background emission-lines at the same redshift, providing evidence
of a common source-plane geometry which was not possible in previous SLACS and BELLS discovery programs.
We estimate more than half of our candidates have an Einstein radius > 1.7", which is significantly
greater than seen in SLACS and BELLS. These larger Einstein radii produce more extended images of
the background galaxy increasing the probability that a background emission-line will enter one
of the IFU spectroscopic fibres, making detection more likely.
