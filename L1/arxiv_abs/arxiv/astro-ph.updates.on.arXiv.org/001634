In this study, we model the dark matter and baryon matter distribution in the Cosmic Web by means of
highly nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger type and reaction diffusion wave mechanical descriptions.
The construction of these wave mechanical models of the structure formation is achieved by introducing
the Fisher information measure and its comparison with a highly nonlinear term called the quantum
potential in the wave equations. Strikingly, the comparison of the nonlinear term and the Fisher
information measure provides a dynamical distinction between lack of self-organization and self-organization
in the dynamical evolution of the cosmic components. Mathematically equivalent to the standard
cosmic fluid equations, these approaches make it possible to follow the evolution of the matter
distribution even into the highly nonlinear regime by circumventing singularities. In addition,
these wave formalisms are extended to two-fluid descriptions of the coupled dark matter and baryon
matter distributions in the linear regime, in the Einstein de Sitter Universe (EdS) to construct
toy models of the cosmic components in this relatively simple Universe model. Based on these two
different wave mechanical formalisms, here fully analytical results for the dark matter and baryon
distributions are provided. Also, numerical realizations of the emerging weblike patterns are
presented from the nonlinear dynamics of the baryon component corresponding to soliton-like solutions.
These soliton-like solutions might represent a proper description of filamentary structures
even in the linear regime.
