A large number of Type IIIb-III pairs, in which the first component is a Type IIIb burst and the second
one is a Type III burst, are often recorded during decameter Type III burst storms. From the beginning
of their observation, the question of whether the components of these pairs are the first and the
second harmonics of radio emission or not has remained open. We discuss properties of decameter
IIIb-III pairs in detail to answer this question. The components of these pairs, Type IIIb bursts
and Type III bursts, have essentially different durations and polarizations. At the same time their
frequency drift rates are rather close, provided that the drift rates of Type IIIb bursts are a little
larger those of Type III bursts at the same frequency. Frequency ratios of the bursts at the same moment
are close to two. This points at a harmonic connection of the components in IIIb-III pairs. At the
same time there was a serious difficulty, namely why the first harmonic had fine frequency structure
in the form of striae and the second harmonic did not have it. Recently Loi, Cairns, and Li ( Astrophys.
J. 790, 67, 2014) succeeded in solving this problem. The physical aspects of observational properties
of decameter IIIb-III pairs are discussed and pros and cons of harmonic character of Type IIIb bursts
and Type III bursts in IIIb-III pairs are presented. We conclude that practically all properties
of the IIIb-III pair components can be understood in the framework of the harmonic relation of the
components of the IIIb-III pairs.
