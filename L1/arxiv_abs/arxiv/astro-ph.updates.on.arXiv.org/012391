We study the gamma-ray emission patterns and light curves in dissipative pulsar magnetospheres.
We produce the gamma-ray light curves by using the geometric method and the particle trajectory
method. For the geometric method, assuming the gamma-ray emission originates in a finite-width
layer along the last closed lines, we generate the gamma-ray light curves based on the uniform emissivity
along the magnetic field lines in the comoving frame (CF). For the particle trajectory method, we
consider the spatial distribution of conductivity $\sigma$ by assuming a very high conductivity
within the light cylinder and a finite conductivity outside the light cylinder (LC). Assuming that
all the $\gamma$-ray emission originates in the outer magnetosphere outside the LC, we generate
the gamma-ray light curves by computing realistic particle trajectories and Lorentz factors,
taking into account both the accelerating electric field and curvature radiation loss. Further,
we compare the modeling light curves to the observed light curves at $>0.1\, \rm GeV$ energies for
Vela pulsar. Our results show that the magnetosphere with the low $\sigma$ value is more preferred
for the geometric method. However, the magnetosphere with a near force-free regime within the LC
and a high $\sigma$ value outside the LC is more favored for the particle trajectory method. It is
noted that the particle trajectory method uses the parallel electric fields that are self-consistent
with the magnetic fields of the magnetosphere. We suggest that the results from the particle trajectory
method are more supported on the physical ground.
