We report a detailed study of the pre-eruption activities that led to the occurrence of an M9.0 flare/CME
event on 2012 October 20 in NOAA AR 11598. This includes the study of the preceding confined C2.4 flare
that occurred on the same AR ~25 minutes earlier. We observed that the M9.0 flare occurred as a consequence
of two distinct triggering events well separated in time. The first triggering episode occurred
as early as ~20 minutes before the onset of the M9.0 flare, evidenced by the destabilization and rise
of a pre-existing filament to a new position of equilibrium at a higher coronal altitude during the
decay phase of the C2.4 flare. This brought the system to a magnetic configuration where the establishment
of the second triggering event was favorable. The second triggering episode occurred ~17 minutes
later, during the early phase of the M9.0 flare, evidenced by the further rise of the filament and
successful ejection. The second trigger is followed by a flare precursor phase, characterized
by non-thermal emission and the sequential formation of a hot channel as shown by the SDO/AIA DEM
(differential emission measure) maps, the RHESSI X-ray images and spectra. These observations
are suggestive of magnetic reconnection and particle acceleration that can explain the precursor
phase and can be directly related to the formation of the hot channel. We discuss on the triggering
mechanisms, their implications during the early and precursor phases and highlight the importance
of early activities and preceding small confined flares to understand the initiation of large eruptive
flares.
