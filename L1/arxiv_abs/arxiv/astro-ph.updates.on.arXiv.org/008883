We investigated four luminous supersoft X-ray sources (SSS) in the Magellanic Clouds suspected
to have optical counterparts of Be spectral type. If the origin of the X-rays is in a very hot atmosphere
heated by hydrogen burning in accreted envelopes of white dwarfs (WDs), like in the majority of SSS,
these objects are close binaries, with very massive WD primaries. Using the South African Large
Telescope (SALT), we obtained the first optical spectra of the proposed optical counterparts of
two candidate Be stars associated with SUZAKU J0105-72 and XMMU J010147.5-715550, respectively
a transient and a recurrent SSS, and confirmed the proposed Be classification and Small Magellanic
Clouds membership. We also obtained new optical spectra of two other Be stars proposed as optical
counterparts of the transient SSS XMMU J052016.0-692505 and MAXI-J0158-744. The optical spectra
with double peaked emission line profiles, are typical of Be stars and present characteristics
similar to many high mass X-ray binaries with excretion disks, truncated by the tidal interaction
with a compact object. The presence of a massive WD that sporadically ignites nuclear burning, accreting
only at certain orbital or evolutionary phases, explains the supersoft X-ray flares. We measured
equivalent widths and distances between lines' peaks, and investigated the variability of the
prominent emission lines' profiles. The excretion disks seem to be small in size, and are likely
to be differentially rotating. We discuss possible future observations and the relevance of these
objects as a new class of type Ia supernovae progenitors.
