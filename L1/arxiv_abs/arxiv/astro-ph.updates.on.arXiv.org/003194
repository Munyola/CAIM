We focus on the exceptional flaring activity of 3C 454.3 in November 2010 and we discuss a theoretical
framework addressing all data in their overall evolution. For two weeks the source has shown a plateau
of enhanced GeV emission preceding a sudden major flare lasting about 3 days before decaying. The
gamma-ray flare onset is abrupt (about 6 hours), and is characterized by a prominent "Compton dominance"
with the GeV flux exceeding the pre-flare values by a factor of 4-5, whereas the optical and X-ray
fluxes increased only by a factor 2. We explore two alternatives. Case 1, with high-energy emission
originating within the BLR; and Case 2, with most of it produced outside. We show that Case 1 has considerable
problems in explaining the whole set of multifrequency data. Case 2, instead, leads to a consistent
and interesting interpretation based on the enhanced inverse Compton radiation that is produced
as the jet crashes onto a mirror cloud positioned at few parsec from the BH. This model explains the
gamma-ray vs. optical/X-ray behavior of 3C 454.3, including the otherwise puzzling phenomena
such as the prominent "orphan" optical flare, and the enhanced line emission with no appreciable
gamma-ray counterpart that preceded the GeV flare. It also accounts for the delayed onset of the
latter on top of the long plateau. Our modelling of the exceptional 3C 454.3 gamma-ray flare shows
that, while emission inside the canonical BLR is problematic, major and rapid variations can be
produced at parsec scales with moderate bulk Lorentz factors $\Gamma\approx 15$.
