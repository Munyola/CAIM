Based on the high resolution spectral monitoring conducted at the 6-m BTA telescope, we study the
optical spectrum of the high-latitude variable V534 Lyr. Heliocentric radial velocities Vr corresponding
to the positions of all metal absorption components, as well as the NaI D and H$\alpha$ lines were
measured during all the observational dates. The analysis of the velocity field examining the lines
of various nature revealed a low-amplitude variability of Vr based on the lines with a high excitation
potential, which are formed in deep layers of the stellar atmosphere, and allowed to estimate the
systemic velocity of Vsys$\approx-125$ km/s (V(lsr)$\approx-105$ km/s). The distance estimate
of d$\approx$6 kpc for the star leads us to its absolute magnitude of Mv$\approx -5.3^{m}$, what
corresponds to the MK spectral classification. The previously undetected for this star spectral
phenomenon was revealed: at certain times a splitting of the profiles of low-excited absorptions
is observed, reaching $\Delta$Vr=20$\div$50 km/s. A combination of the parameters: reduced metallicity
[Met/H]$_{\odot}=-0.28$, increased nitrogen abundance [N/Fe]=+1.10, large spatial velocity,
high luminosity, a strong variability of the emission-absorption profiles of HI lines, splitting
of metal absorptions at different observation moments and the variability of the velocity field
in the atmosphere allow us to consider V534 Lyr as a pulsating star in the instability band near the
HB and belonging to the thick disk of our Galaxy.
