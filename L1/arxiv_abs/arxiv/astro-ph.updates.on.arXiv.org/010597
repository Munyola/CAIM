Using the first 18 months of the Pan-STARRS 1 survey we have identified 33 candidate high-amplitude
objects for follow-up observations and carried out observations of 22 asteroids. 4 of the observed
objects were found to have observed amplitude $A_{obs}\geq 1.0$ mag. We find that these high amplitude
objects are most simply explained by single rubble pile objects with some density-dependent internal
strength, allowing them to resist mass shedding even at their highly elongated shapes. 3 further
objects although below the cut-off for 'high-amplitude' had a combination of elongation and rotation
period which also may require internal cohesive strength, depending on the density of the body.
We find that none of the 'high-amplitude asteroids' identified here require any unusual cohesive
strengths to resist rotational fission. 3 asteroids were sufficiently observed to allow for shape
and spin pole models to be determined through light curve inversion. 45864 was determined to have
retrograde rotation with spin pole axes $\lambda=218\pm 10^{\circ}, \beta=-82\pm 5^{\circ}$
and asteroid 206167 was found to have best fit spin pole axes $\lambda= 57 \pm 5^{\circ}$, $\beta=-67
\pm 5^{\circ}$. An additional object not initially measured with $A_{obs}>1.0$ mag, 49257, was
determined to have a shape model which does suggest a high-amplitude object. Its spin pole axes were
best fit for values $\lambda=112\pm 6^{\circ}, \beta=6\pm 5^{\circ}$. In the course of this project
to date no large super-fast rotators ($P_{rot} < 2.2$ h) have been identified.
