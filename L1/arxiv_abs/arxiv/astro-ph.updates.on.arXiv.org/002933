We investigate the linear and nonlinear evolution of current-carrying jets in a periodic configuration
by means of high resolution three-dimensional numerical simulations. The jets under consideration
are strongly magnetized with a variable pitch profile and initially in equilibrium under the action
of a force-free magnetic field. The growth of current-driven (CDI) and Kelvin-Helmholtz (KHI)
instabilities is quantified using three selected cases corresponding to static, Alfvenic and
super-Alfvenic jets. During the early stages, we observe large-scale helical deformations of
the jet corresponding to the growth of the initially excited CDI mode. A direct comparison between
our simulation results and the analytical growth rates obtained from linear theory reveals good
agreement on condition that high-resolution and accurate discretization algorithms are employed.
After the initial linear phase, the jet structure is significantly altered and, while slowly-moving
jets show increasing helical deformations, larger velocity shear are violently disrupted on a
few Alfven crossing time leaving a turbulent flow structure. Overall, kinetic and magnetic energies
are quickly dissipated into heat and during the saturated regime the jet momentum is redistributed
on a larger surface area with most of the jet mass travelling at smaller velocities. The effectiveness
of this process is regulated by the onset of KHI instabilities taking place at the jet/ambient interface
and can be held responsible for vigorous jet braking and entrainment.
