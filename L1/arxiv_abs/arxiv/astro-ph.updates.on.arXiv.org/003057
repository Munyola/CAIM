In a previous paper (Hedman and Nicholson 2013), we developed tools that allowed us to confirm that
several of the waves in Saturn's rings were likely generated by resonances with fundamental sectoral
normal modes inside Saturn itself. Here we use these same tools to examine eight additional waves
that are probably generated by structures inside the planet. One of these waves appears to be generated
by a resonance with a fundamental sectoral normal mode with azimuthal harmonic number m=10. If this
attribution is correct, then the m=10 mode must have a larger amplitude than the modes with m=5-9,
since the latter do not appear to generate strong waves. We also identify five waves with pattern
speeds between 807 degrees/day and 834 degrees/day. Since these pattern speeds are close to the
planet's rotation rate, they probably are due to persistent gravitational anomalies within the
planet. These waves are all found in regions of enhanced optical depth known as plateaux, but surprisingly
the surface mass densities they yield are comparable to the surface mass densities of the background
C ring. Finally, one wave appears to be a one-armed spiral pattern whose rotation rate suggests it
is generated by a resonance with a structure inside Saturn, but the nature of this perturbing structure
remains unclear. Strangely, the resonant radius for this wave seems to be drifting inwards at an
average rate of 0.8 km/year over the last thirty years, implying that the relevant planetary oscillation
frequency has been steadily increasing.
