Foreground power dominates the measurements of interferometers that seek a statistical detection
of highly-redshifted HI emission from the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). The inherent spectral smoothness
of synchrotron radiation, the dominant foreground emission mechanism, and the chromaticity of
the instrument allows these experiments to delineate a boundary between spectrally smooth and
structured emission in Fourier space (the "wedge" or "pitchfork", and the "EoR Window", respectively).
Faraday rotation can inject spectral structure into otherwise smooth polarized foreground emission,
which through instrument effects or miscalibration could possibly pollute the EoR Window. Using
data from the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA) 19-element commissioning array, we investigate
the polarization response of this new instrument in the power spectrum domain. We confirm the expected
structure of foreground emission in Fourier space predicted by Thyagarajan et al. (2015a, 2016)
for a HERA-type dish, and detect polarized power within the pitchfork. Using simulations of the
polarized response of HERA feeds, we find that almost all of the power in Stokes Q, U and V can be attributed
to instrumental leakage effects. Power consistent with noise in the EoR window suggests a negligible
amount of spectrally-structured polarized power, to the noise-levels attained. This lends confidence
to deep integrations with HERA in the future, but with a lower noise floor these future studies will
also have to investigate their polarized response.
