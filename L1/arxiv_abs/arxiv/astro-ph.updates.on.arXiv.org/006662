We present results from a detailed analysis of our 2016 XMM-Newton observation of the narrow-line
Seyfert 1 galaxy PG 1404+226 which showed a large-amplitude, rapid X-ray variability by a factor
of $\sim7$ in $\sim10$ ks with an exponential rise and a sharp fall in the count rate. We investigate
the origin of the soft X-ray excess emission and rapid X-ray variability in the source through time-resolved
spectroscopy and fractional root-mean-squared (rms) spectral modeling. The strong soft X-ray
excess below 1 keV seen in the mean X-ray spectrum and in the time-resolved spectra is well described
by the intrinsic disk Comptonization model as well as the blurred reflection model where the emission
is intensive merely in the inner regions ($r_{\rm in}<2 r_{\rm g}$) of an ionized accretion disk.
We detected no significant UV variability while the soft X-ray excess varies together with the primary
emission (as $F_{{\rm primary}}\propto F_{{\rm excess}}^{1.54}$), although with a smaller amplitude
as expected in the reflection scenario. The X-ray fractional rms spectrum shows an approximately
constant variability with energy which can be described only in the framework of the blurred reflection
model in which both the intrinsic continuum and reflected emission are highly variable in flux only
and are perfectly coupled with each other. Our results imply the `lamppost geometry' of a compact,
hot corona which illuminates the innermost accretion disk due to light bending and gives rise to
the soft X-ray excess emission.
