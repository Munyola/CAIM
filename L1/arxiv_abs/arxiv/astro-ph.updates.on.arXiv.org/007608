The Schr\"odinger-Poisson equations describe the behavior of a superfluid Bose-Einstein condensate
under self-gravity with a 3D wave function. As $\hbar/m\to 0$, $m$ being the boson mass, the equations
have been postulated to approximate the collisionless Vlasov-Poisson equations also known as
the collisionless Boltzmann-Poisson equations. The latter describe collisionless matter with
a 6D classical distribution function. We investigate the nature of this correspondence with a suite
of numerical test problems in 1D, 2D, and 3D along with analytic treatments when possible. We demonstrate
that, while the density field of the superfluid always shows order unity oscillations as $\hbar/m\to
0$ due to interference and the uncertainty principle, the potential field converges to the classical
answer as $(\hbar/m)^{2}$. Thus, any dynamics coupled to the superfluid potential is expected
to recover the classical collisionless limit as $\hbar/m\to 0$. The quantum superfluid is able
to capture rich phenomena such as multiple phase-sheets, shell-crossings, and warm distributions.
Additionally, the quantum pressure tensor acts as a regularizer of caustics and singularities
in classical solutions. This suggests the exciting prospect of using the Schr\"odinger-Poisson
equations as a low-memory method for approximating the high-dimensional evolution of the Vlasov-Poisson
equations. As a particular example we consider dark matter composed of ultra-light axions, which
in the classical limit ($\hbar/m\to 0$) is expected to manifest itself as collisionless cold dark
matter.
