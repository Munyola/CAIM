In this study, we present and validate a variation of recently-developed physically motivated
sub-grid prescriptions for supernova feedback that account for the unresolved energy-conserving
phase of the bubble expansion. Our model builds upon the implementation publicly available in the
mesh-less hydrodynamic code GIZMO, and is coupled with the chemistry library KROME. Here, we test
it against different setups, to address how it affects the formation/dissociation of molecular
hydrogen (H$_2$). First, we explore very idealised conditions, to show that it can accurately reproduce
the terminal momentum of the blast-wave independent of resolution. Then, we apply it to a suite of
numerical simulations of an isolated Milky Way-like galaxy and compare it with a similar run employing
the delayed-cooling sub-grid prescription. We find that the delayed-cooling model, by pressurising
ad-hoc the gas, is more effective in suppressing star formation. However, to get this effect, it
must maintain the gas warm/hot at densities where it is expected to cool efficiently, artificially
changing the thermo-chemical state of the gas, and reducing the H$_2$ abundance even in dense gas.
Mechanical feedback, on the other hand, is able to reproduce the H$_2$ column densities without
altering the gas thermodynamics, and, at the same time, drives more powerful outflows. However,
being less effective in suppressing star formation, it over-predicts the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation
by a factor of about 2.5. Finally, we show that the model is consistent at different resolution levels,
with only mild differences.
