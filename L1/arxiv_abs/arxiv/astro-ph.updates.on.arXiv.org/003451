We present a statistical analysis of the Kepler M dwarf planet hosts, with a particular focus on the
fractional number of systems hosting multiple transiting planets. We manufacture synthetic planetary
systems within a range of planet multiplicity and mutual inclination for comparison to the Kepler
yield. We recover the observed number of systems containing between 2 and 5 transiting planets if
every M dwarf hosts 6.1+/-1.9 planets with typical mutual inclinations of 2.0 +4.0-2.0 degrees.
This range includes the Solar System in its coplanarity and multiplicity. However, similar to studies
of Kepler exoplanetary systems around more massive stars, we report that the number of singly-transiting
planets found by Kepler is too high to be consistent with a single population of multi-planet systems:
a finding that cannot be attributed to selection biases. To account for the excess singleton planetary
systems we adopt a mixture model and find that 55 +23-12% of planetary systems are either single or
contain multiple planets with large mutual inclinations. Thus, we find that the so-called "Kepler
dichotomy" holds for planets orbiting M dwarfs as well as Sun-like stars. Additionally, we compare
stellar properties of the hosts to single and multiple transiting planets. For the brightest subset
of stars in our sample we find intriguing, yet marginally significant evidence that stars hosting
multiply-transiting systems are rotating more quickly, are closer to the midplane of the Milky
Way, and are comparatively metal poor. This preliminary finding warrants further investigation.
