Recent improvements in the population of Long-duration Gamma Ray Burst (LGRB) host galaxies with
measured metallicities and host masses allows us to investigate how the distributions of both these
properties change with redshift. First we exclude, out to z < 2.5, strong redshift dependent populations
biases in mass and metallicity measurements. We then find a curious consistency in the metallicity
distribution across different redshifts. This is at odds with the general evolution in the mass
metallicity relation of typical galaxies, which become progressively more metal poor with increasing
redshift at constant mass. By converting the measured LGRB host masses and redshifts to expected
metallicities for a typical galaxy of each such mass and redshift, we further find that the increase
in LGRB host galaxy mass distribution with redshift seen in the Perley et al. (2016) SHOALS sample
is consistent with that needed to preserve the observed, non-evolving LGRB metallicity distribution.
However the estimated LGRB host metallicity distribution is approximately a quarter dex higher
than the measured metallicity distribution at all redshifts. This corresponds to about a factor
of two in raw metallicity and resolves much of the difference between the LGRB formation metallicity
cut of about a third solar in Graham & Fruchter (2017) with the cutoff value of solar claimed in Perley
et al. (2016) in favor of the former. As LGRB hosts do not follow the general mass metallicity relation,
there is no substitute for actually measuring their metallicities!
