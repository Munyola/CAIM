In the present work, we investigate how the large-scale magnetic field of the Sun, in its three vector
components, has evolved during most of cycle 24, from 2010 Jan to 2018 Apr. To filter out the small-scale
field of the Sun, present in high-resolution synoptic maps, we use a spherical harmonic decomposition
method, which decomposes the solar field in multipoles with different l degrees. By summing together
the low-l multipoles, we reconstruct the large-scale field at a resolution similar to observed
stellar magnetic fields, which allows the direct comparison between solar and stellar magnetic
maps. During cycle 24, the `Sun-as-a-star' magnetic field shows a polarity reversal in the radial
and meridional components, but not in the azimuthal component. The large-scale solar field remains
mainly poloidal with > 70% of its energy contained in the poloidal component. During its evolution,
the large-scale field is more axisymmetric and more poloidal when near minima in sunspot numbers,
and with a larger intensity near maximum. There is a correlation between toroidal energy and sunspot
number, which indicates that spot fields are major contributors to the toroidal large-scale energy
of the Sun. The solar large-scale magnetic properties fit smoothly with observational trends of
stellar magnetism reported in See et al. The toroidal (Etor) and poloidal (Epol) energies are related
as Etor ~Epol^{1.38 \pm 0.04}. Similar to the stellar sample, the large-scale field of the Sun shows
a lack of toroidal non-axisymmetric field.
