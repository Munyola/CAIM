The nonbaryonic dark matter of the Universe might consist of new stable charged species, bound by
ordinary Coulomb interactions in various forms of heavy neutral "dark atoms". The existing models
offer natural implementations for the dominant and subdominant forms of dark atom components.
In the framework of Walking Technicolor the charge asymmetric excess of both stable negatively
doubly charged technilepton $\zeta^{--}$ and metastable but longliving positively doubly charged
technibaryon $UU^{++}$ can be generated in the early Universe together with the observed baryon
asymmetry. If the excess of $\zeta$ exceeds by several orders of magnitude the excess of $UU$, dark
matter might consist dominantly by $He\zeta$ dark atoms of nuclear interacting O-helium ($OHe$)
bound state of $\zeta$ with primordial helium. Although sparse, this subdominant component can
lead to observable effects, since leptonic decays of technibaryons $UU$ give rise to two positively
charged leptons contrary to the pairs of opposite charge leptons created in decays of neutral particles.
We show that decays of $UU^{++}\rightarrow e^+ e^+, \mu^+ \mu^+, \tau^+ \tau^+$ of the subdominant
$UU\zeta$ component of dark matter, can explain the observed high energy positron excess in the
cosmic rays if the fraction of $UU\zeta$ is $\sim 10^{-6}$ of the total dark matter density, the mass
of $UU^{++}$ about 1 TeV and the lifetime about $10^{20} $s. Optimizing fit of recent AMS-02 data
by model parameters, the predicted mass range of such long-living double charge particle is challenging
for its search at the LHC. (abridged)
