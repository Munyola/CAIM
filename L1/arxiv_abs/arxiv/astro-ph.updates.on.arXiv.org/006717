Models of core accretion assume that in the radiative zones of accreting gas envelopes, radiation
diffuses. But super-Earths/sub-Neptunes (1-4$R_\oplus$, 2-20$M_\oplus$) point to formation
conditions that are optically thin: their modest gas masses are accreted from short-lived and gas-poor
nebulae reminiscent of the transparent cavities of transitional disks. Planetary atmospheres
born in such environments can be optically thin to both incident starlight and internally generated
thermal radiation. We construct time-dependent models of such atmospheres, showing that super-Earths/sub-Neptunes
can accrete their $\sim$1%-by-mass gas envelopes, and super-puffs/sub-Saturns their $\sim$20%-by-mass
envelopes, over a wide range of nebular depletion histories requiring no fine tuning. Although
nascent atmospheres can exhibit stratospheric temperature inversions effected by atomic Fe and
various oxides that absorb strongly at visible wavelengths, the rate of gas accretion remains controlled
by the radiative-convective boundary (rcb) at much greater pressures. For dusty envelopes, the
temperature at the rcb $T_{\rm rcb} \simeq 2500$ K is still set by ${\rm H}_2$ dissociation; for dust-depleted
envelopes, $T_{\rm rcb}$ tracks the temperature of the visible or thermal photosphere, whichever
is deeper, out to at least $\sim$5 AU. The rate of envelope growth remains largely unchanged between
the old radiative diffusion models and the new optically thin models, reinforcing how robustly
super-Earths form as part of the endgame chapter in disk evolution.
