By using a novel interface between the modern smoothed particle hydrodynamics code GASOLINE2 and
the chemistry package KROME, we follow the hydrodynamical and chemical evolution of an isolated
galaxy. In order to assess the relevance of different physical parameters and prescriptions, we
constructed a suite of ten simulations, in which we vary the chemical network (primordial and metal
species), how metal cooling is modelled (non-equilibrium versus equilibrium; optically thin
versus thick approximation), the initial gas metallicity (from ten to hundred per cent solar),
and how molecular hydrogen forms on dust. This is the first work in which metal injection from supernovae,
turbulent metal diffusion, and a metal network with non-equilibrium metal cooling are self-consistently
included in a galaxy simulation. We find that properly modelling the chemical evolution of several
metal species and the corresponding non-equilibrium metal cooling has important effects on the
thermodynamics of the gas, the chemical abundances, and the appearance of the galaxy: the gas is
typically warmer, has a larger molecular gas mass fraction, and has a smoother disc. We also conclude
that, at relatively high metallicity, the choice of molecular-hydrogen formation rates on dust
is not crucial. Moreover, we confirm that a higher initial metallicity produces a colder gas and
a larger fraction of molecular gas, with the low-metallicity simulation best matching the observed
molecular Kennicutt-Schmidt relation. Finally, our simulations agree quite well with observations
which link star formation rate to metal emission lines.
