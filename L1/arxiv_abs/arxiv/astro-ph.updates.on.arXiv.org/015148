Chondrules are silicate spheroids found in meteorites, serving as important fossil records of
the early solar system. In order to form chondrules, chondrule precursors must be heated to temperatures
much higher than the typical conditions in the current asteroid belt. One proposed mechanism for
chondrule heating is the passage through bow shocks of highly eccentric planetesimals in the protoplanetary
disk in the early solar system. However, it is difficult for planetesimals to gain and maintain such
high eccentricities. In this paper, we present a new scenario in which planetesimals in the asteroid
belt region are excited to high eccentricities by the Jovian sweeping secular resonance in a depleting
disk, leading to efficient formation of chondrules. We study the orbital evolution of planetesimals
in the disk using semi-analytic models and numerical simulations. We investigate the dependence
of eccentricity excitation on the planetesimal's size as well as the physical environment, and
calculate the probability for chondrule formation. We find that 50 - 2000 km planetesimals can obtain
eccentricities larger than 0.6 and cause effective chondrule heating. Most chondrules form in
high velocity shocks, in low density gas, and in the inner disk. The fraction of chondrule precursors
which become chondrules is about 4 - 9 % between 1.5 - 3 AU. Our model implies that the disk depletion
timescale is $\tau_\mathrm{dep}\approx 1~\mathrm{Myr}$, comparable to the age spread of chondrules;
and that Jupiter formed before chondrules, no more than 0.7 Myr after the formation of the CAIs.
