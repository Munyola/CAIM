Early dynamical evolution of close-in planetary systems is shaped by an intricate combination
of planetary gravitational interactions, orbital migration, and dissipative effects. While
the process of convergent orbital migration is expected to routinely yield resonant planetary
systems, previous analyses have shown that the semi-major axes of initially resonant pairs of planets
will gradually diverge under the influence of long-term energy damping, producing an overabundance
of planetary period ratios in slight excess of exact commensurability. While this feature is clearly
evident in the orbital distribution of close-in extrasolar planets, the existing theoretical
picture is limited to the specific case of the planetary three-body problem. In this study, we generalise
the framework of dissipative divergence of resonant orbits to multi-resonant chains, and apply
our results to the current observational census of well-characterised three-planet systems.
Focusing on the 2:1 and 3:2 commensurabilities, we identify three 3-planet systems, whose current
orbital architecture is consistent with an evolutionary history wherein convergent migration
first locks the planets into a multi-resonant configuration and subsequent dissipation repels
the orbits away from exact commensurability. Nevertheless, we find that the architecture of the
overall sample of multi planetary systems is incompatible with this simple scenario, suggesting
that additional physical mechanisms must play a dominant role during the early stages of planetary
systems' dynamical evolution.
