Extended narrow-line regions (NLRs) around active galactic nuclei (AGN) are shaped by the distribution
of gas in the host galaxy and by the geometry of the circumnuclear obscuration, and thus they can be
used to test the AGN unification model. In this work, we quantify the morphologies of the narrow-line
regions in 308 nearby AGNs ($z=0-0.14$, \lbol $\sim 10^{42.4-44.1}$ \erg{}) from the MaNGA survey.
Based on the narrow-line region maps, we find that a large fraction (81\%) of these AGN have bi-conical
NLR morphology. The distribution of their measured opening angles suggests that the intrinsic
opening angles of the ionization cones has a mean value of 85--98$^\circ$ with a finite spread of
39-44$^\circ$ (1-$\sigma$). Our inferred opening angle distribution implies a number ratio of
type I to type II AGN of 1:1.6--2.3, consistent with other measurements of the type I / type II ratio
at low AGN luminosities. Combining these measurements with the WISE photometry data, we find that
redder mid-IR color (lower effective temperature of dust) corresponds to stronger and narrower
photo-ionized bicones. This relation is in agreement with the unification model that suggests
that the bi-conical narrow-line regions are shaped by a toroidal dusty structure within a few pc
from the AGN. Furthermore, we find a significant alignment between the minor axis of host galaxy
disks and AGN ionization cones. Together, these findings suggest that obscuration on both circumnuclear
($\sim $pc) and galactic ($\sim$ kpc) scales are important in shaping and orienting the AGN narrow-line
regions.
