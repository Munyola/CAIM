We investigate the chemical and kinematic properties of the diffuse stellar haloes of six simulated
Milky Way-like galaxies from the Aquarius Project. Binding energy criteria are adopted to defined
two dynamically distinct stellar populations: the diffuse inner and outer haloes, which comprise
different stellar sub-populations with particular chemical and kinematic characteristics.
Our simulated inner- and outer-halo stellar populations have received contributions from debris
stars (formed in sub-galactic systems while they were outside the virial radius of the main progenitor
galaxies) and endo-debris stars (those formed in gas-rich sub-galactic systems inside the dark
matter haloes). The inner haloes possess an additional contribution from disc-heated stars in
the range $\sim 3 - 30 %$, with a mean of $\sim 20% $. Disc-heated stars might exhibit signatures of
kinematical support, in particular among the youngest ones. Endo-debris plus disc-heated stars
define the so-called \insitu stellar populations. In both the inner- and outer-halo stellar populations,
we detect contributions from stars with moderate to low [$\alpha$/Fe] ratios, mainly associated
with the endo-debris or disc-heated sub-populations. The observed abundance gradients in the
inner-halo regions are influenced by both the level of chemical enrichment and the relative contributions
from each stellar sub-population. Steeper abundance gradients in the inner-halo regions are related
to contributions from the disc-heated and endo-debris stars, which tend to be found at lower binding
energies than debris stars. (Abridged).
