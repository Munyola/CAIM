We assess the effects of super-massive black hole (SMBH) environments on the gravitational-wave
(GW) signal from binary SMBHs. To date, searches with pulsar timing arrays for GWs from binary SMBHs,
in the frequency band $\sim1-100$\,nHz, include the assumptions that all binaries are circular
and evolve only through GW emission. However, dynamical studies have shown that the only way that
binary SMBH orbits can decay to separations where GW emission dominates the evolution is through
interactions with their environments. We augment an existing galaxy and SMBH formation and evolution
model with calculations of binary SMBH evolution in stellar environments, accounting for non-zero
binary eccentricities. We find that coupling between binaries and their environments causes the
expected GW spectral energy distribution to be reduced with respect to the standard assumption
of circular, GW-driven binaries, for frequencies up to $\sim20$\,nHz. Larger eccentricities
at binary formation further reduce the signal in this regime. We also find that GW bursts from individual
eccentric binary SMBHs are unlikely to be detectable with current pulsar timing arrays. The uncertainties
in these predictions are large, owing to observational uncertainty in SMBH-galaxy scaling relations
and the galaxy stellar mass function, uncertainty in the nature of binary-environment coupling,
and uncertainty in the numbers of the most massive binary SMBHs. We conclude, however, that low-frequency
GWs from binary SMBHs may be more difficult to detect with pulsar timing arrays than currently thought.
