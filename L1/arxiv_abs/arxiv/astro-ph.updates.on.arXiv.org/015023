The detection of gravitational waves from the binary neutron star merger GW170817, alongside its
optical counterpart, marked the beginning of gravitational wave cosmology as it allowed for the
first constraint on the Hubble constant $H_0$ using gravitational wave standard sirens. For the
case where a merger does not have an optical counterpart, it is possible to pursue an analysis in which
the gravitational wave distance estimate for each merger is combined with the redshift data from
all the galaxies in the event's localization volume to estimate $H_0$. A Bayesian formalism has
been developed which estimates the Hubble constant from gravitational wave events both with electromagnetic
counterparts, and using galaxy catalogs to provide redshift information in the non-counterpart
case. It combines these analyses to make the most of the information available. We perform a series
of mock data challenges in order to test our implementation of this formalism, with focus on accounting
for gravitational wave and electromagnetic selection effects. These mock data challenges use
a simplified universe, neglecting large scale structure, peculiar velocities, and redshift uncertainties.
Galaxy catalog incompleteness is modeled with an apparent magnitude threshold. We explore how
the incompleteness of galaxy catalogs has an effect on the final measurement of $H_0$ as well as the
effects of weighting each galaxy according to its luminosity. Under these assumptions we demonstrate
that we successfully recover an unbiased estimate of $H_0$.
