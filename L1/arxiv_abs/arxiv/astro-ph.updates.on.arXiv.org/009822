The HR 8799 system uniquely harbors four young super-Jupiters whose orbits can provide insights
into the system's dynamical history and constrain the masses of the planets themselves. Using the
Gemini Planet Imager (GPI), we obtained down to one milliarcsecond precision on the astrometry
of these planets. We assessed four-planet orbit models with different levels of constraints and
found that assuming the planets are near 1:2:4:8 period commensurabilities, or are coplanar, does
not worsen the fit. We added the prior that the planets must have been stable for the age of the system
(40 Myr) by running orbit configurations from our posteriors through $N$-body simulations and
varying the masses of the planets. We found that only assuming the planets are both coplanar and near
1:2:4:8 period commensurabilities produces dynamically stable orbits in large quantities. Our
posterior of stable coplanar orbits tightly constrains the planets' orbits, and we discuss implications
for the outermost planet b shaping the debris disk. A four-planet resonance lock is not necessary
for stability up to now. However, planet pairs d and e, and c and d, are each likely locked in two-body
resonances for stability if their component masses are above $6~M_{\rm{Jup}}$ and $7~M_{\rm{Jup}}$,
respectively. Combining the dynamical and luminosity constraints on the masses using hot-start
evolutionary models and a system age of $42 \pm 5$~Myr, we found the mass of planet b to be $5.8 \pm 0.5~M_{\rm{Jup}}$,
and the masses of planets c, d, and e to be $7.2_{-0.7}^{+0.6}~M_{\rm{Jup}}$ each.
