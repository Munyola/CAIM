We analyze the radial and vertical metallicity and [alpha/Fe] gradients of the disk stars of a disk
galaxy simulated in a fully cosmological setting with the chemodynamical galaxy evolution code,
GCD+. We study how the radial abundance gradients vary as a function of height above the plane and
find that the metallicity ([alpha/Fe]) gradient becomes more positive (negative) with increasing
height, changing sign around 1.5 kpc above the plane. At the largest vertical height (2 < |z| <
3 kpc), our simulated galaxy shows a positive radial metallicity gradient. We find that the positive
metallicity gradient is caused by the age-metallicity and age-velocity dispersion relation,
where the younger stars have higher metallicity and lower velocity dispersion. Due to the age-velocity
dispersion relation, a greater fraction of younger stars reach |z| > 2 kpc at the outer region,
because of the lower gravitational restoring force of the disk, i.e. flaring. As a result, the fraction
of younger stars with higher metallicity due to the age-metallicity relation becomes higher at
the outer radii, which makes the median metallicity higher at the outer radii. Combining this result
with the recently observed age-metallicity and age-velocity dispersion relation for the Milky
Way thick disk stars suggested by Haywood et al. (2013), we argue that the observed (small) positive
radial metallicity gradient at large heights of the Milky Way disk stars can be explained by the flaring
of the younger thick and/or thin disk stars.
