We explore the multiphase structure of the circumgalactic medium (CGM) probed by synthetic spectra
through a cosmological zoom-in galaxy formation simulation. We employ a Bayesian method for modelling
a combination of absorption lines to derive physical properties of absorbers with a formal treatment
of detections, including saturated systems, and non-detections in a uniform manner. We find that
in the lines of sight passing through localized density structures, absorption lines of low, intermediate
and high ions are present in the spectrum and overlap in velocity space. Low, intermediate and high
ions can be combined to derive the mass-weighted properties of a density-varying peak, although
the ions are not co-spatial within the structure. By contrast, lines of sight that go through the
hot halo only exhibit detectable HI and high ions. In such lines of sight, the absorption lines are
typically broad due to the complex velocity fields across the entire halo. We show that the derived
gas density, temperature, and metallicity match closely the corresponding HI mass-weighted averages
along the LOS. We also show that when the data quality allows, our Bayesian technique allows one to
recover the underlying physical properties of LOS by incorporating both detections and non-detections.
It is especially useful to include non-detections, of species such as NV or NeVIII, when the number
of detections of strong absorbers, such as HI and OVI, is smaller than the number of model parameters
(density, temperature, and metallicity).
