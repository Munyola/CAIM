We consider the prospects for detecting solar-like oscillations in the "super-Nyquist" regime
of long-cadence (LC) Kepler photometry, i.e., above the associated Nyquist frequency of approximately
283 {\mu}Hz. Targets of interest are cool, evolved subgiants and stars lying at the base of the red-giant
branch. These stars would ordinarily be studied using the short-cadence (SC) data, since the associated
SC Nyquist frequency lies well above the frequencies of the detectable oscillations. However,
the number of available SC target slots is quite limited. This imposes a severe restriction on the
size of the ensemble available for SC asteroseismic study.We find that archival Kepler LC data from
the nominal Mission may be utilized for asteroseismic studies of targets whose dominant oscillation
frequencies lie as high as approximately 500 {\mu}Hz, i.e., about 1.75- times the LC Nyquist frequency.
The frequency detection threshold for the shorter-duration science campaigns of the re-purposed
Kepler Mission, K2, is lower. The maximum threshold will probably lie somewhere between approximately
400 and 450 {\mu}Hz. The potential to exploit the archival Kepler and K2 LC data in this manner opens
the door to increasing significantly the number of subgiant and low-luminosity red-giant targets
amenable to asteroseismic analysis, overcoming target limitations imposed by the small number
of SC slots.We estimate that around 400 such targets are now available for study in the Kepler LC archive.
That number could potentially be a lot higher for K2, since there will be a new target list for each
of its campaigns.
