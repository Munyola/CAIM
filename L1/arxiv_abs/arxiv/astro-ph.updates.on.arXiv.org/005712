Plate tectonics is a geophysical process currently unique to Earth, has an important role in regulating
the Earth's climate, and may be better understood by identifying rocky planets outside our solar
system with tectonic activity. The key criterion for whether or not plate tectonics may occur on
a terrestrial planet is if the stress on a planet's lithosphere from mantle convection may overcome
the lithosphere's yield stress. Although many rocky exoplanets closely orbiting their host stars
have been detected, all studies to date of plate tectonics on exoplanets have neglected tidal stresses
in the planet's lithosphere. Modeling a rocky exoplanet as a constant density, homogeneous, incompressible
sphere, we show the tidal stress from the host star acting on close-in planets may become comparable
to the stress on the lithosphere from mantle convection. We also show that tidal stresses from planet-planet
interactions are unlikely to be significant for plate tectonics, but may be strong enough to trigger
Earthquakes. Our work may imply planets orbiting close to their host stars are more likely to experience
plate tectonics, with implications for exoplanetary geophysics and habitability. We produce
a list of detected rocky exoplanets under the most intense stresses. Atmospheric and topographic
observations may confirm our predictions in the near future. Investigations of planets with significant
tidal stress can not only lead to observable parameters linked to the presence of active plate tectonics,
but may also be used as a tool to test theories on the main driving force behind tectonic activity.
