We use the deep CANDELS observations in the GOODS North and South fields to revisit the correlations
between stellar mass ($M_*$), star--formation rate (SFR) and morphology, and to introduce a fourth
dimension, the mass-weighted stellar age, in galaxies at $1.2<z<4$. We do this by making new measures
of $M_*$, $SFR$, and stellar age thanks to an improved SED fitting procedure that allows various
star formation history for each galaxy. Like others, we find that the slope of the Main Sequence (MS)
of star formation in the $(M_*;SFR)$ plane bends at high mass. We observe clear morphological differences
among galaxies across the MS, which also correlate with stellar age. At all redshifts, galaxies
that are quenching or quenched, and thus old, have high $\Sigma_1$ (the projected density within
the central 1 kpc), while younger, star-forming galaxies span a much broader range of $\Sigma_1$,
which includes the high values observed for quenched galaxies, but also extends to much lower values.
As galaxies age and quench, the stellar age and the dispersion of $\Sigma_1$ for fixed values of $M_{*}$
shows two different regimes, one, at the low--mass end, where quenching might be driven by causes
external to the galaxies; the other, at the high--mass end, where quenching is driven by internal
causes, very likely the mass given the low scatter of $\Sigma_1$ (mass quenching). We suggest that
the monotonic increase of central density as galaxies grow is one manifestation of a more general
phenomenon of structural transformation that galaxies undergo as they evolve.
