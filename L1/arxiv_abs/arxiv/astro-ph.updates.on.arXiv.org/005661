Cosmology has entered an era where the experimental limitations are not due to instrumental sensitivity
but instead due to inherent systematic uncertainties in the instrumentation and data analysis
methods. The field of HI intensity mapping (IM) is still maturing, however early attempts are already
systematics limited. One such systematic limitation is 1/f noise, which largely originates within
the instrumentation and manifests as multiplicative gain fluctuations. To date there has been
little discussion about the possible impact of 1/f noise on upcoming single-dish HI IM experiments
such as BINGO, FAST or SKA. Presented in this work are Monte-Carlo end-to-end simulations of a 30
day HI IM survey using the SKA-MID array covering a bandwidth of 950 and 1410 MHz. These simulations
extend 1/f noise models to include not just temporal fluctuations but also correlated gain fluctuations
across the receiver bandpass. The power spectral density of the spectral gain fluctuations are
modelled as a power-law, and characterised by a parameter $\beta$. It is found that the degree of
1/f noise frequency correlation will be critical to the success of HI IM experiments. Small values
of $\beta$ ($\beta$ < 0.25) or high correlation is preferred as this is more easily removed using
current component separation techniques. The spectral index of temporal fluctuations ($\alpha$)
is also found to have a large impact on signal-to-noise. Telescope slew speed has a smaller impact,
and a scan speed of 1 deg s$^{-1}$ should be sufficient for a HI IM survey with the SKA.
