VV124 (UGC 4879) is an isolated, dwarf irregular/dwarf spheroidal (dIrr/dSph) transition-type
galaxy at a distance of 1.36 Mpc. Previous low-resolution spectroscopy yielded inconsistent radial
velocities for different components of the galaxy, and photometry hinted at the presence of a stellar
disk. In order to quantify the stellar dynamics, we observed individual red giants in VV124 with
the Keck/DEIMOS spectrograph. We validated members based on their positions in the color-magnitude
diagram, radial velocities, and spectral features. Our sample contains 67 members. The average
radial velocity is <v_r> = -29.1 +/- 1.3 km/s, in agreement with the previous radio measurements
of HI gas. The velocity distribution is Gaussian, indicating that VV124 is supported primarily
by velocity dispersion inside a radius of 1.5 kpc. Outside that radius, our measurements provide
only an upper limit of 8.6 km/s on any rotation in the photometric disk-like feature. The velocity
dispersion is sigma_v = 9.4 +/- 1.0 km/s, from which we inferred a mass of M_1/2 = (2.1 +/- 0.2) x 10^7
M_sun and a mass-to-light ratio of (M/L_V)_1/2 = 5.2 +/- 1.1 M_sun/L_sun, both measured within the
half-light radius. Thus, VV124 contains dark matter. We also measured the metallicity distribution
from neutral iron lines. The average metallicity, <[Fe/H]> = -1.58 +/- 0.06, is consistent
with the mass-metallicity relation defined by dwarf spheroidal galaxies. The dynamics and metallicity
distribution of VV124 appear similar to dSphs of similar stellar mass.
