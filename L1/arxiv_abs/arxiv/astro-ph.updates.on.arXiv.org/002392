In the solar system, moons largely exceed planets in number. The Kepler database has been shown to
be sensitive to exomoon detection down to the mass of Mars, but the first search has been unsuccessful.
Here, we use a particles-in-cell code to predict the transit of the plasma torus produced by a satellite.
Despite the small size of a moon, the spatial extent of its plasma torus can be large enough to produce
substantial transit absorptions. The model is used for the interpretation of Hubble Space Telescope
early ingress absorptions apparently observed during WASP-12b and HD 189733b UV transits for which
no consistent explanation exists. For HD 189733b an exomoon transiting $\sim 16$ $R_p$ ahead of
the planet and loading $\sim 10^{29}$ C II ions/s into space is required to explain the tentative
early ingress absorption observed for C II. For WASP-12b, a moon transiting $\sim 6$ $R_p$ ahead
from the planet and ejecting $\sim 10^{28}$ Mg II ions per second is required to explain the NUV early
ingress absorption feature. Interestingly, both HD 189733b and WASP-12b predicted satellites
are outside the Hill sphere of their planets, an indication that the moons, if present, were not formed
in situ but probably captured later. Finally, our simulations show a strong electromagnetic coupling
between the polar regions of planets and the orbital position of the moons, an expected outcome of
the unipolar induction DC circuit model. Future observations should test our predictions with
a potential opportunity to unambiguously detect the first exomoon plasma torus.
