Accurate measurements of galaxy masses and sizes are key to tracing galaxy evolution over time.
Cosmological zoom-in simulations provide an ideal test bed for assessing the recovery of galaxy
properties from observations. Here, we utilize galaxies with $M_*\sim10^{10}-10^{11.5}M_{\odot}$
at z~1.7-2 from the MassiveFIRE cosmological simulation suite, part of the Feedback in Realistic
Environments (FIRE) project. Using mock multi-band images, we compare intrinsic galaxy masses
and sizes to observational estimates. We find that observations accurately recover stellar masses,
with a slight average underestimate of ~0.06 dex and a ~0.15 dex scatter. Recovered half-light radii
agree well with intrinsic half-mass radii when averaged over all viewing angles, with a systematic
offset of ~0.1 dex (with the half-light radii being larger) and a scatter of ~0.2 dex. When using color
gradients to account for mass-to-light variations, recovered half-mass radii also exceed the
intrinsic half-mass radii by ~0.1 dex. However, if not properly accounted for, aperture effects
can bias size estimates by ~0.1 dex. No differences are found between the mass and size offsets for
star-forming and quiescent galaxies. Variations in viewing angle are responsible for ~25% of the
scatter in the recovered masses and sizes. Our results thus suggest that the intrinsic scatter in
the mass-size relation may have previously been overestimated by ~25%. Moreover, orientation-driven
scatter causes the number density of very massive galaxies to be overestimated by ~0.5 dex at $M_*\sim10^{11.5}M_{\odot}$.
