We propose that Gigahertz Peak Spectrum (GPS) and Compact Steep Spectrum (CSS) radio sources are
the signposts of relativistic jet feedback in evolving galaxies. Our simulations of relativistic
jets interacting with a warm, inhomogeneous medium, utilize cloud densities and velocity dispersions
in the range derived from optical observations, show that free-free absorption can account for
the $\sim \rm GHz$ peak frequencies and low frequency power laws inferred from the radio observations.
These new computational models replace the power-law model for the free-free optical depth in the
\citep{bicknell97a} model by a more fundamental model involving disrupted log-normal distributions
of warm gas. One feature of our new models is that at early stages, the low frequency spectrum is steep
but progressively flattens as a result of a broader distribution of optical depths, suggesting
that the steep low frequency spectra discovered by \citet{callingham17a} may possibly be attributed
to young sources. We also investigate the inverse correlation between peak frequency and size and
find that the initial location on this correlation is determined by the average density of the warm
ISM. The simulated sources track this correlation initially but eventually fall below it, indicating
the need for a more extended ISM than presently modelled. GPS and CSS sources can potentially provide
new insights into the phenomenon of AGN feedback since their peak frequencies and spectra are indicative
of the density, turbulent structure and distribution of gas in the host galaxy.
