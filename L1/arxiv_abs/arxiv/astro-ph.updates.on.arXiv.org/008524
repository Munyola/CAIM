Observations of Kuiper belt objects (KBOs) in Neptune's 5:2 resonance present two puzzles: this
third order resonance hosts a surprisingly large population, comparable to the prominent populations
of Plutinos and Twotinos in the first order 3:2 and 2:1 resonances, respectively; secondly, their
eccentricities are concentrated near $0.4$. To shed light on these puzzles, we investigate the
phase space near this resonance with use of Poincar\'e sections of the circular planar restricted
three body model. We find several transitions in the phase space structure with increasing eccentricity,
which we explain with the properties of the resonant orbit relative to Neptune's. The resonance
width is narrow for very small eccentricities, but widens dramatically for $e\gtrsim0.2$, reaching
a maximum near $e\approx0.4$, where it is similar to the maximum widths of the 2:1 and 3:2 resonances.
We confirm these results with N-body numerical simulations, including the effects of all four giant
planets and a wide range of orbital inclinations of the KBOs. We find that the boundaries of the stable
resonance zone are not strongly sensitive to inclination and remain very similar to those found
with the simplified three body model, with the caveat that orbits of eccentricity above $\sim0.53$
are unstable; higher eccentricity orbits are phase-protected from destabilizing encounters
with Neptune but not with Uranus. These results show that the 5:2 resonant KBOs are not more puzzling
than the Plutinos and Twotinos; however, detailed understanding of the origins of eccentric, inclined
resonant KBOs remains a challenge.
