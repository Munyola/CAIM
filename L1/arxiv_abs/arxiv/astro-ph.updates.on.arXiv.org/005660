We studied the central regions of the Galactic Centre to determine if the CircumNuclear Disk (CND)
acts as an absorber or a barrier for the central X-rays diffuse emission. After reprocessing 4.6Ms
of Chandra observations, we were able to detect, for the first time, a depression in the X-ray luminosity
of the diffuse emission whose size and location correspond to those of the CND. We extracted the X-ray
spectra for various regions inside the CND footprint as well as for the region where the footprint
is observed and for a region located outside the footprint. We simultaneously fitted these spectra
as an optically thin plasma whose absorption by the interstellar medium and by the local plasma were
fitted independently using the MCMC method. The hydrogen column density of the ISM is 7.5x10^22
cm^-2. The X-ray diffuse emission inside the CND footprint is formed by a 2T plasma of 1 and 4keV with
slightly super-solar abundances except for the iron and carbon which are sub-solar. The plasma
from the CND, in turn, is better described by a 1T model with abundances and local hydrogen column
density which are very different to those of the innermost regions. The large iron abundance in this
region confirms that the CND is dominated by the shock-heated ejecta of the Sgr A East supernova remnant.
We deduced that the CND rather acts as a barrier for the Galactic Centre plasma and that the plasma
located outside the CND may correspond to the collimated outflow possibly created by Sgr A* or the
interaction between the wind of massive stars and the mini-spiral material.
