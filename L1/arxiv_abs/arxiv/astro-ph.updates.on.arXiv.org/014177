We report Arecibo 21 cm absorption-emission observations to characterise the physical properties
of neutral hydrogen (HI) in the proximity of five giant molecular clouds (GMCs): Taurus, California,
Rosette, Mon OB1, and NGC 2264. Strong HI absorption was detected toward all 79 background continuum
sources in the ~60x20 square degree region. Gaussian decompositions were performed to estimate
temperatures, optical depths and column densities of the cold and warm neutral medium (CNM, WNM).
The properties of individual CNM components are similar to those previously observed along random
Galactic sightlines and in the vicinity of GMCs, suggesting a universality of cold HI properties.
The CNM spin temperature (Ts) histogram peaks at ~50K. The turbulent Mach numbers of CNM vary widely,
with a typical value of ~4, indicating that their motions are supersonic. About 60% of the total HI
gas is WNM, and nearly 40% of the WNM lies in thermally unstable regime 500-5000K. The observed CNM
fraction is higher around GMCs than in diffuse regions, and increases with increasing column density
(NHI) to a maximum of ~75%. On average, the optically thin approximation (N*(HI)) underestimates
the total N(HI) by ~21%, but we find large regional differences in the relationship between N(HI)
and the required correction factor, f=N(HI)/N*(HI). We examine two different methods (linear
fit of f vs log10(N*(HI)) and uniform Ts) to correct for opacity effects using emission data from
the GALFA-HI survey. We prefer the uniform Ts method, since the linear relationship does not produce
convincing fits for all subregions.
