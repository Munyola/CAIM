We study the scaling relations between the baryonic content and total mass of groups of galaxies,
as these systems provide a unique way to examine the role of non-gravitational processes in structure
formation. Using Planck and ROSAT data, we conduct detailed comparisons of the stacked thermal
Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ) effect and X-ray scaling relations of galaxy groups found in the the Galaxy
And Mass Assembly (GAMA) survey and the BAHAMAS hydrodynamical simulation. We use weak gravitational
lensing data from the Kilo Degree Survey (KiDS) to determine the average halo mass of the studied
systems. We analyse the simulation in the same way, using realistic weak lensing, X-ray, and tSZ
synthetic observations. Furthermore, to keep selection biases under control, we employ exactly
the same galaxy selection and group identification procedures to the observations and simulation.
Applying this careful comparison, we find that the simulations are in agreement with the observations,
particularly with regards to the scaling relations of the lensing and tSZ results. This finding
demonstrates that hydrodynamical simulation have reached the level of realism that is required
to interpret observational survey data and study the baryon physics within dark matter haloes,
where analytical modelling is challenging. Finally, using simulated data, we demonstrate that
our observational processing of the X-ray and tSZ signals is free of significant biases. We find
that our optical group selection procedure has, however, some room for improvement.
