The Juno Orbiter is measuring the three-dimensional gravity field perturbation of Jupiter induced
by its rapid rotation, zonal flows, and tidal response to its major natural satellites. This paper
aims to provide the contributions to the tesseral harmonics coefficients Cnm, Snm, and the Love
numbers knm to be expected from static tidal response in the gravity field of rotating Jupiter. For
that purpose, we apply the method of Concentric Maclaurin Ellipsoids (CMS). As we are interested
in the variation of the tidal potential with the longitudes of the moons, we take into account the
simultaneous presence of the satellites Io, Europa, and Ganymede. We assume co-planar, circular
orbits with normals parallel to Jupiter's spin axis. The planet-centered longitude of Io in the
three-moon case is arbitrarily assumed varphi = 0. Under these assumptions we find maximum amplitudes
and fluctuations of 3.5 times 10^-8 +- 15% for C22. For the Love numbers, largest variation of 10%
to 20% is seen in k42 and k62, whereas the values k2, k33, and k44 fall into narrow ranges of 0.1% uncertainty
or less. In particular, we find k2=k2,Io(1 +- 0.02%) where k2,Io=0.5897 is the static tidal response
to lone Io. Our obtained gravity field perturbation leads to a maximum equatorial shape deformation
of up to 28m. We suggest that should Juno measurements of the knm deviate from those values, it may
be due to dynamic or dissipative effects on Jupiter's tidal response. Finally, an analytic expression
is provided to calculate the tesseral harmonics contribution from static tidal response for any
configuration of the satellites.
