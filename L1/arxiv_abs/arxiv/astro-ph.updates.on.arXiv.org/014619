We report lensing magnifications, extinction, and time-delay estimates for the first resolved,
multiply-imaged Type Ia supernova iPTF16geu, at $z = 0.409$, using $Hubble\,Space\,Telescope$
($HST$) observations in combination with supporting ground-based data. Multi-band photometry
of the resolved images provides unique information about the differential dimming due to dust in
the lensing galaxy. Using $HST$ and Keck AO reference images taken after the SN faded, we obtain a
total lensing magnification for iPTF16geu of $\mu = 67.8^{+2.6}_{-2.9}$, accounting for extinction
in the host and lensing galaxy. As expected from the symmetry of the system, we measure very short
time-delays for the three fainter images with respect to the brightest one: -0.23 $\pm$ 0.99, -1.43
$\pm$ 0.74 and 1.36 $\pm$ 1.07 days. Interestingly, we find large differences between the magnifications
of the four supernova images, even after accounting for uncertainties in the extinction corrections:
$\Delta m_1 = -3.88^{+0.07}_{-0.06}$, $\Delta m_2 = -2.99^{+0.09}_{-0.08}$, $\Delta m_3 = -2.19^{+0.14}_{-0.15}$
and $\Delta m_4 = -2.40^{+0.14}_{-0.12}$ mag, discrepant with model predictions suggesting similar
image brightnesses. A possible explanation for the large differences is gravitational lensing
by substructures, micro- or millilensing, in addition to the large scale lens causing the image
separations. We find that the inferred magnification is insensitive to the assumptions about the
dust properties in the host and lens galaxy.
