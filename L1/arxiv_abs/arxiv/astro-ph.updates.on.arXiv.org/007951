We explore the effect of momentum-driven winds representing radiation pressure driven outflows
from accretion onto supermassive black holes in a set of numerical hydrodynamical simulations.
We explore two matched sets of cosmological zoom-in runs of 24 halos with masses ~$10^{12.0}-10^{13.4}$
M_sun run with two different feedback models. Our `NoAGN' model includes stellar feedback via UV
heating, stellar winds and supernovae, photoelectric heating and cosmic X-ray background heating
from a meta-galactic background. Our fiducial `MrAGN' model is identical except that it also includes
a model for black hole seeding and accretion, as well as heating and momentum injection associated
with the radiation from black hole accretion. Our MrAGN model launches galactic outflows which
result in both `ejective' feedback - the outflows themselves which drive gas out of galaxies - and
`preventative' feedback, which suppresses the inflow of new and recycling gas. As much as 80 % of
outflowing galactic gas can be expelled, and accretion can be suppressed by as much as a factor of
30 in the MrAGN runs when compared with the NoAGN runs. The histories of NoAGN galaxies are recycling-dominated,
with ~70% of material that leaves the galaxy eventually returning, and the majority of outflowing
gas re-accretes on 1 Gyr timescales without AGN feedback. Outflowing gas in the MrAGN runs has higher
characteristic velocity (500 - 1,000 km/s versus 100-300 km/s for outflowing NoAGN gas) and travels
as far as a few Mpcs. Only ~10% of ejected material is re-accreted in the MrAGN galaxies.
