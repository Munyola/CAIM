In this paper, we present some correlations of neutral hydrogen HI gas and physical properties of
galaxies to investigate the role of atomic gas in governing galaxy evolution. We build a HI-detected
sample including 70 galaxies that are detected by ALFALFA in a 15 deg$^2$ region, and derive their
star formation distribution based on the images of $\rm H\alpha$ narrow-band observed here. In
general, HI-detected galaxies have low surface density of stellar mass and active star formation.
Additionally, most of the galaxies are in good agreement with the star-forming main sequence, consistent
with the previous findings. We confirm the dependence of star formation (SF) in galaxies on HI gas
at least on global scale, i.e., star formation rate (SFR) generally increases with HI mass, specific
star formation rate (SSFR$\equiv$SFR/M$_*$) increases with HI fraction ($f_{HI}$) even for a
given stellar mass, and \hi-based star formation efficiency (SFE) mildly increases with the stellar
mass and SFR surface density. Based on the distribution of stellar mass and star formation, we calculate
the morphology indices of the sample, and analyze the dependence of $f_{HI}$ and SFE on them. The
weak correlations between SFE and morphological indexes imply a weak physical link between HI and
star formation in small scale. We find that $f_{HI}$ mildly increases with the asymmetry and decreases
with the concentration of galaxies, suggesting that the HI gas supply and its effect are likely correlated
with external processes in the extended disks of galaxies.
