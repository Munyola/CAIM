The Chromospheric Lyman Alpha Spectropolarimeter (CLASP) observed the Sun in H I Lyman-{\alpha}
during a suborbital rocket flight on September 3, 2015. The Interface Region Imaging Telescope
(IRIS) coordinated with the CLASP observations and recorded nearly simultaneous and co-spatial
observations in the Mg II h&k lines. The Mg II h and Ly-{\alpha} lines are important transitions,
energetically and diagnostically, in the chromosphere. The canonical solar atmosphere model
predicts that these lines form in close proximity to each other and so we expect that the line profiles
will exhibit similar variability. In this analysis, we present these coordinated observations
and discuss how the two profiles compare over a region of quiet sun at viewing angles that approach
the limb. In addition to the observations, we synthesize both line profiles using a 3D radiation-MHD
simulation. In the observations, we find that the peak width and the peak intensities are well correlated
between the lines. For the simulation, we do not find the same relationship. We have attempted to
mitigate the instrumental differences between IRIS and CLASP and to reproduce the instrumental
factors in the synthetic profiles. The model indicates that formation heights of the lines differ
in a somewhat regular fashion related to magnetic geometry. This variation explains to some degree
the lack of correlation, observed and synthesized, between Mg II and Ly-{\alpha}. Our analysis
will aid in the definition of future observatories that aim to link dynamics in the chromosphere
and transition region.
