Powerful relativistic jets are one of the main ways in which accreting black holes provide kinetic
feedback to their surroundings. Jets launched from or redirected by the accretion flow that powers
them should be affected by the dynamics of the flow, which in accreting stellar-mass black holes
has shown increasing evidence for precession due to frame dragging effects that occur when the black
hole spin axis is misaligned with the orbital plane of its companion star. Recently, theoretical
simulations have suggested that the jets can exert an additional torque on the accretion flow, although
the full interplay between the dynamics of the accretion flow and the launching of the jets is not
yet understood. Here we report a rapidly changing jet orientation on a timescale of minutes to hours
in the black hole X-ray binary V404 Cygni, detected with very long baseline interferometry during
the peak of its 2015 outburst. We show that this can be modelled as Lense-Thirring precession of a
vertically-extended slim disk that arises from the super-Eddington accretion rate. Our findings
suggest that the dynamics of the precessing inner accretion disk could play a role in either directly
launching or redirecting the jets within the inner few hundred gravitational radii. Similar dynamics
should be expected in any strongly-accreting black hole whose spin is misaligned with the inflowing
gas, both affecting the observational characteristics of the jets, and distributing the black
hole feedback more uniformly over the surrounding environment.
