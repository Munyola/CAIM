We have performed a 5-8 $\mu$m spectral line survey of the hot molecular core associated with the
massive protostar AFGL 2591, using the Echelon-Cross-Echelle Spectrograph (EXES) on the Stratospheric
Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA). We have supplemented these data with a ground based
study in the atmospheric M band around 4.5 $\mu$m using the iSHELL instrument on the Infrared Telescope
Facility (IRTF), and the full N band window from 8-13 $\mu$m using the Texas Echelon Cross Echelle
Spectrograph (TEXES) on the IRTF. Here we present the first detection of ro-vibrational transitions
of CS in this source. The absorption lines are centred on average around -10 kms$^{-1}$ and the line
widths of CS compare well with the hot component of $^{13}$CO (around 10 kms$^{-1}$). Temperatures
for CS, hot $^{13}$CO and $^{12}$CO v=1-2 agree well and are around 700 K. We derive a CS abundance
of 8$\times$10$^{-3}$ and 2$\times$10$^{-6}$ with respect to CO and H$_2$ respectively. This
enhanced CS abundance with respect to the surrounding cloud (1$\times$10$^{-8}$) may reflect
sublimation of H$_2$S ice followed by gas-phase reactions to form CS. Transitions are in LTE and
we derive a density of $>$10$^7$ cm$^{-3}$, which corresponds to an absorbing region of $<$0.04$''$.
EXES observations of CS are likely to probe deeply into the hot core, to the base of the outflow. Submillimeter
and infrared observations trace different components of the hot core as revealed by the difference
in systemic velocities, line widths and temperatures, as well as the CS abundance.
