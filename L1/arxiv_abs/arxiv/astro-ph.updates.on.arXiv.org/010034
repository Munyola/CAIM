Space Vehicle (SV) life span depends on its station keeping capability. Station keeping is the ability
of the vehicle to maintain position and orientation. Due to external perturbations, the trajectory
of the SV derives from the ideal orbit. Actual positioning systems for satellites are mainly based
on ground equipment, which means heavy infrastructures. Autonomous positioning and navigation
systems using Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) can then represent a great reduction
in platform design and operating costs. Studies have been carried out and the first operational
systems, based on GPS receivers, become available. But better availability of service could be
obtained considering a receiver able to process GPS and Galileo signals. Indeed Galileo system
will be compatible with the current and the modernized GPS system in terms of signals representation
and navigation data. The greater availability obtained with such a receiver would allow significant
increase of the number of point solutions and performance enhancement. For a mid-term perspective
Thales Alenia Space finances a PhD to develop the concept of a reconfigurable receiver able to deal
with both the GPS system and the future Galileo system. In this context, the aim of this paper is to
assess the performances of a receiver designed for Geosynchronous Earth Orbit (GEO) applications.
It is shown that high improvements are obtained with a receiver designed to track both GPS and Galileo
satellites. The performance assessments have been used to define the specifications of the future
satellite GNSS receiver.
