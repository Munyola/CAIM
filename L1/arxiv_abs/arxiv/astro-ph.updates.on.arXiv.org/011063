Only three extragalactic supernovae have been detected at late times at millimeter wavelengths:
SN 1987A, SN 1978K, and SN 1996cr. SN 1978K is a remarkably luminous Type IIn supernova that remains
bright at all wavelengths 40 years after its explosion. Here we present Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter
Array (ALMA) observations taken in 2016 using Bands 3, 4, 6, and 7 that show a steepening in the spectrum.
An absorbed single power law model broadly fits all the radio and millimeter observations, but would
require significant chromatic variability. Alternatively, a broken power law fits the radio-millimeter
spectrum: this can be explained using an ultra-relativistic spherical blast wave in a wind scaling
with a cooling break, as in a gamma-ray burst afterglow. Using updated Australia Telescope Compact
Array (ATCA) light curves, we show the non-thermal radio continuum continues to decay as $t^{-1.53}$;
in the fireball model, this independently defines the power law indices found in the radio-millimeter
spectrum. Supernovae such as SN 1978K might be important contributors to the Universal dust budget:
only SN 1978K was detected in a search for warm dust in supernovae in the transitional phase (age 10-100
years). Using Spitzer Space Telescope observations, we show that at least some of this dust emission
has been decaying rapidly as $t^{-2.45}$ over the past decade, suggesting it is being destroyed.
Depending on the modeling of the synchrotron emission, the ALMA observations suggest there may
be emission from a cold dust component.
