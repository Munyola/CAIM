Weak heating events are frequent and ubiquitous in solar corona. They derive their energy from the
local magnetic field and form a major source of local heating, signatures of which are seen in EUV
and X-ray bands. Their radio emission arise from various plasma instabilities that lead to coherent
radiation, making even a weak flare appear very bright. The radio observations hence probe non-equilibrium
dynamics providing complementary information on plasma evolution. However, a robust study of
radio emission from a weak event among many simultaneous events, requires high dynamic range imaging
at sub-second andsub-MHz resolutions owing to their high spectro-temporal variability. Such
observations were not possible until recently.This is among the first spatially resolved studies
of an active region loop hosting a transient brightening (ARTB) and dynamically linked to a metrewave
type-I noise storm. It uses imaging observations at metrewave, EUV and X-ray bands, along with magnetogram
data. We believe this is the first spectroscopic radio imaging study of a type-I source, the data
for which was obtained using the Murchison Widefield Array. We report the discovery of 30 s quasi-periodic
oscillations (QPOs) in the radio light curve, riding on a coherent baseline flux. The strength of
the QPOs and the baseline flux enhanced during a mircoflare associated with the ARTB. Our observations
suggest a scenario where magnetic stress builds up over an Alfv\'{e}n timescale (30s) across the
typical magnetic field braiding scale and then dissipates via a cascade of weak reconnection events.
