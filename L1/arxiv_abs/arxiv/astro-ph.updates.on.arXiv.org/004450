There is now substantial evidence that the progenitors of some core-collapse supernovae undergo
enhanced or extreme mass loss prior to explosion. The imprint of this mass loss is observed in the
spectra and dynamics of the expanding blastwave on timescales of days to years after core-collapse,
and the effects on the spectral and dynamical evolution may linger long after the supernova has evolved
into the remnant stage. In this paper, we present for the first time, largely self-consistent end-to-end
simulations for the evolution of a massive star from the pre-main sequence, up to and through core
collapse, and into the remnant phase. We present three models and compare and contrast how the progenitor
mass loss history impacts the dynamics and spectral evolution of the supernovae and supernova remnants.
We study a model which only includes steady mass loss, a model with enhanced mass loss over a period
of $\sim$ 5000 years prior to core-collapse, and a model with extreme mass loss over a period of $\sim$
500 years prior to core collapse. The models are not meant to address any particular supernova or
supernova remnant, but rather to highlight the important role that the progenitor evolution plays
in the observable qualities of supernovae and supernova remnants. Through comparisons of these
three different progenitor evolution scenarios, we find that the mass loss in late stages (during
and after core carbon burning) can have a profound impact on the dynamics and spectral evolution
of the supernova remnant centuries after core-collapse.
