We present a parsec-scale molecular hydrogen (H$_2$ 1-0 S(1) at 2.12~\micron) outflow discovered
from the UKIRT Widefield Infrared Survey for H$_2$. The outflow is located in the infrared dark cloud
core MSXDC G053.11+00.05 MM1 at 1.7 kpc and likely associated with two young stellar objects (YSOs)
at the center. The overall morphology of the outflow is bipolar along the NE-SW direction with a brighter
lobe to the southwest, but the detailed structure consists of several flows and knots. With the total
length of $\sim$1 pc, the outflow luminosity is fairly high with $L_{\rm H_{2}} > 6~L_{\sun}$, implying
a massive outflow-driving YSO if the entire outflow is driven by a single source. The two putative
driving sources, located at the outflow center, show photometric variability of $\gtrsim$1 mag
in {\it H}- and {\it K}-bands. This, with their early evolutionary stage from spectral energy distribution
(SED) fitting, indicates that both are capable of ejecting outflows and may be eruptive variable
YSOs. The YSO masses inferred from SED fitting are $\sim$10~$M_{\sun}$ and $\sim$5~$M_{\sun}$,
suggesting the association of the outflow with massive YSOs. The geometrical morphology of the
outflow is well explained by the lower mass YSO by assuming a single source origin, but without kinematic
information, the contribution from the higher mass YSO cannot be ruled out. Considering star formation
process by fragmentation of a high-mass core into several lower mass stars, we also suggest the possible
presence of another, yet-undetected driving source deeply embedded in the core.
