There are several supervised machine learning methods used for the application of automated morphological
classification of galaxies; however, there has not yet been a clear comparison of these different
methods using imaging data, or a investigation for maximising their effectiveness. We carry out
a comparison between seven common machine learning methods for galaxy classification (Convolutional
Neural Network (CNN), K-nearest neighbour, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, and
Neural Networks) by using Dark Energy Survey (DES) data combined with visual classifications from
the Galaxy Zoo 1 project (GZ1). Our goal is to determine the optimal machine learning methods when
using imaging data for galaxy classification. We show that CNN is the most successful method of these
seven methods in our study. Using a sample of $\sim$2,800 galaxies with visual classification from
GZ1, we reach an accuracy of $\sim$0.99 for the morphological classification of Ellipticals and
Spirals. The further investigation of the galaxies that were misclassified but with high predicted
probabilities in our CNN reveals the incorrect classification provided by GZ1, and that the galaxies
having a low probability of being either spirals or ellipticals are visually Lenticulars (S0),
demonstrating that supervised learning is able to rediscover that this class of galaxy is distinct
from both Es and Spirals. We confirmed $\sim$2.5\% galaxies are misclassified by GZ1 in our study.
After correcting these galaxies' label, we improve our CNN performance to an average accuracy of
over 0.99 (accuracy of 0.994 is our best result)
