It is widely known that in active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and black hole X-ray binaries (BHXBs), there
is a tight correlation among their radio luminosity ($L_R$), X-ray luminosity ($L_X$) and BH mass
($\mbh$), the so-called `fundamental plane' (FP) of BH activity. Yet the supporting data are very
limited in the $\mbh$ regime between stellar mass (i.e., BHXBs) and 10$^{6.5}$\,\msun\ (namely,
the lower bound of supermassive BHs in common AGNs). In this work, we developed a new method to measure
the 1.4 GHz flux directly from the images of the VLA FIRST survey, and apply it to the type-1 low-mass
AGNs in the \cite{2012ApJ...755..167D} sample. As a result, we obtained 19 new low-mass AGNs for
FP research with both \mbh\ estimates ($\mbh \approx 10^{5.5-6.5}$\,\msun), reliable X-ray measurements,
and (candidate) radio detections, tripling the number of such candidate sources in the literature.Most
(if not all) of the low-mass AGNs follow the standard radio/X-ray correlation and the universal
FP relation fitted with the combined dataset of BHXBs and supermassive AGNs by \citet{2009ApJ...706..404G};
the consistency in the radio/X-ray correlation slope among those accretion systems supports the
picture that the accretion and ejection (jet) processes are quite similar in all accretion systems
of different \mbh. In view of the FP relation, we speculate that the radio loudness $\mathcal{R}$
(i.e., the luminosity ratio of the jet to the accretion disk) of AGNs depends not only on Eddington
ratio, but probably also on \mbh.
