The plasma parameters such as the electron density and temperature plays a key role in the dynamics
of the solar atmosphere. These characteristics are important in solar physics, because they can
help to understand the physics in the solar corona. The goal is to reconstruct the electron density
and temperature distributions in the solar corona. The relations between emission and plasma parameters
in different time scales are studied. We present a physics-based model to reconstruct the density,
temperature and emission in the EUV band. This model called CODET is composed of a flux transport
model, an extrapolation model, an emission model and an optimization algorithm. The CODET model
parameters were constrained by comparing the model's output to the TIMED/SEE record instead of
direct observations because it covers a longer time interval than the direct solar observations
currently available. The most important results of the current work that the recovery of SSI variability
in specific wavelengths in the EUV band, also the variations in density and temperature in large
time scale through the solar atmosphere, with the CODET model. The evolution of the electron density
and temperature profiles through the solar corona in different layers during the solar cycle 23
and 24, will be presented. The emission maps were obtained and they are in accordance to the observations.
Also, the density and temperature maps are related to the variations of the magnetic field in different
layers through the solar atmosphere.
