Space-based high contrast imaging mission concepts for studying rocky exoplanets in reflected
light are currently under community study. We develop an inverse modeling framework to estimate
the science return of such missions given different instrument design considerations. By combining
an exoplanet albedo model, an instrument noise model, and an ensemble Markov chain Monte Carlo sampler,
we explore retrievals of atmospheric and planetary properties for Earth twins as a function of signal-to-noise
ratio (SNR) and resolution ($R$). Our forward model includes Rayleigh scattering, single-layer
water clouds with patchy coverage, and pressure-dependent absorption due to water vapor, oxygen,
and ozone. We simulate data at $R = 70$ and $R = 140$ from 0.4-1.0 $\mu$m with SNR $ = 5, 10, 15, 20$ at 550
nm (i.e., for HabEx/LUVOIR-type instruments). At these same SNR, we simulate data for WFIRST paired
with a starshade, which includes two photometric points between 0.48-0.6 $\mu$m and $R = 50$ spectroscopy
from 0.6-0.97 $\mu$m. Given our noise model for WFIRST-type detectors, we find that weak detections
of water vapor, ozone, and oxygen can be achieved with observations with at least $R = 70$ / SNR$\ =
15$, or $R = 140$ / SNR$\ = 10$ for improved detections. Meaningful constraints are only achieved
with $R = 140$ / SNR$\ = 20$ data. The WFIRST data offer limited diagnostic information, needing at
least SNR = 20 to weakly detect gases. Most scenarios place limits on planetary radius, but cannot
constrain surface gravity and, thus, planetary mass.
