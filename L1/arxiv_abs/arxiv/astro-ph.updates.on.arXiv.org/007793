Recent observations in extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) wavelengths reveal an EUV late phase in some
solar flares that is characterized by a second peak in warm coronal emissions ($\sim3$~MK) several
tens of minutes to a few hours after the soft X-ray (SXR) peak. Using the model enthalpy-based thermal
evolution of loops (EBTEL), in this paper we numerically probe the production of EUV late-phase
solar flares. Starting from two main mechanisms of producing the EUV late phase, i.e., long-lasting
cooling and secondary heating, we carry out two groups of numerical experiments to study the effects
of these two processes on the emission characteristics in late-phase loops. In either of the two
processes an EUV late-phase solar flare that conforms to the observational criteria can be numerically
synthesized. However, the underlying hydrodynamic and thermodynamic evolutions in late-phase
loops are different between the two synthetic flare cases. The late-phase peak due to a long-lasting
cooling process always occurs during the radiative cooling phase, while that powered by a secondary
heating is more likely to take place in the conductive cooling phase. We then propose a new method
for diagnosing the two mechanisms based on the shape of EUV late-phase light curves. Moreover, from
the partition of energy input, we discuss why most solar flares are not EUV late flares. Finally,
by addressing some other factors that may potentially affect the loop emissions, we also discuss
why the EUV late phase is mainly observed in warm coronal emissions.
