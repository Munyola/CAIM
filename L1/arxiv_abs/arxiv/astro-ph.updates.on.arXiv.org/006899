We present a study of the HI and optical properties of nearby ($z$ $\le$ 0.1) Low Surface Brightness
galaxies (LSBGs). We started with a literature sample of $\sim$900 LSBGs and divided them into three
morphological classes: spirals, irregulars and dwarfs. Of these, we could use $\sim$490 LSBGs
to study their HI and stellar masses, colours and colour magnitude diagrams, and local environment,
compare them with normal, High Surface Brightness (HSB) galaxies and determine the differences
between the three morphological classes. We found that LSB and HSB galaxies span a similar range
in HI and stellar masses, and have a similar $M_{\rm HI}$/$M_{\star}$--$M_{\star}$ relationship.
Among the LSBGs, as expected, the spirals have the highest average HI and stellar masses, both of
about 10$^{9.8}$ $M_\odot$. The LSGBs' ($g$--$r$) integrated colour is nearly constant as function
of HI mass for all classes. In the colour magnitude diagram, the spirals are spread over the red and
blue regions whereas the irregulars and dwarfs are confined to the blue region. The spirals also
exhibit a steeper slope in the $M_{\rm HI}$/$M_{\star}$--$M_{\star}$ plane. Within their local
environment we confirmed that LSBGs are more isolated than HSB galaxies, and LSB spirals more isolated
than irregulars and dwarfs. Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistical tests on the HI mass, stellar mass
and number of neighbours indicates that the spirals are a statistically different population from
the dwarfs and irregulars. This suggests that the spirals may have different formation and HI evolution
than the dwarfs and irregulars.
