Deriving a simple, analytic galaxy star formation history (SFH) using observational data is a complex
task without the proper tool to hand. We therefore present SNITCH, an open source code written in
Python, developed to quickly (~2 minutes) infer the parameters describing an analytic SFH model
from the emission and absorption features of a galaxy spectrum dominated by star formation gas ionisation.
SNITCH uses the Flexible Stellar Population Synthesis models of Conroy et al. (2009), the MaNGA
Data Analysis Pipeline and a Markov Chain Monte Carlo method in order to infer three parameters (time
of quenching, rate of quenching and model metallicity) which best describe an exponentially declining
quenching history. This code was written for use on the MaNGA spectral data cubes but is customisable
by a user so that it can be used for any scenario where a galaxy spectrum has been obtained, and adapted
to infer a user-defined analytic SFH model for specific science cases. Herein we outline the rigorous
testing applied to SNITCH and show that it is both accurate and precise at deriving the SFH of a galaxy
spectra. The tests suggest that SNITCH is sensitive to the most recent epoch of star formation but
can also trace the quenching of star formation even if the true decline does not occur at an exponential
rate. With the use of both an analytical SFH and only five spectral features, we advocate that this
code be used as a comparative tool across a large population of spectra, either for integral field
unit data cubes or across a population of galaxy spectra.
