The very conception and early development stage of AR 12548 are investigated based on SDO/HMI observations
of 20--25 May 2016. Full-vector magnetic and velocity fields are analysed in parallel. In the growing
bipolar magnetic (BMR), the leading-polarity magnetic element nucleates as a compact feature
against the background of a distributed trailing-polarity field, in which a germ of the trailing-polarity
element is already present. Both magnetic elements give rise to a couple of pores, which then evolves
into a bipolar sunspot group. The growth of the leading (negative) polarity sets in abruptly and
occurs rapidly while the trailing (positive) polarity grows smoothly and more slowly. There is
also similar dissymmetry between the time variations of the negative and positive magnetic fluxes
through some area encompassing the BMR. No signs of strong horizontal magnetic fields are detected
between the growing leading and trailing magnetic poles of the BMR. No predominant upflow between
the future locations of the magnetic poles precedes the origin of the BMR; instead, upflows and downflows
are mixed, with some prevalence of downflows. Any signs of a large-scale horizontal divergent flow
from the area when the BMR develops are missing; in contrast, a regular supergranulation and mesogranulation
pattern remains intact. The observed scenario of early BMR evolution is in strong contradiction
with the expectations following from the model of rising $\Omega$-shaped loop of a flux tube of strong
magnetic field.
