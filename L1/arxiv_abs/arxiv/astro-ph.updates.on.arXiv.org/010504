Recent polarization measurements of fast radio bursts (FRBs) provide new insights on these enigmatic
sources. We show that the nearly 100% linear polarization and small variation of the polarization
position angles (PAs) of multiple bursts from the same source suggest that the radiation is produced
near the surface of a strongly magnetized neutron star. As the emitted radiation travels through
the magnetosphere, the electric vector of the X-mode wave adiabatically rotates and stays perpendicular
to the local magnetic field direction. The PA freezes at a radius where the plasma density becomes
too small to be able to turn the electric vector. At the freeze-out radius, the electric field is perpendicular
to the magnetic dipole moment of the neutron star projected in the plane of the sky, independent of
the radiation mechanism or the orientation of the magnetic field in the emission region. We discuss
a number of predictions of the model. The variation of PAs from repeating FRBs should follow the rotational
period of the underlying neutron star (but the burst occurrence may not be periodic). Measuring
this period will provide crucial support for the neutron star nature of the progenitors of FRBs.
For FRB 121102, the small range of PA variation means that the magnetic inclination angle is less
than about 20 degrees and that the observer's line of sight is outside the magnetic inclination cone.
Other repeating FRBs may have a different range of PA variation from that of FRB 121102, depending
on the magnetic inclination and the observer's viewing angle.
