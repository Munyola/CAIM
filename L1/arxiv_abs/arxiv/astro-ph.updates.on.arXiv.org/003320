Optical and ultraviolet observations for the nearby type II-plateau supernova (SN IIP) 2013am
in the nearby spiral galaxy M65 are presented in this paper. The early spectra are characterized
by relatively narrow P-Cygni features, with ejecta velocities much lower than observed in normal
SNe IIP (i.e., $\sim$2000 km s$^{-1}$ vs. $\sim$5000 km $^{-1}$ in the middle of the plateau phase).
Moreover, prominent Ca II absorptions are also detected in SN 2013am at relatively early phases.
These spectral features are reminiscent of those seen in the low-velocity and low-luminosity SN
IIP 2005cs. However, SN 2013am exhibits different photometric properties, having shorter plateau
phases and brighter light-curve tails if compared to SN 2005cs. Adopting $R_{V}$=3.1 and a mean
value of total reddening derived from the photometric and spectroscopic methods(i.e., $E(B-V)=0.55\pm$0.19
mag), we find that SN 2013am may have reached an absolute $V$-band peak magnitude of $-15.83\pm0.71$
mag, and produced a $^{56}$Ni mass of $0.016^{+0.010}_{-0.006} solar masses in the explosion.
These parameters are close to those derived for SN 2008in and SN 2009N which have been regarded as
"gap-filler" objects linking the faint SNe IIP to the normal ones. This indicates that some low-velocity
SNe IIP may not necessarily result from the low-energetic explosions, and the low expansion velocities
could be due to a lower metallicity of the progenitor stars, a larger envelope mass ejected in the
explosion, or that is was observed at an angle that is away from the polar direction.
