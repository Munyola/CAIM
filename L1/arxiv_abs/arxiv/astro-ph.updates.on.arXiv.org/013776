In this work, we investigate the reason behind the increased occurrence of S0 galaxies in high density
environments. Our sample comprises of $\sim$ 2500 spiral and $\sim$ 2000 S0 galaxies spanning a
wide range of environments. Dividing the galaxies into categories of classical and pseudobulge
hosting spiral and S0 galaxies, we have studied their properties as a function of the environment.
We find that the fraction of pseudobulge hosting disc galaxies decreases with increase in density.
The classical bulge hosting spirals and S0 galaxies follow a similar trend in less dense environments
but towards higher densities, we observe an increase in the fraction of classical bulge host S0 galaxies
at the expense of spirals. Comparing the structural and the star formation properties of galaxies
on the size-mass and $NUV-r$ colour-mass planes respectively, we infer that classical bulge hosting
spirals are likely to get transformed into S0 morphology. We notice a trend of galaxy structure with
environment such that the fraction of classical bulge hosting spiral galaxies is found to increase
with environment density. We also find that among classical bulge hosting spirals, the fraction
of quenched galaxies increases in denser environments. We surmise that the existence of more classical
bulge hosting spirals galaxies and more efficient quenching leads to the observed increased occurrence
of S0 galaxies in high density environments. The relation between galaxy structure and environment
also exists for the disc galaxies irrespective of their visual morphology, which is driven mainly
by halo mass.
