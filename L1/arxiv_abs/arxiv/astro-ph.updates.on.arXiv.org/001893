We present revised properties for 196,468 stars observed by the NASA Kepler Mission and used in the
analysis of Quarter 1-16 (Q1-Q16) data to detect and characterize transiting exoplanets. The catalog
is based on a compilation of literature values for atmospheric properties (temperature, surface
gravity, and metallicity) derived from different observational techniques (photometry, spectroscopy,
asteroseismology, and exoplanet transits), which were then homogeneously fitted to a grid of Dartmouth
stellar isochrones. We use broadband photometry and asteroseismology to characterize 11,532
Kepler targets which were previously unclassified in the Kepler Input Catalog (KIC). We report
the detection of oscillations in 2,762 of these targets, classifying them as giant stars and increasing
the number of known oscillating giant stars observed by Kepler by ~20% to a total of ~15,500 stars.
Typical uncertainties in derived radii and masses are ~40% and ~20%, respectively, for stars with
photometric constraints only, and 5-15% and ~10% for stars based on spectroscopy and/or asteroseismology,
although these uncertainties vary strongly with spectral type and luminosity class. A comparison
with the Q1-Q12 catalog shows a systematic decrease in radii for M dwarfs, while radii for K dwarfs
decrease or increase depending on the Q1-Q12 provenance (KIC or Yonsei-Yale isochrones). Radii
of F-G dwarfs are on average unchanged, with the exception of newly identified giants. The Q1-Q16
star properties catalog is a first step towards an improved characterization of all Kepler targets
to support planet occurrence studies.
