Context: The principle definition of habitability for exoplanets is whether they can sustain liquid
water on their surfaces, i.e. that they orbit within the habitable zone. However, the planet's magnetosphere
should also be considered, since without it, an exoplanet's atmosphere may be eroded away by stellar
winds. Aims: The aim of this paper is to investigate magnetospheric protection of a planet from the
effects of stellar winds from solar-mass stars. Methods: We study hypothetical Earth-like exoplanets
orbiting in the host star's habitable zone for a sample of 124 solar-mass stars. These are targets
that have been observed by the Bcool collaboration. Using two wind models, we calculate the magnetospheric
extent of each exoplanet. These wind models are computationally inexpensive and allow the community
to quickly estimate the magnetospheric size of magnetised Earth-analogues orbiting cool stars.
Results: Most of the simulated planets in our sample can maintain a magnetosphere of ~5 Earth radii
or larger. This suggests that magnetised Earth analogues in the habitable zones of solar analogues
are able to protect their atmospheres and is in contrast to planets around young active M dwarfs.
In general, we find that Earth-analogues around solar-type stars, of age 1.5 Gyr or older, can maintain
at least a Paleoarchean Earth sized magnetosphere. Our results indicate that planets around 0.6
- 0.8 solar-mass stars on the low activity side of the Vaughan-Preston gap are the optimum observing
targets for habitable Earth analogues.
