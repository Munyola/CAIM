As part of the SILCC-ZOOM project we present our first sub-parsec resolution radiation-hydrodynamic
simulations of two molecular clouds self-consistently forming from a turbulent, multi-phase
ISM. The clouds have similar initial masses of few 10$^4$ M$_{\odot}$, escape velocities of ~5 km
s$^{-1}$, and a similar initial energy budget. We follow the formation of star clusters with a sink
based model and the impact of radiation from individual massive stars with the tree-based radiation
transfer module TreeRay. Photo-ionizing radiation is coupled to a chemical network to follow gas
heating, cooling and molecule formation and dissociation. For the first 3 Myr of cloud evolution
we find that the overall star formation effciency is considerably reduced by a factor of ~4 to global
cloud values of < 10 % as the mass accretion of sinks that host massive stars is terminated after <1
Myr. Despite the low effciency, star formation is triggered across the clouds. Therefore, a much
larger region of the cloud is affected by radiation and the clouds begin to disperse. The time scale
on which the clouds are dispersed sensitively depends on the cloud substructure and in particular
on the amount of gas at high visual extinction. The damage of radiation done to the highly shielded
cloud (MC1) is delayed. We also show that the radiation input can sustain the thermal and kinetic
energy of the clouds at a constant level. Our results strongly support the importance of ionizing
radiation from massive stars for explaining the low observed star formation effciency of molecular
clouds
