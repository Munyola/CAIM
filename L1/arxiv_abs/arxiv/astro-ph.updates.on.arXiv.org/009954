We present results from an ongoing investigation using the Kilo Degree Survey (KiDS) on the VLT Survey
Telescope (VST) to provide a census of ultra-compact massive galaxies (UCMGs), defined as galaxies
with stellar masses $M_{\rm \star} > 8 \times 10^{10} \rm M_{\odot}$ and effective radii $R_{\rm
e} < 1.5\,\rm kpc$. UCMGs, which are expected to have undergone very few merger events, provide a
unique view on the accretion history of the most massive galaxies in the Universe. Over an effective
sky area of nearly 330 square degrees, we select UCMG candidates from KiDS multi-colour images,
which provide high quality structural parameters, photometric redshifts and stellar masses.
Our sample of $\sim 1000$ photometrically selected UCMGs at $z < 0.5$ represents the largest sample
of UCMG candidates assembled to date over the largest sky area. In this paper we present the first
effort to obtain their redshifts using different facilities, starting with first results for 28
candidates with redshifts $z < 0.5$, obtained at NTT and TNG telescopes. We confirmed, as bona fide
UCMGs, 19 out of the 28 candidates with new redshifts. A further 46 UCMG candidates are confirmed
with literature spectroscopic redshifts (35 at $z < 0.5$), bringing the final cumulative sample
of spectroscopically-confirmed lower-z UCMGs to 54 galaxies, which is the largest sample at redshifts
below $0.5$. We use these spectroscopic redshifts to quantify systematic errors in our photometric
selection, and use these to correct our UCMG number counts. We finally compare the results to independent
datasets and simulations.
