We discuss the properties of stellar mass black hole (BH) mergers induced by tidal encounters with
a massive BH at galactic centres or potentially in dense star clusters. The tidal disruption of stellar
binaries by a massive BH is known to produce hypervelocity stars. However, such a tidal encounter
does not always lead to the break-up of binaries. Since surviving binaries tend to become hard and
eccentric, this process can produce BH mergers in principle. For initially circular binaries,
we show that the gravitational wave (GW) merger times become shorter by a factor of more than $10^{2}$
($10^5$) in $10\%$ ($1\%$) of the surviving cases. This reduction is primarily due to the growth
in binary's eccentricity at the tidal encounter. We also investigate the effective spins of the
survivors, assuming that BH spins are initially aligned with the binary orbital angular momentum.
We find that binary orientations can flip in the opposite direction at the tidal encounter. For the
survivors with large merger time reduction factors, the effective spin distribution is rather
flat. We estimate the merger rate due to the tidal encounter channel to be $\sim 0.6\ \textrm{Gpc}^{-3}\textrm{yr}^{-1}$.
This mechanism is unlikely to be the dominant formation channel of BH mergers. However, the current
and near-future GW observatories are expected to detect an enormous number of BH mergers. If mergers
are found in the vicinity of massive BHs (e.g. the detection of GW lensing echoes or preceding extreme-mass-ratio
bursts), this mechanism would provide a possible explanation for their origin.
