We used the updated [Fe/H] abundances of 168 F-G type dwarfs and calibrated them to a third order polynomial
in terms of reduced ultraviolet excess, $\delta_{0.41}$ defined with $ugr$ data in the SDSS. We
estimated the $M_g$ absolute magnitudes for the same stars via the re-reduced Hipparcos parallaxes
and calibrated the absolute magnitude offsets, $\Delta M_g$, relative to the intrinsic sequence
of Hyades to a third order polynomial in terms of $\delta_{0.41}$. The ranges of the calibrations
are $-2<$[Fe/H]$\leq$0.3 dex and $4<M_g\leq6$ mag. The mean of the residuals and the corresponding
standard deviation for the metallicity calibration are 0 and 0.137 mag; while, for the absolute
magnitude calibration they are 0 and 0.179 mag, respectively. We applied our procedures to 23,414
dwarf stars in the Galactic field with the Galactic coordinates $85^{\circ}\leq b\leq90^{\circ}$,
$0^{\circ}\leq l\leq360^{\circ}$ and size 78 deg$^{2}$. We estimated absolute magnitude $M_g$
dependent vertical metallicity gradients as a function of vertical distance $Z$. The gradients
are deep in the range of $0<Z\leq5$ kpc, while they are very small positive numbers beyond $Z=5$ kpc.
All dwarfs with $5<M_g\leq6$ mag are thin-disc stars and their distribution shows a mode at $(g-r)_0\approx
0.38$ mag, while the absolute magnitudes $4<M_g\leq5$ are dominated by thick disc and halo stars,
i.e. the apparently bright ones ($g_0\leq18$ mag) are thick-disc stars with a mode at $(g-r)_0\sim0.38$
mag, while the halo population is significant in the faint stars ($g_0>18$ mag).
