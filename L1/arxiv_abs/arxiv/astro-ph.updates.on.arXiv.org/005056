Cross-identifying complex radio sources with optical or infra red (IR) counterparts in surveys
such as the Australia Telescope Large Area Survey (ATLAS) has traditionally been performed manually.
However, with new surveys from the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) detecting
many tens of million of radio sources such an approach is no longer feasible. This paper presents
new software (LRPY - Likelihood Ratio in PYthon) to automate the process of cross-identifying radio
sources with catalogues at other wavelengths. LRPY implements the Likelihood Ratio (LR) technique
with a modification to account for two galaxies contributing to a sole measured radio component.
We demonstrate LRPY by applying it to ATLAS DR3 and a {\it Spitzer}-based multi-wavelength fusion
catalogue, identifying 3,848 matched sources via our LR-based selection criteria. A subset of
1987 sources have flux density values for all IRAC bands which allow us to use criteria to distinguish
between active galactic nuclei (AGN) and star-forming galaxies (SFG). We find that 936 radio sources
($\approx47\,\%$) meet both of the Lacy and Stern AGN selection criteria. Of the matched sources,
295 have spectroscopic redshifts and we examine the radio to IR flux ratio vs redshift, proposing
an AGN selection criterion below the Elvis radio-loud (RL) AGN limit for this dataset. Taking the
union of all three AGN selection criteria we identify 956 as AGN ($\approx48\,\%$). From this dataset,
we find a decreasing fraction of AGN with lower radio flux densities consistent with other results
in the literature.
