We present results of the analysis of a sample of 22 stars of spectral types from O7 to B5 and luminosity
classes I-V for which Spitzer/IRS spectra are available. The IRS spectra of these stars are examined
for signs of excess infrared (IR) emission by comparison with stellar atmospheric spectra. We find
that the spectra of half of the studied stars are dominated by excess emission in the far-IR, including
all six super- and bright giants. In order to examine the origin of the far-IR excess, we supplement
the Spitzer data with optical high-resolution echelle spectroscopy ($\lambda/\Delta \lambda
\sim 10^5$), near-IR high-contrast coronagraphic imaging taken with the SPHERE instrument at
VLT with a spatial resolution of 0.05", and WISE and Herschel photometry. In the optical region,
we detect various absorption and emission lines (H$\alpha$, CIII, and NIII) irrespective of the
far-IR excess. Pfund($\alpha$) and Humphrey($\alpha$) lines are observed at the same time as the
far-IR excess. These lines are stronger in stars with far-IR excess than in stars without excess.
A scattered-light disk in the central r < 2.5" region of the far-IR excess stars HD149404, HD151804,
and HD154368 can be excluded from H band imaging down to a 1$\sigma$ contrast of $F(r)/F_{*} \sim
10^{-6}$. The far-IR excess is fit either by a free-free component from ionized gas as for the winds
of hot stars or a large (1pc) circumstellar dust shell. The putative dust envelopes required to explain
the excess have a visual extinction as low as a few hundred $\mu$-mag.
