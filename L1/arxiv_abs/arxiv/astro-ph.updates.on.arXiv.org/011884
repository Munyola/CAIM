We investigate four young, but non-accreting, very low mass stars in Orion, which show irregular
eclipses by circumstellar dust. The eclipses are not recurring periodically, are variable in depth,
lack a flat bottom, and their duration is comparable to the typical timescale between eclipses.
The dimming is associated with reddening consistent with dust extinction. Taken together this
implies the presence of rings around these four stars, with radii ranging from 0.01 to 40 AU, comprised
of optically thin dust clouds. The stars also show IR excess indicating the presence of evolved circumstellar
disks, with orders of magnitude more material than needed for the eclipses. However, the rings need
to cover an opening angle of about 20 degrees to explain how common these variable stars are in the
coeval population in the same region, which is more extended than a typical disk. Thus, we propose
that the rings may not be part of the disks, but instead separate structures with larger scale heights.
To be sustained over years, the rings need to be replenished by dust from the disk or gravitationally
bound to an object (e.g., planets or planetesimals). These four stars belong to a growing and diverse
class of post-T Tauri stars with dips or eclipses in their lightcurves. Dusty rings with scale heights
exceeding those of disks may be a common phenomenon at stellar ages between 5 and 10 Myr, in the transition
from accretion disks to debris disks. These structures could be caused by migrating planets and
may be signposts for the presence of young planetary systems.
