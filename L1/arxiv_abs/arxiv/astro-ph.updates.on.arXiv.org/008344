Spreads in light element abundances among stars (a.k.a. multiple populations) are observed in
nearly all globular clusters. One way to map such chemical variations using high-precision photometry
is to employ a suitable combination of stellar magnitudes in the F275W, F336W, F438W, and F814W filters
(the so called "chromosome map"), to maximise the separation between the different multiple populations.
For each individual cluster its chromosome map separates the so-called first population -with
metal abundance patterns typical of field halo stars- from the second population, that displays
distinctive abundance variations among a specific group of light-elements. Surprisingly, the
distribution of first population stars in chromosome maps of several -but not all- clusters has
been found to be more extended than expected from purely observational errors, suggesting a chemically
inhomogeneous origin. We consider here three clusters with similar metallicity ([Fe/H]~-1.3)
and different chromosome maps, namely NGC 288, M 3 and NGC 2808, and argue that the first population
extended distribution (as observed in two of these clusters) is due to spreads of the initial helium
abundance and possibly a small range of nitrogen abundances as well. The presence of a range of initial
He and N abundances amongst stars traditionally thought to have homogeneous composition, plus
the fact that these spreads appear only in some clusters, challenge the scenarios put forward so
far to explain the multiple population phenomenon.
