The dramatic relativistic jets pointing directly at us in BL Lac objects can be well modelled by bulk
motion beaming of synchrotron self-Compton emission powered by a low Eddington fraction accretion
flow. Nearly 500 of these AGN are seen in the 2nd Fermi Large Area Telescope catalogue of AGN. We combine
the jet models which describe individual spectra with the expected jet parameter scalings with
mass and mass accretion rate to predict the expected number of Fermi detected sources given the number
densities of AGN from cosmological simulations. We select only sources with Eddington scaled mass
accretion rate $< 0.01$ (i.e. radiatively inefficient flows), and include cooling, orientation
effects, and the effects of absorption from pair production on the extragalactic IR background.
These models overpredict the number of Fermi detected BL Lacs by a factor of 1000! This clearly shows
that one of the underlying assumptions is incorrect, almost certainly that jets do not scale simply
with mass and accretion rate. The most plausible additional parameter which can affect the region
producing the Fermi emission is black hole spin. We can reproduce the observed numbers of BL Lacs
if such relativistic jets are only produced by the highest spin ($a_*>0.8$) black holes, in agreement
with the longstanding spin-jet paradigm. This also requires that high spins are intrinsically
rare, as predicted by the cosmological simulations for growing black hole mass via chaotic (randomly
aligned) accretion episodes, where only the most massive black holes have high spin due to black
hole-black hole mergers.
