The Survey of Water and Ammonia in Nearby galaxies (SWAN) studies atomic and molecular species across
the nuclei of four star forming galaxies: NGC\,253, IC\,342, NGC\,6946, and NGC\,2146. As part
of this survey, we present Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) molecular line observations of three
galaxies: IC\,342, NGC\,6946 and NGC\,2146. NGC\,253 is covered in a previous paper. These galaxies
were chosen to span an order of magnitude in star formation rates and to select a variety of galaxy
types. We target the metastable transitions of ammonia NH$_{3}$(1,1) to (5,5), the 22\,GHz water
(H$_2$O) ($6_{16}-5_{23}$) transition, and the 36.1\,GHz methanol (CH$_3$OH) ($4_{-1}-3_{0}$)
transition. {We use the NH$_{3}$\ metastable lines to perform thermometry of the dense molecular
gas.} We show evidence for uniform heating across the central kpc of IC\,342 with two temperature
components for the molecular gas, similar to NGC 253,} of 27\,K and 308\,K, and that the dense molecular
gas in NGC\,2146 has a temperature $<$86 K. We identify two new water masers in IC\,342, and one new
water maser in each of NGC\,6946 and NGC\,2146. The two galaxies NGC\,253 and NGC\,2146, with the
most vigorous star formation, host H$_2$O kilomasers. Lastly, we detect the first 36\,GHz CH$_3$OH\
masers in IC\,342 and NGC\,6946. For the four external galaxies the total CH$_3$OH\ luminosity
in each galaxy suggests a correlation with galactic star formation rate, whereas the morphology
of the emission is similar to that of HNCO, a weak shock tracer.
