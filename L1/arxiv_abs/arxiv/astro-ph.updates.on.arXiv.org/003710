We present a method to build mock galaxy catalogues starting from a halo catalogue that uses halo
occupation distribution (HOD) recipes as well as the subhalo abundance matching (SHAM) technique.
Combining both prescriptions we are able to push the absolute magnitude of the resulting catalogue
to fainter luminosities than using just the SHAM technique and can interpret our results in terms
of the HOD modelling. We optimize the method by populating with galaxies friends-of-friends dark
matter haloes extracted from the Marenostrum Institut de Ci\`{e}ncies de l'Espai (MICE) dark matter
simulations and comparing them to observational constraints. Our resulting mock galaxy catalogues
manage to reproduce the observed local galaxy luminosity function and the colour-magnitude distribution
as observed by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. They also reproduce the observed galaxy clustering
properties as a function of luminosity and colour. In order to achieve that, the algorithm also includes
scatter in the halo mass - galaxy luminosity relation derived from direct SHAM and a modified NFW
mass density profile to place satellite galaxies in their host dark matter haloes. Improving on
general usage of the HOD that fits the clustering for given magnitude limited samples, our catalogues
are constructed to fit observations at all luminosities considered and therefore for any luminosity
subsample. Overall, our algorithm is an economic procedure of obtaining galaxy mock catalogues
down to faint magnitudes that are necessary to understand and interpret galaxy surveys.
