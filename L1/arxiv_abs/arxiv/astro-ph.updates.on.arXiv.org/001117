We model the linear and nonlinear growth of large scale structure in the Cubic Galileon gravity model,
by running a suite of N-body cosmological simulations using the {\tt ECOSMOG} code. Our simulations
include the Vainshtein screening effect, which reconciles the Cubic Galileon model with local
tests of gravity. In the linear regime, the amplitude of the matter power spectrum increases by $\sim
25%$ with respect to the standard $\Lambda$CDM model today. The modified expansion rate accounts
for $\sim 20%$ of this enhancement, while the fifth force is responsible for only $\sim 5%$. This
is because the effective unscreened gravitational strength deviates from standard gravity only
at late times, even though it can be twice as large today. In the nonlinear regime ($k \gtrsim 0.1 h\rm{Mpc}^{-1}$),
the fifth force leads to only a modest increase ($\lesssim 8%$) in the clustering power on all scales
due to the very efficient operation of the Vainshtein mechanism. Such a strong effect is typically
not seen in other models with the same screening mechanism. The screening also results in the fifth
force increasing the number density of halos by less than 10%, on all mass scales. Our results show
that the screening does not ruin the validity of linear theory on large scales which anticipates
very strong constraints from galaxy clustering data. We also show that, whilst the model gives an
excellent match to CMB data on small angular scales ($l \gtrsim 50$), the predicted integrated Sachs-Wolf
effect is in tension with Planck/WMAP results.
