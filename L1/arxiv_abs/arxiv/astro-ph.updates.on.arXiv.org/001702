A detailed quantum analysis of a ionic reaction with a crucial role in the ISM is carried out to generate
ab initio reactive cross sections with a quantum method. From them we obtain the corresponding CH+
depletion rates over a broad range of temperatures. The new rates are further linked to a complex
chemical network that shows the evolution in time of the CH+ abundance in photodissociation region
(PDR) and molecular cloud (MC) environments. The evolutionary abundances of CH+ are given by numerical
solutions of a large set of coupled, first-order kinetics equations by employing the new chemical
package KROME. The differences found between all existing calculations from low-T experiments
are explained via a simple numerical model that links the low-T cross section reductions to collinear
approaches where nonadiabatic crossings dominate. The analysis of evolutionary abundance of
CH+ reveals that the important region for the depletion reaction of this study is that above 100 K,
hence showing that, at least for this reaction, the differences with the existing low-temperature
experiments are of essentially no importance within the astrochemical environments. A detailed
analysis of the chemical network involving CH+ also shows that a slight decrease in the initial oxygen
abundance might lead to higher CH+ abundance since the main chemical carbon ion depletion channel
is reduced in efficiency. This simplified observation might provide an alternative starting point
to understand the problem of astrochemical models in matching the observed CH+ abundances.
