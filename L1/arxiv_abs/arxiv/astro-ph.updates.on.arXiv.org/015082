The Magellanic Clouds are nearby dwarf irregular galaxies whose morphologies show different properties
when traced by different stellar populations, making them an important laboratory for studying
galaxy morphologies. We study the morphology of the Magellanic Clouds using data from the VISTA
survey of the Magellanic Clouds system (VMC). We used about $10$ and $2.5$ million sources across
an area of $\sim105$ deg$^2$ and $\sim42$ deg$^2$ towards the Large and Small Magellanic Cloud (LMC
and SMC), respectively. We estimated median ages of stellar populations occupying different regions
of the near-infrared ($J-K_\mathrm{s}, K_\mathrm{s}$) colour-magnitude diagram. Morphological
maps were produced and detailed features in the central regions were characterised for the first
time with bins corresponding to a spatial resolution of $0.13$ kpc (LMC) and $0.16$ kpc (SMC). In
the LMC, we find that main sequence stars show coherent structures that grow with age and trace the
multiple spiral arms of the galaxy, star forming regions become dimmer as we progress in age, while
supergiant stars are centrally concentrated. Intermediate-age stars, despite tracing a regular
and symmetrical morphology, show central clumps and hints of spiral arms. In the SMC, young main
sequence stars depict a broken bar. Intermediate-age populations show signatures of elongation
towards the Magellanic Bridge that can be attributed to the LMC-SMC interaction $\sim200$ Myr ago.
They also show irregular central features suggesting that the inner SMC has also been influenced
by tidal interactions.
