G292.0+1.8 (G292) is a young ($\sim$3000 yr), Galactic textbook-type core-collapse supernova
remnant (CCSNR). It is characterized by X-ray, optical and infrared emission from ejecta and circumstellar
medium (CSM) features, and contains a pulsar (PSR J1124-5916) and pulsar wind nebula that have been
observed in X-rays and radio. Previous studies have revealed a complex, dynamically evolving,
oxygen-rich remnant, a striking relic from the explosion of a massive star. Here, using our deep
(530 ks) $\textit{Chandra}$ ACIS data, we present high spatial-resolution maps (based on a regional
grid size of a few arcsec) of the shocked CSM and metal-rich ejecta in G292. We make the first $\textit{Chandra}$-detection
of Fe-rich ejecta in G292. We identify the X-ray counterpart of the northern equatorial belt, a component
of a ring-like CSM structure identified earlier in the infrared band. We show the detailed spatial
distributions of ejecta enriched in O, Ne, Mg, Si, S and Fe. We find that the bulk of the Si, S and Fe-rich
X-ray-emitting ejecta are located in the northwestern hemisphere of the remnant, opposite to the
pulsar's projected angular displacement to the southeast from the SNR's center. This suggests
that the pulsar's kick may have originated from gravitational and hydrodynamic forces during an
asymmetric explosion, rather than from anisotropic neutrino emission. Based on abundance ratios
and our estimated CSM and ejecta masses, we constrain the progenitor mass to 13 M$_{\odot}$ $\lesssim$
M $\lesssim$ 30 M$_{\odot}$
