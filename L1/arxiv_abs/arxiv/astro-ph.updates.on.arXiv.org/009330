We isolate a set of quasars that exhibit emergent C iv broad absorption lines (BALs) in their spectra
by comparing spectra in the SDSS Data Release 7 and the SDSS/BOSS Data Releases 9 and 10. After visually
defining a set of emergent BALs, follow-up observations were obtained with the Gemini Observatory
for 105 quasars. We find an emergence rate consistent with the previously reported disappearance
rate of BAL quasars given the relative numbers of non-BAL and BAL quasars in the SDSS. We find candidate
newly emerged BALs are preferentially drawn from among BALs with smaller balnicity indices, shallower
depths, larger velocities, and smaller widths. Within two rest-frame years (average) after a BAL
has emerged, we find it equally likely to continue increasing in equivalent width in an observation
six months later (average) as it is to start decreasing. From the time separations between our observations,
we conclude the coherence time-scale of BALs is less than 100 rest-frame days. We observe coordinated
variability among pairs of troughs in the same quasar, likely due to clouds at different velocities
responding to the same changes in ionizing flux; and the coordination is stronger if the velocity
separation between the two troughs is smaller. We speculate the latter effect may be due to clouds
having on average lower densities at higher velocities due to mass conservation in an accelerating
flow, causing the absorbing gas in those clouds to respond on different timescales to the same ionizing
flux variations.
