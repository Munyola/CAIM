Over the past three decades instruments on the ground and in space have discovered thousands of planets
outside the solar system. These observations have given rise to an astonishingly detailed picture
of the demographics of short-period planets, but are incomplete at longer periods where both the
sensitivity of transit surveys and radial velocity signals plummet. Even more glaring is that the
spectra of planets discovered with these indirect methods are either inaccessible (radial velocity
detections) or only available for a small subclass of transiting planets with thick, clear atmospheres.
Direct detection can be used to discover and characterize the atmospheres of planets at intermediate
and wide separations, including non-transiting exoplanets. Today, a small number of exoplanets
have been directly imaged, but they represent only a rare class of young, self-luminous super-Jovian-mass
objects orbiting tens to hundreds of AU from their host stars. Atmospheric characterization of
planets in the <5 AU regime, where radial velocity (RV) surveys have revealed an abundance of other
worlds, is technically feasible with 30-m class apertures in combination with an advanced AO system,
coronagraph, and suite of spectrometers and imagers. There is a vast range of unexplored science
accessible through astrometry, photometry, and spectroscopy of rocky planets, ice giants, and
gas giants. In this whitepaper we will focus on one of the most ambitious science goals --- detecting
for the first time habitable-zone rocky (<1.6 R_Earth) exoplanets in reflected light around nearby
