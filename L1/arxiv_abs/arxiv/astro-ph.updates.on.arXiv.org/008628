Hydra spectra of 85 G-K dwarfs in the young cluster, M35, near the Li 6708 Angstrom line region are
analyzed. From velocities and Gaia astrometry, 78 are likely single-star members which, combined
with previous work, produces 108 members with T_eff ranging from 6150 to 4000 K as defined by multicolor,
broad-band photometry, E(B-V ) = 0.20 and [Fe/H] = -0.15, though there are indications the metallicity
may be closer to solar. A(Li) follows a well-delineated decline from 3.15 for the hottest stars to
upper limits <= 1.0 among the coolest dwarfs. Contrary to earlier work, M35 includes single stars
at systematically higher A(Li) than the mean cluster relation. This subset exhibits higher V_ROT
than the more Li-depleted sample and, from photometric rotation periods, is dominated by stars
classed as convective (C); all others are interface (I) stars. The cool, high-Li rapid rotators
are consistent with models that consider simultaneously rapid rotation and radius inflation;
rapid rotators hotter than the sun exhibit excess Li depletion, as predicted by the models. The A(Li)
distribution with color and rotation period, when compared to the Hyades/Praesepe and the Pleiades,
is consistent with gyrochronological analysis placing M35's age between the older M34 and younger
Pleiades. However, the Pleiades display a more excessive range in A(Li) and rotation period than
M35 on the low-Li, slow-rotation side of the distribution, with supposedly younger stars at a given
T_eff in the Pleiades spinning slower, with A(Li) reduced by more than a factor of four compared to
M35.
