We present the observation of a major solar eruption that is associated with fast sunspot rotation.
The event includes a sigmoidal filament eruption, a coronal mass ejection, and a GOES X2.1 flare
from NOAA active region 11283. The filament and some overlying arcades were partially rooted in
a sunspot. The sunspot rotated at $\sim$10$^\circ$ per hour rate during a period of 6 hours prior
to the eruption. In this period, the filament was found to rise gradually along with the sunspot rotation.
Based on the HMI observation, for an area along the polarity inversion line underneath the filament,
we found gradual pre-eruption decreases of both the mean strength of the photospheric horizontal
field ($B_h$) and the mean inclination angle between the vector magnetic field and the local radial
(or vertical) direction. These observations are consistent with the pre-eruption gradual rising
of the filament-associated magnetic structure. In addition, according to the Non-Linear Force-Free-Field
reconstruction of the coronal magnetic field, a pre-eruption magnetic flux rope structure is found
to be in alignment with the filament, and a considerable amount of magnetic energy was transported
to the corona during the period of sunspot rotation. Our study provides evidences that in this event
sunspot rotation plays an important role in twisting, energizing, and destabilizing the coronal
filament-flux rope system, and led to the eruption. We also propose that the pre-event evolution
of $B_h$ may be used to discern the driving mechanism of eruptions.
