In this paper we explore the effects of self-obscuration in protostellar disks with a radially decreasing
temperature gradient and a colder midplane. We are motivated by recent reports of resolved dark
lanes (`hamburgers') and (sub)mm spectral indices systematically below the ISM value for optically
thin dust $\alpha_{\rm ISM} =3.7$. We explore several model grids, scaling disk mass and varying
inclination angle $i$ and observing frequency $\nu$ from the VLA Ka band ($\sim 37$ GHz) to ALMA Band
8 ($\sim 405$ GHz). We also consider the effects of decreasing the index of the (sub-)mm dust opacity
power law $\beta$ from 1.7 to 1. We find that a distribution of disk masses in the range $M_{\rm disk}
= 0.01-2~M_\odot$ is needed to reproduce the observed distribution of spectral indices, and that
assuming a fixed $\beta =1.7$ gives better results than $\beta=1$. A wide distribution of disk masses
is also needed to produce some cases with $\alpha <2$, as reported for some sources in the literature.
Such extremely low spectral indices arise naturally when the selected observing frequencies sample
the appropriate change in the temperature structure of the optically thick model disk. Our results
show that protostellar disk masses could often be underestimated by $> \times10$, and are consistent
with recent hydrodynamical simulations. Although we do not rule out the possibility of some grain
growth occurring within the short protostellar timescales, we conclude that self-obscuration
needs to be taken into account.
