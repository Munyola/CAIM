We present new observations and analysis of G2 - the intriguing red emission-line object which is
quickly approaching the Galaxy's central black hole. The observations were obtained with the laser
guide star adaptive optics systems on the W. M. Keck I and II telescopes and include spectroscopy
(R ~ 3600) centered on the Hydrogen Br-gamma line as well as K' (2.1 micrometer) and L' (3.8 micrometer)
imaging. Analysis of these observations shows the Br-gamma line emission has a positional offset
from the L' continuum. This offset is likely due to background source confusion at L'. We therefore
present the first orbital solution derived from Br-gamma line astrometry, which when coupled with
radial velocity measurements, results in a later time of closest approach (2014.21 +/- 0.14), closer
periastron (130 AU, 1900Rs), and higher eccentricity (0.9814 +/- 0.0060) compared to a solution
using L' astrometry. The new orbit casts doubt on previous associations of G2 and a low surface brightness
"tail". It is shown that G2 has no K' counterpart down to K' ~ 20 mag. G2's L' continuum and the Br-gamma
line-emission is unresolved in almost all epochs; however it is marginally extended in our highest
quality Br-gamma data set from 2006 and exhibits a clear velocity gradient at that time. While the
observations altogether suggest that G2 has a gaseous component which is tidally interacting with
the central black hole, there is likely a central star providing the self-gravity necessary to sustain
the compact nature of this object.
