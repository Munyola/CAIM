We have extracted weighted mean values of {\Omega}_{mw}=0.296+/-0.008 and H_{0w}=68.7+/-0.55
km s-1 Mpc-1 from ten baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data sets, found in eight isotropic two point
correlation function (2PCF) studies. Those results were obtained using fit-lines to CMB compatible
solutions, but are independent of any particular CMB parameter set. Two central assumptions were
employed. The first was a {\Lambda}CDM cosmology with {\Omega}_{K}~0 and a dark energy equation
of state with w ~-1. Second, effects that perturb the BAO correlation function, {\xi}(r), peak position
at its co-moving radius of ~150 Mpc, were taken as constant over the small range that the peak is shifted
from its fiducial to data position. Those perturbations include non-linearities, galaxy biasing
and redshift distortion. That second assumption enables an accurate description of the 2PCF peak
shift using a basic format, the Fourier transform of the matter power spectrum modified with the
conventional no-wiggle term. The computed correlation function peak location, r_{p}, depends
upon the damping parameter, k*. We have performed computations with two k* values that give widely
disparate r_{p} values, yet find negligible effect on the outcomes. Additional to the parameter
evaluations, we demonstrate that contrary to widespread usage, D_{V}(z)/r_{d} does not equal
{\alpha}D_{V f}(z)/r_{df}. Here, D_{V}(z) is the volume averaged distance, r_{d} is the acoustic
sound horizon at the baryon drag epoch, the subscript, f, refers to fiducial values, and {\alpha}
is the correlation function peak shift-parameter.
