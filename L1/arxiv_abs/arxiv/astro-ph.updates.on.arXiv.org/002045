We present the results of our analysis of the RR Lyrae (RRL) variable stars detected in two transition-type
dwarf galaxies (dTrans), ESO294-G010 and ESO410-G005 in the Sculptor group, which is known to be
one of the closest neighboring galaxy groups to our Local Group. Using deep archival images from
the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) onboard the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), we have identified
a sample of RR Lyrae candidates in both dTrans galaxies [219 RRab (RR0) and 13 RRc (RR1) variables
in ESO294-G010; 225 RRab and 44 RRc stars in ESO410-G005]. The metallicities of the individual RRab
stars are calculated via the period-amplitude-[Fe/H] relation derived by Alcock et al. This yields
mean metallicities of <[Fe/H]>_{ESO294} = -1.77 +/- 0.03 and <[Fe/H]>_{ESO410}
= -1.64 +/- 0.03. The RRL metallicity distribution functions (MDFs) are investigated further via
simple chemical evolution models; these reveal the relics of the early chemical enrichment processes
for these two dTrans galaxies. In the case of both galaxies, the shapes of the RRL MDFs are well-described
by pre-enrichment models. This suggests two possible channels for the early chemical evolution
for these Sculptor group dTrans galaxies: 1) The ancient stellar populations of our target dwarf
galaxies might have formed from the star forming gas which was already enriched through "prompt
initial enrichment" or an "initial nucleosynthetic spike" from the very first massive stars, or
2) this pre-enrichment state might have been achieved by the end products from more evolved systems
of their nearest neighbor, NGC 55.
