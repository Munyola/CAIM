We present the most comprehensive picture ever obtained of the central parts of the Milky Way probed
with RR Lyrae variable stars. This is a collection of 38257 RR Lyr stars detected over 182 square degrees
monitored photometrically by the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) in the most
central regions of the Galactic bulge. The sample consists of 16804 variables found and published
by the OGLE collaboration in 2011 and 21453 RR Lyr stars newly detected in the photometric databases
of the fourth phase of the OGLE survey (OGLE-IV). 93% of the OGLE-IV variables were previously unknown.
The total sample consists of 27258 RRab, 10825 RRc, and 174 RRd stars. We provide OGLE-IV I- and V-band
light curves of the variables along with their basic parameters. About 300 RR Lyr stars in our collection
are plausible members of 15 globular clusters. Among others, we found the first pulsating variables
that may belong to the globular cluster Terzan 1 and the first RRd star in the globular cluster M54.
Our survey also covers the center and outskirts of the Sagittarius Dwarf Spheroidal Galaxy enabling
studies of the spatial distribution of the old stellar population from this galaxy. A group of double-mode
RR Lyr stars with period ratios around 0.740 form a stream in the sky that may be a relic of a cluster
or a dwarf galaxy tidally disrupted by the Milky Way. Three of our RR Lyr stars experienced a pulsation
mode switching from double-mode to single fundamental mode or vice versa. We also present the first
known RRd stars with large-amplitude Blazhko effect.
