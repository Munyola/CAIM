Broad-line type Ic Supernovae (BL-Ic SNe) are characterized by high ejecta velocity ($\gtrsim
10^4$ km s$^{-1}$) and are sometimes associated with the relativistic jets typical of long duration
($\gtrsim 2$ s) Gamma-Ray Bursts (L-GRBs). The reason why a small fraction of BL-Ic SNe harbor relativistic
jets is not known. Here we present deep X-ray and radio observations of the BL-Ic SN2014ad extending
from $13$ to $930$ days post explosion. SN2014ad was not detected at either frequency and has no observational
evidence of a GRB counterpart. The proximity of SN2014ad ($d\sim 26$ Mpc) enables very deep constraints
on the progenitor mass-loss rate $\dot{M}$ and on the total energy of the fast ejecta $E$. We consider
two synchrotron emission scenarios for a wind-like circumstellar medium (CSM): (i) uncollimated
non-relativistic ejecta, and (ii) off-axis relativistic jet. Within the first scenario our observations
are consistent with GRB-less BL-Ic SNe characterized by a modest energy budget of their fast ejecta
($E \lesssim 10^{45}$ erg), like SNe 2002ap and 2010ay. For jetted explosions, we cannot rule out
a GRB with $E \lesssim 10^{51}$ erg (beam-corrected) with a narrow opening angle ($\theta_j \sim
5^{\circ}$) observed moderately off-axis ($\theta_{\rm obs} \gtrsim 30^{\circ}$) and expanding
in a very low CSM density ($\dot{M}$ $\lesssim 10^{-6}$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$). Our study shows
that off-axis low-energy jets expanding in a low-density medium cannot be ruled out even in the most
nearby BL-Ic SNe with extensive deep observations, and might be a common feature of BL-Ic SNe.
