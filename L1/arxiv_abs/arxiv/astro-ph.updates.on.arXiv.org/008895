The periods of magnetic activity cycles in the Sun and solar-type stars do not exhibit a simple or
even single trend with respect to rotation rate or luminosity. Dynamo models can be used to interpret
this diversity, and can ultimately help us understand why some solar-like stars do not exhibit a
magnetic cycle, whereas some do, and for the latter what physical mechanisms set their magnetic
cycle period. Three-dimensional non-linear magnetohydrodynamical simulations present the
advantage of having only a small number of tunable parameters, and produce in a dynamically self-consistent
manner the flows and the dynamo magnetic fields pervading stellar interiors. We conducted a series
of such simulations within the EULAG-MHD framework, varying the rotation rate and luminosity of
the modeled solar-like convective envelopes. We find decadal magnetic cycles when the Rossby number
near the base of the convection zone is moderate (typically between 0.25 and 1). Secondary, shorter
cycles located at the top of the convective envelope close to the equator are also observed in our
numerical experiments, when the local Rossby number is lower than 1. The deep-seated dynamo sustained
in these numerical experiments is fundamentally non-linear, in that it is the feedback of the large-scale
magnetic field on the large-scale differential rotation that sets the magnetic cycle period. The
cycle period is found to decrease with the Rossby number, which offers an alternative theoretical
explanation to the variety of activity cycles observed in solar-like stars.
