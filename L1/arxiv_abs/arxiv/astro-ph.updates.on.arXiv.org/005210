We present a comparative analysis of the properties of passive, star-forming and transition (green
valley) galaxies, in four discrete environments: field, groups, the outskirts and the core of X-ray
clusters. We construct samples of galaxies from the SDSS in these environments so that they are bound
to have similar redshift distributions. The classification of galaxies into the three sequences
is based on the UV-optical colour $NUV-r$. We study a number of galaxy properties: stellar mass,
morphology, specific star formation rate and the history of star formation. The analysis of green
valley galaxies reveals that the physical mechanisms responsible for external quenching become
more efficient moving from the field to denser environments. We confirm previous findings that
green valley galaxies have intermediate morphologies, moreover, we find that this appears to be
independent of the environment. Regarding the stellar mass of green valley galaxies, we find that
they tend to be more massive in the field than in denser environments. On average, green valley galaxies
account for $\sim 20\%$ of all galaxies in groups and X-ray clusters. We find evidence that the field
environment is inefficient in transforming low mass galaxies. Green valley galaxies have average
star formation histories intermediate between passive and star forming galaxies, and have a clear
and consistent dependence on the environment: both, the quenching time, and the amplitude of the
star formation rate, decrease towards higher density environments.
