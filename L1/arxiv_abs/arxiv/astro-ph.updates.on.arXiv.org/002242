A variety of observational evidence demonstrates that brown dwarfs exhibit active atmospheric
circulations. In this study we use a shallow-water model to investigate the global atmospheric
dynamics in the stratified layer overlying the convective zone on these rapidly rotating objects.
We show that the existence and properties of the atmospheric circulation crucially depend on key
parameters including the energy injection rate and radiative timescale. Under conditions of strong
internal heat flux and weak radiative dissipation, a banded flow pattern comprising east-west
jet streams spontaneously emerges from the interaction of atmospheric turbulence with the planetary
rotation. In contrast, when the internal heat flux is weak and/or radiative dissipation is strong,
turbulence injected into the atmosphere damps before it can self-organize into jets, leading to
a flow dominated by isotropic turbulence and vortices instead. Based on the location of the transition,
we suggest that many brown dwarfs may exhibit atmospheric circulations dominated by turbulence
and vortices (rather than jets) due to the strong radiative damping on these worlds, but a jet structure
is also possible under some conditions. Our simulated light curves capture important features
from observed infrared lightcurves of brown dwarfs, including amplitude variations of a few percent
and shapes that fluctuate between single-peak and multi-peak structures. More broadly, our work
shows that the shallow-water system provides a useful tool to illuminate fundamental aspects of
the dynamics on these worlds.
