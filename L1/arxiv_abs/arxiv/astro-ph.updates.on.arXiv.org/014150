We measure the intergalactic medium (IGM) opacity in the Ly$\alpha$ as well as in the Ly$\beta$ forest
along $19$ quasar sightlines between $5.5\lesssim z_{\rm abs}\lesssim 6.1$, probing the end stages
of the reionization epoch. Owing to its lower oscillator strength the Ly$\beta$ transition is sensitive
to different gas temperatures and densities than Ly$\alpha$, providing additional constraints
on the ionization and thermal state of the IGM. A comparison of our measurements to different inhomogeneous
reionization models, derived from post-processing the Nyx cosmological hydrodynamical simulation
to include spatial fluctuations in the ultraviolet background (UVB) or the gas temperature field,
as well as to a uniform reionization model with varying thermal states of the IGM, leads to two primary
conclusions: First, we find that including the effects of spectral noise is key for a proper data
to model comparison. Noise effectively reduces the sensitivity to high opacity regions, and thus
even stronger spatial inhomogeneities are required to match the observed scatter in the observations
than previously inferred. Second, we find that models which come close to reproducing the distribution
of Ly$\alpha$ effective optical depths nevertheless underpredict the Ly$\beta$ opacity at the
same spatial locations. The origin of this disagreement is not entirely clear but models with an
inversion in the temperature-density relation of the IGM just after reionization is completed
match our measurements best, although they still do not fully capture the observations at $z\gtrsim
5.8$.
