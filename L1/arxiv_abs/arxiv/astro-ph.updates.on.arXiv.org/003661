CO, $^{13}$CO and C$^{18}$O ${\it J}$ = 3--2 observations are presented of the Ophiuchus molecular
cloud. The $^{13}$CO and C$^{18}$O emission is dominated by the Oph A clump, and the Oph B1, B2, C,
E, F and J regions. The optically thin(ner) C$^{18}$O line is used as a column density tracer, from
which the gravitational binding energy is estimated to be $4.5 \times 10^{39}$ J (2282 $M_\odot$
km$^2$ s$^{-2}$). The turbulent kinetic energy is $6.3 \times 10^{38}$ J (320 $M_\odot$ km$^2$
s$^{-2}$), or 7 times less than this, and therefore the Oph cloud as a whole is gravitationally bound.
Thirty protostars were searched for high velocity gas, with eight showing outflows, and twenty
more having evidence of high velocity gas along their lines-of-sight. The total outflow kinetic
energy is $1.3 \times 10^{38}$ J (67 $M_\odot$ km$^2$ s$^{-2}$), corresponding to 21$\%$ of the
cloud?s turbulent kinetic energy. Although turbulent injection by outflows is significant, but
does ${\it not}$ appear to be the dominant source of turbulence in the cloud. 105 dense molecular
clumplets were identified, which had radii $\sim$ 0.01--0.05 pc, virial masses $\sim$ 0.1--12
$M_\odot$, luminosities $\sim$ 0.001--0.1 K~km s$^{-1}$ pc$^{-2}$, and excitation temperatures
$\sim$ 10--50K. These are consistent with the standard GMC based size-line width relationships,
showing that the scaling laws extend down to size scales of hundredths of a parsec, and to sub solar-mass
condensations. There is however no compelling evidence that the majority of clumplets are undergoing
free-fall collapse, nor that they are pressure confined.
