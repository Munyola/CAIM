The R Coronae Borealis (RCB) stars are rare hydrogen--deficient, carbon--rich supergiants. They
undergo extreme, irregular declines in brightness of many magnitudes due to the formation of thick
clouds of carbon dust. It is thought that RCB stars result from the mergers of CO/He white dwarf (WD)
binaries. We constructed post--merger spherically asymmetric models computed with the MESA code,
and then followed the evolution into the region of the HR diagram where the RCB stars are located.
We also investigated nucleosynthesis in the dynamically accreting material of CO/He WD mergers
which may provide a suitable environment for significant production of 18O and the very low 16O/18O
values observed. We have also discovered that the N abundance depends sensitively on the peak temperature
in the He--burning shell. Our MESA modeling consists of engineering the star by adding He--WD material
to an initial CO--WD model, and then following the post--merger evolution using a nuclear--reaction
network to match the observed RCB abundances as it expands and cools to become an RCB star. These new
models are more physical because they include rotation, mixing, mass-loss, and nucleosynthesis
within MESA. We follow the later evolution beyond the RCB phase to determine the stars' likely lifetimes.
The relative numbers of known RCB and Extreme Helium (EHe) stars correspond well to the lifetimes
predicted from the MESA models. In addition, most of computed abundances agree very well with the
observed range of abundances for the RCB class.
