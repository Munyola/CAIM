A triggered 140 ks XMM-Newton observation of the narrow-line Seyfert 1 (NLS1) Mrk 335 in December
2015 caught the active galaxy at its lowest X-ray flux since 2007. The NLS1 is relatively quiescent
for the first ~120 ks of the observation before it flares in brightness by a factor of about five in
the last 20 ks. Although only part of the flare is captured before the observation is terminated,
the data reveal significant differences between the flare and quiescent phases. During the low-flux
state, Mrk 335 demonstrates a reflection-dominated spectrum that results from a compact corona
around a Kerr black hole. In addition to the rapid brightening, the flare is further described by
spectral softening and a falling reflection fraction that are consistent with previous observations
advocating at least part of the corona in Mrk 335 could be the base of an aborted jet. The spectrum during
the flaring interval reveals several residuals between the 2-3 sigma level that could be attributed
to absorption lines from a highly ionised plasma that is moving outward at v~0.12c. It could be that
the increased luminosity during the flare enhances the radiation pressure sufficiently to launch
a possible wind. If the wind is indeed responding to the change in corona luminosity then it must be
located within ~80 Rg. The escape velocity at this distance is comparable to the estimated wind velocity.
If confirmed, this is the first example of a radio-quiet AGN exhibiting behaviour consistent with
both diffuse and collimated outflow.
