In the core accretion paradigm of planet formation, gas giants only form a massive atmosphere after
their progenitors exceeded a threshold mass: the critical core mass. Most (exo)planets, being
smaller and rock/ice-dominated, never crossed this line. Nevertheless, they were massive enough
to attract substantial amounts of gas from the disc, while their atmospheres remained in pressure-equilibrium
with the disc. Our goal is to characterise the hydrodynamical properties of the atmospheres of such
embedded planets and their implication for their (long-term) evolution. In this paper -- the first
in series -- we start to investigate the properties of an isothermal and inviscid flow past a small,
embedded planet by conducting local, 2D hydrodynamical simulations. Using the PLUTO code we confirm
that the flow is steady and bound. This steady outcome is most apparent for the log-polar grid (with
the grid spacing proportional to the distance from the planet). For low-mass planets, Cartesian
grids are somewhat less efficient as they have difficulty to follow the circular, large speeds in
the deep atmosphere. Relating the amount of rotation to the gas fraction of the atmosphere, we find
that more massive atmospheres rotate faster -- a finding consistent with Kelvin's circulation
theorem. Rotation therefore limits the amount of gas that planets can acquire from the nebula. Dependent
on the Toomre-Q parameter of the circumstellar disc, the planet's atmosphere will reach Keplerian
rotation before self-gravity starts to become important.
