Motivated by the observed differences in the nebular emission of nearby and high-redshift galaxies,
we carry out a set of direct numerical simulations of turbulent astrophysical media exposed to a
UV background. The simulations assume a metallicity of $Z/Z_{\odot}$=0.5 and explicitly track
ionization, recombination, charge transfer, and ion-by-ion radiative cooling for several astrophysically
important elements. Each model is run to a global steady state that depends on the ionization parameter
$U$, and the one-dimensional turbulent velocity dispersion, $\sigma_{\rm 1D}$, and the turbulent
driving scale. We carry out a suite of models with a T=42,000K blackbody spectrum, $n_e$ = 100 cm$^{-3}$
and $\sigma_{\rm 1D}$ ranging between 0.7 to 42 km s$^{-1},$ corresponding to turbulent Mach numbers
varying between 0.05 and 2.6. We report our results as several nebular diagnostic diagrams and compare
them to observations of star-forming galaxies at a redshift of $z\approx$2.5, whose higher surface
densities may also lead to more turbulent interstellar media. We find that subsonic, transsonic
turbulence, and turbulence driven on scales of 1 parsec or greater, have little or no effect on the
line ratios. Supersonic, small-scale turbulence, on the other hand, generally increases the computed
line emission. In fact with a driving scale $\approx 0.1$ pc, a moderate amount of turbulence, $\sigma_{\rm
1D}$=21-28 km s$^{-1},$ can reproduce many of the differences between high and low redshift observations
without resorting to harder spectral shapes.
