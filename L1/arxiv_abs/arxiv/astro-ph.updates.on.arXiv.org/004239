High contrast imaging instruments such as GPI and SPHERE are discovering gap structures in protoplanetary
disks at an ever faster pace. Some of these gaps may be opened by planets forming in the disks. In order
to constrain planet formation models using disk observations, it is crucial to find a robust way
to quantitatively back out the properties of the gap-opening planets, in particular their masses,
from the observed gap properties, such as their depths and widths. Combing 2D and 3D hydrodynamics
simulations with 3D radiative transfer simulations, we investigate the morphology of planet-opened
gaps in near-infrared scattered light images. Quantitatively, we obtain correlations that directly
link intrinsic gap depths and widths in the gas surface density to observed depths and widths in images
of disks at modest inclinations under finite angular resolution. Subsequently, the properties
of the surface density gaps enable us to derive the disk scale height at the location of the gap $h$,
and to constrain the quantity $M_{\rm p}^2/\alpha$, where $M_{\rm p}$ is the mass of the gap-opening
planet and $\alpha$ characterizes the viscosity in the gap. As examples, we examine the gaps recently
imaged by VLT/SPHERE, Gemini/GPI, and Subaru/HiCIAO in HD 97048, TW Hya, HD 169142, LkCa 15, and
RX J1615.3-3255. Scale heights of the disks and possible masses of the gap-opening planets are derived
assuming each gap is opened by a single planet. Assuming $\alpha=10^{-3}$, the derived planet mass
in all cases are roughly between 0.1-1 $M_{\rm J}$.
