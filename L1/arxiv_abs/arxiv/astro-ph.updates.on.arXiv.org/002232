Three-dimensional simulations of core-collapse supernovae are granting new insight into the
as-yet uncertain mechanism that drives successful explosions. While there is still debate about
whether explosions are obtained more easily in 3D than in 2D, it is undeniable that there exist qualitative
and quantitative differences between the results of 3D and 2D simulations. We present an extensive
set of high-resolution one-, two-, and three-dimensional core-collapse supernova simulations
with multispecies neutrino leakage carried out in two different progenitors. Our simulations
confirm the results of Couch (2013) indicating that 2D explodes more readily than 3D. We argue that
this is due to the inadequacies of 2D to accurately capture important aspects of the three-dimensional
dynamics. We find that without artificially enhancing the neutrino heating rate we do not obtain
explosions in 3D. We examine the development of neutrino-driven convection and the standing accretion
shock instability and find that, in separate regimes, either instability can dominate. We find
evidence for growth of the standing accretion shock instability for both 15-$M_\odot$ and 27-$M_\odot$
progenitors, however, it is weaker in 3D exploding models. The growth rate of both instabilities
is artificially enhanced along the symmetry axis in 2D as compared with our axis-free 3D Cartesian
simulations. Our work highlights the growing consensus that core-collapse supernovae must be
studied in 3D if we hope to solve the mystery of how the explosions are powered.
