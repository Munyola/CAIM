The basic unified model of active galactic nuclei (AGN) invokes an anisotropic obscuring structure,
usually referred to as a torus, to explain AGN obscuration as an angle-dependent effect. We present
a new grid of X-ray spectral templates based on radiative transfer calculations in neutral gas in
an approximately toroidal geometry, appropriate for CCD-resolution X-ray spectra (FWHM > 130
eV). Fitting the templates to broadband X-ray spectra of AGN provides constraints on two important
geometrical parameters of the gas distribution around the supermassive black hole: the average
column density and the covering factor. Compared to the currently available spectral templates,
our model is more flexible, and capable of providing constraints on the main torus parameters in
a wider range of AGN. We demonstrate the application of this model using hard X-ray spectra from NuSTAR
(3-79 keV) for four AGN covering a variety of classifications: 3C 390.3, NGC 2110, IC 5063, and NGC
7582. This small set of examples was chosen to illustrate the range of possible torus configurations,
from disk-like to sphere-like geometries with column densities below, as well as above, the Compton-thick
threshold. This diversity of torus properties challenges the simple assumption of a standard geometrically
and optically thick toroidal structure commonly invoked in the basic form of the unified model of
AGN. Finding broad consistency between the our constraints and those from infrared modeling, we
discuss how the approach from the X-ray band complements similar measurements of AGN structures
at other wavelengths.
