The dust properties in the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds are studied using the HERITAGE Herschel
Key Project photometric data in five bands from 100 to 500 micron. Three simple models of dust emission
were fit to the observations: a single temperature blackbody modified by a power- law emissivity
(SMBB), a single temperature blackbody modified by a broken power-law emissivity (BEMBB), and
two blackbodies with different temperatures, both modified by the same power-law emissivity (TTMBB).
Using these models we investigate the origin of the submm excess; defined as the submillimeter (submm)
emission above that expected from SMBB models fit to observations < 200 micron. We find that the
BEMBB model produces the lowest fit residuals with pixel-averaged 500 micron submm excesses of
27% and 43% for the LMC and SMC, respectively. Adopting gas masses from previous works, the gas-to-dust
ratios calculated from our the fitting results shows that the TTMBB fits require significantly
more dust than are available even if all the metals present in the interstellar medium (ISM) were
condensed into dust. This indicates that the submm excess is more likely to be due to emissivity variations
than a second population of colder dust. We derive integrated dust masses of (7.3 +/- 1.7) x 10^5 and
(8.3 +/- 2.1) times 10^4 M(sun) for the LMC and SMC, respectively. We find significant correlations
between the submm excess and other dust properties; further work is needed to determine the relative
contributions of fitting noise and ISM physics to the correlations.
