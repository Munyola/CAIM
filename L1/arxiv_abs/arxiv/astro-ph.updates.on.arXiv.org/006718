Transits of habitable planets around solar-like stars are expected to be shallow, and to have long
periods, which means low information content. The current bottleneck in the detection of such transits
is caused in large part by the presence of red (correlated) noise in the light curves obtained from
the dedicated space telescopes. Based on the groundbreaking results deep learning achieves in
many signal and image processing applications, we propose to use deep neural networks to solve this
problem. We present a feasibility study, in which we applied a convolutional neural network on a
simulated training set. The training set comprised light curves received from a hypothetical high-cadence
space-based telescope. We simulated the red noise by using Gaussian Processes with a wide variety
of hyperparameters. We then tested the network on a completely different test set simulated in the
same way. Our study proves that very difficult cases can indeed be detected. Furthermore, we show
how detection trends can be studied, and detection biases be quantified. We have also checked the
robustness of the neural-network performance against practical artifacts such as outliers and
discontinuities, which are known to affect space-based high-cadence light curves. Future work
will allow us to use the neural networks to characterize the transit model and identify individual
transits. This new approach will certainly be an indispensable tool for the detection of habitable
planets in the future planet-detection space missions such as PLATO.
