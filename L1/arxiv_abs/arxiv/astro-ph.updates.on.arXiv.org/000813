We study the statistical properties of the Normalized Excess Variance of variability process characterized
by a red-noise power spectral density (PSD), as the case of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). We perform
Monte Carlo simulations of lightcurves, assuming both a continuous and a sparse sampling pattern
and various signal-to-noise (S/N) ratios. We show that the normalized excess variance is a biased
estimate of the variance even in the case of continuously sampled lightcurves. The bias depends
on the PSD slope and on the sampling pattern, but not on the S/N ratio. We provide a simple formula to
account for the bias, which yields unbiased estimates with an accuracy better than 15%. We show that
the normalized excess variance estimates based on single lightcurves (especially for sparse sampling
and S/N less than 3) are highly uncertain (even if corrected for bias) and we propose instead the use
of an ensemble estimate, based on multiple lightcurves of the same object, or on the use of lightcurves
of many objects. These estimates have symmetric distributions, known errors, and can also be corrected
for biases.We use our results to estimate the ability to measure the intrinsic source variability
in current data, and show that they could also be useful in the planning of the observing strategy
of future surveys such as those provided by X-ray missions studying distant and/or faint AGN populations
and, more in general, in the estimation of the variability amplitude of sources that will result
from future surveys such as Pan-STARRS, and LSST.
