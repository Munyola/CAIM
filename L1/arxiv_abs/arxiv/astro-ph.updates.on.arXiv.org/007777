Chemical diversity of the gas in low-mass protostellar cores is widely recognized. In order to explore
its origin, a survey of chemical composition toward 36 Class 0/I protostars in the Perseus molecular
cloud complex, which are selected in an unbiased way under certain physical conditions, has been
conducted with IRAM 30 m and NRO 45 m telescope. Multiple lines of C2H, c-C3H2 and CH3OH have been observed
to characterize the chemical composition averaged over a 1000 au scale around the protostar. The
derived beam-averaged column densities show significant chemical diversity among the sources,
where the column density ratios of C2H/CH3OH are spread out by 2 orders of magnitude. From previous
studies, the hot corino sources have abundant CH3OH but deficient C2H, their C2H/CH3OH column density
ratios being relatively low. In contrast, the warm-carbon-chain chemistry (WCCC) sources are
found to reveal the high C2H/CH3OH column density ratios. We find that the majority of the sources
have intermediate characters between these two distinct chemistry types. A possible trend is seen
between the C2H/CH3OH ratio and the distance of the source from the edge of a molecular cloud. The
sources located near cloud edges or in isolated clouds tend to have a high C2H/CH3OH ratio. On the
other hand, the sources having a low C2H/CH3OH ratio tend to be located in inner regions of the molecular
cloud complex. This result gives an important clue to an understanding of the origin of the chemical
diversity of protostellar cores in terms of environmental effects.
