Well before the radio discovery of pulsars offered the first observational confirmation for their
existence (Hewish et al., 1968), it had been suggested that neutron stars might be endowed with very
strong magnetic fields of $10^{10}$-$10^{14}$G (Hoyle et al., 1964; Pacini, 1967). It is because
of their magnetic fields that these otherwise small ed inert, cooling dead stars emit radio pulses
and shine in various part of the electromagnetic spectrum. But the presence of a strong magnetic
field has more subtle and sometimes dramatic consequences: In the last decades of observations
indeed, evidence mounted that it is likely the magnetic field that makes of an isolated neutron star
what it is among the different observational manifestations in which they come. The contribution
of the magnetic field to the energy budget of the neutron star can be comparable or even exceed the
available kinetic energy. The most magnetised neutron stars in particular, the magnetars, exhibit
an amazing assortment of explosive events, underlining the importance of their magnetic field
in their lives. In this chapter we review the recent observational and theoretical achievements,
which not only confirmed the importance of the magnetic field in the evolution of neutron stars,
but also provide a promising unification scheme for the different observational manifestations
in which they appear. We focus on the role of their magnetic field as an energy source behind their
persistent emission, but also its critical role in explosive events.
