We present relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (RMHD) simulations of stationary overpressured
magnetized relativistic jets which are characterized by their dominant type of energy, namely
internal, kinetic, or magnetic. Each model is threaded by a helical magnetic field with a pitch angle
of $45^\circ$ and features a series of recollimation shocks produced by the initial pressure mismatch,
whose strength and number varies as a function of the dominant type of energy. We perform a study of
the polarization signatures from these models by integrating the radiative transfer equations
for synchrotron radiation using as inputs the RMHD solutions. These simulations show a top-down
emission asymmetry produced by the helical magnetic field and a progressive confinement of the
emission into a jet spine as the magnetization increases and the internal energy of the non-thermal
population is considered to be a constant fraction of the thermal one. Bright stationary components
associated with the recollimation shocks appear presenting a relative intensity modulated by
the Doppler boosting ratio between the pre-shock and post-shock states. Small viewing angles show
a roughly bimodal distribution in the polarization angle due to the helical structure of the magnetic
field, which is also responsible for the highly stratified degree of linear polarization across
the jet width. In addition, small variations of the order of $26^\circ$ are observed in the polarization
angle of the stationary components, which can be used to identify recollimation shocks in astrophysical
jets.
