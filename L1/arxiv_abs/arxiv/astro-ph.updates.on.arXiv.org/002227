Multi-molecule observations towards an increasing variety of galaxies have been showing that
the relative molecular abundances are affected by the type of activity. However, these studies
are biased towards bright active galaxies, which are typically in interaction. We study the molecular
composition of one of the most isolated galaxies in the local Universe where the physical and chemical
properties of their molecular clouds have been determined by intrinsic mechanisms. We present
3 mm broad band observations of the galaxy CIG 638, extracted from the AMIGA sample of isolated galaxies.
The emission of the J=1-0 transitions of CCH, HCN, HCO+, and HNC are detected. Integrated intensity
ratios between these line are compared with similar observations from the literature towards active
galaxies including starburst galaxies (SB), active galactic nuclei (AGN), luminous infrared
galaxies (LIRG), and GMCs in M33. A significantly high ratio of CCH with respect to HCN, HCO+, and
HNC is found towards CIG 638 when compared with all other galaxies where these species have been detected.
This points to either an overabundance of CCH or to a relative lack of dense molecular gas as supported
by the low HCN/CO ratio, or both. The data suggest that the CIG 638 is naturally a less perturbed galaxy
where a lower fraction of dense molecular gas, as well as a more even distribution could explain the
measured ratios. In this scenario the dense gas tracers would be naturally dimmer, while the UV enhanced
CCH, would be overproduced in a less shielded medium.
