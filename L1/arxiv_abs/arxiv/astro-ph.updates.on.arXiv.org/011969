The integrated spectra of stellar systems contain a wealth of information, and its analysis can
reveal fundamental parameters such as metallicity, age and star formation history. Widely used
methods to analyze these spectra are based on comparing the galaxy spectra to stellar population
(SP) models. Despite being a powerful tool, SP models contain many ingredients, each with their
assumptions and uncertainties. Among the several possible sources of uncertainties, it is not
straightforward to identify which ingredient dominates the errors in the models. In this work we
propose a study of one of the SP model ingredients -- the spectral stellar libraries -- independently
of the other ingredients. To that aim, we will use the integrated spectra of globular clusters which
have color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) available. From these CMDs it is possible to model the integrated
spectra of these objects without having to adopt -- or make assumptions -- on the other two main ingredients
of SP models, evolutionary tracks or an IMF. Here we tested four widely used stellar libraries. We
found that the libraries are able to reproduce the integrated spectra of 18 of the 30 cluster spectra
inside a mean flux uncertainty of 5%. For the larger wavelength range tested, a theoretical library
outperforms the empirical ones in the comparison. Without the blue part of the spectra, empirical
libraries fare better than the theoretical, in particular when individual features are concerned.
However, the results are promising for theoretical libraries, which are equally efficient to reproduce
the whole spectrum.
