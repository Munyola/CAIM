Moderately strong shocks arise naturally when two subclusters merge. For instance, when a smaller
subcluster falls into the gravitational potential of a more massive cluster, a bow shock is formed
and moves together with the subcluster. After pericenter passage, however, the subcluster is decelerated
by the gravity of the main cluster, while the shock continues moving away from the cluster center.
These shocks are considered as promising candidates for powering radio relics found in many clusters.
The aim of this paper is to explore the fate of such shocks when they travel to the cluster outskirts,
far from the place where the shocks were initiated. In a uniform medium, such a "runaway" shock should
weaken with distance. However, as shocks move to large radii in galaxy clusters, the shock is moving
down a steep density gradient that helps the shock to maintain its strength over a large distance.
Observations and numerical simulations show that, beyond $R_{500}$, gas density profiles are
as steep as, or steeper than, $\sim r^{-3}$, suggesting that there exists a "Habitable zone" for
moderately strong shocks in cluster outskirts where the shock strength can be maintained or even
amplified. A characteristic feature of runaway shocks is that the strong compression, relative
to the initial state, is confined to a narrow region just behind the shock. Therefore, if such a shock
runs over a region with a pre-existing population of relativistic particles, then the boost in radio
emissivity, due to pure adiabatic compression, will also be confined to a narrow radial shell.
