Supermassive stars born in pristine environments in the early Universe hold the promise of being
the seeds for the supermassive black holes observed as high redshift quasars shortly after the epoch
of reionisation. H$_2$ suppression is thought to be crucial in order to negate normal Population
III star formation and allow high accretion rates to drive the formation of supermassive stars.
Only in the cases where vigorous fragmentation is avoided will a monolithic collapse be successful
giving rise to a single massive central object. We investigate the number of fragmentation sites
formed in collapsing atomic cooling haloes subject to various levels of background Lyman-Werner
flux. The background Lyman-Werner flux manipulates the chemical properties of the gas in the collapsing
halo by destroying H$_2$. We find that low levels of flux, which simply delay collapse but don't greatly
impact on the thermodynamic state of the gas actually increase the number of fragmentation sites
compared to the zero flux case. Only when the collapsing gas cloud shifts from the molecular to the
atomic cooling regime is the degree of fragmentation suppressed. In our particular case we find
that this occurs above a critical Lyman-Werner background of J $\sim 10$ J$_{21}$. The important
criterion being the transition to the atomic cooling regime rather than the actual value of J, which
will vary locally. Once the temperature of the gas exceeds T $\gtrsim$ 10$^4$ K and the gas transitions
to atomic line cooling, then vigorous fragmentation is strongly suppressed.
