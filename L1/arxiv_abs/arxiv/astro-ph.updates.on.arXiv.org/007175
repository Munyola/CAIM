We perform polarimetry analysis of 20 active galactic nuclei (AGN) jets using the Very Long Baseline
Array (VLBA) at 1.4, 1.6, 2.2, 2.4, 4.6, 5.0, 8.1, 8.4, and 15.4 GHz. The study allowed us to investigate
linearly polarized properties of the jets at parsec-scales: distribution of the Faraday rotation
measure (RM) and fractional polarization along the jets, Faraday effects and structure of Faraday-corrected
polarization images. Wavelength-dependence of the fractional polarization and polarization
angle is consistent with external Faraday rotation, while some sources show internal rotation.
The RM changes along the jets, systematically increasing its value towards synchrotron self-absorbed
cores at shorter wavelengths. The highest core RM reaches 16,900 rad/m^2 in the source rest frame
for the quasar 0952+179, suggesting the presence of highly magnetized, dense media in these regions.
The typical RM of transparent jet regions has values of an order of a hundred rad/m^2. Significant
transverse rotation measure gradients are observed in seven sources. The magnetic field in the
Faraday screen has no preferred orientation, and is observed to be random or regular from source
to source. Half of the sources show evidence for the helical magnetic fields in their rotating magnetoionic
media. At the same time jets themselves contain large-scale, ordered magnetic fields and tend to
align its direction with the jet flow. The observed variety of polarized signatures can be explained
by a model of spine-sheath jet structure.
