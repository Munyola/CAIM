Solar radio emission, especially at metre-wavelengths, is well known to vary over small spectral
($\lesssim$100\,kHz) and temporal ($<1$\,s) spans. It is comparatively recently, with the advent
of a new generation of instruments, that it has become possible to capture data with sufficient resolution
(temporal, spectral and angular) that one can begin to characterize the solar morphology simultaneously
along the axes of time and frequency. This ability is naturally accompanied by an enormous increase
in data volumes and computational burden, a problem which will only become more acute with the next
generation of instruments such as the Square Kilometre Array (SKA). The usual approach, which requires
manual guidance of the calibration process, is impractical. Here we present the "Automated Imaging
Routine for Compact Arrays for the Radio Sun (AIRCARS)", an end-to-end imaging pipeline optimized
for solar imaging with arrays with a compact core. We have used AIRCARS so far on data from the Murchison
Widefield Array (MWA) Phase-I. The dynamic range of the images is routinely from a few hundred to
a few thousand. In the few cases, where we have pushed AIRCARS to its limits, the dynamic range can
go as high as $\sim$75000. The images made represent a substantial improvement in the state-of-the-art
in terms of imaging fidelity and dynamic range. This has the potential to transform the multi-petabyte
MWA solar archive from raw visibilities into science-ready images. AIRCARS can also be tuned to
upcoming telescopes like the SKA, making it a very useful tool for the heliophysics community.
