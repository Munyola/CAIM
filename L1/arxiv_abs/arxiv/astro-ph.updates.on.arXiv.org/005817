The prevalence of clouds in currently observable exoplanetary atmospheres motivates the compilation
and calculation of their optical properties. First, we present a new open-source Mie scattering
code known as LX-MIE, which is able to consider large size parameters ($\sim 10^7$) using a single
computational treatment. We validate LX-MIE against the classical MIEV0 code as well as previous
studies. Second, we embark on an expanded survey of the published literature for both the real and
imaginary components of the refractive indices of 32 condensate species. As much as possible, we
rely on experimental measurements of the refractive indices and resort to obtaining the real from
the imaginary component (or vice versa), via the Kramers-Kronig relation, only in the absence of
data. We use these refractive indices as input for LX-MIE to compute the absorption, scattering
and extinction efficiencies of all 32 condensate species. Finally, we use a three-parameter function
to provide convenient fits to the shape of the extinction efficiency curve. We show that the errors
associated with these simple fits in the Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3), J, H and K wavebands are $\sim
10\%$. These fits allow for the extinction cross section or opacity of the condensate species to
be easily included in retrieval analyses of transmission spectra. We discuss prospects for future
experimental work. The compilation of the optical constants and LX-MIE are publicly available
as part of the open-source Exoclime Simulation Platform (this http URL).
