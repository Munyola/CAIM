We present a machine learning (ML) approach for the prediction of galaxies' dark matter halo masses
that achieves an improved performance over conventional methods. We train three ML algorithms
(\texttt{XGBoost}, Random Forests, and neural network) to predict halo masses using a set of synthetic
galaxy catalogues that are built by populating dark matter haloes in N-body simulations with galaxies,
and that match both the clustering and the joint-distributions of properties of galaxies in the
Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We explore the correlation of different galaxy- and group-related
properties with halo mass, and extract the set of nine features that contribute the most to the prediction
of halo mass. We find that mass predictions from the ML algorithms are more accurate than those from
halo abundance matching (\texttt{HAM}) or dynamical mass (\texttt{DYN}) estimates. Since the
danger of this approach is that our training data might not accurately represent the real Universe,
we explore the effect of testing the model on synthetic catalogues built with different assumptions
than the ones used in the training phase. We test a variety of models with different ways of populating
dark matter haloes, such as adding velocity bias for satellite galaxies. We determine that, though
training and testing on different data can lead to systematic errors in predicted masses, the ML
approach still yields substantially better masses than either \texttt{HAM}or \texttt{DYN}.
Finally, we apply the trained model to a galaxy and group catalogue from the SDSS DR7 and present the
resulting halo masses.
