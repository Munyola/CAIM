A general formulation to compute habitable zones for binary stars is presented. We extend the simple
formulation of the known concept: {\it circumstellar habitable zone} for single stars, to the case
of eccentric stellar binary systems, where two sources of luminosity at different orbital phases
contribute to the irradiance of their planetary circumstellar and circumbinary regions. Our approach
considers binaries with eccentric orbits and guarantees that orbits in the computed habitable
zone remain within it at all orbital phases. We apply this formulation to calculate habitable zones
for binary stars of the solar neighborhood with known orbital parameters. Regions of stable, non-intersecting
orbits, supported by invariant loops have been determined using the results of Pichardo, et al.
2005 and 2008, together with their habitable zones, are calculated for 51 cases, including some
with discovered planets. Formulae and interpolating tables are provided, so the reader can compute
the boundaries of the habitable zones for an arbitrary binary system, using the stellar flux limits
they prefer. Together with the formulae provided for stable zones, these allow the computation
of both regions of stability and habitability around any binary stellar system. We found just that
$50\%$ of the cases we take can satisfy both restrictions, this is a very important constriction
to binary systems, nevertheless our conclusion shows this kind of systems must be considered as
strong candidates in the search for habitable planets and allow us to point some binaries as viable
candidates.
