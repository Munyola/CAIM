We report the detection of 6.2um polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) and rest-frame 4-7um continuum
emission in the z=4.055 submillimeter galaxy GN20, using the Infrared Spectrograph (IRS) on board
the Spitzer Space Telescope. This represents the first detection of PAH emission at z>4. The
strength of the PAH emission feature is consistent with a very high star formation rate of ~1600Msun/yr.
We find that this intense starburst powers at least ~1/3 of the faint underlying 6um continuum emission,
with an additional, significant (and perhaps dominant) contribution due to a power-law-like hot
dust source, which we interpret to likely be a faint, dust-obscured active galactic nucleus (AGN).
The inferred 6um AGN continuum luminosity is consistent with a sensitive upper limit on the hard
X-ray emission as measured by the Chandra X-Ray Observatory if the previously undetected AGN is
Compton-thick. This is in agreement with the finding at optical/infrared wavelengths that the
galaxy and its nucleus are heavily dust-obscured. Despite the strong power-law component enhancing
the mid-infrared continuum emission, the intense starburst associated with the photon-dominated
regions that give rise to the PAH emission appears to dominate the total energy output in the infrared.
GN20 is one of the most luminous starburst galaxies known at any redshift, embedded in a rich protocluster
of star-forming galaxies. This investigation provides an improved understanding of the energy
sources that power such exceptional systems, which represent the extreme end of massive galaxy
formation at early cosmic times.
