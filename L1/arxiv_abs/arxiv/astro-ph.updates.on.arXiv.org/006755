Non-detection of $\gamma$-ray emission from galaxy clusters has challenged diffusive shock acceleration
(DSA) of cosmic-ray (CR) protons at weak collisionless shocks that are expected to form in the intracluster
medium. As an effort to address this problem, we here explore possible roles of Alfv\'en waves self-excited
via resonant streaming instability during the CR acceleration at parallel shocks. The mean drift
of Alfv\'en waves may either increase or decrease the scattering center compression ratio, depending
on the postshock cross-helicity, leading to either flatter or steeper CR spectra. We first examine
such effects at planar shocks, based on the transport of Alfv\'en waves in the small amplitude limit.
For the shock parameters relevant to cluster shocks, Alfv\'enic drift flattens the CR spectrum
slightly, resulting in a small increase of the CR acceleration efficiency, $\eta$. We then consider
two additional, physically motivated cases: (1) postshock waves are isotropized via MHD and plasma
processes across the shock transition and (2) postshock waves contain only forward waves propagating
along with the flow due to a possible gradient of CR pressure behind the shock. In these cases, Alfv\'enic
drift could reduce $\eta$ by as much as a factor of 5 for weak cluster shocks. For the canonical parameters
adopted here, we suggest $\eta\sim10^{-4}-10^{-2}$ for shocks with sonic Mach number $M_{\rm
s}\approx2-3$. The possible reduction of $\eta$ may help ease the tension between non-detection
of $\gamma$-rays from galaxy clusters and DSA predictions.
