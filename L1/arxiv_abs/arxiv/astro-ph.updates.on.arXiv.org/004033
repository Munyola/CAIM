The Sun is an active star that produces large-scale energetic events such as solar flares and coronal
mass ejections and numerous smaller-scale events such as solar jets. These events are often associated
with accelerated particles that can cause emission at radio wavelengths. The reconfiguration
of the solar magnetic field in the corona is believed to be the cause of the majority of solar energetic
events and accelerated particles. Here, we investigate a bright J-burst that was associated with
a solar jet and the possible emission mechanism causing these two phenomena. Methods. We used data
from the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) to observed a solar jet, and radio data from the Low Frequency
Array (LOFAR) and the Nancay Radioheliograph (NRH) to observe a J-burst over a broad frequency range
(33-173 MHz) on 9 July 2013 at ~11:06 UT. The J-burst showed fundamental and harmonic components
and it was associated with a solar jet observed at extreme ultraviolet wavelengths with SDO. The
solar jet occurred at a time and location coincident with the radio burst with a velocity of 510 km
s-1. The jet occurred in the northern hemisphere in the negative polarity region of an extended area
of bipolar plage as opposed to a group of complex active regions in the southern hemisphere. Newly
emerged positive flux in the negative magnetic polarity region of the bipolar plage appeared to
be the trigger of the jet. Radio imaging showed that the J-burst emitting electrons originated in
a region above the newly emerged magnetic field of positive polarity and then followed long, closed
magnetic field lines.
