Context. Waves are ubiquitous in the solar corona and there are indications that they are excited
by photospheric p-modes. However, it is unclear how p-modes in coronal loops are converted to sausage
modes and transverse (kink) modes, which are observed in the corona. Aims. We aim to investigate
how those wave modes are excited in the lower corona by photospheric acoustic waves. Methods. We
built 3D magnetohydrostatic loop systems with multiple inclinations spanning from the photosphere
to the lower corona. We then simulated these atmospheres with the MANCHA code, in which we perturb
the equilibrium with a p-mode driver at the bottom of the domain. By splitting the velocity perturbation
into components longitudinal, normal, and azimuthal to the magnetic flux surfaces we can study
wave behavior. Results. In vertical flux tubes, we find that deformed fast sausage surface waves
and slow sausage body waves are excited. In inclined flux tubes fast kink surface waves, slow sausage
body waves, and either a fast sausage surface wave or a plane wave are excited. In addition, we calculate
a wave conversion factor (0 $\le$ C $\le$ 1) from acoustic to magnetic wave behavior by taking the
ratio of the mean magnetic energy flux to the sum of the mean magnetic and acoustic energy flux and
compare it to a commonly used theoretical conversion factor. We find that between magnetic field
inclinations of 10$^\circ$ to 30$^\circ$ those two methods lie within 40%. For smaller inclinations
the absolute deviation is smaller than 0.1.
