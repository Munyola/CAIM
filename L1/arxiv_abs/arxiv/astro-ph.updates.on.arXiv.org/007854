One of the biggest problems we can encounter while dealing with the limb-darkening coefficients
for stellar atmospheric models with spherical symmetry is the difficulty of adjusting both the
limb and the central parts simultaneously. In particular, the regions near the drop-offs are not
well reproduced for most models, depending on Teff, log g, or wavelength. Even if the law with four
terms is used, these disagreements still persist. Here we introduce a new method that considerably
improves the description of both the limb and the central parts and that will allow users to test models
of stellar atmospheres with spherical symmetry more accurately in environments such as exoplanetary
transits, eclipsing binaries, etc. The method introduced here is simple. Instead of considering
all the $\mu $ points in the adjustment, as is traditional, we consider only the points until the drop-off
($\mu_{cri}$) of each model. From this point, we impose a condition ${I(\mu)}/{I (1)} = 0$. All calculations
were performed by adopting the least-squares method. The resulting coefficients using this new
method reproduce the intensity distribution of the PHOENIX spherical models (COND and DRIFT) quite
well for the photometric systems of the space missions {{\sc TESS}}, {{\sc KEPLER}}, {{\sc COROT}},
and {{\sc MOST}}. The calculations cover the following ranges of local gravity and effective temperatures:
2.5 $\leq$ log g $\leq$ 6.0 and 1500 K $\leq$ T$_{\rm eff}$ $\leq$ 12000 K. The new spherical coefficients
can easily be adapted to the most commonly used light curve synthesis codes.
