The PdBI (Plateau de Bure Interferometer) Arcsecond Whirlpool Survey (PAWS) has mapped the molecular
gas in the central ~9kpc of M51 in its 12CO(1-0) line emission at cloud-scale resolution of ~40pc
using both IRAM telescopes. We utilize this dataset to quantitatively characterize the relation
of molecular gas (or CO emission) to other tracers of the interstellar medium (ISM), star formation
and stellar populations of varying ages. Using 2-dimensional maps, a polar cross-correlation
technique and pixel-by-pixel diagrams, we find: (a) that (as expected) the distribution of the
molecular gas can be linked to different components of the gravitational potential, (b) evidence
for a physical link between CO line emission and radio continuum that seems not to be caused by massive
stars, but rather depend on the gas density, (c) a close spatial relation between the PAH and molecular
gas emission, but no predictive power of PAH emission for the molecular gas mass,(d) that the I-H
color map is an excellent predictor of the distribution (and to a lesser degree the brightness) of
CO emission, and (e) that the impact of massive (UV-intense) young star-forming regions on the bulk
of the molecular gas in central ~9kpc can not be significant due to a complex spatial relation between
molecular gas and star-forming regions that ranges from co-spatial to spatially offset to absent.
The last point, in particular, highlights the importance of galactic environment -- and thus the
underlying gravitational potential -- for the distribution of molecular gas and star formation.
