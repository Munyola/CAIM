We have used Kepler photometry to characterize variability in four radio-loud active galactic
nuclei (three quasars and one object tentatively identified as a Seyfert 1.5 galaxy) on timescales
from minutes to months, comparable to the light crossing time of the accretion disk around the central
supermassive black hole or the base of the relativistic jet. Kepler's almost continuous observations
provide much better temporal coverage than is possible from ground-based observations. We report
the first such data analyzed for quasars. We have constructed power spectral densities using 8 Kepler
quarters of long-cadence (30-minute) data for three AGN, 6 quarters for one AGN and 2 quarters of
short-cadence (1-minute) data for all four AGN. On timescales longer than about 0.2-0.6 day, we
find red noise with mean power-law slopes ranging from -1.8 to -1.2, consistent with the variability
originating in turbulence either behind a shock or within an accretion disk. Each AGN has a range
of red noise slopes which vary slightly by month and quarter of observation. No quasi-periodic oscillations
of astrophysical origin were detected. We detected several days-long flares when brightness increased
by 3% - 7% in two objects. No flares on timescales of minutes to hours were detected. Our observations
imply that the duty cycle for enhanced activity in these radio-loud AGN is small. These well-sampled
AGN light curves provide an impetus to develop more detailed models of turbulence in jets and instabilities
in accretion disks.
