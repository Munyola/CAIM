We have derived relations between full-width-half-maxima and equivalent widths of metallic absorption
lines in the spectra of RR~Lyrae stars to estimate new upper limits on the axial equatorial rotational
velocities of RR~Lyrae and metal-poor red horizontal branch stars (RHB). We also have derived the
variations of RR~Lyrae macroturbulent velocities during the pulsation cycles. In RRab cycles
the line widths are dominated by phase-dependent convolutions of axial rotation and macroturbulence,
which we designate as V_macrot. The behavior of V_macrot is remarkably uniform among the RRab stars,
but the behavior of V_macrot among RRc stars varies strongly from star to star. The RRab stars exhibit
an upper limit on V_macrot of 5 +/- 1 km/s with weak evidence of an anti-correlation with T_eff. The
RRc minima range from 2 to 12 km/s. The abrupt decline in large rotations with decreasing T_eff at
the blue boundary of the instability strip and the apparently smooth continuous variation among
the RRab and RHB stars suggests that HB stars gain/lose surface angular momentum on time scales short
compared to HB lifetimes. V_macrot values for our metal-poor RHB stars agree well with those derived
by Fourier analysis of an independent but less metal-poor sample of Carney et al. (2008); they conform
qualitatively to the expectations of Tanner et al. (2013). A general conclusion of our investigation
is that surface angular momentum as measured by V_rot*sini is not a reliable indicator of total stellar
angular momentum anywhere along the HB.
