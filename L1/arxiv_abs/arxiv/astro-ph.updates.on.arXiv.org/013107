Cosmic filaments play a crucial role in galaxy evolution transporting gas from the intergalactic
medium into galaxies. However, little is known about the efficiency of this process and whether
the gas is accreted in a homogenous or clumpy way. Recent observations suggest the presence of broad
gas density distributions in the circumgalactic medium which could be related to the accretion
of filaments. By means of high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations, we explore here the evolution
of cold accreting filaments flowing through the hot circumgalactic medium (CGM) of high-z galaxies.
In particular, we examine the nonlinear effects of Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI) on the development
of broad gas density distributions and on the formation of cold, dense clumps. We explore a large
parameter space in filament and perturbation properties, such as, filament Mach number, initial
perturbation wavelength, and thickness of the interface between the filament and the halo. We find
that the time averaged density distribution of the cold gas is qualitatively consistent with a skewed
log-normal probability distribution function (PDF) plus an additional component in form of a high
density tail for high Mach-numbers. Our results suggest a tight correlation between the accreting
velocity and the maximum densities developing in the filament which is consistent with the variance-Mach
number relation for turbulence. Therefore, cosmological accretion could be a viable mechanism
to produce turbulence and broad gas density distributions within the CGM.
