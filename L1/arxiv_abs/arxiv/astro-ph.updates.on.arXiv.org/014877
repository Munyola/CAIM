On 2014 March 29, an intense solar flare classified as X1.0 occurred in the active region 12017. Several
associated phenomena accompanied this event, among them a fast-filament eruption, large-scale
propagating disturbances in the corona and the chromosphere including a Moreton wave, and a coronal
mass ejection. This flare was successfully detected in multiwavelength imaging in H-alpha line
by the Flare Monitoring Telescope (FMT) at Ica University, Peru. We present a detailed study of the
Moreton wave associated with the flare in question. Special attention is paid to the Doppler characteristics
inferred from the FMT wing (H-alpha$\pm0.8$~{\AA}) observations, which are used to examine the
downward/upward motion of the plasma in the chromosphere. Our findings reveal that the downward
motion of the chromospheric material at the front of the Moreton wave attains a maximum velocity
of 4 km/s, whereas the propagation speed ranges between 640 and 859 km/s. Furthermore, utilizing
the weak shock approximation in conjunction with the velocity amplitude of the chromospheric motion
induced by the Moreton wave, we derive the Mach number of the incident shock in the corona. We also
performed the temperature-emission measure analysis of the coronal wave based on the Atmospheric
Imaging Assembly (AIA) observations, which allowed us to derive the compression ratio, and to estimate
the Alfv\'en and fast-mode Mach numbers of the order of 1.06-1.28 and 1.05-1.27. Considering these
results and the MHD linear theory we discuss the characteristics of the shock front and the interaction
with the chromospheric plasma.
