The heating of the solar chromosphere remains one of the most important questions in solar physics.
Our current understanding is that small-scale internetwork (IN) magnetic fields play an important
role as a heating agent. Indeed, cancellations of IN magnetic elements in the photosphere can produce
transient brightenings in the chromosphere and transition region. These bright structures might
be the signature of energy release and plasma heating, probably driven by magnetic reconnection
of IN field lines. Although single events are not expected to release large amounts of energy, their
global contribution to the chromosphere may be significant due to their ubiquitous presence in
quiet Sun regions. In this paper we study cancellations of IN elements and analyze their impact on
the energetics and dynamics of the quiet Sun atmosphere. We use high resolution, multiwavelength,
coordinated observations obtained with the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS) and
the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope (SST) to identify cancellations of IN magnetic flux patches and
follow their evolution. We find that, on average, these events live for ~3 minutes in the photosphere
and ~12 minutes in the chromosphere and/or transition region. Employing multi-line inversions
of the Mg II h & k lines we show that cancellations produce clear signatures of heating in the upper
atmospheric layers. However, at the resolution and sensitivity accessible to the SST, their number
density still seems to be one order of magnitude too low to explain the global chromospheric heating.
