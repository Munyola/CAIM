The repeating fast radio burst (FRB) 121102 was recently localized in a dwarf galaxy at a cosmological
distance. The dispersion measure (DM) derived for each burst from FRB 121102 so far has not shown
significant evolution, even though an apparent increase was recently seen with newly detected
VLA bursts. It is expected that more repeating FRB sources may be detected in the future. In this work,
we investigate a list of possible astrophysical processes that might cause DM variation of a particular
FRB source. The processes include (1) the cosmological scale effects such as Hubble expansion and
large-scale structure fluctuations; (2) the FRB local effects such as gas density fluctuation,
expansion of a supernova remnant, a pulsar wind nebula, and an HII region; and (3) the propagation
effect due to plasma lensing. We find that the DM variations contributed by the large-scale structure
are extremely small, and any observable DM variation is likely caused by the plasma local to the FRB
source. Besides mechanisms that produce decreasing DM with time, we suggest that an FRB source in
an expanding supernova remnant around a nearly neutral ambient medium during the deceleration
(Sedov-Taylor and snowplow) phases or in a growing HII region can introduce DM increasing. Some
effects (e.g. an FRB source moving in an HII region or plasma lensing) can give either positive or
negative DM variations. Future observations of DM variations of FRB 121102 and other repeating
FRB sources can bring important clues for the physical origin of these sources.
