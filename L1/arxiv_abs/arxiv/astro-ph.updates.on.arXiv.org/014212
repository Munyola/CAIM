Context. The water snowline divides dry and icy solid material in protoplanetary disks, and has
been thought to significantly affect planet formation at all stages. If dry particles break up more
easily than icy ones, then the snowline causes a traffic jam, because small grains drift inward at
lower speeds than larger pebbles. Aims. We aim to measure the effect of high dust concentrations
around the snowline onto the gas dynamics. Methods. Using numerical simulations, we model the global
radial evolution of an axisymmetric protoplanetary disk. Our model includes particle growth,
evaporation and recondensation of water, and the back-reaction of dust onto the gas, taking into
account the vertical distribution of dust particles. Results. We find that the dust back-reaction
can stop and even reverse the flux of gas outside the snowline, decreasing the gas accretion rate
onto the star to under $50\%$ of its initial value. At the same time the dust accumulates at the snowline,
reaching dust-to-gas ratios of $\epsilon \gtrsim 0.8$, and delivers large amounts of water vapor
towards the inner disk, as the icy particles cross the snowline. However, the accumulation of dust
at the snowline and the decrease in the gas accretion rate only take place if the global dust-to-gas
ratio is high ($\varepsilon_0 \gtrsim 0.03$), if the viscous turbulence is low ($\alpha_\nu \lesssim
10^{-3} $), if the disk is large enough ($r_c \gtrsim 100\, \textrm{AU}$), and only during the early
phases of the disk evolution ($t \lesssim 1\, \textrm{Myr}$). Otherwise the dust back-reaction
fails to perturb the gas motion.
