When Carl Sagan observed the Earth during a Gallileo fly-by in 1993, he found a widely distributed
surface pigment with a sharp reflection edge in the red part of the spectrum, which, together with
the abundance of gaseous oxygen and methane in extreme thermodynamic disequilibrium, were strongly
suggestive of the presence of life on Earth. This widespread pigmentation that could not be explained
by geological processes alone, is caused by the cellular structure of vegetation - a mechanism for
potentially limiting damage to chlorophyll and/or limiting water loss. The distinctive increase
in the red portion of Earth's global reflectance spectrum is called the vegetation red edge in astrobiology
literature and is one of the proposed surface biosignatures to search for on exoplanets and exomoons.
Earth's surface vegetation has only been widespread for about half a billion years, providing a
surface biosignature for approximately 1/9th our planet's lifetime. However, as chlorophyll
is present in many forms of life on Earth, like cyanobacteria, algae, lichen, corals, as well as leafy
vegetation, such a spectral red edge feature could indicate a wide range of life, expanding its use
for the search for surface biosignatures beyond vegetation alone to a time long before vegetation
became widespread on Earth. We show how lichens could extend the presence of Earth's red edge surface
biofeature to 1.2 Gyr ago, while ocean surface algae and cyanobacteria could extend it to over 2 Gyr
ago, expanding the use of a photosynthetic red edge to earlier times in Earth's history.
