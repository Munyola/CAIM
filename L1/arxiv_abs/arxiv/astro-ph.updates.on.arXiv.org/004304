High-energy gamma rays of interstellar origin are produced by the interaction of cosmic-ray (CR)
particles with the diffuse gas and radiation fields in the Galaxy. The main features of this emission
are well understood and are reproduced by existing CR propagation models employing 2D Galactocentric
cylindrically symmetrical geometry. However, the high-quality data from instruments like the
Fermi Large Area Telescope reveal significant deviations from the model predictions on few to tens
of degree scales indicating the need to include the details of the Galactic spiral structure and
thus require 3D spatial modelling. In this paper the high-energy interstellar emissions from the
Galaxy are calculated using the new release of the GALPROP code employing 3D spatial models for the
CR source and interstellar radiation field (ISRF) densities. Three models for the spatial distribution
of CR sources are used that are differentiated by their relative proportion of input luminosity
attributed to the smooth disc or spiral arms. Two ISRF models are developed based on stellar and dust
spatial density distributions taken from the literature that reproduce local near- to far-infrared
observations. The interstellar emission models that include arms and bulges for the CR source and
ISRF densities provide plausible physical interpretations for features found in the residual
maps from high-energy gamma-ray data analysis. The 3D models for CR and ISRF densities provide a
more realistic basis that can be used for the interpretation of the non-thermal interstellar emissions
from the Galaxy.
