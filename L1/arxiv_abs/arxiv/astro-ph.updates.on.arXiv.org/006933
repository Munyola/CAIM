X-ray reflection is a very powerful method to assess the spin of supermassive black holes (SMBHs)
in active galactic nuclei (AGN), yet not universally accepted. Indeed, complex reprocessing (absorption,
scattering) of the intrinsic spectra along the line of sight can mimic the relativistic effects
on which the spin measure is based. In this work, we test how reliable the SMBH spin measurements that
can be be currently achieved are, through the simulations of high-quality XMM-Newton and NuSTAR
spectra. Each member of our group simulated 10 spectra with multiple components that are typically
seen in AGN, such as warm and (partial-covering) neutral absorbers, relativistic and distant reflection,
and thermal emission. The resulting spectra were blindly analysed by the other two members. Out
of the 60 fits, 42 turned out to be physically accurate when compared to the input model. The SMBH spin
was retrieved with success in 31 cases, some of which (9) are even found among formally inaccurate
fits (although with looser constraints). We show that, at the high signal-to-noise ratio assumed
in our simulations, neither the complexity of the multi-layer, partial-covering absorber nor
the input value of the spin are the major drivers of our results. The height of the X-ray source (in
a lamp-post geometry) plays instead a crucial role in recovering the spin. In particular, a success
rate of 16/16 is found among the accurate fits for a dimensionless spin parameter larger than 0.8
and a lamp-post height lower than 5 gravitational radii.
