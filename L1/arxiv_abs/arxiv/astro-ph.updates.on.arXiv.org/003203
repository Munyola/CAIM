We present two new catalogues of superclusters of galaxies out to a redshit of z = 0.15, based on the
Abell/ACO cluster redshift compilation maintained by one of us (HA). The first of these catalogues,
the all-sky Main SuperCluster Catalogue (MSCC), is based on only the rich (A-) Abell clusters, and
the second one, the Southern SuperCluster Catalogue (SSCC), covers declinations delta < -17
deg and includes the supplementary Abell S-clusters. A tunable Friends-of-Friends (FoF) algorithm
was used to account for the cluster density decreasing with redshift and for different selection
functions in distinct areas of the sky. We present the full list of Abell clusters used, together
with their redshifts and supercluster memberships and including the isolated clusters. The SSCC
contains about twice the number of superclusters than MSCC for delta < -17 deg, which we found
to be due to: (1) new superclusters formed by A-clusters in their cores and surrounded by S-clusters
(50%), (2) new superclusters formed by S-clusters only (40%), (3) redistribution of member clusters
by fragmentation of rich (multiplicity m > 15) superclusters (8%), and (4) new superclusters
formed by the connection of A-clusters through bridges of S-clusters (2%). Power-law fits to the
cumulative supercluster multiplicity function yield slopes of alpha = -2.0 and alpha = -1.9 for
MSCC and SSCC respectively. This power-law behavior is in agreement with the findings for other
observational samples of superclusters, but not with that of catalogues based on cosmological
simulations.
