Properties of galaxies like their absolute magnitude and their stellar mass content are correlated.
These correlations are tighter for close pairs of galaxies, which is called galactic conformity.
In hierarchical structure formation scenarios, galaxies form within dark matter halos. To explain
the amplitude and the spatial range of galactic conformity two--halo terms or assembly bias become
important. With the scale dependent correlation coefficients the amplitude and the spatial range
of conformity are determined from galaxy and halo samples. The scale dependent correlation coefficients
are introduced as a new descriptive statistic to quantify the correlations between properties
of galaxies or halos, depending on the distances to other galaxies or halos. These scale dependent
correlation coefficients can be applied to the galaxy distribution directly. Neither a splitting
of the sample into subsamples, nor an a priori clustering is needed. This new descriptive statistic
is applied to galaxy catalogues derived from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey III and to halo catalogues
from the MultiDark simulations. In the galaxy sample the correlations between absolute Magnitude,
velocity dispersion, ellipticity, and stellar mass content are investigated. The correlations
of mass, spin, and ellipticity are explored in the halo samples. Both for galaxies and halos a scale
dependent conformity is confirmed. Moreover the scale dependent correlation coefficients reveal
a signal of conformity out to 40Mpc and beyond. The halo and galaxy samples show a differing amplitude
and range of conformity.
