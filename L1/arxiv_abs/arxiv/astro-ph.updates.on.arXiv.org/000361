We present multi-wavelength imagery of the merger remnant galaxy NGC 1316 with an objective to study
the content of dust and its association with the other phases of the ISM. Color-index maps as well
as extinction maps derived for this galaxy reveal an intricate and complex dust morphology in NGC
1316, i.e., in the inner part it exists in the form of a prominent lane while at about 6--7\,kpc it apparently
takes an arc-like pattern extended along the North-East direction. In addition to this, several
other dust clumps and knots are also evident in this galaxy. Dust emission mapped using \textit{Spitzer}
data at 8 $\mu$m indicates even more complex morphological structures of the dust in NGC1316. The
extinction curve derived over the optical to near-IR bands closely follows the standard Galactic
curve suggesting similar properties of the dust grains. The dust content of NGC 1316 estimated from
optical extinction is $\sim$ 2.13$\times\, 10^5$ \Msun. This is a lower limit compared to that estimated
using the IRAS flux densities $\sim$ 5.17$\times\, 10^6$ \Msun\, and flux densities at 24$\mu$m,
70$\mu$m and 160 $\mu$m from MIPS $\sim$ 3.2$\times\, 10^7$ \Msun. High resolution \textit{Chandra}
observations of this merger remnant system have provided with an unprecedented view of the complex
nature of hot gas distribution in NGC 1316 which closely matches the morphology of ionized gas and
to some extent with the dust also. X-ray color-color plot for the resolved sources within optical
D$_{25}$ extent of NGC 1316 has enabled us to separate them in different classes.
