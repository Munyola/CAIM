The Gemini Infrared Multi-Object Spectrograph (GIRMOS) is a powerful new instrument being built
to facility-class standards for the Gemini telescope. It takes advantage of the latest developments
in adaptive optics and integral field spectrographs. GIRMOS will carry out simultaneous high-angular-resolution,
spatially-resolved infrared ($1-2.4$ $\mu$m) spectroscopy of four objects within a two-arcminute
field-of-regard by taking advantage of multi-object adaptive optics. This capability does not
currently exist anywhere in the world and therefore offers significant scientific gains over a
very broad range of topics in astronomical research. For example, current programs for high redshift
galaxies are pushing the limits of what is possible with infrared spectroscopy at $8-10$-meter
class facilities by requiring up to several nights of observing time per target. Therefore, the
observation of multiple objects simultaneously with adaptive optics is absolutely necessary
to make effective use of telescope time and obtain statistically significant samples for high redshift
science. With an expected commissioning date of 2023, GIRMOS's capabilities will also make it a
key followup instrument for the James Webb Space Telescope when it is launched in 2021, as well as
a true scientific and technical pathfinder for future Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT) multi-object
spectroscopic instrumentation. In this paper, we will present an overview of this instrument's
capabilities and overall architecture. We also highlight how this instrument lays the ground work
for a future TMT early-light instrument.
