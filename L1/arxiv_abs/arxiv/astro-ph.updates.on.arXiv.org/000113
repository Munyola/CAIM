We present the strongest current constraints on primordial non-Gaussianity (PNG) from a collection
of galaxy surveys, combining large-scale clustering measurements and their cross-correlations
with the cosmic microwave background. We update the data sets used by Giannantonio et al. (2012),
and broaden that analysis to include the full set of two-point correlation functions between all
surveys. In order to obtain the most reliable constraints on PNG, we advocate the use of the cross-correlations
between the catalogs as a robust estimator and we perform an extended analysis of the possible systematics
to reduce their impact on the results. To minimize the impact of stellar contamination in our luminous
red galaxy (LRG) sample, we use the recent Baryon Oscillations Spectroscopic Survey catalog of
Ross et al. (2011). We also find evidence for a new systematic in the NVSS radio galaxy survey similar
to, but smaller than, the known declination-dependent issue; by weighting the observed data with
randomized catalogs in right ascension and declination, such problems can be moderated significantly.
We find no evidence of primordial non-Gaussianity; for the local-type configuration we obtain
for the skewness parameter -37 < fNL < 25 at 95% c.l. when using the most conservative part of
our data set, improving previous results by 30%; we also find no evidence for significant kurtosis,
parameterized by gNL. In addition to PNG, we simultaneously constrain dark energy and find that
it is required with a form consistent with a cosmological constant.
