We explore the question of whether the interior state of massive red supergiant supernova progenitors
can be effectively probed with asteroseismology. We have computed a suite of ten models with ZAMS
masses from 15 to 25 m_sun in intervals of 1 m_sun, including the effects of rotation, with the stellar
evolutionary code MESA. We estimate characteristic frequencies and convective luminosities
of convective zones at two illustrative stages, core helium burning and off-center convective
carbon burning. We also estimate the power that might be delivered to the surface to modulate the
luminous output considering various efficiencies and dissipation mechanisms. The inner convective
regions should generate waves with characteristic periods of ~20 days in core helium burning, ~10
days in helium shell burning, and 0.1 to 1 day in shell carbon burning. Acoustic waves may avoid both
shock and diffusive dissipation relatively early in core helium burning throughout most of the
structure. In shell carbon burning, years before explosion, the signal generated in the helium
shell might in some circumstances be weak enough to avoid shock dissipation, but is subject to strong
thermal dissipation in the hydrogen envelope. Signals from a convective carbon-burning shell
are very likely to be even more severely damped within the envelope. In the most optimistic case,
early in core helium burning, waves arriving close to the surface could represent luminosity fluctuations
of a few millimagnitudes, but the conditions in the very outer reaches of the envelope suggest severe
thermal damping there.
