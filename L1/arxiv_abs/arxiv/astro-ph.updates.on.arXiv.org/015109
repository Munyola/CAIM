The 180-day Space Telescope and Optical Reverberation Mapping campaign on NGC 5548 discovered
an anomalous period, the broad-line region (BLR) holiday, in which the emission lines decorrelated
from the continuum variations. This is important since the correlation between the continuum-flux
variations and the emission-line response is the basic assumption for black hole (BH) mass determinations
through reverberation mapping. During the BLR holiday, the high-ionization intrinsic absorption
lines also decorrelated from the continuum as a result of variable covering factor of the line of
sight (LOS) obscurer. The emission lines are not confined to the LOS, so this does not explain the
BLR holiday. If the LOS obscurer is a disk wind, its streamlines must extend down to the plane of the
disk and the base of the wind would lie between the BH and the BLR, forming an equatorial obscurer.
This obscurer can be transparent to ionizing radiation, or can be translucent, blocking only parts
of the SED, depending on its density. An emission-line holiday is produced if the wind density increases
only slightly above its transparent state. Both obscurers are parts of the same wind, so they can
have associated behavior in a way that explains both holidays. A very dense wind would block nearly
all ionizing radiation, producing a Seyfert 2 and possibly providing a contributor to the changing-look
AGN phenomenon. Disk winds are very common and we propose that the equatorial obscurers are too,
but mostly in a transparent state.
