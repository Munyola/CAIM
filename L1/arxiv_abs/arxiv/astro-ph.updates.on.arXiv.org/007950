We measure the velocity dispersion, $\sigma$, and surface density, $\Sigma$, of the molecular
gas in nearby galaxies from CO spectral line cubes with spatial resolution $45$-$120$ pc, matched
to the size of individual giant molecular clouds. Combining $11$ galaxies from the PHANGS-ALMA
survey with $4$ targets from the literature, we characterize ${\sim}30,000$ independent sightlines
where CO is detected at good significance. $\Sigma$ and $\sigma$ show a strong positive correlation,
with the best-fit power law slope close to the expected value for resolved, self-gravitating clouds.
This indicates only weak variation in the virial parameter $\alpha_\mathrm{vir}\propto\sigma^2/\Sigma$,
which is ${\sim}1.5$-$3.0$ for most galaxies. We do, however, observe enormous variation in the
internal turbulent pressure $P_\mathrm{turb}\propto\Sigma\,\sigma^2$, which spans ${\sim}5\rm\;dex$
across our sample. We find $\Sigma$, $\sigma$, and $P_\mathrm{turb}$ to be systematically larger
in more massive galaxies. The same quantities appear enhanced in the central kpc of strongly barred
galaxies relative to their disks. Based on sensitive maps of M31 and M33, the slope of the $\sigma$-$\Sigma$
relation flattens at $\Sigma\lesssim10\rm\;M_\odot\,pc^{-2}$, leading to high $\sigma$ for
a given $\Sigma$ and high apparent $\alpha_\mathrm{vir}$. This echoes results found in the Milky
Way, and likely originates from a combination of lower beam filling factors and a stronger influence
of local environment on the dynamical state of molecular gas in the low density regime.
