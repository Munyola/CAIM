We present the first three-dimensional (3D), hydrodynamic simulations of the core convection
zone (CZ) and extended radiative zone spanning from 1% to 90% of the stellar radius of an intermediate
mass (3 $\mathrm{M}_\odot$) star. This allows us to self-consistently follow the generation of
internal gravity waves (IGWs) at the convective boundary and their propagation to the surface.
We find that convection in the core is dominated by plumes. The frequency spectrum in the CZ and that
of IGW generation is a double power law as seen in previous two-dimensional (2D) simulations. The
spectrum is significantly flatter than theoretical predictions using excitation through Reynolds
stresses induced by convective eddies alone. It is compatible with excitation through plume penetration.
An empirically determined distribution of plume frequencies generally matches the one necessary
to explain a large part of the observed spectrum. We observe waves propagating in the radiation zone
and excited standing modes, which can be identified as gravity and fundamental modes. They show
similar frequencies and node patterns to those predicted by the stellar oscillation code GYRE.
The continuous part of the spectrum fulfills the IGW dispersion relation. A spectrum of tangential
velocity and temperature fluctuations close to the surface is extracted, which are directly related
to observable brightness variations in stars. Unlike 2D simulations we do not see the high frequencies
associated with wave breaking, likely because these 3D simulations are more heavily damped.
