The masses of galaxy clusters are a key tool to constrain cosmology through the physics of large-scale
structure formation and accretion. Mass estimates based on X-ray and Sunyaev--Zel'dovich measurements
have been found to be affected by the contribution of non-thermal pressure components, due e.g.
to kinetic gas energy. The characterization of possible ordered motions (e.g. rotation) of the
intra-cluster medium could be important to recover cluster masses accurately. We update the study
of gas rotation in clusters through the maps of the kinetic Sunyaev--Zel'dovich effect, using a
large sample of massive synthetic galaxy clusters ($ M_{vir} > 5\times 10^{14} h^{-1}$M$_\odot$
at $z~=~0 $) from MUSIC high-resolution simulations. We select few relaxed objects showing peculiar
rotational features, as outlined in a companion work. To verify whether it is possible to reconstruct
the expected radial profile of the rotational velocity, we fit the maps to a theoretical model accounting
for a specific rotational law, referred as the vp2b model. We find that our procedure allows to recover
the parameters describing the gas rotational velocity profile within two standard deviations,
both with and without accounting for the bulk velocity of the cluster. The amplitude of the temperature
distortion produced by the rotation is consistent with theoretical estimates found in the literature,
and it is of the order of 23 per cent of the maximum signal produced by the cluster bulk motion. We also
recover the bulk velocity projected on the line of sight consistently with the simulation true value.
