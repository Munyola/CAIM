In this second paper of the series on internal gravity waves (IGWs), we present a study of the generation
and propagation of IGWs in a model solar atmosphere with diverse magnetic conditions. A magnetic
field free, and three magnetic models that start with an initial, vertical, homogeneous field of
10 G, 50 G, and 100 G magnetic flux density, are simulated using the CO$^{\rm 5}$BOLD code. We find
that the IGWs are generated in similar manner in all four models in spite of the differences in the
magnetic environment. The mechanical energy carried by IGWs is significantly larger than that
of the acoustic waves in the lower part of the atmosphere, making them an important component of the
total wave energy budget. The mechanical energy flux (10$^{6}$ - 10$^{3}$ W m$^{-2}$) is few orders
of magnitude larger than the Poynting flux (10$^{3}$ - 10$^{1}$ W m$^{-2}$). The Poynting fluxes
show a downward component in the frequency range corresponding to the IGWs, which confirm that these
waves do not propagate upwards in the atmosphere when the fields are predominantly vertical and
strong. We conclude that, in the upper photosphere, the propagation properties of IGWs depend on
the average magnetic field strength and therefore these waves can be potential candidate for magnetic
field diagnostics of these layers. However, their subsequent coupling to Alfv\'{e}nic waves are
unlikely in a magnetic environment permeated with predominantly vertical fields and therefore
they may not directly or indirectly contribute to the heating of layers above plasma-$\beta$ less
than 1.
