We address a simple model where the Kennicutt-Schmidt (KS) relation between the macroscopic densities
of star-formation rate (SFR, $\rho_{\rm sfr}$) and gas ($n$) in galactic discs emerges from self-regulation
of the SFR via supernova feedback. It arises from the physics of supernova bubbles, insensitive
to the microscopic SFR recipe and not explicitly dependent on gravity. The key is that the filling
factor of SFR-suppressed supernova bubbles self-regulates to a constant, $f\sim 0.5$. Expressing
the bubble fading radius and time in terms of $n$, the filling factor is $f \propto S\,n^{-s}$ with
$s\sim 1.5$, where $S$ is the supernova rate density. A constant $f$ thus refers to $\rho_{\rm sfr}
\propto n^{1.5}$, with a density-independent SFR efficiency per free-fall time $\sim 0.01$. The
self-regulation to $f \sim 0.5$ and the convergence to a KS relation independent of the local SFR
recipe are demonstrated in cosmological and isolated-galaxy simulations using different codes
and recipes. In parallel, the spherical analysis of bubble evolution is generalized to clustered
supernovae, analytically and via simulations, yielding $s \simeq 1.5 \pm 0.5$. An analysis of photo-ionized
bubbles about pre-supernova stars yields a range of KS slopes but the KS relation is dominated by
the supernova bubbles. Superbubble blowouts may lead to an alternative self-regulation by outflows
and recycling. While the model is over-simplified, its simplicity and validity in the simulations
may argue that it captures the origin of the KS relation.
