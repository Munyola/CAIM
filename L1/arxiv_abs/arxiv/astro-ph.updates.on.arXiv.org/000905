After off-center C ignition in the cores of super-AGB stars the C flame propagates all the way down
to the center, trailing behind it the C-shell convective zone, and thus building a degenerate ONe
core. This standard picture is obtained in stellar evolution simulations if the bottom C-shell
convection boundary is assumed to be a discontinuity associated with a strict interpretation of
the Schwarzschild condition for convective instability. However, this boundary is prone to additional
mixing processes, such as thermohaline convection and convective boundary mixing. Using hydrodynamic
simulations we show that, contrary to previous results, thermohaline mixing is too inefficient
to interfere with the C-flame propagation. However, even a small amount of convective boundary
mixing removes the physical conditions required for the C-flame propagation all the way to the center.
This result holds even if we allow for some turbulent heat transport in the CBM region. As a result,
super AGB stars build in their interiors hybrid C-O-Ne degenerate cores composed of a relatively
large CO core (M_CO ~ 0.2 M_sun) surrounded by a thick ONe zone (M_ONe ~ 0.85 M_sun) with another thin
CO layer above. If exposed by mass loss, these cores will become hybrid C-O-Ne white dwarfs. Otherwise,
the ignition of C-rich material in the central core, surrounded by the thick ONe zone, may trigger
a thermonuclear supernova explosion. The quenching of the C-flame may have implications for the
ignition mechanism of SN Ia in the double-degenerate merger scenario.
