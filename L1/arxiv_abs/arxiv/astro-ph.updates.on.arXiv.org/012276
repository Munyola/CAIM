Halos and galaxies acquire their angular momentum during the collapse of surrounding large-scale
structure. This process imprints alignments between galaxy spins and nearby filaments and sheets.
Low mass halos grow by accretion onto filaments, aligning their spins with the filaments, whereas
high mass halos grow by mergers along filaments, generating spins perpendicular to the filament.
We search for this alignment signal using filaments identified with the "Cosmic Web Reconstruction"
algorithm applied to the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Main Galaxy Sample and galaxy spins from the MaNGA
integral-field unit survey. MaNGA produces a map of the galaxy's rotational velocity, allowing
direct measurement of the galaxy's spin direction, or unit angular momentum vector projected onto
the sky. We find no evidence for alignment between galaxy spins and filament directions. We do find
hints of a mass-dependent alignment signal, which is in 2-3$\sigma$ tension with the mass-dependent
alignment signal in the MassiveBlack-II and Illustris hydrodynamical simulations. However,
the tension vanishes when galaxy spin is measured using the H$\alpha$ emission line velocity rather
than stellar velocity. Finally, in simulations we find that the mass-dependent transition from
aligned to anti-aligned dark matter halo spins is not necessarily present in stellar spins: we find
a stellar spin transition in Illustris but not in MassiveBlack-II, highlighting the sensitivity
of spin-filament alignments to feedback prescriptions and subgrid physics.
