(Abridged) This is the Maunakea Spectroscopic Explorer 2018 book. It is intended as a concise reference
guide to all aspects of the scientific and technical design of MSE, for the international astronomy
and engineering communities, and related agencies. The current version is a status report of MSE's
science goals and their practical implementation, following the System Conceptual Design Review,
held in January 2018. MSE is a planned 10-m class, wide-field, optical and near-infrared facility,
designed to enable transformative science, while filling a critical missing gap in the emerging
international network of large-scale astronomical facilities. MSE is completely dedicated to
multi-object spectroscopy of samples of between thousands and millions of astrophysical objects.
It will lead the world in this arena, due to its unique design capabilities: it will boast a large (11.25
m) aperture and wide (1.52 sq. degree) field of view; it will have the capabilities to observe at a
wide range of spectral resolutions, from R2500 to R40,000, with massive multiplexing (4332 spectra
per exposure, with all spectral resolutions available at all times), and an on-target observing
efficiency of more than 80%. MSE will unveil the composition and dynamics of the faint Universe and
is designed to excel at precision studies of faint astrophysical phenomena. It will also provide
critical follow-up for multi-wavelength imaging surveys, such as those of the Large Synoptic Survey
Telescope, Gaia, Euclid, the Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope, the Square Kilometre Array,
and the Next Generation Very Large Array.
