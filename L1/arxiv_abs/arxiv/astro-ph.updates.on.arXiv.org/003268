Simulating the evolution of the local universe is important for studying galaxies and the intergalactic
medium in a way free of cosmic variance. Here we present a method to reconstruct the initial linear
density field from an input non-linear density field, employing the Hamiltonian Markov Chain Monte
Carlo (HMC) algorithm combined with Particle Mesh (PM) dynamics. The HMC+PM method is applied to
cosmological simulations, and the reconstructed linear density fields are then evolved to the
present day with N-body simulations. The constrained simulations so obtained accurately reproduce
both the amplitudes and phases of the input simulations at various $z$. Using a PM model with a grid
cell size of 0.75 Mpc/h and 40 time-steps in the HMC can recover more than half of the phase information
down to a scale k~0.85 h/Mpc at high z and to k~3.4 h/Mpc at z=0, which represents a significant improvement
over similar reconstruction models in the literature, and indicates that our model can reconstruct
the formation histories of cosmic structures over a large dynamical range. Adopting PM models with
higher spatial and temporal resolutions yields even better reconstructions, suggesting that
our method is limited more by the availability of computer resource than by principle. Dynamic models
of structure evolution adopted in many earlier investigations can induce non-Gaussianity in the
reconstructed linear density field, which in turn can cause large systematic deviations in the
predicted halo mass function. Such deviations are greatly reduced or absent in our reconstruction.
