We study the galaxy clustering dependence on the $\left[\mathrm{O\scriptsize{II}}\right]$
emission line luminosity in the SDSS DR7 Main galaxy sample at mean redshift $z\sim0.1$. We select
volume-limited samples of galaxies with different $\left[\mathrm{O\scriptsize{II}}\right]$
luminosity thresholds and measure their projected, monopole and quadrupole two-point correlation
functions. We model these observations using the 1$h^{-1}\rm{Gpc}$ MultiDark Planck cosmological
simulation and generate light-cones with the SUrvey GenerAtoR algorithm. To interpret our results,
we adopt a modified (Sub)Halo Abundance Matching scheme, accounting for the stellar mass incompleteness
of the emission line galaxies. The satellite fraction constitutes an extra parameter in this model
and allows to optimize the clustering fit on both small and intermediate scales (i.e. $r_p\lesssim
30h^{-1}\rm{Mpc})$, with no need of any velocity bias correction. We find that, in the local Universe,
the $\left[\mathrm{O\scriptsize{II}}\right]$ luminosity correlates with all the clustering
statistics explored and with the galaxy bias. This latter quantity correlates more strongly with
the SDSS $r$-band magnitude than $\left[\mathrm{O\scriptsize{II}}\right]$ luminosity. In
conclusion, we propose a straightforward method to produce reliable clustering models, entirely
built on the simulation products, which provides robust predictions of the typical ELG host halo
masses and satellite fraction values. The SDSS galaxy data, MultiDark mock catalogues and clustering
results are made publicly available.
