We perform a simulation using the Astrophysical Multipurpose Software Environment of the Orion
Trapezium star cluster in which the evolution of the stars and the dynamics of planetary systems
are taken into account. The initial conditions from earlier simulations were selected in which
the size and mass distributions of the observed circumstellar disks in this cluster are satisfactorily
reproduced. Four, five, or size planets per star were introduced in orbit around the 500 solar-like
stars with a maximum orbital separation of 400au. Our study focuses on the production of free-floating
planets. A total of 357 become unbound from a total of 2522 planets in the initial conditions of the
simulation. Of these, 281 leave the cluster within the crossing timescale of the star cluster; the
others remain bound to the cluster as free-floating intra-cluster planets. Five of these free-floating
intra-cluster planets are captured at a later time by another star. The two main mechanisms by which
planets are lost from their host star, ejection upon a strong encounter with another star or internal
planetary scattering, drive the evaporation independent of planet mass of orbital separation
at birth. The effect of small perturbations due to slow changes in the cluster potential are important
for the evolution of planetary systems. In addition, the probability of a star to lose a planet is
independent of the planet mass and independent of its initial orbital separation. As a consequence,
the mass distribution of free-floating planets indistinguishable from the mass distribution
of planets bound to their host star.
