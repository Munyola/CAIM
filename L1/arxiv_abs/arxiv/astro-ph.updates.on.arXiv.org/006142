The core component width in normal pulsars, with periods ($P$) $>$ 0.1 seconds, measured at the half-power
point at 1 GHz has a lower boundary line (LBL) which closely follows the $P^{-0.5}$ scaling relation.
This result is of fundamental importance for understanding the emission process and requires extended
studies over a wider frequency range. In this paper we have carried out a detailed study of the profile
component widths of 123 normal pulsars observed in the Meterwavelength Single-pulse Polarimetric
Emission Survey at 333 and 618 MHz. The components in the pulse profile were separated into core and
conal classes. We found that at both frequencies the core as well as the conal component widths versus
period had a LBL which followed the $P^{-0.5}$ relation with a similar lower boundary. The radio
emission in normal pulsars have been observationally shown to arise from a narrow range of heights
around a few hundred kilometers above the stellar surface. In the past the $P^{-0.5}$ relation has
been considered as evidence for emission arising from last open dipolar magnetic field lines. We
show that the $P^{-0.5}$ dependence only holds if the trailing and leading half-power points of
the component are associated with the last open field line. In such a scenario we do not find any physical
motivation which can explain the $P^{-0.5}$ dependence for both core and conal components as evidence
for dipolar geometry in normal pulsars. We believe the period dependence is a result of an yet unexplained
physical phenomenon.
