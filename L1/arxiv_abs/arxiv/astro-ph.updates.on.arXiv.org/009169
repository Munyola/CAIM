We present recent ALMA observations of the CO(1-0) and CO(3-2) emission lines in the brightest cluster
galaxy of RXCJ1504.1$-$0248, which is one of the most extreme cool core clusters known. The central
galaxy contains $1.9\times 10^{10}~M_{\odot}$ of molecular gas. The molecular gas morphology
is complex and disturbed, showing no evidence for a rotationally-supported structure in equilibrium.
$80\%$ of the gas is situated within the central 5 kpc of the galactic center, while the remaining
gas is located in a 20 kpc long filament. The cold gas has likely condensed out of the hot atmosphere.
The filament is oriented along the edge of a putative X-ray cavity, suggesting that AGN activity
has stimulated condensation. This is enegetically feasible, although the morphology is not as
conclusive as systems whose molecular filaments trail directly behind buoyant radio bubbles.
The velocity gradient along the filament is smooth and shallow. It is only consistent with free-fall
if it lies within $20^{\circ}$ of the plane of the sky. The abundance of clusters with comparably
low velocities suggests that the filament is not free-falling. Both the central and filamentary
gas are coincident with bright UV emission from ongoing star formation. Star formation near the
cluster core is consistent with the Kennicutt-Schmidt law. The filament exhibits increased star
formation surface densities, possibly resulting from either the consumption of a finite molecular
gas supply or spatial variations in the CO-to-H$_2$ conversion factor.
