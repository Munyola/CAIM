Massive-star binaries can undergo a phase where one of the two stars expands during its advanced
evolutionary stage as a giant and envelops its companion, ejecting the hydrogen envelope and tightening
its orbit. Such a common envelope phase is required to tighten the binary orbit in the formation of
many of the observed X-ray binaries and merging compact binary systems. In the formation scenario
for neutron star binaries, the system might pass through a phase where a neutron star spirals into
the envelope of its giant star companion. These phases lead to mass accretion onto the neutron star.
Accretion onto these common-envelope-phase neutron stars can eject matter that has undergone
burning near to the neutron star surface. This paper presents nucleosynthetic yields of this ejected
matter, using population synthesis models to study the importance of these nucleosynthetic yields
in a galactic chemical evolution context. Depending on the extreme conditions in temperature and
density found in the accreted material, both proton-rich and neutron-rich nucleosynthesis can
be obtained, with efficient production of neutron rich isotopes of low Z material at the most extreme
conditions, and proton rich isotopes, again at low Z, in lower density models. Final yields are found
to be extremely sensitive to the physical modeling of the accretion phase. We show that neutron stars
accreting in binary common envelopes might be a new relevant site for galactic chemical evolution,
and therefore more comprehensive studies are needed to better constrain nucleosynthesis in these
objects.
