We used radio observations of the neighbour galaxy M31 in order to put constraints on dark matter
particle mass and annihilation cross section. Dark matter annihilation in M31 halo produces highly
energetic leptons, which emit synchrotron radiation on radio frequencies in the galactic magnetic
field. We predicted expected radio fluxes for the two annihilation channels: \chi\chi -> bb*
and \chi\chi -> \tau^+\tau^-. We then compared them with available data on the central radio
emission of M31 as observed by four radio surveys: VLSS (74 MHz), WENSS (325 MHz), NVSS (1400 MHz)
and GB6 (4850 MHz). Assuming a standard NFW dark matter density profile and a conservative magnetic
field distribution inside the Andromeda galaxy, we find that the thermal relic annihilation cross
section <\sigma v> = 3*10^{-26} cm^3/s or higher are only allowed for WIMP masses greater
than 100 GeV and 55 GeV for annihilation into bb* and \tau^+\tau^- respectively. Taking into account
potential uncertainties in the distributions of DM density and magnetic field, the mentioned WIMP
limiting masses can be as low as 23 GeV for both channels, and as high as 280 and 130 GeV for annihilation
into bb* and \tau^+\tau^- respectively. These mass values exceed the best up-to-day known constraints
from Fermi gamma observations: 40 GeV and 19 GeV respectively [A.Geringer-Sameth and S.M.Koushiappas,
Phys. Rev. Lett. 107, 241303 (2011)]. Precise measurements of the magnetic field in the relevant
region and better reconstruction of the DM density profile of M31 will be able to reduce the uncertainties
of our exclusion limits.
