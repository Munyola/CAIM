Mergers of binary black holes on eccentric orbits are among the targets for second-generation ground-based
gravitational-wave detectors. These sources may commonly form in galactic nuclei due to gravitational-wave
emission during close flyby events of single objects. We determine the distributions of initial
orbital parameters for a population of these gravitational-wave sources. Our results show that
the initial dimensionless pericenter distance systematically decreases with the binary component
masses and the mass of the central supermassive black hole, and its distribution depends sensitively
on the highest possible black hole mass in the nuclear star cluster. For a multi-mass black hole population
with masses between 5 Msun and 80 Msun, we find that between 43-69% (68-94%) of 30 Msun - 30 Msun (10
Msun - 10 Msun) sources have an eccentricity greater than 0.1 when the gravitational-wave signal
reaches 10 Hz, but less than 10% of the sources with binary component masses less than 30 Msun remain
eccentric at this level near the last stable orbit (LSO). The eccentricity at LSO is typically between
0.005-0.05 for the lower-mass BHs, and 0.1 - 0.2 for the highest-mass BHs. Thus, due to the limited
low-frequency sensitivity, the six currently known quasi-circular LIGO/Virgo sources could
still be compatible with this originally highly eccentric source population. However, at the design
sensitivity of these instruments, the measurement of the eccentricity and mass distribution of
merger events may be a useful diagnostic to identify the fraction of GW sources formed in this channel.
