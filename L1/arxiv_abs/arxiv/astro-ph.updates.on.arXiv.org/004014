Context. Observations have shown that twisted magnetic fields naturally occur, and indeed are
omnipresent in the Sun's atmosphere. It is therefore of great theoretical interest in solar atmospheric
waves research to investigate the types of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) wave modes that can propagate
along twisted magnetic flux tubes. Aims. Within the framework of ideal MHD, the main aim of this work
is to investigate small amplitude incompressible wave modes of twisted magnetic flux tubes with
m more or equal 1. The axial magnetic field strength inside and outside the tube will be allowed to
vary, to ensure the results will not be restricted to only cold plasma equilibria conditions. Methods.
The dispersion equation for these incompressible linear MHD wave modes was derived analytically
by implementing the long wavelength approximation. Results. It is shown, in the long wavelength
limit, that both the frequency and radial velocity profile of the m = 1 kink mode are completely unaffected
by the choice of internal background magnetic twist. However, fluting modes with m more or equal
2 are sensitive to the particular radial profile of magnetic twist chosen. Furthermore, due to background
twist, a low frequency cut-off is introduced for fluting modes that is not present for kink modes.
From an observational point of view, although magnetic twist does not affect the propagation of
long wavelength kink modes, for fluting modes it will either work for or against the propagation,
depending on the direction of wave travel relative to the sign of the background twist.
