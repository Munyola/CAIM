Bars are common galactic structures in the local universe that play an important role in the secular
evolution of galaxies, including the Milky Way. In particular, the velocity distribution of individual
stars in our galaxy is useful to shed light on stellar dynamics, and provides information complementary
to that inferred from the integrated light of external galaxies. However, since a wide variety of
models reproduce the distribution of velocity and the velocity dispersion observed in the Milky
Way, we look for signatures of the bar on higher-order moments of the line-of-sight velocity ($V_{los}$)
distribution. We make use of two different numerical simulations --one that has developed a bar
and one that remains nearly axisymmetric-- to compare them with observations in the latest APOGEE
data release (SDSS DR14). This comparison reveals three interesting structures that support the
notion that the Milky Way is a barred galaxy. A high skewness region found at positive longitudes
constrains the orientation angle of the bar, and is incompatible with the orientation of the bar
at $\ell=0^\circ$ proposed in previous studies. We also analyse the $V_{los}$ distributions in
three regions, and introduce the Hellinger distance to quantify the differences among them. Our
results show a strong non-Gaussian distribution both in the data and in the barred model, confirming
the qualitative conclusions drawn from the velocity maps. In contrast to earlier work, we conclude
it is possible to infer the presence of the bar from the kurtosis distribution.
