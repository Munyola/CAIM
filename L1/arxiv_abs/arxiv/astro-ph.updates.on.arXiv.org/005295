We analyze pulse properties of Short gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) from a new catalog containing 434 pulses
from 387 BATSE Time-Tagged Event (TTE) GRBs. Short GRB pulses exhibit correlated properties of
duration, fluence, hardness, and amplitude, and they evolve hard-to-soft while undergoing similar
triple-peaked light curves similar to those found in Long/Intermediate bursts. We classify pulse
light curves using their temporal complexities, demonstrating that Short GRB pulses exhibit a
range of complexities from smooth to highly variable. Most of the bright, hard, chaotic emission
seen in complex pulses seems to represent a separate highly-variable emission component. Unlike
Long/Intermediate bursts, as many as 90\% of Short GRBs are single-pulsed. However, emission in
Short multi-pulsed bursts is coupled such that the first pulse's duration is a predictor of both
the interpulse separation and subsequent pulse durations. These results strongly support the
idea that external shocks produce the prompt emission seen in Short GRBs. The similarities between
the triple-peaked structures and spectral evolution of Long, Short, and Intermediate GRBs then
suggests that external shocks are responsible for the prompt emission observed in all GRB classes.
In addition to these findings, we identify a new type of gamma-ray transient in which peak amplitudes
occur at the end of the burst rather than at earlier times. Some of these "Crescendo" bursts are preceded
by rapid-fire "Staccato" pulses, whereas the remaining are preceded by a variable episode that
could be unresolved staccato pulses.
