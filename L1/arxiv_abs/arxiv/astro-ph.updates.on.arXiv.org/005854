We present wide and deep photometry of the northwest part of the halo of the Andromeda galaxy (M31)
using Hyper Suprime-Cam on the Subaru Telescope. The survey covers 9.2 deg$^{2}$ field in the $g$,
$i$, and $NB515$ bands and shows a clear red giant branch (RGB) of M31's halo stars and a pronounced
red clump (RC) feature. The spatial distribution of RC stars shows a prominent stream feature, the
North Western (NW) Stream, and a diffuse substructure in the south part of our survey field. We estimate
the distances based on the RC method and obtain $(m-M)$ = 24.63$\pm 0.191$(random)$\pm0.057$(systematic)
and 24.29$\pm 0.211$(random)$\pm0.057$(systematic) mag for the NW stream and diffuse substructure,
respectively, implying that the NW Stream is located behind M31, whereas the diffuse substructure
is located in front. We also estimate line-of-sight distances along the NW Stream and find that the
south part of the stream is $\sim$20 kpc closer to us relative to the north part. The distance to the
NW Stream inferred from the isochrone fitting to the color-magnitude diagram favors the RC-based
distance, but the TRGB-based distance estimated for $NB515$-selected RGB stars does not agree
with it. The surface number density distribution of RC stars across the NW Stream is found to be approximately
Gaussian with a FWHM of $\sim$25 arcmin (5.7 kpc), with a slight skew to the south-west side. That
along the NW Stream shows a complicated structure including variations in number density and a significant
gap in the stream.
