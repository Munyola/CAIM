We have observed 104 gravitationally-lensed active galactic nuclei (AGN) at $z\sim1-4$ with $Herschel$/SPIRE,
the largest such sample ever studied. By targeting gravitational lenses, we probe intrinsic far-infrared
(FIR) luminosities and star formation rates (SFRs) more typical of the population than the extremely
luminous sources that are otherwise accessible. We detect 71 percent (74 sources) of the sample,
of which 66 percent (69 sources) have spectral energy distributions (SEDs) that are characteristic
of heated dust emission. For objects with sufficiently constrained SEDs, we find a median modified
black body dust temperature of $38^{+12}_{-5}$ K. We derive a median magnification-corrected
FIR luminosity of $3.7^{+4.9}_{-2.4} \times 10^{11}\ {\rm L_{\odot}}$ and a median SFR of $110^{+160}_{-70}\
{\rm M_{\odot} yr^{-1}}$ for the sample. By applying the radio-infrared correlation, we find no
evidence for an FIR excess which, in addition to the low dust temperatures, is consistent with dust
heating that is dominated by star formation. These results are in line with current models of quasar
evolution, but suggest that most quasars exist in a transitional phase between a dusty star-forming
galaxy and an AGN-dominated system. Synchrotron emission is found to dominate at FIR wavelengths
for $<15$ percent of those sources classified as powerful radio galaxies from cm-wavelength observations.
We find the FIR luminosities of radio-bright quasars are lower on average, however further investigation
of individual objects is required to correct for systematic biases.
