Spectral properties of the turbulent cascade from fluid to kinetic scales in collisionless plasmas
are investigated by means of large-size three-dimensional (3D) hybrid (fluid electrons, kinetic
protons) particle-in-cell simulations. Initially isotropic Alfv\`enic fluctuations rapidly
develop a strongly anisotropic turbulent cascade, mainly in the direction perpendicular to the
ambient magnetic field. The omnidirectional magnetic field spectrum shows a double power-law
behavior over almost two decades in wavenumber, with a Kolmogorov-like index at large scales, a
spectral break around ion scales, and a steepening at sub-ion scales. Power laws are also observed
in the spectra of the ion bulk velocity, density, and electric field, both at magnetohydrodynamic
(MHD) and at kinetic scales. Despite the complex structure, the omnidirectional spectra of all
fields at ion and sub-ion scales are in remarkable quantitative agreement with those of a two-dimensional
(2D) simulation with similar physical parameters. This provides a partial, a-posteriori validation
of the 2D approximation at kinetic scales. Conversely, at MHD scales, the spectra of the density
and of the velocity (and, consequently, of the electric field) exhibit differences between the
2D and 3D cases. Although they can be partly ascribed to the lower spatial resolution, the main reason
is likely the larger importance of compressible effects in a full geometry. Our findings are also
in remarkable quantitative agreement with solar wind observations.
