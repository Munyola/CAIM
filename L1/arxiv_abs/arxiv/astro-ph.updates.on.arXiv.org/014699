Context. The deuterium fraction in low-mass prestellar cores is a good diagnostic indicator of
the initial phases of star formations, and it is also a fundamental quantity to infer the ionisation
degree in these objects. Aims. With the analysis of multiple transitions of $\rm N_2H^+$, $\rm N_2D^+$,
$\rm HC^{18}O^+$ and $\rm DCO^+$ we are able to determine the molecular column density maps and the
deuterium fraction in $\rm N_2H^+$ and $\rm HCO^+$ toward the prototypical prestellar core L1544.
This is the preliminary step to derive the ionisation degree in the source. Methods. We use a non-local
thermodynamic equilibrium (non-LTE) radiative transfer code, combined with the molecular abundances
derived from a chemical model, to infer the excitation conditions of all the observed transitions,
which allows us to derive reliable maps of each molecule's column density. The ratio between the
column density of a deuterated species and its non-deuterated counterpart gives the searched deuteration
level. Results. The non-LTE analysis confirms that, for the analysed molecules, higher-J transitions
are characterised by excitation temperatures $\approx 1-2\,$K lower than the lower-J ones. The
chemical model that provides the best fit to the observational data predict the depletion of $\rm
N_2H^+$ and to a lesser extent of $\rm N_2D^+$ in the innermost region. The peak values for the deuterium
fraction that we find are $\mathrm{D/H_{N_2H^+}} = 0.26^{+0.15}_{-0.14}$ and $\mathrm{D/H_{HCO^+}}
= 0.035^{+0.015}_{-0.012}$, in good agreement with previous estimates in the source.
