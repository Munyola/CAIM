The galactic gaseous halo is a gas reservoir for the interstellar medium in the galaxy disk, supplying
materials for star formation. We developed a gaseous halo model connecting the galaxy disk and the
gaseous halo by assuming the star formation rate on the disk is balanced by the radiative cooling
rate of the gaseous halo, including stellar feedback. In addition to a single-temperature gaseous
halo in collisional ionization equilibrium, we also consider the photoionization effect and a
steady-state cooling model. Photoionization is important for modifying the ion distribution
in low-mass galaxies and outskirts of massive galaxies due to the low densities. The multi-phase
cooling model dominates the region within the cooling radius, where t_cooling=t_Hubble. Our model
reproduces most of the observed high ionization state ions for a wide range of galaxy masses (i.e.,
OVI, OVII, NeVIII, MgX, and OVIII). We find that the OVI column density has a narrow range around ~10^14
cm^-2 for halo masses from M_star ~ 3 * 10^10 Msun to 6*10^12 Msun, which is consistent with some but
not all observational studies. For galaxies with halo masses <~ 3 * 10^11 Msun, photoionization
produces most of the OVI, while for more massive galaxies, the OVI is from the medium that is cooling
from higher temperatures. Fitting the Galactic (Milky-Way) OVII and OVIII suggests a gaseous halo
model where the metallicity is ~0.55 Zsun and the gaseous halo has a maximum temperature of ~ 1.9 *
10^6 K. This gaseous halo model does not close the census of baryonic material within R200.
