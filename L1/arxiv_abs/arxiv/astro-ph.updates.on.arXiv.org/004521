We explore the association of non-neutralized currents with solar flare occurrence in a sizable
sample of observations, aiming to show the potential of such currents in solar flare prediction.
We use the regularly produced high quality vector magnetograms by the Helioseismic Magnetic Imager
and more specifically the Space weather HMI Active Region Patches (SHARP). Through a newly established
method, that incorporates detailed error analysis, we calculate the non-neutralized currents
contained in active regions (AR). Two predictors are produced, namely the total and the maximum
unsigned non-neutralized current. Both are tested in AR time-series and a representative sample
of point-in-time observations during the interval 2012-2016. The average values of non-neutralized
currents in flaring active regions are by more than an order of magnitude higher than in non-flaring
regions and correlate very well with the corresponding flare index. The temporal evolution of these
parameters appears to be connected to physical processes, such as flux emergence and/or magnetic
polarity inversion line formation that are associated with increased solar flare activity. Using
Bayesian inference of flaring probabilities, it is shown that the total unsigned non-neutralized
current outperforms significantly the total unsigned magnetic flux and other well established
current-related predictors. Thus, it shows good prospects for inclusion in an operational flare
forecasting service. We plan to use the new predictor in the framework of the FLARECAST project along
with other highly performing predictors.
