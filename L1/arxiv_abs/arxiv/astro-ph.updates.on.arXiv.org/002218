It has been argued that the specific star formation rates of star forming galaxies inferred from
observational data decline more rapidly below z = 2 than is predicted by hierarchical galaxy formation
models. We present a detailed analysis of this problem by comparing predictions from the GALFORM
semi-analytic model with an extensive compilation of data on the average star formation rates of
star-forming galaxies. We also use this data to infer the form of the stellar mass assembly histories
of star forming galaxies. Our analysis reveals that the currently available data favours a scenario
where the stellar mass assembly histories of star forming galaxies rise at early times and then fall
towards the present day. In contrast, our model predicts stellar mass assembly histories that are
almost flat below z = 2 for star forming galaxies, such that the predicted star formation rates can
be offset with respect to the observational data by factors of up to 2-3. This disagreement can be
explained by the level of coevolution between stellar and halo mass assembly that exists in contemporary
galaxy formation models. In turn, this arises because the standard implementations of star formation
and supernova feedback used in the models result in the efficiencies of these process remaining
approximately constant over the lifetime of a given star forming galaxy. We demonstrate how a modification
to the timescale for gas ejected by feedback to be reincorporated into galaxy haloes can help to reconcile
the model predictions with the data.
