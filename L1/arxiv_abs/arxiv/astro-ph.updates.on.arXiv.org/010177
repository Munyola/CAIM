We report on the coexistence of powerful gas outflows observed in millimeter and X-ray data of the
Radio-Loud Narrow Line Seyfert 1 Galaxy IRAS 17020+4544. Thanks to the large collecting power of
the Large Millimeter Telescope, a prominent line arising from the 12CO(1-0) transition was revealed
in recent observations of this source. The complex profile is composed by a narrow double-peak line
and a broad wing. While the double-peak structure may be arising in a disk of molecular material,
the broad wing is interpreted as the signature of a massive outflow of molecular gas with an approximate
bulk velocity of -660 km/s. This molecular wind is likely associated to a multi-component X-ray
Ultra-Fast Outflow with velocities reaching up to ~0.1c and column densities in the range 10^{21-23.9}
cm^-2 that was reported in the source prior to the LMT observations. The momentum load estimated
in the two gas phases indicates that within the observational uncertainties the outflow is consistent
with being propagating through the galaxy and sweeping up the gas while conserving its energy. This
scenario, which has been often postulated as a viable mechanism of how AGN feedback takes place,
has so far been observed only in ULIRGs sources. IRAS 17020+4544 with bolometric and infrared luminosity
respectively of 5X10^{44} erg/s and 1.05X10^{11} L_sun appears to be an example of AGN feedback
in a NLSy1 Galaxy (a low power AGN). New proprietary multi-wavelength data recently obtained on
this source will allow us to corroborate the proposed hypothesis.
