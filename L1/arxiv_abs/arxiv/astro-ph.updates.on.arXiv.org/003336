The Interface Region Imaging Spectrometer (IRIS) is the first solar instrument to observe ~10 MK
plasma at subarcsecond spatial resolution through imaging spectroscopy of the Fe XXI 1354.1 forbidden
line. IRIS observations of the X1 class flare that occurred on 2014 March 29 at 17:48 UT reveal Fe XXI
emission from both the flare ribbons and the post-flare loop arcade. Fe XXI appears at the ribbon
locations around 75 seconds after the ribbons appear in the chromospheric continuum, and 1354.1
shows blue-shifts of 100-200 km/s, suggesting hot plasma upflow into the corona. The Fe XXI ribbon
emission is compact with a spatial extent of <2", and can extend beyond the chromospheric ribbon
locations. Examples are found of both decreasing and increasing blue-shift in the direction away
from the ribbon locations, and blue-shifts were present for at least 6 minutes after the flare peak.
The post-flare loop arcade, seen in Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) 131 A filtergram images
that are dominated by Fe XXI, exhibited bright loop-tops with an asymmetric intensity distribution.
The sizes of the loop-tops are resolved by IRIS at > 1", and line widths in the loop-tops are not
broader than in the loop-legs suggesting the loop-tops are not sites of enhanced turbulence. Line-of-sight
speeds in the loop arcade are typically <10 km/s, and mean non-thermal motions fall from 43 km/s
at the flare peak to 26 km/s six minutes later. If the average velocity in the loop arcade is assumed
to be at rest, then it implies a new reference wavelength for the Fe XXI line of 1354.106 +/- 0.023 A.
