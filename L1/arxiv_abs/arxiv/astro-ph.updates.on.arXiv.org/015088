While it has been suggested that there is a connection between the magnetic properties and the internal
structure of young stars, there have not been enough magnetic measurements to firmly establish
such a correlation at the earliest ages. Here, we contribute to this endeavor by presenting stellar
parameters and magnetic field strength measurements of BP Tau and V347 Aur, both stars observed
with the near-infrared spectrograph iSHELL. We first test the accuracy of our method by fitting
synthetic stellar spectra to a sample of nine main and post-main-sequence stars. We report uncertainties
of $\sigma_{\rm Teff}$ = 91 K in temperature and $\sigma_{\rm log(g)}$ = 0.14 in gravity. We then
apply the modeling technique to BP Tau and measure a surface magnetic field strength of $\langle
\rm B \rangle $ = 2.5$^{+0.15}_{-0.16}$ kG, confirming literature results. For this star, however,
we obtain a much lower temperature value than previous optical studies ($\Delta \rm T \sim 400$ K)
and interpret this significant temperature difference as due to the relatively higher impact of
starspots at near-infrared wavelengths than at optical wavelengths. We further apply this technique
to the class I protostellar source V347 Aur and measure for the first time its magnetic field strength
$\langle \rm B \rangle = $ 1.36$^{+0.06}_{-0.05}$ kG and its surface gravity log(g) = 3.25$^{+0.14}_{-0.14}$.
Lastly, we combine our measurements with pre-main-sequence stellar evolutionary models and illustrate
the effects produced by starspots on the retrieved masses and ages of young stars.
