We present the analysis of a new near-infrared (NIR) spectrum of a recently discovered $z=6.621$
quasar PSO J006+39 in an attempt to explore the early growth of supermassive black holes (SMBHs).
This NIR (rest-frame ultraviolet, UV) spectrum shows blue continuum slope and rich metal emission
lines in addition to Ly$\alpha$ line. We utilize the MgII line width and the rest frame luminosity
$L_\text{3000\AA}$ to find the mass of SMBH ($M_\text{BH}$) to be $\sim 10^8 M_\odot$, making this
one of the lowest mass quasars at high redshift. The power-law slope index ($\alpha_\lambda$) of
the continuum emission is $-2.94\pm0.03$, significantly bluer than the slope of $\alpha_\lambda=-7/3$
predicted from standard thin disc models. We fit the spectral energy distribution (SED) using a
model which can fit local SMBHs, which includes warm and hot Comptonisation powered by the accretion
flow as well as an outer standard disc. The result shows that the very blue slope is probably produced
by a small radial ($\sim230$ gravitational radius, $R_\text{g}$) extent of the standard accretion
disc. All plausible SED models require that the source is super-Eddington ($L_\text{bol}/L_\text{Edd}
\gtrsim 9$), so the apparently small disc may simply be the inner funnel of a puffed up flow, and clearly
the SMBH in this quasar is in a rapid growth phase. We also utilize the rest-frame UV emission lines
to probe the chemical abundance in the broad line region (BLR) of this quasar. We find that this quasar
has super solar metallicity through photoionization model calculations.
