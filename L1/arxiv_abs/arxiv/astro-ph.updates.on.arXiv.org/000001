We present a study of the prevalence, strength, and kinematics of ultraviolet FeII and MgII emission
lines in 212 star-forming galaxies at z = 1 selected from the DEEP2 survey. We find FeII* emission
in composite spectra assembled on the basis of different galaxy properties, indicating that FeII*
emission is prevalent at z = 1. In these composites, FeII* emission is observed at roughly the systemic
velocity. At z = 1, we find that the strength of FeII* emission is most strongly modulated by dust attenuation,
and is additionally correlated with redshift, star-formation rate, and [OII] equivalent width,
such that systems at higher redshifts with lower dust levels, lower star-formation rates, and larger
[OII] equivalent widths show stronger FeII* emission. We detect MgII emission in at least 15% of
the individual spectra and we find that objects showing stronger MgII emission have higher specific
star-formation rates, smaller [OII] linewidths, larger [OII] equivalent widths, lower dust attenuations,
and lower stellar masses than the sample as a whole. MgII emission strength exhibits the strongest
correlation with specific star-formation rate, although we find evidence that dust attenuation
and stellar mass also play roles in the regulation of MgII emission. Future integral field unit observations
of the spatial extent of FeII* and MgII emission in galaxies with high specific star-formation rates,
low dust attenuations, and low stellar masses will be important for probing the morphology of circumgalactic
gas.
