Microlensing is a powerful and unique technique to probe isolated objects in the Galaxy. To study
the characteristics of these interesting objects based on the microlensing method, measurement
of the microlens parallax is required to determine the properties of the lens. Of the various methods
to measure microlens parallax, the most robust way is to make simultaneous ground- and space-based
observations, i.e., by measuring the space-based microlens parallax. However, space-based campaigns
usually require "expensive" resources. Gould & Yee (2012) proposed an idea called the "cheap space-based
microlens parallax" that can measure the lens-parallax using only $2$ or $3$ space-based observations
of high-magnification events. This cost-effective observation strategy to measure microlens
parallaxes could be used by space-borne telescopes to build a complete sample for studying isolated
objects. This would enable a direct measurement of the mass function including both extremely low-mass
objects and high-mass stellar remnants. However, to adopt this idea requires a test to check how
it would work in actual situations. Thus, we present the first practical test of the idea using the
high-magnification microlensing event OGLE-2016-BLG-1045, for which a subset of Spitzer observations
fortuitously duplicate the prescription of Gould & Yee (2012). From the test, we confirm that the
measurement of the lens-parallax adopting this idea has sufficient accuracy to determine the physical
properties of the isolated lens.
