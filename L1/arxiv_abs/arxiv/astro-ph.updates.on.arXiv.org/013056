The dense clusters within the Serpens Molecular Cloud are among the most active regions of nearby
star formation. In this paper, we use Gaia DR2 parallaxes and proper motions to statistically measure
1167 kinematic members of Serpens, few of which were previously identified, to evaluate the star
formation history of the complex. The optical members of Serpens are concentrated in three distinct
groups located at 380 to 480 pc; the densest clusters are still highly obscured by optically-thick
dust and have few optical members. The total population of young stars and protostars in Serpens
is at least 2000 stars, including past surveys that were most sensitive to protostars and disks,
and may be far higher. Distances to dark clouds measured from deficits in star counts are consistent
with the distances to the optical star clusters. The Serpens Molecular Cloud is seen in the foreground
of the Aquila Rift, dark clouds located at 600 to 700 pc, and behind patchy extinction, here called
the Serpens Cirrus, located at ~250 pc. Based on the lack of a distributed population of older stars,
the star formation rate throughout the Serpens Molecular Cloud increased by at least a factor of
20 within the past ~5 Myr. The optically bright stars in Serpens Northeast are visible because their
natal molecular cloud has been eroded and not because they were flung outwards from a central factory
of star formation. The separation between subclusters of 20 to 100 pc and the absence of an older population
leads to speculation that an external forcing was needed to trigger the active star formation.
