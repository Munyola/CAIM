Protoplanetary disks often appear as multiple concentric rings in dust continuum emission maps
and scattered light images. These features are often associated with possible young planets in
these disks. Many non-planetary explanations have also been suggested, including snow lines,
dead zones and secular gravitational instabilities in the dust. In this paper we suggest another
potential origin. The presence of copious amounts of dust tends to strongly reduce the conductivity
of the gas, thereby inhibiting the magneto-rotational instability, and thus reducing the turbulence
in the disk. From viscous disk theory it is known that a disk tends to increase its surface density
in regions where the viscosity (i.e. turbulence) is low. Local maxima in the gas pressure tend to
attract dust through radial drift, increasing the dust content even more. We investigate mathematically
if this could potentially lead to a feedback loop in which a perturbation in the dust surface density
could perturb the gas surface density, leading to increased dust drift and thus amplification of
the dust perturbation and, as a consequence, the gas perturbation. We find that this is indeed possible,
even for moderately small dust grain sizes, which drift less efficiently, but which are more likely
to affect the gas ionization degree. We speculate that this instability could be triggered by the
small dust population initially, and when the local pressure maxima are strong enough, the larger
dust grains get trapped and lead to the familiar ring-like shapes. We also discuss the many uncertainties
and limitations of this model.
