Dust plays a pivotal role in the chemical enrichment of the interstellar medium. In the era of mid/high
resolution spectra and multi-band spectral energy distributions, testing extinctions against
gas and dust-phase properties is becoming possible. In order to test relations between metals,
dust and depletions, and comparing those to the Local Group (LG) relations, we build a sample of 93
gamma-ray bursts and quasar absorbers (the largest sample so far) which have extinction and elemental
column density measurements available. We find that extinctions and total column density of the
volatile elements (Zn, S) are correlated (with a best-fit of dust-to-metals (DTM) 4.05x10-22 mag
cm2) and consistent with the LG DTM relation. The refractory elements (Fe, Si) follow a similar,
but less significant, relation offset about 1 dex from the LG relation. On the assumption that depletion
onto dust grains is the cause, we compute the total (gas+dust-phase) column density and find a remarkable
agreement with the LG DTM relation: a best-fit of 4.91x10-22 mag cm2. We then use our results to compute
the amount of 'intervening metal from unknown sources' in random sightlines out to redshifts of
z=5. Those metals implicate the presence of dust and give rise to an average 'cosmic dust dimming'
effect which we express as a function of redshift, CDD(z). The CDD is unimportant out to redshifts
of about 3, but because it is cumulative it becomes significant at redshifts z=3-5. Our results in
this paper are based on a minimum of assumptions and effectively relying on observations.
