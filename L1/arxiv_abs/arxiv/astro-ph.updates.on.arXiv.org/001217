The Dark Energy Survey (DES) will be unprecedented in its ability to probe exceptionally large cosmic
volumes to relatively faint optical limits. Primarily designed for the study of comparatively
low redshift (z<2) galaxies with the aim of constraining dark energy, an intriguing byproduct
of the survey will be the identification of massive (>10^(12.0) M_sun) galaxies at z>~4.
This will greatly improve our understanding of how galaxies form and evolve. By both passively evolving
the low redshift mass function and extrapolating the observed high redshift mass function, we find
that such galaxies should be rare but nonetheless present at early times, with predicted number
densities of ~0.02 deg^-2. The unique combination of depth and coverage that DES provides will allow
the identification of such galaxies should they exist - potentially identifying hundreds of such
sources. We then model possible high redshift galaxies and determine their detectability using
the DES filter sets and depths. We model sources with a broad range stellar properties and find that
for these galaxies to be detected they must be either sufficiently young, high mass and/or relatively
dust free (E(B-V)<0.45) - with these parameters jointly affecting each galaxy's detectability.
We also propose colour-colour selection criteria for the identification of both pristine and dusty
sources and find that, although contamination fractions will be high, the most reliable candidate
massive high redshift galaxies are likely to be identifiable in the DES data through prioritisation
of colour-selected sources.
