The presence of massive quiescent galaxies at high redshifts is still a challenge for most models
of galaxy formation. The aim of this work is to compare the observed number density and properties
of these galaxies with the predictions of state-of-the-art models. The sample of massive quiescent
galaxies has been selected from the COSMOS2015 photometric catalogue with $z_{\rm phot}\geq 2.5$,
$\log (M_*/M_\odot)\geq 10.5$ and $\log(\mathrm{sSFR\,[yr^{-1}]})\le -11$. The photometric
SEDs of the selected galaxies have been thoroughly analyzed based on different stellar population
synthesis models. The final sample includes only those galaxies qualified as quiescent in all SED
fitting runs. The observed properties have been compared to theoretical models: the number density
of quiescent galaxies with $10.5 \leq \log(M_*/M_\odot) < 10.8$ is reproduced by some models, although
there is a large scatter in their predictions. Instead, very massive $\log(M_{*}/M_{\odot}) \geq
10.8$ are underpredicted by most of the current models of galaxy formation: some of them, built on
the CARNage simulation, are consistent with data up to $z \sim 4$, while at higher redshifts the volume
of the considered simulation is too small to find such rare objects. Simulated galaxies which match
the observed properties in the $\mathrm{sSFR}-M_*$ plane at $z\sim 3$ have been analyzed by reconstructing
their evolutionary paths: their merger trees suggest that AGN feedback could be the key process
allowing for a rapid quenching of the star formation at $z\gtrsim 4$ and that its treatment should
be improved in models.
