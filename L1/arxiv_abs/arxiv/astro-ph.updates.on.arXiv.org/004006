PKS 1155+251 is a radio-loud quasar source at z=0.203. Observations using very long baseline interferometry
(VLBI) at ~2, 5, 8 and 15 GHz show that the structure of the radio source is quite complicated on parsec
scales and that the outer hot spots are apparently undergoing a significant contraction. Because
these results cannot be fully explained based on the compact symmetric object (CSO) scenario with
a radio core located between the northern and southern complexes, we made observations with the
Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) at 24 and 43 GHz to search for compact substructures and alternative
interpretations. The results show that the radio core revealed in the previous VLBI observations
remains compact with a flat spectrum in our sub-milli-arcsecond--resolution images; the northern
lobe emission becomes faint at 24 GHz and is mostly resolving out at 43 GHz; the southern complex is
more bright but has been resolved into the brightest southern-end (S1) and jet or tail alike components
westwards. Explaining the southern components aligned westward with a standard CSO scenario alone
remains a challenge. As for the flatter spectral index of the southern-end component S1 between
24 and 43 GHz in our observations and the significant 15 GHz VLBA flux variability of S1, an alternative
scenario is that the southern complex may be powered by a secondary black hole residing at S1. But
more sensitive and high-resolution VLBI monitoring is required to discriminate the CSO and the
binary black hole scenarios.
