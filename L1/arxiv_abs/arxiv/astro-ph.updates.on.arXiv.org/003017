We study the late time cosmological evolution of $f(R)$ theories of modified gravity, with the matter
content of the universe being that of collisional self interacting matter. We assume that the universe
is described by a flat Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker metric and that it is matter and dark
energy dominated. The results of our numerical analysis for a collisional matter $f(R)$ theory
are compared with those resulting from pressure-less matter $f(R)$ theory and from the $\mathrm{\Lambda}\mathrm{CDM}$
model. As we shall demonstrate, the resulting picture can vary from model to model, indicating that
the effect of collisional matter in $f(R)$ theories is strongly model dependent. Particularly,
in a few cases, may give better fit to the $\mathrm{\Lambda}\mathrm{CDM}$ model. In all studied
cases, the effective equation of state parameter does not cross the phantom divide, both in the collisional
matter and pressure-less matter $f(R)$ theories. Finally, we thoroughly study the effects of collisional
matter on one of the $f(R)$ models that is known to provide a unified description of early time inflation
and late time acceleration. The overall picture of the evolution of the universe is not drastically
affected, apart from the matter era which is further enhanced with an additional matter energy density
term, which is of leading order. However, a fully consistent description of the universe's evolution
requires the introduction of a dark energy compensate in the total energy density, a concept very
well known from the literature.
