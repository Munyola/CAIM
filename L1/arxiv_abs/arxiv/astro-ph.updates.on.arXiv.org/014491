The discovery of ring systems around objects of the outer Solar System provides a strong motivation
to apply theoretical models in order to better estimate their physical and orbital parameters,
which can constrain scenarios for their origin. We review the criterion for maintaining apse-alignment
across a ring and the balance between the energy input rate provided by a close by satellite and the
internal dissipation rate occurring through ring particle collisions that is required to maintain
ring eccentricity, as derived from the equations of motion governing the Lagrangian-displacements
of the ring-particle orbits. We use the case of the epsilon-ring of Uranus, to calibrate our theoretical
discussion and illustrate the basic dynamics governing these types of ring. In the case of the ring
system of (10199) Chariklo, where the evidence that the rings are eccentric is not conclusive, we
apply the theory of apse-alignment to derive information about the most plausible combination
of values of the surface density and eccentricity-gradient, as well as the masses and locations
of their postulated but -presently undetected-shepherd-satellites. When the balance conditions
that we predict are applied to the ring system of (10199) Chariklo, we are able to estimate the minimum
mass of a shepherd satellite required to prevent eccentricity decay, as a function of its orbital
location, for two different models of dissipation. We conclude that the satellite mass required
to maintain the m = 1 eccentric mode in the ring, would be similar or smaller than that needed to confine
the rings radially.
