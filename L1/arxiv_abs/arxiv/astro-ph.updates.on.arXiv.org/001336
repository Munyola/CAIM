The super-Earth exoplanet 55 Cnc e, the smallest member of a five-planet system, has recently been
observed to transit its host star. The radius estimates from transit observations, coupled with
spectroscopic determinations of mass, provide constraints on its interior composition. The composition
of exoplanetary interiors and atmospheres are particularly sensitive to elemental C/O ratio,
which to first order can be estimated from the host stars. Results from a recent spectroscopic study
analyzing the 6300A [O I] line and two C I lines suggest that 55 Cnc has a carbon-rich composition (C/O=1.12+/-0.09).
However oxygen abundances derived using the 6300A [O I] line are highly sensitive to a Ni I blend,
particularly in metal-rich stars such as 55 Cnc ([Fe/H]=0.34+/-0.18). Here, we further investigate
55 Cnc's composition by deriving the carbon and oxygen abundances from these and additional C and
O absorption features. We find that the measured C/O ratio depends on the oxygen lines used. The C/O
ratio that we derive based on the 6300A [O I] line alone is consistent with the previous value. Yet,
our investigation of additional abundance indicators results in a mean C/O ratio of 0.78+/-0.08.
The lower C/O ratio of 55 Cnc determined here may place this system at the sensitive boundary between
protoplanetary disk compositions giving rise to planets with high (>0.8) versus low (<0.8)
C/O ratios. This study illustrates the caution that must applied when determining planet host star
C/O ratios, particularly in cool, metal-rich stars.
