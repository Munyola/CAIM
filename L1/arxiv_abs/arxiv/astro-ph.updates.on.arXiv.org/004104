We analyze scaling relations and evolution histories of galaxy sizes in the TNG100, part of the IllustrisTNG
simulation suite. Observational qualitative trends of size with stellar mass, star-formation
rate and redshift are reproduced, and a quantitative comparison of projected r-band sizes at 0~<z<~2
shows agreement to better than 0.25dex. We follow populations of z=0 galaxies with a range of masses
backwards in time along their main progenitor branches, separately for main-sequence and quenched
galaxies. Our main findings are as follows. (i) At $M_{*,z=0}>~10^{9.5}$M$_\odot$, the main progenitors
evolve in different ways, with quenched galaxies hardly growing in median size before quenching,
whereas main-sequence galaxies grow their median size continuously, thus opening a gap from the
progenitors of quenched galaxies. This is partly because the main-sequence high-redshift progenitors
of quenched z=0 galaxies are drawn from the lower end of the size distribution of the overall population
of main-sequence high-redshift galaxies. (ii) Quenched galaxies with $M_{*,z=0}>~10^{9.5}$M$_\odot$
experience a steep size growth on the size-mass plane after their quenching time, but the size growth
rate as a function of time is similar to that of main-sequence galaxies. Hence, the size gap is not
closed by z=0. (iii) At all masses but $M_{*,z=0}>10^{11}$M$_\odot$, most of the size (and mass)
growth of quenched galaxies occurs while they are still on the main-sequence, and the size variation
among quenched galaxies is driven by different degrees of growth on the main-sequence rather than
after quenching.
