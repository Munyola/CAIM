We present the first high-resolution map of the cold molecular gas distribution, as traced by CO(2-1)
emission with ALMA, in a prominent ram pressure stripped tail. The Norma cluster galaxy ESO 137-001
is undergoing a strong interaction with the surrounding intra-cluster medium and is one of the nearest
jellyfish galaxies with a long multi-phase tail. We have mapped the full extent of the tail at 1" (350
pc) angular resolution and found a rich distribution of mostly compact CO regions extending to nearly
60 kpc in length and 25 kpc in width. In total about 10^9 M_sun of molecular gas was detected. The CO
features are found predominantly at the heads of numerous small-scale (~ 1.5 kpc) fireballs (i.e.,
star-forming clouds with linear streams of young stars extending toward the galaxy) but also of
large-scale (~ 8 kpc) super-fireballs, and double-sided fireballs that have additional diffuse
ionized gas tails extending in the direction opposite to the stellar tails. The new data help to shed
light on the origin of the molecular tail - CO filaments oriented in the direction of the tail with
only diffuse associated Halpha emission are likely young molecular features formed in situ, whereas
other large CO features tilted with respect to the tail may have originated from the densest gas complexes
that were pushed gradually away from the disk. The ALMA observations of ESO 137-001, together with
observations from HST, Chandra and VLT/MUSE, offer the most complete view of a spectacular ram pressure
stripped tail to date.
