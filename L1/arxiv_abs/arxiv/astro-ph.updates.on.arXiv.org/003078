We present a catalog of galaxy clusters selected via their Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect signature
from 2500 deg$^2$ of South Pole Telescope (SPT) data. This work represents the complete sample of
clusters detected at high significance in the 2500-square-degree SPT-SZ survey, which was completed
in 2011. A total of 677 (409) cluster candidates are identified above a signal-to-noise threshold
of $\xi$ =4.5 (5.0). Ground- and space-based optical and near-infrared (NIR) imaging confirms
overdensities of similarly colored galaxies in the direction of 516 (or 76%) of the $\xi$>4.5
candidates and 387 (or 95%) of the $\xi$>5 candidates; the measured purity is consistent with
expectations from simulations. Of these confirmed clusters, 415 were first identified in SPT data,
including 251 new discoveries reported in this work. We estimate photometric redshifts for all
candidates with identified optical and/or NIR counterparts; we additionally report redshifts
derived from spectroscopic observations for 141 of these systems. The mass threshold of the catalog
is roughly independent of redshift above $z$~0.25 leading to a sample of massive clusters that extends
to high redshift. The median mass of the sample is $M_{\scriptsize 500c}(\rho_\mathrm{crit})$
~ 3.5 x 10$^{14} M_\odot h^{-1}$, the median redshift is $z_{med}$ =0.55, and the highest-redshift
systems are at $z$>1.4. The combination of large redshift extent, clean selection, and high
typical mass makes this cluster sample of particular interest for cosmological analyses and studies
of cluster formation and evolution.
