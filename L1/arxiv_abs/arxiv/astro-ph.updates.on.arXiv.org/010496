The detection of stochastic background of gravitational waves (GWs), produced by cosmological
phase transitions (PTs), is of fundamental importance because allows to probe the physics related
to PT energy scales. Given the decisive role of non-zero quark chemical potential towards understanding
physics in the core of neutron stars, quark stars and heavy-ion collisions, in this paper we qualitatively
explore the stochastic background of GW spectrum generated by high-density QCD first order PT.
Specifically, we calculate the frequency peak $f_{peak}$ redshifted at today time and the fractional
energy density $\Omega_{gw}h^2$ in light of equation-of-state improved by the finite quark (baryon)
chemical potential (we consider an effective three flavor chiral quarks model of QCD). Our calculations
reveal a striking increase in $f_{peak}$ and $\Omega_{gw}h^2$ due to the quark chemical potential,
which means to improve the chances of detecting, in possible future observations, the stochastic
background of GWs from QCD first order PT. Concerning the phenomenological contribution of QCD
equation-of-state, and in particular the possibility to detect a stochastic GW signal, we further
show that the role of the quark chemical potential is model-dependent. This feature allows to discriminate
among possible QCD effective models depending on their capability to shed light on the dynamic of
QCD-PT through future observations of primordial GWs. In this perspective, the results are indeed
encouraging to employ the GWs to study the QCD PT in high density strong interaction matter.
