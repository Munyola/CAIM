High-velocity clouds (HVCs) are interstellar clouds of atomic hydrogen that do not partake of the
Galactic rotation and have velocities of a several hundred kilometers per second. A considerable
number of these clouds are falling down towards the Galactic disk. HVCs form large and massive complexes,
so their collisions with the disk must release a great amount of energy into the interstellar medium.
The cloud-disk interaction produces two shocks, one propagates through the cloud and the other
through the disk; the properties of these shocks depend mainly on the cloud velocity and the disk-cloud
density ratio. In this work we study the conditions necessary for these shocks to accelerate particles
by diffusive shock acceleration and the produced non-thermal radiation. We analyze particle acceleration
in both the cloud and disk shocks. Solving a time-dependent 2-D transport equation for both relativistic
electrons and protons we obtain particle distributions and non-thermal spectral energy distributions.
In a shocked cloud significant synchrotron radio emission is produced along with soft gamma rays.
In the case of acceleration in the shocked disk, the non-thermal radiation is stronger; the gamma
rays, of leptonic origin, might be detectable with current instruments. A large number of protons
are injected into the Galactic interstellar medium, and locally exceed the cosmic-ray background.
We conclude that under adequate conditions the contribution from HVC-disk collisions to the galactic
population of relativistic particles and the associated extended non-thermal radiation might
be important.
