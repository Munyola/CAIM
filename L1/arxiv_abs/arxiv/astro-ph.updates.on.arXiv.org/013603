We present optical IFU observations of the Taffy system (UGC 12914/15); named for the radio emission
that stretches between the two galaxies. Given that these gas rich galaxies are believed to have
recently collided head-on, the pair exhibits a surprisingly normal total (sub-LIRG) IR luminosity
($\mathrm{L_{FIR} \sim 4.5 \times 10^{10}}$ L$_\odot$). Previous observations have demonstrated
that a large quantity of molecular and neutral gas have been drawn out of the galaxies into a massive
multi-phase bridge. We present, for the first time, spatially resolved spectroscopy of the ionized
gas in the system. The results show that the ionized gas is highly disturbed kinematically, with
gas spread in two main filaments between the two galaxies. The line profiles exhibit widespread
double components in both the bridge and parts of the disks of the galaxies. We investigate the spatial
distribution of the excitation properties of the ionized gas using emission-line diagnostic diagrams,
and conclude that large quantities (up to 40$\%$) of the emission from the entire system is consistent
with gas heated in $\sim$200 \kms\ shocks. While the shocked gas is mainly associated with the bridge,
there is a significant amount of shocked gas associated with both galaxies. Confirming other multi-wavelength
indicators, the results suggest that the effects of shocks and turbulence can continue to be felt
in a high-speed galaxy collision long after the collision has occurred. The persistence of shocks
in the Taffy system may explain the relatively low current star formation rates in the system as a
whole.
