Multiple codes are available to derive atmospheric parameters and individual chemical abundances
from high-resolution spectra of AFGKM stars. Almost every spectroscopist has its own preferences
regarding which code and method to use. But intrinsic differences between codes and methods lead
to complex systematics that depend on multiple variables such as the selected spectral regions
and the radiative transfer code used. I expanded iSpec, the popular open source spectroscopic tool,
to support the most known radiative transfer codes and I assessed their similarities and biases
when using multiple setups based on the equivalent width method and the synthetic spectral fitting
technique (interpolating from a pre-computed grid of spectra or synthesizing with interpolated
model atmospheres). This work shows that systematics on atmospheric parameter and abundances
between most of the codes can be reduced when using the same method and a careful spectral feature
selection is executed, but it may not be possible to ignore the remaining differences depending
on what is the scientific case and the required precision. Regarding methods, equivalent width-based
and spectrum fitting-analyses exhibit large differences that emerge due to their intrinsic differences,
which is relevant given the popularity of these two methods. The results help us identify the key
caveats of modern spectroscopy that any scientist should be aware of before trusting its own results
or being tempted to combine atmospheric parameters and abundances from the literature.
