The ice-albedo feedback on rapidly-rotating terrestrial planets in the habitable zone can lead
to abrupt transitions (bifurcations) between a warm and a snowball (ice-covered) state, bistability
between these states, and hysteresis in planetary climate. This is important for planetary habitability
because snowball events may trigger rises in the complexity of life, but could also endanger complex
life that already exists. Recent work has shown that planets tidally locked in synchronous rotation
states will transition smoothly into the snowball state rather than experiencing bifurcations.
Here we investigate the structure of snowball bifurcations on planets that are tidally influenced,
but not synchronously rotating, so that they experience long solar days. We use PlaSIM, an intermediate-complexity
global climate model, with a thermodynamic mixed layer ocean and the Sun's spectrum. We find that
the amount of hysteresis (range in stellar flux for which there is bistability in climate) is significantly
reduced for solar days with lengths of tens of Earth days, and disappears for solar days of hundreds
of Earth days. These results suggest that tidally influenced planets orbiting M and K-stars that
are not synchronously rotating could have much less hysteresis associated with the snowball bifurcations
than they would if they were rapidly rotating. This implies that the amount of time it takes them to
escape a snowball state via CO$_2$ outgassing would be greatly reduced, as would the period of cycling
between the warm and snowball state if they have a low CO$_2$ outgassing rate.
