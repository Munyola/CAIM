Recent observations from {\em RHESSI} have revealed that the number of non-thermal electrons in
the coronal part of a flaring loop can exceed the number of electrons required to explain the hard
X-ray-emitting footpoints of the same flaring loop. Such sources cannot, therefore, be interpreted
on the basis of the standard collisional transport model, in which electrons stream along the loop
while losing their energy through collisions with the ambient plasma; additional physical processes,
to either trap or scatter the energetic electrons, are required. Motivated by this and other observations
that suggest that high energy electrons are confined to the coronal region of the source, we consider
turbulent pitch angle scattering of fast electrons off low frequency magnetic fluctuations as
a confinement mechanism, modeled as a spatial diffusion parallel to the mean magnetic field. In
general, turbulent scattering leads to a reduction of the collisional stopping distance of non-thermal
electrons along the loop and hence to an enhancement of the coronal HXR source relative to the footpoints.
The variation of source size $L$ with electron energy $E$ becomes weaker than the quadratic behavior
pertinent to collisional transport, with the slope of $L(E)$ depending directly on the mean free
path $\lambda$ again pitch angle scattering. Comparing the predictions of the model with observations,
we find that $\lambda \sim$$(10^8-10^9)$ cm for $\sim30$ keV, less than the length of a typical flaring
loop and smaller than, or comparable to, the size of the electron acceleration region.
