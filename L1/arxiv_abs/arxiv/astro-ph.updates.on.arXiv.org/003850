Jupiter's atmosphere has been observed to be depleted in helium (Yatm~0.24), suggesting active
helium sedimentation in the interior. This is accounted for in standard Jupiter structure and evolution
models through the assumption of an outer, He-depleted envelope that is separated from the He-enriched
deep interior by a sharp boundary. Here we aim to develop a model for Jupiter's inhomogeneous thermal
evolution that relies on a more self-consistent description of the internal profiles of He abundance,
temperature, and heat flux. We make use of recent numerical simulations on H/He demixing, and on
layered (LDD) and oscillatory (ODD) double diffusive convection, and assume an idealized planet
model composed of a H/He envelope and a massive core. A general framework for the construction of
interior models with He rain is described. Despite, or perhaps because of, our simplifications
made we find that self-consistent models are rare. For instance, no model for ODD convection is found.
We modify the H/He phase diagram of Lorenzen et al. to reproduce Jupiter's atmospheric helium abundance
and examine evolution models as a function of the LDD layer height, from those that prolong Jupiter's
cooling time to those that actually shorten it. Resulting models that meet the luminosity constraint
have layer heights of about 0.1-1 km, corresponding to ~10,-20,000 layers in the rain zone between
~1 and 3-4.5 Mbars. Present limitations and directions for future work are discussed, such as the
formation and sinking of He droplets.
