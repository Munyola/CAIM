Low-mass stars are known to have magnetic fields that are believed to be of dynamo origin. Two complementary
techniques are principally used to characterise them. Zeeman-Doppler imaging (ZDI) can determine
the geometry of the large-scale magnetic field while Zeeman broadening can assess the total unsigned
flux including that associated with small-scale structures such as spots. In this work, we study
a sample of stars that have been previously mapped with ZDI. We show that the average unsigned magnetic
flux follows an activity-rotation relation separating into saturated and unsaturated regimes.
We also compare the average photospheric magnetic flux recovered by ZDI, $\langle B_V\rangle$,
with that recovered by Zeeman broadening studies, $\langle B_I\rangle$. In line with previous
studies, $\langle B_V\rangle$ ranges from a few % to $\sim$20% of $\langle B_I\rangle$. We show
that a power law relationship between $\langle B_V\rangle$ and $\langle B_I\rangle$ exists and
that ZDI recovers a larger fraction of the magnetic flux in more active stars. Using this relation,
we improve on previous attempts to estimate filling factors, i.e. the fraction of the stellar surface
covered with magnetic field, for stars mapped only with ZDI. Our estimated filling factors follow
the well-known activity-rotation relation which is in agreement with filling factors obtained
directly from Zeeman broadening studies. We discuss the possible implications of these results
for flux tube expansion above the stellar surface and stellar wind models.
