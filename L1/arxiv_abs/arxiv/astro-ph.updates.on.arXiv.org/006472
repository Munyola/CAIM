We perform, for the first time, a detailed long-term activity study of the binary system $\zeta$
Ret. We use all available HARPS spectra obtained between the years 2003 and 2016. We built a time series
of the Mount Wilson $S$ index for both stars, then we analyse these series by using Lomb-Scargle periodograms.
The components $\zeta^{1}$ Ret and $\zeta^{2}$ Ret that belong to this binary system are physically
very similar to each other and also similar to our Sun, which makes it a remarkable system. We detect
in the solar-analogue star $\zeta^{2}$ Ret a long-term activity cycle with a period of $\sim$10
yr, similar to the solar one ($\sim$11 yr). It is worthwhile to mention that this object satisfies
previous criteria for a flat star and for a cycling star simultaneously. Another interesting feature
of this binary system, is a high $\sim$0.220 dex difference between the averages log($\mathrm{R}'_\mathrm{HK}$)
activity levels of both stars. Our study clearly shows that $\zeta^{1}$ Ret is significantly more
active than $\zeta^{2}$ Ret. In addition, $\zeta^{1}$ Ret shows an erratic variability in its stellar
activity. In this work, we explore different scenarios trying to explain this rare behaviour in
a pair of coeval stars, which could help to explain the difference in this and other binary systems.
From these results, we also warn that for the development of activity-age calibrations (which commonly
use binary systems and/or stellar clusters as calibrators) it should be taken into account the whole
history of activity available of the stars involved.
