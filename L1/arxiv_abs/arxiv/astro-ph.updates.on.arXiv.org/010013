The mechanism for producing gamma-ray quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) in blazar is unknown.
One possibility is the geometric model, in which without the need for intrinsic quasi-periodic
variation, the relativistic Doppler factor changes periodically, resulting in observed gamma-ray
QPO. We propose a method to test this geometric model. We analyze the {\it Fermi}-LAT data of PG 1553+113
spanning from 2008 August until 2018 February. According to 29 four-month average spectral energy
distributions (SEDs) in the energy range of 0.1-300 GeV, we split the {\it Fermi}-LAT energy range
into three bands: 0.1-1 GeV, 1-10 GeV, and 10-300 GeV. The spectrum in each energy range can be successfully
fitted by a power-law. The light curves and photon indices in the three energy ranges are obtained.
Then, light curves in three narrow energy ranges, i.e., 0.2-0.5 GeV, 2-5 GeV and 20- 40 GeV, are constructed,
and the relative variability amplitudes in the three narrow energy ranges are calculated. A discrete-correlation
analysis is performed for the light curves. Our results indicate that (i) the light curves in the
different energy ranges follow the same pattern showed in the light curve above 0.1 GeV; (ii) the
three groups of photon indices in the energy ranges of 0.1-1 GeV, 1-10 GeV, and 10-300 GeV keep nearly
constant; (iii) the ratio between relative variability amplitudes in different narrow energy
ranges are equal (within their errors) to the prediction by the Doppler effect. Our results support
the scenario of the relativistic boost producing the gamma-ray QPO for PG 1553+113.
