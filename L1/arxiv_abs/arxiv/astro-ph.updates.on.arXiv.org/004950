We present a measurement of the DLA mean bias from the cross-correlation of DLA and the Ly$\alpha$
forest, updating earlier results of Font-Ribera et al. 2012 with the final BOSS Data Release and
an improved method to address continuum fitting corrections. Our cross-correlation is well fitted
by linear theory with the standard $\Lambda CDM$ model, with a DLA bias of $b_{\rm DLA} = 1.99\pm 0.11$;
a more conservative analysis, which removes DLA in the Ly$\beta$ forest and uses only the cross-correlation
at $r> 10{\rm h^{-1}\,Mpc}$, yields $b_{\rm DLA} = 2.00\pm 0.19$. This assumes the cosmological
model from \cite{Planck2015} and the Ly$\alpha$ forest bias factors of Bautista et al. 2017, and
includes only statistical errors obtained from bootstrap analysis. The main systematic errors
arise from possible impurities and selection effects in the DLA catalogue, and from uncertainties
in the determination of the Ly$\alpha$ forest bias factors and a correction for effects of high column
density absorbers. We find no dependence of the DLA bias on column density or redshift. The measured
bias value corresponds to a host halo mass $\sim 4\cdot10^{11} {\rm M_{\odot}}$ if all DLA were hosted
in halos of a similar mass. In a realistic model where host halos over a broad mass range have a DLA cross
section $\Sigma(M_h) \propto M_h^{\alpha}$ down to $M_h > M_{\rm min} =10^{8.5} {\rm M_{\odot}}$,
we find that $\alpha > 1$ is required to have $b_{\rm DLA}> 1.7$, implying a steeper relation or higher
value of $M_{\rm min}$ than is generally predicted in numerical simulations of galaxy formation.
