We present the Ly$\alpha$ luminosity function (LF) derived from 34 Ly$\alpha$ emitters (LAEs)
at $z=7.0$ on the sky of $3.1$ deg$^2$, the largest sample so far obtained at a redshift $z\gtrsim7$.
The LAE sample is made by deep large-area Subaru narrowband observations conducted by the Cosmic
HydrOgen Reionization Unveiled with Subaru (CHORUS) project. The $z=7.0$ Ly$\alpha$ LF of our
project is consistent with those of the previous DECam and Subaru studies at the bright and faint
ends, respectively, while our $z=7.0$ Ly$\alpha$ LF has uncertainties significantly smaller
than those of the previous study results. Exploiting the small errors of our measurements, we investigate
the shape of the faint to bright-end Ly$\alpha$ LF. We find that the $z=7.0$ Ly$\alpha$ LF shape can
be explained by the steep slope of $\alpha \simeq -2.5$ suggested at $z=6.6$, and that there is no
clear signature of a bright-end excess at $z\simeq 7$ claimed by the previous work, which was thought
to be made by the ionized bubbles around bright LAEs whose Ly$\alpha$ photons could easily escape
from the partly neutral IGM at $z\simeq 7$. We estimate the Ly$\alpha$ luminosity densities (LDs)
with Ly$\alpha$ LFs at $z\simeq 6-8$ given by our and the previous studies, and compare the evolution
of the UV-continuum LD estimated with dropouts. The Ly$\alpha$ LD monotonically decreases from
$z\sim 6$ to $8$, and evolves stronger than the UV-continuum LD, indicative of the Ly$\alpha$ damping
wing absorption of the IGM towards the heart of the reionization epoch.
