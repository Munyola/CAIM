Advanced ACTPol (AdvACT) is a third generation polarization upgrade to the Atacama Cosmology Telescope,
designed to observe the cosmic microwave background (CMB). AdvACT expands on the 90 and 150 GHz transition
edge sensor (TES) bolometer arrays of the ACT Polarimeter (ACTPol), adding both high frequency
(HF, 150/230 GHz) and low frequency (LF, 27/39 GHz) multichroic arrays. The addition of the high
and low frequency detectors allows for the characterization of synchrotron and spinning dust emission
at the low frequencies and foreground emission from galactic dust and dusty star forming galaxies
at the high frequencies. The increased spectral coverage of AdvACT will enable a wide range of CMB
science, such as improving constraints on dark energy, the sum of the neutrino masses, and the existence
of primordial gravitational waves. The LF array will be the final AdvACT array, replacing one of
the MF arrays for a single season. Prior to the fabrication of the final LF detector array, we designed
and characterized prototype TES bolometers. Detector geometries in these prototypes are varied
in order to inform and optimize the bolometer designs for the LF array, which requires significantly
lower noise levels and saturation powers (as low as ${\sim}1$ pW) than the higher frequency detectors.
Here we present results from tests of the first LF prototype TES detectors for AdvACT, including
measurements of the saturation power, critical temperature, thermal conductance and time constants.
We also describe the modifications to the time-division SQUID readout architecture compared to
the MF and HF arrays.
