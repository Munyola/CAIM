The Martian upper atmosphere is known to vary diurnally and seasonally due to changing amounts of
solar radiation. However, in the upper thermosphere and exosphere, the neutrals are also subject
to ion precipitation. This can increase the temperature in the region of precipitation, resulting
in density changes that might be seen in in situ data (Fang et al. 2013). Therefore, we examine neutral
density data from the MAVEN Neutral Gas and Ion Mass Spectrometer (NGIMS) in Mars-Solar-Electric
(MSE) coordinates, where location is determined by the direction of the solar wind convective electric
field, resulting in a hemispherical asymmetry in the ion precipitation. By examining densities
in MSE coordinates (Hara et al. 2013) we are able to look for a detectable effect in the region where
ion precipitation is more likely. Using the NGIMS neutral data and Key Parameters in situ solar wind
data from February 2015 to August 2017 we look for asymmetries by constructing average density maps
in Mars-Solar-Orbital (MSO) and MSE coordinates near the exobase. The NGIMS densities for O, Ar,
and CO2 from 180-220 km altitude for each orbit are averaged and then binned by location in MSO coordinates
and transformed to MSE coordinates. The resulting MSE map exhibits a small density increase in the
southern hemisphere, where one would expect to see enhanced precipitation. Although suggestive,
the change is not statistically significant, so that the effect of ion precipitation, thought to
be an important driver in the evolution of Mars' atmosphere remains elusive.
