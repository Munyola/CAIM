The Southern Photometric Local Universe Survey (S-PLUS) is imaging ~9300 deg^2 of the celestial
sphere in twelve optical bands using a dedicated 0.8 m robotic telescope, the T80-South, at the Cerro
Tololo Inter-American Observatory, Chile. The telescope is equipped with a 9.2k by 9.2k e2v detector
with 10 um pixels, resulting in a field-of-view of 2 deg^2 with a plate scale of 0.55"/pixel. The survey
consists of four main subfields, which include two non-contiguous fields at high Galactic latitudes
(8000 deg^2 at |b| > 30 deg) and two areas of the Galactic plane and bulge (for an additional 1300 deg^2).
S-PLUS uses the Javalambre 12-band magnitude system, which includes the 5 u', g', r', i', z' broad-band
filters and 7 narrow-band filters centered on prominent stellar spectral features: the Balmer
jump/[OII], Ca H+K, H-delta, G-band, Mg b triplet, H-alpha, and the Ca triplet. S-PLUS delivers
accurate photometric redshifts (delta_z/(1+z) = 0.02 or better) for galaxies with r' < 20 AB mag
and redshift < 0.5, thus producing a 3D map of the local Universe over a volume of more than 1 (Gpc/h)^3.
The final S-PLUS catalogue will also enable the study of star formation and stellar populations
in and around the Milky Way and nearby galaxies, as well as searches for quasars, variable sources,
and low-metallicity stars. In this paper we introduce the main characteristics of the survey, illustrated
with science verification data highlighting the unique capabilities of S-PLUS. We also present
the first public data release of ~336 deg^2 of the Stripe-82 area, which is available at this http
