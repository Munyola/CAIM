Galactic winds and fountains driven by supernova-heated gas play an integral role in re-distributing
gas in galaxies, depositing metals in the circumgalactic medium (CGM), and quenching star formation.
The interplay between these outflows and ram pressure stripping due to the galaxy's motion through
an ambient medium may enhance these effects by converting fountain flows into expelled gas. In this
paper, we present controlled, 3D simulations of ram pressure stripping combined with thermally
driven, local outflows from clustered supernovae in an isolated disk galaxy modeled on the Large
Magellanic Cloud (LMC), a dwarf satellite of the Milky Way on its first infall. Observational evidence
of local outflows emanating from supergiant shells in the LMC and a trailing filament of HI gas originating
from these regions - with no obvious Leading Arm counterpart - may represent a perfect example of
this process. Our simulations present a proof-of-concept that ram pressure can convert fountain
flows into expelled gas. We find that fountains launched near the peak star formation time of the
LMC can comprise part of the LMC filament in the Trailing Stream, but with lower column densities
than observed. Larger, more numerous outflows from the LMC may be possible and may contribute more
mass, but higher inertia gas will lengthen the timescale for this gas to be swept away by ram pressure.
Given the high resolution observations, increased knowledge of star formation histories, and
growing evidence of multiphase, ionized outflows, the LMC is an ideal test-bed for future wind models.
