The optical and UV emission from sub-parsec massive black hole binaries (MBHBs) in active galactic
nuclei (AGN) is believed to vary periodically, on timescales comparable to the binary's orbital
time. If driven by accretion rate fluctuations, the variability could be isotropic. If dominated
by relativistic Doppler modulation, the variability should instead be anisotropic, resembling
a rotating forward-beamed lighthouse. We consider the infrared (IR) reverberation of either type
of periodic emission by pc-scale circumbinary dust tori. We predict the phase and amplitude of IR
variability as a function of the ratio of dust light crossing time to the source variability period,
and of the torus inclination and opening angle. We enumerate several differences between the isotropic
and anisotropic cases. Interestingly, for a nearly face-on binary with an inclined dust torus,
the Doppler boost can produce IR variability without any observable optical/UV variability. Such
orphan-IR variability would have been missed in optical searches for periodic AGN. We apply our
models to time-domain WISE IR data from the MBHB candidate PG 1302-102 and find consistency with
dust reverberation by both isotropically emitting and Doppler-boosted sources in the shorter
wavelength W1-W2 (2.8-5.3 micrometer) bands. We constrain the dust torus to be thin (aspect ratio
~0.1), with an inner radius at 1-5 pc. More generally, our dust echo models will aid in identifying
new MBHB candidates, determining their nature, and constraining the physical properties of MBHBs
and their dust tori.
