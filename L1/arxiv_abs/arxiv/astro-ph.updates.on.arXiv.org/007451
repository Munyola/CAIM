Europa's surface exhibits morphological features associated with a low craters density that demonstrate
a recent internal activity. In particular, the morphology of the smooth plains covering parts of
the surface, and their relationship to the surrounding terrains suggest that they result from viscous
liquid extrusions. Furthermore, recent literature explains the emplacement of liquid-related
features, such as double ridges, lenticulae and chaos by the presence of liquid reservoirs beneath
the surface. We model the ascent of liquid water through a dike or a pipe-like conduit, from a sub-surface
reservoir to Europa's surface and derive the eruption time-scale and the total volume extruded
at the end of the eruption, depending on the chamber volume and depth. We also estimate the freezing
time of the sub-surface reservoir necessary to trigger an eruption. Considering available data
for density and eutectic temperature of salt impurities recently proposed for Europa, we discuss
their effect on the cryomagma freezing time and ascent. For plausible volumes and depths varying
between $0.1$ $km^3$ $\leq$ $V$ $\leq$ $10$ $km^3$ and $100$ $m$ $\leq$ $H$ $\leq$ $10$ $km$, the
total extruded cryolava volume ranges from $10^5$ to $10^8$ $m^3$ and the time scale of the eruptions
varies from few minutes to few tens of hours. The freezing time-scale of the cryomagma pocket varies
with the cryomagma composition: it varies between $10^2$ to $10^3$ years for a pure water cryomagma
and from $10^2$ to $10^4$ years for a briny cryomagma.
