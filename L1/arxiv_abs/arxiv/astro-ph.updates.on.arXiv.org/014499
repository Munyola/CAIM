We observe two metal-poor main sequence stars that are members of the recently-discovered Sylgr
stellar stream. We present radial velocities, stellar parameters, and abundances for 13 elements
derived from high-resolution optical spectra collected using the Magellan Inamori Kyocera Echelle
spectrograph. The two stars have identical compositions (within 0.13 dex or 1.2 sigma) among all
elements detected. Both stars are very metal poor ([Fe/H] = -2.92 +/- 0.06). Neither star is highly
enhanced in C ([C/Fe] < +1.0). Both stars are enhanced in the alpha elements Mg, Si, and Ca ([alpha/Fe]
= +0.32 +/- 0.06), and ratios among Na, Al, and all Fe-group elements are typical for other stars in
the halo and ultra-faint and dwarf spheroidal galaxies at this metallicity. Sr is mildly enhanced
([Sr/Fe] = +0.22 +/- 0.11), but Ba is not enhanced ([Ba/Fe] < -0.4), indicating that these stars do
not contain high levels of neutron-capture elements. The Li abundances match those found in metal-poor
unevolved field stars and globular clusters (log epsilon (Li) = 2.05 +/- 0.07), which implies that
environment is not a dominant factor in determining the Li content of metal-poor stars. The chemical
compositions of these two stars cannot distinguish whether the progenitor of the Sylgr stream was
a dwarf galaxy or a globular cluster. If the progenitor was a dwarf galaxy, the stream may originate
from a dense region such as a nuclear star cluster. If the progenitor was a globular cluster, it would
be the most metal-poor globular cluster known.
