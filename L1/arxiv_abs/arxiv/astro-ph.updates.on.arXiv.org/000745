Asteroids and comets are of strategic importance for science in an effort to understand the formation,
evolution and composition of the Solar System. Near-Earth Objects (NEOs) are of particular interest
because of their accessibility from Earth, but also because of their speculated wealth of material
resources. The exploitation of these resources has long been discussed as a means to lower the cost
of future space endeavours. In this paper, we consider the currently known NEO population and define
a family of so-called Easily Retrievable Objects (EROs), objects that can be transported from accessible
heliocentric orbits into the Earth's neighbourhood at affordable costs. The asteroid retrieval
transfers are sought from the continuum of low energy transfers enabled by the dynamics of invariant
manifolds; specifically, the retrieval transfers target planar, vertical Lyapunov and halo orbit
families associated with the collinear equilibrium points of the Sun-Earth Circular Restricted
Three Body problem. The judicious use of these dynamical features provides the best opportunity
to find extremely low energy Earth transfers for asteroid material. A catalogue of asteroid retrieval
candidates is then presented. Despite the highly incomplete census of very small asteroids, the
ERO catalogue can already be populated with 12 different objects retrievable with less than 500
m/s of {\Delta}v. Moreover, the approach proposed represents a robust search and ranking methodology
for future retrieval candidates that can be automatically applied to the growing survey of NEOs.
