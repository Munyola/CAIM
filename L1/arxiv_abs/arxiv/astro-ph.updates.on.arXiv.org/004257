We present Halpha linear spectropolarimetry of a large sample of Herbig Ae/Be stars. Together with
newly obtained data for 17 objects, the sample contains 56 objects, the largest such sample to date.
A change in linear polarization across the Halpha line is detected in 42 (75 %) objects, which confirms
the previous finding that the circumstellar environment around these stars on small spatial scales
has an asymmetric structure, which is typically identified with a disk. A second outcome of this
research is that we confirm that Herbig Ae stars are similar to T Tauri stars in displaying a line polarization
effect, while depolarization is more common among Herbig Be stars. This finding had been suggested
previously to indicate that Herbig Ae stars form in the same manner than T Tauri stars through magnetospheric
accretion. It appears that the transition between these two differing polarization line effects
occurs around the B7-B8 spectral type. This would in turn not only suggest that Herbig Ae stars accrete
in a similar fashion as lower mass stars, but also that this accretion mechanism switches to a different
type of accretion for Herbig Be stars. We report that the magnitude of the line effect caused by electron
scattering close to the stars does not exceed 2%. Only a very weak correlation is found between the
magnitude of the line effect and the spectral type or the strength of the Halpha line. This indicates
that the detection of a line effect only relies on the geometry of the line-forming region and the
geometry of the scattering electrons.
