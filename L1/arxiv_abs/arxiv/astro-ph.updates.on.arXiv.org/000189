We investigate a CME propagating towards Earth on 29 March 2011. This event is specifically chosen
for its predominately northward directed magnetic field, so that the influence from the momentum
flux onto Earth can be isolated. We focus our study on understanding how a small Earth-directed segment
propagates. Mass images are created from the white-light cameras onboard STEREO which are also
converted into mass height-time maps (mass J-maps). The mass tracks on these J-maps correspond
to the sheath region between the CME and its associated shock front as detected by in situ measurements
at L1. A time-series of mass measurements from the STEREO COR-2A instrument are made along the Earth
propagation direction. Qualitatively, this mass time-series shows a remarkable resemblance
to the L1 in situ density series. The in situ measurements are used as inputs into a 3D magnetospheric
space weather simulation from CCMC. These simulations display a sudden compression of the magnetosphere
from the large momentum flux at the leading edge of the CME and predictions are made for the time-derivative
of the magnetic field (dB/dt) on the ground. The predicted dB/dt were then compared with observations
from specific equatorially-located ground stations and show notable similarity. This study of
the momentum of a CME from the Sun down to its influence on magnetic ground stations on Earth is presented
as preliminary proof of concept, such that future attempts may try to use remote sensing to create
density and velocity time-series as inputs to magnetospheric simulations.
