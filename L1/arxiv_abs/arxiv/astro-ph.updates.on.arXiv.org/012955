This paper describes the characterization of the GALANTE photometric system, a seven intermediate-
and narrow-band filter system with a wavelength coverage from 3000 $\r{A}$ to 9000 $\r{A}$ . We describe
the photometric system presenting the full sensitivity curve as a product of the filter sensitivity,
CCD, telescope mirror, and atmospheric transmission curves, as well as some first- and second-order
moments of this sensitivity function. The GALANTE photometric system is composed of four filters
from the J-PLUS photometric system, a twelve broad-to-narrow filter system, and three exclusive
filters, specifically designed to measure the physical parameters of stars such as effective temperature
$T_{\rm eff}$, $\log(g)$, metallicity, colour excess $E(4405-5495)$, and extinction type $R_{5495}$.
Two libraries, the Next Generation Spectral Library (NGSL) and the one presented in Ma\'iz Apell\'aniz
& Weiler (2018), have been used to determine the transformation equations between the Sloan Digital
Sky Survey ($\textit{SDSS}$) $\textit{ugriz}$ photometry and the GALANTE photometric system.
We will use this transformation to calibrate the zero points of GALANTE images. To this end, a preliminary
photometric calibration of GALANTE has been made based on two different $\textit{griz}$ libraries
($\textit{SDSS}$ DR12 and ATLAS All-Sky Stellar Reference Catalog, hereinafter $\textit{RefCat2}$).
A comparison between both zero points is performed leading us to the choice of $\textit{RefCat2}$
as the base catalogue for this calibration, and applied to a field in the Cyg OB2 association.
