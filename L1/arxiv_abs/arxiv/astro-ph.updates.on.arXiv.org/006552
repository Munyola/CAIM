The Kelvin-Hemholtz (K-H) instability in the corona EUV jet is studied via 2.5 MHD numerical simulations.
The jet results from magnetic reconnection due to the interation of the new emerging magnetic field
and the pre-existing magnetic field in the corona. Our results show that the Alfven Mach number along
the jet is about 5-14 just before the instability occurs, and it is even higher than 14 at some local
areas. During the K-H instability process, several vortex-like plasma blobs of high temperature
and high density appear along the jet, and magnetic fields have also been rolled up and the magnetic
configuration including anti-parallel magnetic fields forms, which leads to magnetic reconnection
at many X-points and current sheet fragments inside the vortex-like blob. After magnetic islands
appear inside the main current sheet, the total kinetic energy of the reconnection outflows decreases,
and cannot support the formation of the vortex-like blob along the jet any longer, then the K-H instability
eventually disappears. We also present the results about how the guide field and the flux emerging
speed affect the K-H instability. We find that the strong guide field inhibits the shock formation
in the reconnection upward outflow regions but helps secondary magnetic islands appear earlier
in the main current sheet, and then apparently suppresses the K-H instability. As the speed of the
emerging magnetic field decreases, the K-H instability appears later, the highest temperature
inside the vortex blob gets lower and the vortex structure gets smaller.
