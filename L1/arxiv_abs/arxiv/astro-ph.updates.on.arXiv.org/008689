The solar mean magnetic field (SMMF) is referred to as the disc-averaged line-of-sight (LOS) magnetic
field that also reflects the polarity imbalance of the magnetic field on the Sun. The origin of the
SMMF has been debated over the past few decades, with one school of thought suggesting that the contribution
to the SMMF is mostly due to the large scale magnetic field structure, also termed as the background
magnetic field, whereas other and more recent studies have indicated that active regions have a
major contribution to the observed SMMF. In this paper, we re-investigate the issue of the origin
of the SMMF by decomposing the solar disk into plages, networks, sunspots and background regions,
thereby calculating the variation in the observed SMMF due to each of these features. We have used
full disk images from SDO/{\it AIA} recorded at 1600~\AA\, for earmarking plages, networks and
background regions and 4500~\AA\, images for separating the sunspots. The LOS fields corresponding
to each of these regions are estimated from the co-temporal SDO/{\it HMI} full disk magnetograms.
The temporal variation of the SMMF shows a near one-to-one correspondence with that of the background
field regions suggesting that they constitute the major component of the observed SMMF. A linear
regression analysis based on the coefficient of determination shows that the background field
dominates, and accounts for 89\% of the variation in the SMMF whereas the magnetic field from the
other features accounts for the rest 11\%.
