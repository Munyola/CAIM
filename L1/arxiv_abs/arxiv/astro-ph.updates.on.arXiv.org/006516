Double-lined eclipsing binaries allow accurate and direct determination of fundamental parameters
such as mass and radius for each component, and they provide important constraints on the stellar
structure and evolution models. In this study, we aim to determine a unique set of binary parameters
for the Algol system W UMi and to examine its evolutionary status. New high-resolution time-series
spectroscopic observations were carried out during 14 nights from April 2008 to March 2011, and
a total of 37 spectra were obtained using the Bohyunsan Optical Echelle Spectrograph. We measured
the radial velocities (RVs) for both components, and the effective temperature of the primary star
was found to be $T_{\rm eff,1}$ = 9310 $\pm$ 90 K by a comparison of the observed spectra and the Kurucz
models. The physical parameters of W UMi were derived by an analysis of our RV data together with the
multi-band light curves of Devinney et al. (1970). The individual masses, radii, and luminosities
of both components are $M_1$ = 3.68 $\pm$ 0.10 M$_\odot$ and $M_2$ = 1.47 $\pm$ 0.04 M$_\odot$, $R_1$
= 3.88 $\pm$ 0.03 R$_\odot$ and $R_2$ = 3.13 $\pm$ 0.03 R$_\odot$, and $L_1$ = 102 $\pm$ 1 L$_\odot$
and $L_2$ = 7.3 $\pm$ 0.1 L$_\odot$, respectively. A comparison of these parameters with theoretical
stellar models showed that the primary component lies in the main-sequence band, while the less
massive secondary is noticeably evolved. The results indicate that the initially more massive
star became the present secondary by losing most of its own mass via mass transfer to the companion
(present primary).
