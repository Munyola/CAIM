Within the standard hierarchical structure formation scenario, Milky Way-mass dark matter haloes
have hundreds of dark matter subhaloes with mass $\gtrsim 10^8 \, {\rm M_{\odot}}$. Over the lifetime
of a galactic disc a fraction of these may pass close to the central region and interact with the disc.
We extract the properties of subhaloes, such as their mass and trajectories, from a realistic cosmological
simulation to study their potential effect on stellar discs. We find that massive subhalo impacts
can generate disc heating, rings, bars, warps, lopsidedness as wells as spiral structures in the
disc. Specifically, strong counter-rotating single-armed spiral structures form each time a
massive subhalo passes through the disc. Such single-armed spirals wind up relatively quickly
(over $1-2$ Gyrs) and are generally followed by co-rotating two-armed spiral structures that both
develop and wind up more slowly. In our simulations self-gravity in the disc is not very strong and
these spiral structures are found to be kinematic density waves. We demonstrate that there is a clear
link between each spiral mode in the disc and a given subhalo that caused it, and by changing the mass
of the subhalo we can modulate the strength of the spirals. Furthermore, we find that the majority
of subhaloes interact with the disc impulsively, such that the strength of spirals generated by
subhaloes is proportional to the total torque they exert. We conclude that only a handful of encounters
with massive subhaloes is sufficient for re-generating and sustaining spiral structures in discs
over their entire lifetime.
