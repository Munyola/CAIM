At a distance of 1.8 parsecs, Barnard's star (Gl 699) is a red dwarf with the largest apparent motion
of any known stellar object. It is the closest single star to the Sun, second only to the alpha Centauri
triple stellar system. Barnard's star is also among the least magnetically active red dwarfs known
and has an estimated age older than our Solar System. Its properties have made it a prime target for
planet searches employing techniques such as radial velocity, astrometry, and direct imaging,
all with different sensitivity limits but ultimately leading to disproved or null results. Here
we report that the combination of numerous measurements from high-precision radial velocity instruments
reveals the presence of a low-amplitude but significant periodic signal at 233 days. Independent
photometric and spectroscopic monitoring, as well as the analysis of instrumental systematic
effects, show that this signal is best explained as arising from a planetary companion. The candidate
planet around Barnard's star is a cold super-Earth with a minimum mass of 3.2 Earth masses orbiting
near its snow-line. The combination of all radial velocity datasets spanning 20 years additionally
reveals a long-term modulation that could arise from a magnetic activity cycle or from a more distant
planetary object. Because of its proximity to the Sun, the proposed planet has a maximum angular
separation of 220 milli-arcseconds from Barnard's star, making it an excellent target for complementary
direct imaging and astrometric observations.
