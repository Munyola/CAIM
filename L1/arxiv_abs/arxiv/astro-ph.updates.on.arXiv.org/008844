Nova SMC 2016 has been the most luminous nova known in the direction of the Magellanic Clouds. It turned
into a very luminous supersoft X-ray source between day 16 and 28 after the optical maximum. We observed
it with Chandra, the HRC-S camera and the Low Energy Transmission Grating (LETG) on 2016 November
and 2017 January (days 39 and 88 after optical maximum), and with XMM-Newton on 2016 December (day
75). We detected the compact white dwarf (WD) spectrum as a luminous supersoft X-ray continuum with
deep absorption features of carbon, nitrogen, magnesium, calcium, probably argon and sulfur on
day 39, and oxygen, nitrogen and carbon on days 75 and 88. The spectral features attributed to the
WD atmosphere are all blue-shifted, by about 1800 km/s on day 39 and up to 2100 km/s in the following
observations. Spectral lines attributed to low ionization potential transitions in the interstellar
medium are also observed. Assuming the distance of the Small Magellanic Cloud, the bolometric luminosity
exceeded Eddington level for at least three months. A preliminary analysis with atmospheric models
indicates effective temperature around 700,000 K on day 39, peaking at the later dates in the 850,000-900,000
K range, as expected for a 1.25 m(sol) WD. We suggest a possible classification as an oxygen-neon
WD, but more precise modeling is needed to accurately determine the abundances. The X-ray light
curves show large, aperiodic ux variability, not associated with spectral variability. We detected
red noise, but did not find periodic or quasi-periodic modulations.
