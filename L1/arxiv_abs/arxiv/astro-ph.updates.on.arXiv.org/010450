We study several Galactic black hole candidates using long-time RXTE/ASM X-ray data to search for
telltale signatures of differences in viscous timescales in the two components used in the Two-Component
Advective Flow (TCAF) paradigm. In high-mass X-ray binaries (HMXBs) mainly winds are accreted.
This nearly inviscid and dominant sub-Keplerian flow falls almost freely towards the black hole.
A standard Keplerian disc can form out of this sub-Keplerian matter in presence of a significant
viscosity and could be small in size. However, in low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs), highly viscous
and larger Keplerian accretion disc is expected to form inside the sub-Keplerian disc due to the
Roche-lobe overflow. Due to two viscous timescales in these two components, it is expected to have
a larger lag between the times-of-arrival of these components in LMXBs than that in HMXBs. Direct
cross-correlation between the photon fluxes will not reveal this lag/delay since they lack linear
dependence; however, they are coupled through the viscous processes which bring in both matter.
To quantify the aforesaid time lag, we introduce an index ({\Theta}), which is a proxy of the usual
photon index ({\Gamma}). Thus, when {\Theta}, being dynamically responsive to both fluxes, is
considered as a reference, the arrival time lag between the two fluxes in LMXBs is found to be much
larger than that in HMXBs. Our result establishes the presence of two dynamical components in accretion
and shows that the Keplerian disc size indeed is smaller in HMXBs as compared to that in LMXBs.
