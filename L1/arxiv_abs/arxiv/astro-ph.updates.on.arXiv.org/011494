We investigate the possibility that the dwarf galaxies Crater II and Hercules have previously been
tidally stripped by the Milky Way. We present Magellan/IMACS spectra of candidate member stars
in both objects. We identify 37 members of Crater II, 25 of which have velocity measurements in the
literature, and we classify 3 stars within that subset as possible binaries. We find that including
or removing these binary candidates does not change the derived velocity dispersion of Crater II.
Excluding the binary candidates, we measure a velocity dispersion of $\sigma_{V_{los}} = 2.7^{+0.5}_{-0.4}$
\kms, corresponding to $M/L = 47^{+17}_{-13}$ M$_{\odot}/$L$_{\odot}$. We measure a mean metallicity
of [Fe/H] = $-1.95^{+0.06}_{-0.05}$, with a dispersion of $\sigma_{\mbox{[Fe/H]}} = 0.18^{+0.06}_{-0.08}$.
Our velocity dispersion and metallicity measurements agree with previous measurements for Crater
II, and confirm that the galaxy resides in a kinematically cold dark matter halo. We also search for
spectroscopic members stripped from Hercules in the possible extratidal stellar overdensities
surrounding the dwarf. For both galaxies, we calculate proper motions using \textit{Gaia} DR2
astrometry, and use their full 6D phase space information to evaluate the probability that their
orbits approach sufficiently close to the Milky Way to experience tidal stripping. Given the available
kinematic data, we find a probability of $\sim$40% that Hercules has suffered tidal stripping.
The proper motion of Crater II makes it almost certain to be stripped.
