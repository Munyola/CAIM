Spectra of HII regions obtained with Gemini/GMOS are used to derive the radial metallicity gradients
of four small, low-mass spiral galaxies. The analysis of the outer disk of one of them, NGC 1058, uncovers
the characteristic flattening found in similar extended disk galaxies. After combining these
data with published long-slit observations of nearby spiral galaxies, no evidence for a dependence
of the disk scale length-normalized metallicity gradients with stellar mass is found, down to log(M*/Msun)
~ 8.5. The abundance gradients derived from these observations are compared to predictions from
recent cosmological simulations of galaxy evolution, finding that in several cases the simulations
fail to reproduce the mean steepening of the gradients, expressed in dex/kpc, with decreasing stellar
mass for present-day galaxies, or do not extend to sufficiently small stellar masses for a meaningful
comparison. The mean steepening of the abundance gradients (in dex/kpc) with decreasing disk scale
length is in qualitative agreement with predictions from the inside-out model of Boissier & Prantzos,
although the predicted slopes are systematically steeper than observed. This indicates the necessity
of including processes such as outflows and radial mixing in similar models of galactic chemical
evolution. Published spatially resolved metallicity and photometric data of dwarf irregular
galaxies suggest that significant, but transitory, metallicity gradients can develop for systems
that have experienced recent (t < 100 Myr) enhanced star formation in their inner disks.
