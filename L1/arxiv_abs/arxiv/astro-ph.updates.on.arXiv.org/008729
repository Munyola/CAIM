The Kepler mission has detected a number of transiting circumbinary planets (CBPs). Although currently
not detected, exomoons could be orbiting some of these CBPs, and they might be suitable for harboring
life. A necessary condition for the existence of such exomoons is their long-term dynamical stability.
Here, we investigate the stability of exomoons around the Kepler CBPs using numerical N-body integrations.
We determine regions of stability and obtain stability maps in the (a_m,i_pm) plane, where a_m is
the initial exolunar semimajor axis with respect to the CBP, and i_pm is the initial inclination
of the orbit of the exomoon around the planet with respect to the orbit of the planet around the stellar
binary. Ignoring any dependence on i_pm, for most Kepler CBPs the stability regions are well described
by the location of the 1:1 mean motion resonance (MMR) of the binary orbit with the orbit of the moon
around the CBP. This can be ascribed to a destabilizing effect of the binary compared to the case if
the binary were replaced by a single body, and which is borne out by corresponding 3-body integrations.
For high inclinations, the evolution is dominated by Lidov-Kozai oscillations, which can bring
moons in dynamically stable orbits to close proximity within the CBP, triggering strong interactions
such as tidal evolution, tidal disruption, or direct collisions. This suggests that there is a dearth
of highly-inclined exomoons around the Kepler CBPs, whereas coplanar exomoons are dynamically
allowed.
