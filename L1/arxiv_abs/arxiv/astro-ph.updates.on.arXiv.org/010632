We map the trends of elemental abundance ratios across the Galactic disk, spanning R = 3-15 kpc and
midplane distance |Z|= 0-2 kpc, for 15 elements in a sample of 20,485 stars measured by the SDSS/APOGEE
survey (O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, P, S, K, Ca, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni). Adopting Mg rather than Fe as our reference
element, and separating stars into two populations based on [Fe/Mg], we find that the median trends
of [X/Mg] vs. [Mg/H] in each population are nearly independent of location in the Galaxy. The full
multi-element cartography can be summarized by combining these nearly universal median sequences
with our measured metallicity distribution functions and the relative proportions of the low-[Fe/Mg]
(high-alpha) and high-[Fe/Mg] (low-alpha) populations, which depend strongly on R and |Z|. We
interpret the median sequences with a semi-empirical "2-process" model that describes both the
ratio of core collapse and Type Ia supernova contributions to each element and the metallicity dependence
of the supernova yields. These observationally inferred trends can provide strong tests of supernova
nucleosynthesis calculations. Our results lead to a relatively simple picture of abundance ratio
variations in the Milky Way, in which the trends at any location can be described as the sum of two components
with relative contributions that change systematically and smoothly across the Galaxy. Deviations
from this picture and future extensions to other elements can provide further insights into the
physics of stellar nucleosynthesis and unusual events in the Galaxy's history.
