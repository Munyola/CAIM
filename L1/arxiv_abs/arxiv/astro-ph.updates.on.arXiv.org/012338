We report Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) , Very Large Telescope (VLT) and Spitzer Space
Telescope observations of ESO 184$-$G82, the host galaxy of GRB 980425/SN 1998bw, that yield evidence
of a companion dwarf galaxy at a projected distance of 13 kpc. The companion, hereafter GALJ193510-524947,
is a gas-rich, star-forming galaxy with a star formation rate of $\rm0.004\,M_{\odot}\, yr^{-1}$,
a gas mass of $10^{7.1\pm0.1} M_{\odot}$, and a stellar mass of $10^{7.0\pm0.3} M_{\odot}$. The
interaction between ESO 184$-$G82 and GALJ193510-524947 is evident from the extended gaseous
structure between the two galaxies in the GMRT HI 21 cm map. We find a ring of high column density HI
gas, passing through the actively star forming regions of ESO 184$-$G82 and the GRB location. This
ring lends support to the picture in which ESO 184$-$G82 is interacting with GALJ193510-524947.
The massive stars in GALJ193510-524947 have similar ages to those in star-forming regions in ESO
184$-$G82, also suggesting that the interaction may have triggered star formation in both galaxies.
The gas and star formation properties of ESO 184$-$G82 favour a head-on collision with GALJ193510-524947
rather than a classical tidal interaction. We perform state-of-the art simulations of dwarf--dwarf
mergers and confirm that the observed properties of ESO 184$-$G82 can be reproduced by collision
with a small companion galaxy. This is a very clear case of interaction in a gamma ray burst host galaxy,
and of interaction-driven star formation giving rise to a gamma ray burst in a dense environment.
