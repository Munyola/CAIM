Observational work have shown that the two brightest satellite galaxies, the Large Magellanic
Cloud (LMC) and the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), of the Milky Way (MW) are rare in the Milky Way analogs.
It is then interesting to know if the presence of massive satellite have any effect on the whole satellite
population in the Milky Way analogs. In this paper we investigate this problem using a semi-analytical
model combined with the Millennium-II Simulation. The MW analogous galaxies are defined to have
similar stellar mass or dark matter halo mass as the MW. We find that in the first case, the halo mass
is larger and there are on average two times more satellites in Milky Way analogs if there is a massive
satellite galaxy in the system. This is mainly from the halo formation bias. The difference is smaller
if the Milky Way analogs is selected using halo mass. It is also find that the satellites distribution
is slightly asymmetry, more concentrated on the line connecting the central galaxy and the massive
satellite. We also find that on average LMC have brought in 14.7 satellite galaxies with M_r < 0 at
its accretion, among which 4.5 satellites are still within a distance of 50 kpc from the LMC. Considering
other satellite, we predict there are 7.8 satellites with 50 kpc from the LMC. By comparing our model
to the early data of SAGA, a survey to observe satellite galaxy around 100 Milky Way analogs, we find
that SAGA have more bright satellites and less faint satellites than our model predictions. Future
comparison is needed for the final SAGA data.
