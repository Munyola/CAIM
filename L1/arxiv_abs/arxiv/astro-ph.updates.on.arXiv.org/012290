We study the redshift evolution of galaxy dynamical properties using the state-of-the-art semi-analytic
model GAEA (GAlaxy Evolution and Assembly): we show that the predicted size-mass relation for disky/star
forming and quiescent galaxies is in good agreement with observational estimates, up to $z\sim2$.
Nonetheless, bulge dominated galaxies have sizes that are offset low with respect to observational
estimates, mainly due to our implementation of disk instability at high redshift. At large masses,
both quiescent and bulge dominated galaxies have sizes smaller than observed. We interpret this
as a consequence of our most massive galaxies having larger gas masses than observed, and therefore
being more affected by dissipation. We argue that a proper treatment of quasar driven winds is needed
to alleviate this problem. Our model compact galaxies have number densities in agreement with observational
estimates and they form most of their stars in small and low angular momentum high-$z$ halos. GAEA
predicts that a significant fraction of compact galaxies forming at high-$z$ is bound to merge with
larger structures at lower redshifts: therefore they are not the progenitors of normal-size passive
galaxies at $z=0$. Our model also predicts a stellar-halo size relation that is in good agreement
with observational estimates. The ratio between stellar size and halo size is proportional to the
halo spin and does not depend on stellar mass but for the most massive galaxies, where AGN feedback
leads to a significant decrease of the retention factor (from about 80 per cent to 20 per cent).
