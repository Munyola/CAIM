We use the observed amount of subhaloes and line-of-sight dark-matter haloes in a sample of eleven
gravitational lens systems from the Sloan Lens ACS Survey to constrain the free-streaming properties
of the dark matter particles. In particular, we combine the detection of a small-mass dark-matter
halo by Vegetti et al. (2010) with the non-detections by Vegetti et al. (2014) and compare the derived
subhalo and halo mass functions with expectations from Cold Dark Matter (CDM) and sterile neutrino
models. We constrain the half-mode mass, i.e. the mass scale at which the linear matter power-spectrum
is reduced by 50 percent relatively to the CDM model, to be $\log M_{\rm {hm}} \left[M_\odot\right]
< 10.96$ (equivalent thermal relic mass $m_{\rm th} > 1.02$ keV) at the 2-$\sigma$ level. This excludes
sterile neutrino models with neutrino masses of $m_{\rm s} = 2.0$ keV and lepton asymmetry $L_{\rm
6} \leq 0.68$ and all values of $L_{\rm 6}$ for $m_{\rm s} < 1.5$ keV. Our constraints are weaker than
currently provided by the number of Milky Way satellites, observations of the 3.5 keV X-ray line
and the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest. However, they are more robust than the former as they are less affected
by baryonic processes. Moreover, unlike the latter they are not affected by assumptions on the thermal
histories for the inter-galactic medium. Under the assumption of a CDM dominated universe, the
expected number of detectable line-of-sight haloes is $1.16\pm1.08$, in agreement with the single
detection reported for this sample.
