The type I Seyfert galaxy NGC 3227 was observed by Suzaku six times in 2008, with intervals of $\sim1$
week and net exposures of $\sim50$ ksec each. Among the six observations, the source varied by nearly
an order of magnitude, being brightest in the 1st observation with a 2-10 keV luminosity of $1.2\times10^{42}$~erg~s$^{-1}$,
while faintest in the 4th with $2.9\times10^{41}$~erg~s$^{-1}$. As it became fainter, the continuum
in a 2-45 keV band became harder, while a narrow Fe-K$\alpha$ emission line, detected on all occasions
at 6.4 keV of the source rest frame, remained approximately constant in the photon flux. Through
a method of variability-assisted broad-band spectroscopy (e.g., Noda et al. 2013), the 2-45 keV
spectrum of NGC 3227 was decomposed into three distinct components. One is a relatively soft power-law
continuum with a photon index of $\sim 2.3$, weakly absorbed and highly variable on time scales of
$\sim5$ ksec; it was observed only when the source was above a threshold luminosity of $\sim6.6 \times10^{41}$
erg s$^{-1}$ (in 2-10 keV), and was responsible for further source brightening beyond. Another
is a harder and more absorbed continuum with a photon index of $\sim 1.6$, which persisted through
the six observations and varied slowly on time scales of a few weeks by a factor of $\sim2$. This component,
carrying a major fraction of the broad-band emission when the source is below the threshold luminosity,
is considered as an additional primary emission. The last one is a reflection component with the
narrow iron line, produced at large distances from the central black hole.
