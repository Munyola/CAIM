Magnetorotational instability (MRI) has a potential to generate the vigorous turbulence in protoplanetary
disks, although its turbulence strength and accretion stress remains debatable because of the
uncertainty of MRI with low ionization fraction. We focus on the heating of electrons by strong electric
fields which amplifies nonideal magnetohydrodynamic effects. The heated electrons frequently
collide with and stick to dust grains, which in turn decreases the ionization fraction and is expected
to weaken the turbulent motion driven by MRI. In order to quantitatively investigate the nonlinear
evolution of MRI including the electron heating, we perform magnetohydrodynamical simulation
with the unstratified shearing box. We introduce a simple analytic resistivity model depending
on the current density by mimicking resistivity given by the calculation of ionization. Our simulation
confirms that the electron heating suppresses magnetic turbulence when the electron heating occurs
with low current density. We find a clear correlation between magnetic stress and its current density,
which means that the magnetic stress is proportional to the squared current density. When the turbulent
motion is completely suppressed, laminar accretion flow is caused by ordered magnetic field. We
give an analytical description of the laminar state by using a solution of linear perturbation equations
with resistivity. We also propose a formula that successfully predicts the accretion stress in
the presence of the electron heating.
