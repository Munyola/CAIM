An ultra-light axion field with mass $\sim 10^{-22}\ {\rm eV}$, also known as wave or fuzzy dark matter,
has been proposed as a component of the dark matter in the Universe. We study the evolution of the axion
dark matter distribution in the central region of a halo, assuming the mass is dominated by this axion
field, and that gravity is the only important interaction. We calculate the excited axion states
in the spherical gravitational potential generated by the self-gravitating ground-state, also
known as soliton. These excited states are similar to the states of the hydrogen atom with quantum
numbers $(n,l,m)$, here designating oscillation modes of a classical wave. At fixed $n$, the modes
with highest $l$ have the lowest energy because of the extended mass distribution generating the
potential. We use an approximate analytical treatment to derive the distribution of mass in these
states when a steady-state is reached by dynamical relaxation, and find that a corona with a mass
density profile $\rho \propto r^{-5/3}$ should be set up around the central soliton, analogous
to the Bahcall-Wolf cusp predicted for the stellar distribution around a central black hole. The
central soliton accretes dark matter from the corona as dynamical relaxation proceeds and negative
orbital energy flows out. This density profile should remain valid out to the radius where the mass
in the corona is comparable to the mass of the central soliton; further than that, the gravitational
potential depends on the initial distribution of dark matter and the relaxation time increases
rapidly with radius.
