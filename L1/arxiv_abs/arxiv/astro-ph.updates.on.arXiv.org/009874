The purpose of this study is the identification of young ($1< age < 100$ Myr), nearby ($d \leqslant100$
pc) moving groups (YNMGs) through their kinematic signature. YNMGs could be the result of the recent
dispersal of young embedded clusters, such that they still represent kinematically cold groups,
carrying the residual motion of their parental cloud. Using the fact that a large number ($\sim$
14000) of the RAVE sources with evidence of chromospheric activity, also present signatures of
stellar youth, we selected a sample of solar type sources with the highest probability of chromospheric
activity to look for common kinematics. We made use of radial velocity information from RAVE and
astrometric parameters from GAIA DR2 to construct a 6-dimension position-velocity vector catalog
for our full sample. We developed a method based on the grouping of stars with similar orientation
of their velocity vectors, which we call the Cone Method Sampling. Using this method, we detected
646 sources with high significance in the velocity space, with respect to the average orientation
of artificial distributions made from a purely Gaussian velocity ellipsoid with null vertex deviation.
We compared this sample of highly significant sources with a catalog of YNMGs reported in previous
studies, which yield 75 confirmed members. From the remaining sample, about 50% of the sources have
ages younger than 100 Myr, which indicate they are highly probable candidates to be new members of
identified or even other YNMGs in the solar neighborhood.
