We present results of multicolor UBVRI observations of the type 1 Seyfert galaxy (SyG 1) NGC 7469
carried out at the 1.5-meter telescope of the Maidanak Observatory (Uzbekistan) in 2008-2014.
Analysis of the light curves indicates the presence of another slow flare of a long-term variability
in 2009-2014 with a maximum in 2011-2012. We investigate properties of the long-term variability
in 2009-2014, present (U-B)-(B-V) color diagrams for maxima and minima of NGC 7469 nuclear variability
using various apertures and compare them with the black-body gas radiation which models the accretion
disk radiation. Color-index measurements shows that the color becomes bluer at maximum brightness,
indicating a higher temperature of the accretion disk. We have analysed the relation of X-ray and
optical variability of NGC 7469 in 2008 and 2009 in comparison with the activity minimum in 2003.
In 2008 the correlation coefficient between the X-ray and optical radiation is close to 0.5. Such
poor correlation can be explained by the influence of an SN 1a explosion in close proximity to the
nucleus of NGC 7469. The SN manifests itself in the optical band but does not affect the X-ray variability
pattern. Comparison of the variability data in 2009 reveals a good correlation between the optical
(U band) and the X-ray (7-10 keV) variability with the correlation coefficient of about 0.93. The
correlation coefficient and the lag depend on the wavelength in the optical and X-ray bands. The
lag between the X-ray and optical fluxes in 2009 is 2-4 days. In 2003 the lag is almost zero.
