We report on our efforts to test the Einstein Equivalence Principle by measuring the gravitational
redshift with the VLBI spacecraft RadioAstron, in an eccentric orbit around Earth with geocentric
distances as small as $\sim$ 7,000 km and up to 350,000 km. The spacecraft and its ground stations
are each equipped with stable hydrogen maser frequency standards, and measurements of the redshifted
downlink carrier frequencies were obtained at both 8.4 and 15 GHz between 2012 and 2017. Over the
course of the $\sim$ 9 d orbit, the gravitational redshift between the spacecraft and the ground
stations varies between $6.8 \times 10^{-10}$ and $0.6 \times 10^{-10}$. Since the clock offset
between the masers is difficult to estimate independently of the gravitational redshift, only
the variation of the gravitational redshift is considered for this analysis. We obtain a preliminary
estimate of the fractional deviation of the gravitational redshift from prediction of $\epsilon
= -0.016 \pm 0.003_{\rm stat} \pm 0.030_{\rm syst}$ with the systematic uncertainty likely being
dominated by unmodelled effects including the error in accounting for the non-relativistic Doppler
shift. This result is consistent with zero within the uncertainties. For the first time, the gravitational
redshift has been probed over such large distances in the vicinity of Earth. About three orders of
magnitude more accurate estimates may be possible with RadioAstron using existing data from dedicated
interleaved observations combining uplink and downlink modes of operation.
