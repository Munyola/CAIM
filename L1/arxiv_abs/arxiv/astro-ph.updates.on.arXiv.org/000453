We present simulations modeling closed regions of the solar corona threaded by a strong magnetic
field where localized photospheric vortical motions twist the coronal field lines. The linear
and nonlinear dynamics are investigated in the reduced magnetohydrodynamic regime in Cartesian
geometry. Initially the magnetic field lines get twisted and the system becomes unstable to the
internal kink mode, confirming and extending previous results. As typical in this kind of investigations,
where initial conditions implement smooth fields and flux-tubes, we have neglected fluctuations
and the fields are laminar until the instability sets in. But previous investigations indicate
that fluctuations, excited by photospheric motions and coronal dynamics, are naturally present
at all scales in the coronal fields. Thus, in order to understand the effect of a photospheric vortex
on a more realistic corona, we continue the simulations after kink instability sets in, when turbulent
fluctuations have already developed in the corona. In the nonlinear stage the system never returns
to the simple initial state with ordered twisted field lines, and kink instability does not occur
again. Nevertheless field lines get twisted, but in a disordered way, and energy accumulates at
large scales through an inverse cascade. This energy can subsequently be released in micro-flares
or larger flares, when interaction with neighboring structures occurs or via other mechanisms.
The impact on coronal dynamics and CMEs initiation is discussed.
