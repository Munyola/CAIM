The last century has seen enormous progress in our understanding of the Universe. We know the life
cycles of stars, the structure of galaxies, the remnants of the big bang, and have a general understanding
of how the Universe evolved. We have come remarkably far using electromagnetic radiation as our
tool for observing the Universe. However, gravity is the engine behind many of the processes in the
Universe, and much of its action is dark. Opening a gravitational window on the Universe will let
us go further than any alternative. Gravity has its own messenger: Gravitational waves, ripples
in the fabric of spacetime. They travel essentially undisturbed and let us peer deep into the formation
of the first seed black holes, exploring redshifts as large as z ~ 20, prior to the epoch of cosmic re-ionisation.
Exquisite and unprecedented measurements of black hole masses and spins will make it possible to
trace the history of black holes across all stages of galaxy evolution, and at the same time constrain
any deviation from the Kerr metric of General Relativity. eLISA will be the first ever mission to
study the entire Universe with gravitational waves. eLISA is an all-sky monitor and will offer a
wide view of a dynamic cosmos using gravitational waves as new and unique messengers to unveil The
Gravitational Universe. It provides the closest ever view of the early processes at TeV energies,
has guaranteed sources in the form of verification binaries in the Milky Way, and can probe the entire
Universe, from its smallest scales around singularities and black holes, all the way to cosmological
dimensions.
