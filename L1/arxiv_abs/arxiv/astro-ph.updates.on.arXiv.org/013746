We show that the recently discovered binary 2M05215658+4359220 (2M0521), comprised of a giant
star (GS) orbiting a suspected black hole (BH) in a ~80 day orbit, may be instrumental in shedding
light on uncertain BH-formation physics and can be a test case for studying wind accretion models.
Using binary population synthesis with a realistic prescription for the star formation history
and metallicity evolution of the Milky Way, we analyze the evolution of binaries containing compact
objects (COs) in orbit around GSs with properties similar to 2M0521. We find ~100-1000 CO-GS binaries
in the Milky Way observable by Gaia, and 0-12 BH-GS and 0-1 neutron star-GS binaries in the Milky Way
with properties similar to 2M0521. We find that all CO-GSs with Porb<5 yr, including 2M0521, go through
a common envelope (CE) and hence form a class of higher mass analogs to white dwarf post-CE binaries.
We further show how the component masses of 2M0521-like binaries depend strongly on the supernova-engine
model we adopt. Thus, an improved measurement of the orbit of 2M0521, imminent with Gaia's third
data release, will strongly constrain its component masses and as a result inform supernova-engine
models widely used in binary population synthesis studies. These results have widespread implications
for the origins and properties of CO binaries, especially those detectable by LIGO and LISA. Finally,
we show that the reported X-ray non-detection of 2M0521 is a challenge for wind accretion theory,
making 2M0521-like CO-GS binaries a prime target for further study with accretion models.
