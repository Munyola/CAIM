We have measured the line-of-sight velocity distribution from integrated stellar light at two
points in the outer halo of M87 (NGC 4486), the second-rank galaxy in the Virgo Cluster. The data were
taken at R = 480" ($\sim 41.5$ kpc) and R = 526" ($\sim 45.5$ kpc) along the SE major axis. The second
moment for a non-parametric estimate of the full velocity distribution is $420 \pm 23$ km/s and $577
\pm 35$ km/s respectively. There is intriguing evidence in the velocity profiles for two kinematically
distinct stellar components at the position of our pointing. Under this assumption we employ a two-Gaussian
decomposition and find the primary Gaussian having rest velocities equal to M87 (consistent with
zero rotation) and second moments of $383 \pm 32$ km/s and $446 \pm 43$ km/s respectively. The asymmetry
seen in the velocity profiles suggests that the stellar halo of M87 is not in a relaxed state and confuses
a clean dynamical interpretation. That said, either measurement (full or two component model)
shows a rising velocity dispersion at large radii, consistent with previous integrated light measurements,
yet significantly higher than globular cluster measurements at comparable radial positions.
These integrated light measurements at large radii, and the stark contrast they make to the measurements
of other kinematic tracers, highlight the rich kinematic complexity of environments like the center
of the Virgo Cluster and the need for caution when interpreting kinematic measurements from various
dynamical tracers.
