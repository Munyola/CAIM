Multidimensional nucleosynthesis studies with hundreds of nuclei linked through thousands of
nuclear processes are still computationally prohibitive. To date, most nucleosynthesis studies
rely either on hydrostatic/hydrodynamic simulations in spherical symmetry, or on post-processing
simulations using temperature and density versus time profiles directly linked to huge nuclear
reaction networks. Parallel computing has been regarded as the main permitting factor of computationally
intensive simulations. This paper explores the different pros and cons in the parallelization
of stellar codes, providing recommendations on when and how parallelization may help in improving
the performance of a code for astrophysical applications. We report on different parallelization
strategies succesfully applied to the spherically symmetric, Lagrangian, implicit hydrodynamic
code SHIVA, extensively used in the modeling of classical novae and type I X-ray bursts. Speed-up
factors of 26 and 35 have been obtained with a parallelized version of SHIVA, in a 200-shell simulation
of a type I X-ray burst carried out with two nuclear reaction networks: a reduced one, consisting
of 324 isotopes and 1392 reactions, and a more extended network with 606 nuclides and 3551 nuclear
interactions. Maximum speed-ups of 41 (324-isotope network) and 85 (606-isotope network), are
also predicted for 200 cores, stressing that the number of shells of the computational domain constitutes
an effective upper limit for the maximum number of cores that could be used in a parallel application.
