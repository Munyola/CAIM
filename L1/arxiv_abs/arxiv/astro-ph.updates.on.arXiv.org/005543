Reconstructing the chemical evolution of the Milky Way is crucial for understanding the formation
of stars, planets, and galaxies throughout cosmic time. Different studies associated with element
production in the early universe and how elements are incorporated into gas and stars are necessary
to piece together how the elements evolved. These include establishing chemical abundance trends,
as set by metal-poor stars, comparing nucleosynthesis yield predictions with stellar abundance
data, and theoretical modeling of chemical evolution. To aid these studies, we have collected chemical
abundance measurements and other information such as stellar parameters, coordinates, magnitudes,
and radial velocities, for extremely metal-poor stars from the literature. The database, JINAbase,
contains 1658 unique stars, 60% of which have [Fe/H]<2.5. This information is stored in an SQL database,
together with a user-friendly queryable web application (this http URL). Objects with unique chemical
element signatures (e.g., r-process stars, s-process and CEMP stars) are labeled or can be classified
as such. The web application enables fast selection of customized comparison samples from the literature
for the aforementioned studies and many more. Using the multiple entries for three of the most well
studied metal-poor stars, we evaluate systematic uncertainties of chemical abundances measurements.
We provide a brief guide on the selection of chemical elements for model comparisons for non- spectroscopists
who wish to learn about metal-poor stars and the details of chemical abundances measurements.
