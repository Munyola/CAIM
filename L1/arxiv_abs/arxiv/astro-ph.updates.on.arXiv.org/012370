The emission process of Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) remains unknown. We investigate whether the synchrotron
maser emission from relativistic shocks in a magnetar wind can explain the observed FRB properties.
We perform particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations of perpendicular shocks in cold pair plasmas, checking
our results for consistency among three PIC codes. We confirm that a linearly polarized X-mode wave
is self-consistently generated by the shock and propagates back upstream as a precursor wave. We
find that at magnetizations $\sigma\gtrsim 1$ (i.e., ratio of Poynting flux to particle energy
flux of the pre-shock flow) the shock converts a fraction $f_\xi' \approx 7 \times 10^{-4}/\sigma^2$
of the total incoming energy into the precursor wave, as measured in the shock frame. The wave spectrum
is narrow-band (fractional width $\lesssim 1-3$), with apparent but not dominant line-like features
as many resonances concurrently contribute. The peak frequency in the pre-shock (observer) frame
is $\omega^{\prime \prime}_{\rm peak} \approx 3 \gamma_{\rm s | u} \omega_{\rm p}$, where $\gamma_{\rm
s|u}$ is the shock Lorentz factor in the upstream frame and $\omega_{\rm p}$ the plasma frequency.
At $\sigma\gtrsim1$, where our estimated $\omega''_{\rm peak}$ differs from previous works,
the shock structure presents two solitons separated by a cavity, and the peak frequency corresponds
to an eigenmode of the cavity. Our results provide physically-grounded inputs for FRB emission
models within the magnetar scenario.
