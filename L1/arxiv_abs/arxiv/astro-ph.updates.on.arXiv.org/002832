Gravitational waves from a variety of sources are predicted to superpose to create a stochastic
background. This background is expected to contain unique information from throughout the history
of the universe that is unavailable through standard electromagnetic observations, making its
study of fundamental importance to understanding the evolution of the universe. We carry out a search
for the stochastic background with the latest data from LIGO and Virgo. Consistent with predictions
from most stochastic gravitational-wave background models, the data display no evidence of a stochastic
gravitational-wave signal. Assuming a gravitational-wave spectrum of Omega_GW(f)=Omega_alpha*(f/f_ref)^alpha,
we place 95% confidence level upper limits on the energy density of the background in each of four
frequency bands spanning 41.5-1726 Hz. In the frequency band of 41.5-169.25 Hz for a spectral index
of alpha=0, we constrain the energy density of the stochastic background to be Omega_GW(f)<5.6x10^-6.
For the 600-1000 Hz band, Omega_GW(f)<0.14*(f/900 Hz)^3, a factor of 2.5 lower than the best
previously reported upper limits. We find Omega_GW(f)<1.8x10^-4 using a spectral index of
zero for 170-600 Hz and Omega_GW(f)<1.0*(f/1300 Hz)^3 for 1000-1726 Hz, bands in which no previous
direct limits have been placed. The limits in these four bands are the lowest direct measurements
to date on the stochastic background. We discuss the implications of these results in light of the
recent claim by the BICEP2 experiment of the detection of inflationary gravitational waves.
