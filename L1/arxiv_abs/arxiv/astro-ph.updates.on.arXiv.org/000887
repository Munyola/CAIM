We aim to find the optimal site locations for a hypothetical network of 1-3 triangular gravitational-wave
telescopes. We define the following N-telescope figures of merit (FoMs) and construct three corresponding
metrics: (a) capability of reconstructing the signal polarization; (b) accuracy in source localization;
and (c) accuracy in reconstructing the parameters of a standard binary source. We also define a combined
metric that takes into account the three FoMs with practically equal weight. After constructing
a geomap of possible telescope sites, we give the optimal 2-telescope networks for the four FoMs
separately in example cases where the location of the first telescope has been predetermined. We
found that based on the combined metric, placing the first telescope to Australia provides the most
options for optimal site selection when extending the network with a second instrument. We suggest
geographical regions where a potential second and third telescope could be placed to get optimal
network performance in terms of our FoMs. Additionally, we use a similar approach to find the optimal
location and orientation for the proposed LIGO-India detector within a five-detector network
with Advanced LIGO (Hanford), Advanced LIGO (Livingston), Advanced Virgo, and KAGRA. We found
that the FoMs do not change greatly in sites within India, though the network can suffer a significant
loss in reconstructing signal polarizations if the orientation angle of an L-shaped LIGO-India
is not set to the optimal value of ~58.2deg(+k*90deg) (measured counterclockwise from East to the
bisector of the arms).
