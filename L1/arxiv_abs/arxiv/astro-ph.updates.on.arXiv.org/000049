There have been many proposed explanations for the larger-than-expected radii of some transiting
hot Jupiters, including either stellar or orbital energy deposition deep in the atmosphere or deep
in the interior. In this paper, we explore the important influences on hot-Jupiter radius evolution
of (i) additional heat sources in the high atmosphere, the deep atmosphere, and deep in the convective
interior; (ii) consistent cooling of the deep interior through the planetary dayside, nightside,
and poles; (iii) the degree of heat redistribution to the nightside; and (iv) the presence of an upper
atmosphere absorber inferred to produce anomalously hot upper atmospheres and inversions in some
close-in giant planets. In particular, we compare the radius expansion effects of atmospheric
and deep-interior heating at the same power levels and derive the power required to achieve a given
radius increase when night-side cooling is incorporated. We find that models that include consistent
day/night cooling are more similar to isotropically irradiated models when there is more heat redistributed
from the dayside to the nightside. In addition, we consider the efficacy of ohmic heating in the atmosphere
and/or convective interior in inflating hot Jupiters. Among our conclusions are that (i) the most
highly irradiated planets cannot stably have uB > (10 km/s Gauss) over a large fraction of their
daysides, where u is the zonal wind speed and B is the dipolar magnetic field strength in the atmosphere,
and (ii) that ohmic heating cannot in and of itself lead to a runaway in planet radius.
