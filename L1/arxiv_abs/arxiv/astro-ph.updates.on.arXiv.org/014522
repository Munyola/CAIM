Galaxies are surrounded by massive gas reservoirs (i.e. the circumgalactic medium; CGM) which
play a key role in their evolution. The properties of the CGM, which are dependent on a variety of internal
and environmental factors, are often inferred from absorption line surveys which rely on a limited
number of single lines-of-sight. In this work we present an analysis of 28 galaxy haloes selected
from the Auriga project, a cosmological magneto-hydrodynamical zoom-in simulation suite of isolated
Milky Way-mass galaxies, to understand the impact of CGM diversity on observational studies. Although
the Auriga haloes are selected to populate a narrow range in halo mass, our work demonstrates that
the CGM of L* galaxies is extremely diverse: column densities of commonly observed species span
~3-4 dex and their covering fractions range from ~5 to 90 per cent. Despite this diversity, we identify
the following correlations: 1) the covering fractions (CF) of hydrogen and metals of the Auriga
haloes positively correlate with stellar mass, 2) the CF of H I, C IV, and Si II anticorrelate with
active galactic nucleus luminosity due to ionization effects, and 3) the CF of H I, C IV, and Si II positively
correlate with galaxy disc fraction due to outflows populating the CGM with cool and dense gas. The
Auriga sample demonstrates striking diversity within the CGM of L* galaxies, which poses a challenge
for observations reconstructing CGM characteristics from limited samples, and also indicates
that long-term merger assembly history and recent star formation are not the dominant sculptors
of the CGM.
