Galaxy clusters are known to be the reservoirs of Cosmic Rays (CRs), mostly inferred from theoretical
calculations or detection of CR derived observables. Though CR electrons have been detected through
radio emissions, CR protons and its derivative gamma rays remained undetected. CR acceleration
in clusters is mostly attributed to its dynamical activities that produce shocks. Shocks in clusters
emerge out of merger or accretion but, which one is more effective? at which dynamical phase? and
why? So, in quest of answers, we study the detail evolution of cosmic ray emission in the galaxy clusters
using cosmological simulations with {\sc enzo} code. Defining appropriate dynamical states using
the concept of virialization, we have studied a sample of merging and non-merging clusters. We report
that the merger shocks (Mach, $\mathcal{M}=2-5$) are the most effective CR producers in clusters.
Clusters once merged, permanently deviate from CR and X-ray mass scaling of non-merging systems,
enabling us to use it as a tool to determine the state of merger. Through a temporal and spatial evolution
study, we found a strong correlation between cluster merger dynamics and CR production. We have
observed that the brightest phase of X-ray and CR emission from clusters occur respectively about
1.0 and 1.5 Gyr after every merger. This significant finding of non concurrent appearance of X-ray
and CR emission peaks can explain the non-detection of gamma-rays from many X-ray bright galaxy
clusters. This can also be a guiding information to select appropriate targets for gamma-ray detection
from clusters.
