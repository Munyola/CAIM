We explore the effects of seasonal variability for the climate of Earth-like planets as determined
by the two parameters polar obliquity and orbital eccentricity using a general circulation model
of intermediate complexity. In the first part of the paper we examine the consequences of different
values of obliquity and eccentricity for the spatio-temporal patterns of radiation and surface
temperatures as well as for the main characteristics of the atmospheric circulations. In the second
part we analyse the associated implications for the habitability of planets close to the outer edge
of the habitable zone (HZ). This part of the paper focuses in particular on the multistability property
of climate, i.e. the parallel existence of both an ice-free and an ice-covered climate state. Our
results show that seasonal variability affects both the existence of and transitions between the
two climate states. Moreover, our experiments reveal that planets with Earth-like atmospheres
and high seasonal variability can have ice-free areas at much larger distance from the host star
than planets without seasonal variability, which leads to a substantial expansion of the outer
edge of the HZ. Sensitivity experiments exploring the role of azimuthal obliquity and surface heat
capacity test the robustness of our results. On circular orbits, our findings obtained with a general
circulation model agree well with previous studies based on one dimensional energy balance models,
whereas significant differences are found on eccentric orbits.
