A highly unusual pair of a gamma-ray burst (GRB) GRB060218 and an associated supernova SN2006aj
has puzzled theorists for years. A supernova shock breakout and a jet from a newborn stellar mass
compact object were put forward to explain its multiwavelength signature. We propose that the source
is naturally explained by another channel, a tidal disruption of a white dwarf (WD) by an intermediate
mass black hole (IMBH). The tidal disruption is accompanied by a tidal pinching, which leads to the
ignition of a WD and a supernova. Some debris falls back onto the IMBH, forms a disk, which quickly
amplifies the magnetic field, and launches a jet. We successfully fit soft X-ray spectrum with the
Comptonized blackbody emission from a jet photosphere. The optical/UV emission is consistent
with self-absorbed synchrotron from the expanding jet front. The accretion rate temporal dependence
Mdot(t) in a tidal disruption provides a good fit to soft X-ray lightcurve. The IMBH mass is found
to be about 10^4Msun in three independent estimates: (1) fitting tidal disruption Mdot(t) to soft
X-ray lightcurve; (2) computing the jet base radius in a jet photospheric emission model; (3) inferring
the central BH mass based on a host dwarf galaxy stellar mass. The supernova position is consistent
with the center of the host galaxy, while low supernova ejecta mass is consistent with a WD mass. High
expected rate of tidal disruptions in dwarf galaxies is consistent with one source observed by Swift
satellite over several years at GRB060218 distance of 150Mpc. The encounters with the WDs provide
a lot of fuel for IMBH growth.
