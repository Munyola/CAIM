Ground based radial velocity (RV) searches continue to discover exoplanets below Neptune mass
down to Earth mass. Furthermore, ground based transit searches now reach milli-mag photometric
precision and can discover Neptune size planets around bright stars. These searches will find exoplanets
around bright stars anywhere on the sky, their discoveries representing prime science targets
for further study due to the proximity and brightness of their host stars. A mission for transit follow-up
measurements of these prime targets is currently lacking. The first ESA S-class mission CHEOPS
(CHaracterizing ExoPlanet Satellite) will fill this gap. It will perform ultra-high precision
photometric monitoring of selected bright target stars almost anywhere on the sky with sufficient
precision to detect Earth sized transits. It will be able to detect transits of RV-planets by photometric
monitoring if the geometric configuration results in a transit. For Hot Neptunes discovered from
the ground, CHEOPS will be able to improve the transit light curve so that the radius can be determined
precisely. Because of the host stars' brightness, high precision RV measurements will be possible
for all targets. All planets observed in transit by CHEOPS will be validated and their masses will
be known. This will provide valuable data for constraining the mass-radius relation of exoplanets,
especially in the Neptune-mass regime. During the planned 3.5 year mission, about 500 targets will
be observed. There will be 20% of open time available for the community to develop new science programmes.
