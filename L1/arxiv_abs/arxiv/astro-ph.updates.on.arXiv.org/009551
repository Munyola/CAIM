This study expands the coverage and improves the homogeneity of the distribution of MILES template
stars in the parameter space, as well as extends the wavelength coverage of the template spectra
to the far red beyond the Ca\,{\sc{ii}} triplet. To achieve this we have carried out a major observational
campaign using the OMR long-slit spectrograph mounted on the NAOC 2.16\,m telescope and the YFOSC
long-slit spectrograph mounted on the YNAO 2.4\,m telescope. The original sample is based on the
MILES library, supplemented by 918 stars selected from PASTEL database. In total, 822 OMR and 1,324
YFOSC spectra, covering respectively the wavelength ranges $\lambda\lambda$3800--5180 and
$\lambda\lambda$5150--9000, have been collected and reduced. The spectra have a mean resolution
FWHM (full-width at half-maximum) of $\sim 3.3$\,{\AA} and are wavelength- and flux-calibrated
to an accuracy of $\sim 20$\,km\,s$^{-1}$ and $\sim 5$\,per\,cent, respectively. The spectra
are further corrected for systematic errors in the wavelength calibration to an accuracy of $\sim
4$\,km\,s$^{-1}$ by cross-correlating with the theoretical spectra. Almost all the spectra have
an average signal to noise ratio (SNR) better than 100 per pixel. Combined with the MILES spectra,
there are now 1,731, 1,542, 1,324 and 1,273 stars with spectra covering respectively $\lambda\lambda$3800--5180,
$\lambda\lambda$3800--7500, $\lambda\lambda$5150--9000 and $\lambda\lambda$3800--9000.
This paper describes our template star selection, the observation and data reduction, and presents
the reduced spectra collected hitherto.
