The formation of massive black hole binaries (MBHBs) is an unavoidable outcome of galaxy evolution
via successive mergers. However, the mechanism that drives their orbital evolution from parsec
separations down to the gravitational wave (GW) dominated regime is poorly understood, and their
final fate is still unclear. If such binaries are embedded in gas-rich and turbulent environments,
as observed in remnants of galaxy mergers, the interaction with gas clumps (such as molecular clouds)
may efficiently drive their orbital evolution. Using numerical simulations, we test this hypothesis
by studying the dynamical evolution of an equal-mass, circular MBHB accreting infalling molecular
clouds. We investigate different orbital configurations, modelling a total of 13 systems to explore
different possible impact parameters and relative inclinations of the cloud-binary encounter.
We focus our study on the prompt, transient phase during the first few orbits when the dynamical evolution
of the binary is fastest, finding that this evolution is dominated by the exchange of angular momentum
through gas capture by the individual black holes and accretion. Building on these results, we construct
a simple model for evolving a MBHB interacting with a sequence of clouds, which are randomly drawn
from reasonable populations with different levels of anisotropy in their angular momenta distributions.
We show that the binary efficiently evolves down to the GW emission regime within a few hundred million
years, overcoming the 'final parsec' problem regardless of the stellar distribution.
