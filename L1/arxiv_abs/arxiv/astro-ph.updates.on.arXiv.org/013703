ALMA 870$\mu$m continuum imaging has uncovered a population of blends of multiple dusty star-forming
galaxies (DSFGs) in sources originally detected with the Herschel Space Observatory. However,
their pairwise separations are much smaller that what is found by ALMA follow-up of other single-dish
surveys or expected from theoretical simulations. Using ALMA and VLA, we have targeted three of
these systems to confirm whether the multiple 870$\mu$m continuum sources lie at the same redshift,
successfully detecting $^{12}$CO($J = 3$-2) and $^{12}$CO($J = 1$-0) lines and being able to confirm
that in the three cases all the multiple DSFGs are likely physically associated within the same structure.
Therefore, we report the discovery of two new gas-rich dusty protocluster cores (HELAISS02, $z
= 2.171 \pm 0.004$; HXMM20, $z = 2.602 \pm 0.002$). The third target is located in the well known COSMOS
overdensity at $z = 2.51$ (named CL J1001+0220 in the literature), for which we do not find any new
secure CO(1-0) detection, although some of its members show only tentative detections and require
further confirmation. From the gas, dust, and stellar properties of the two new protocluster cores,
we find very large molecular gas fractions yet low stellar masses, pushing the sources above the
main sequence, while not enhancing their star formation efficiency. We suggest that the sources
might be newly formed galaxies migrating to the main sequence. The properties of the three systems
compared to each other and to field galaxies may suggest a different evolutionary stage between
systems.
