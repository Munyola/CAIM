We report a detection of a faint near-Earth asteroid (NEA), which was done using our synthetic tracking
technique and the CHIMERA instrument on the Palomar 200-inch telescope. This asteroid, with apparent
magnitude of 23, was moving at 5.97 degrees per day and was detected at a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)
of 15 using 30 sec of data taken at a 16.7 Hz frame rate. The detection was confirmed by a second observation
one hour later at the same SNR. The asteroid moved 7 arcseconds in sky over the 30 sec of integration
time because of its high proper motion. The synthetic tracking using 16.7 Hz frames avoided the trailing
loss suffered by conventional techniques relying on 30-sec exposure, which would degrade the surface
brightness of image on CCD to an approximate magnitude of 25. This detection was a result of our 12-hour
blind search conducted on the Palomar 200-inch telescope over two nights on September 11 and 12,
2013 scanning twice over six 5.0 deg x 0.043 deg fields. The fact that we detected only one NEA, is consistent
with Harris's estimation of the asteroid population distribution, which was used to predict the
detection of 1--2 asteroids of absolute magnitude H=28--31 per night. The design of experiment,
data analysis method, and algorithms for estimating astrometry are presented. We also demonstrate
a milli-arcsecond astrometry using observations of two bright asteroids with the same system on
Apr 3, 2013. Strategies of scheduling observations to detect small and fast-moving NEAs with the
synthetic tracking technique are discussed.
