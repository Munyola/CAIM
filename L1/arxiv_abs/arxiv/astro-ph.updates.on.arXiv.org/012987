High redshift, massive halos are observed to have sustained, high star formation rates, which require
that the amount of cold gas in the halo is continuously replenished. The cooling time scale for the
hot virialized halo gas is too long to provide the source of cold gas. Supersonic, cold streams have
been invoked as a mechanism for feeding massive halos at high redshift and deliver the cold gas required
for continued star formation at the rates observed. This mechanism for replenishing the cold gas
reservoir is motivated by some cosmological simulations. However, the cold streams are likely
to be subject to the supersonic version of the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI), which eventually
leads to stream disruption. Cosmological simulations have yet to obtain the spatial resolution
required for understanding the detailed stability properties of cold streams. In this paper, we
consider instead an idealized model of magnetized cold streams that we spatially resolve. Using
linear theory we show how magnetic fields with dynamically important field strengths do not inhibit
the KHI but rather enhance its growth rate. We perform nonlinear simulations of magnetized stream
disruption and find that magnetic fields can nevertheless increase stream survival times by suppressing
the mixing rate of cold gas with the circumgalactic medium. We find that magnetic fields can allow
streams to survive $\sim 2-8$ times longer and, consequently, that streams $\sim 2-8$ times thinner
can reach the central galaxy if the magnetic field strength is $\sim 0.3-0.8 \mu$G.
