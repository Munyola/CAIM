Context. Accreted material onto CTTSs is expected to form a hot quasi-periodic plasma structure
that radiates in X-rays. Simulations of this phenomenon only partly match with observations. They
all rely on a static model for the chromosphere model and on the assumption that radiation and matter
are decoupled. Aims. We explore the effects on the structure and on the dynamics of the accretion
flow of both a shock-heated chromosphere and of the coupling between radiation and hydrodynamics.
Methods. We simulate accretion columns falling onto a stellar chromosphere using the 1D ALE code
AstroLabE. This code solves the hydrodynamics equations along with the two first momenta equations
for radiation transfer, with the help of a dedicated opacity table for the coupling between matter
and radiation. We derive the total electron and ions densities from collisional-radiative NLTE
ionisation equilibrium. Results. The chromospheric acoustic heating has an impact on the duration
of the cycle and on the structure of the heated slab. In addition, the coupling between radiation
and hydrodynamics leads to a heating of the accretion flow and the chromosphere, inducing a possible
unburial of the whole column. These two last conclusions are in agreement with the computed monochromatic
intensity. Both effects (acoustic heating and radiation coupling) have an influence on the amplitude
and temporal variations of the net X-ray luminosity, which varies between 30 and 94% of the incoming
mechanical energy flux, depending on the model considered.
