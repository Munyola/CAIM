Inserting a varying Lambda in Einstein's field equations can be made consistent with Bianchi identities
by allowing for torsion, without the need for adding scalar field degrees of freedom. In the minimal
such theory, in the absence of matter Lambda is totally free and undetermined by the field equations.
Inclusion of matter ties Lambda algebraically to it, at least in a set up where homogeneity and isotropy
are assumed, i.e.\ when there is no Weyl curvature. We show that Lambda is proportional to the matter
density, with a proportionality constant that depends on the equation of state. Unfortunately,
the proportionality constant becomes infinite for pure radiation, ruling out the minimal theory
{\it prima facie}, in spite of its novel internal consistency. It is possible to generalize the theory
still without the addition of kinetic terms (which would bring it close to a more conventional quintessence
model). We now find a new algebraically-enforced proportionality between Lambda and the matter
density. Lambda and radiation may now coexist in a form consistent with Big Bang nucleosynthesis,
though this places strict constraints on the single free parameter of the theory, $\theta$. In the
matter epoch Lambda behaves just like a dark matter component. Its density is proportional to the
baryonic and/or dark matter, and its presence and gravitational effects would need to be included
in accounting for the necessary dark matter in our Universe. This is a companion paper to Ref. [1]
where the underlying gravitational theory is developed in detail.
