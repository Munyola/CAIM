Disk warps around classical T Tauri stars (CTTS) can periodically obscure the central star for some
viewing geometries. For these so-called AA Tau-like variables, the obscuring material is located
in the inner disk and absorption spectroscopy allows one to characterize its dust and gas content.
Since the observed emission from CTTS consists of several components (photospheric, accretion,
jet, and disk emission), which can all vary with time, it is generally challenging to disentangling
disk features from emission variability. Multi-epoch, flux-calibrated, broadband spectra provide
us with the necessary information to cleanly separate absorption from emission variability. We
applied this method to three epochs of VLT/X-Shooter spectra of the CTTS V354 Mon (CSI Mon-660) located
in NGC 2264 and find that: (a) the accretion emission remains virtually unchanged between the three
epochs; (b) the broadband flux evolution is best described by disk material obscuring part of the
star, and (c) the Na and K gas absorption lines show only a minor increase in equivalent width during
phases of high dust extinction. The limits on the absorbing gas column densities indicate a low gas-to-dust
ratio in the inner disk, less than a tenth of the ISM value. We speculate that the evolutionary state
of V354 Mon, rather old with a low accretion rate, is responsible for the dust excess through an evolution
toward a dust dominated disk or through the fragmentation of larger bodies that drifted inward from
larger radii in a still gas dominated disk.
