We explore the properties of Type II-Plateau (II-P) supernovae (SNe) together with their red-supergiant
(RSG) star progenitors. Using MESA STAR, we modulate the parameters (e.g., mixing length, overshoot,
rotation, metallicity) that control the evolution of a 15Msun main-sequence star to produce a variety
of physical pre-SN models and SN II-P ejecta. We extend previous modeling of SN II-P radiation to
include photospheric and nebular phases, as well as multi-band light curves and spectra. Our treatment
does not assume local thermodynamic equilibrium, is time dependent, treats explicitly the effects
of line blanketing, and incorporates non-thermal processes. We find that the color properties
of SNe II-P require large model atoms for FeI and FeII, much larger than adopted in Dessart & Hillier
(2011). The color properties also imply RSG progenitors of limited extent (~500Rsun) --- larger
progenitor stars produce a SN II-P radiation that remains too blue for too long. This finding calls
for a reduction of RSG radii, perhaps through a strengthening of convective energy transport in
RSG envelopes. Increased overshoot and rotation reduce the ratio of ejecta to helium-core mass,
similarly to an increase in main-sequence mass, and thus complicate the inference ofprogenitor
masses. In contrast to the great sensitivity on progenitor radius, SN II-P color evolution appears
insensitive to variations in explosion energy. Finally, we document the numerous SN II-P signatures
that vary with progenitor metallicity, revealing their potential for metallicity determinations
in the nearby and distant Universe.
