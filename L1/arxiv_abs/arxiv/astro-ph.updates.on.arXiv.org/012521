Coronal Jets are transitory small-scale eruptions omnipresent in solar observations. Active
regions jets produce significant perturbations on the ambient solar atmosphere and are believed
to be generated by microflare reconnection. Multiple sets of recurrent jets are identified in extreme-ultraviolet
filter imaging. In this work we analyze the long time-scale recurrence of coronal jets originating
from a unique footpoint structure observed in the lower corona. We report the detection of penumbral
magnetic structures in the lower corona. These structures, that we entitled "Coronal Geysers",
persist through multiple reconnection events that trigger recurrent jets in a quasi-periodical
trend. Recurrent jet eruptions have been associated with Type-III radio bursts that are manifestations
of traveling non-thermal electron beams.We examine the assumed link, as the coronal sources of
interplanetary Type-III bursts are still open for debate. We scrutinized the hypothesized association
by temporally correlating a statistically significant sample of six Geyser structures, that released
at least 50 recurrent jets, with correspondent Type-III radio bursts detected in the interplanetary
medium. Data analysis of these phenomena provides new information towards understanding of small-scale
reconnection, non-thermal electron beam acceleration, and energy release. We find that the penumbral
Geyser-like flaring structures produce recurring jets. They can be long-lived, quasi-stable,
and act as coronal sources for Type-III bursts and implicitly for upwards accelerated electron
beams.
