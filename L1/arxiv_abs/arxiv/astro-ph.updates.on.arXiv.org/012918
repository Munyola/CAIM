Magnetic reconnection may be the fundamental process allowing energy stored in magnetic fields
to be released abruptly, solar flares and coronal mass ejection (CME) being archetypal natural
plasma examples. Magnetic reconnection is much too slow a process to be efficient on the large scales,
but accelerates once small enough scales are formed in the system. For this reason, the fractal reconnection
scenario was introduced (Shibata and Tanuma 2001) to explain explosive events in the solar atmosphere:
it was based on the recursive triggering and collapse via tearing instability of a current sheet
originally thinned during the rise of a filament in the solar corona. Here we compare the different
fractal reconnection scenarios that have been proposed, and derive generalized scaling relations
for the recursive triggering of fast, `ideal' - i.e. Lundquist number independent - tearing in collapsing
current sheet configurations with arbitrary current profile shapes. An important result is that
the Sweet-Parker scaling with Lundquist number, if interpreted as the aspect ratio of the singular
layer in an ideally unstable sheet, is universal and does not depend on the details of the current
profile in the sheet. Such a scaling however must not be interpreted in terms of stationary reconnection,
rather it defines a step in the accelerating sequence of events of the ideal tearing mediated fractal
cascade. We calculate scalings for the expected number of plasmoids for such generic profiles and
realistic Lundquist numbers.
