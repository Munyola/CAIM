The 3.2 gigapixel LSST camera, an array of 189 thick fully-depleted CCDs, will repeatedly image
the southern sky and accomplish a wide variety of science goals. However, its trove of tens of billions
of object images implies stringent requirements on systematic biases imprinted during shift-and-stare
CCD observation. In order to correct for these biases which, without correction, violate requirements
on weak lensing precision, we investigate CCD systematics using both simulations of charge transport
as well as with a unique bench-top optical system matched to the LSST's fast f/1.2 beam. By illuminating
single CCDs with realistic scenes of stars and galaxies and then analyzing these images with the
LSST data management pipelines, we can characterize the survey's imaging performance well before
the camera's first light. We present measurements of several CCD systematics under varying conditions
in the laboratory, including the brightness-dependent broadening of star and galaxy images, charge
transport anomalies in the silicon bulk as well as the edges, and serial deferred charge. Alongside
these measurements, we also present the development and testing of physics-based models which
inform corrections or mitigation strategies for these systematics. Optimization of the CCD survey
operation under a variety of realistic observational conditions, including systematic effects
from the optics, clocking, sky brightness, and image analysis, will be critical to achieve the LSST's
goals of precision astronomy and cosmology.
