New means of interstellar travel are now being considered by various research teams, assuming lightweight
spaceships to be accelerated via either laser or solar radiation to a significant fraction of the
speed of light (c). We recently showed that gravitational assists can be combined with the stellar
photon pressure to decelerate an incoming lightsail from Earth and fling it around a star or bring
it to rest. Here, we demonstrate that photogravitational assists are more effective when the star
is used as a bumper (i.e. the sail passes "in front of" the star) rather than as a catapult (i.e. the
sail passes "behind" or "around" the star). This increases the maximum deceleration at $\alpha$
Cen A and B and reduces the travel time of a nominal graphene-class sail (mass-to-surface ratio 8.6e-4
gram m$^{-2}$) from 95 to 75 yr. The maximum possible velocity reduction upon arrival depends on
the required deflection angle from $\alpha$ Cen A to B and therefore on the binary's orbital phase.
Here, we calculate the variation of the minimum travel times from Earth into a bound orbit around
Proxima for the next 300 yr and then extend our calculations to roughly 22,000 stars within about
300 ly. Although $\alpha$ Cen is the most nearby star system, we find that Sirius A offers the shortest
possible travel times into a bound orbit: 69 yr assuming 12.5% c can be obtained at departure from
the solar system. Sirius A thus offers the opportunity of flyby exploration plus deceleration into
a bound orbit of the companion white dwarf after relatively short times of interstellar travel.
