The Multi-coupled Dark Energy (McDE) scenario has been recently proposed as a specific example
of a cosmological model characterized by a non-standard physics of the dark sector of the universe
that nevertheless gives an expansion history which does not significantly differ from the one of
the standard $\Lambda $CDM model. In this work, we present the first constraints on the McDE scenario
obtained by comparing the predicted evolution of linear density perturbations with a large compilation
of recent data sets for the growth rate $f\sigma_{8}$, including 6dFGS, LRG, BOSS, WiggleZ and VIPERS.
Confirming qualitative expectations, growth rate data provide much tighter bounds on the model
parameters as compared to the extremely loose bounds that can be obtained when only the background
expansion history is considered. In particular, the $95\%$ confidence level on the coupling strength
$|\beta |$ is reduced from $|\beta |\leq 83$ (background constraints only) to $|\beta |\leq 0.88$
(background and linear perturbation constraints). We also investigate how these constraints
further improve when using data from future wide-field surveys such as supernova data from LSST
and growth rate data from Euclid-type missions. In this case the $95\%$ confidence level on the coupling
further reduce to $|\beta |\leq 0.85$. Such constraints are in any case still consistent with a scalar
fifth-force of gravitational strength, and we foresee that tighter bounds might be possibly obtained
from the investigation of nonlinear structure formation in McDE cosmologies.[Abridged]
