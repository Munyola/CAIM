We present a new study of the spatial distribution and ages of the star clusters in the Small Magellanic
Cloud (SMC). To detect and estimate the ages of the star clusters we rely on the new fully-automated
method developed by Bitsakis et al. (2017). Our code detects 1319 star clusters in the central 18
deg$^{2}$ of the SMC we surveyed (1108 of which have never been reported before). The age distribution
of those clusters suggests enhanced cluster formation around 240 Myr ago. It also implies significant
differences in the cluster distribution of the bar with respect to the rest of the galaxy, with the
younger clusters being predominantly located in the bar. Having used the same set-up, and data from
the same surveys as for our previous study of the LMC, we are able to robustly compare the cluster properties
between the two galaxies. Our results suggest that the bulk of the clusters in both galaxies were
formed approximately 300 Myr ago, probably during a direct collision between the two galaxies.
On the other hand, the locations of the young ($\le$50 Myr) clusters in both Magellanic Clouds, found
where their bars join the HI arms, suggest that cluster formation in those regions is a result of internal
dynamical processes. Finally, we discuss the potential causes of the apparent outside-in quenching
of cluster formation that we observe in the SMC. Our findings are consistent with an evolutionary
scheme where the interactions between the Magellanic Clouds constitute the major mechanism driving
their overall evolution.
