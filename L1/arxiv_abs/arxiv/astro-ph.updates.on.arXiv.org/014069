Extremely High energy peaked BL Lac (EHBL) objects are a special class of blazars with peculiar observational
properties at X-ray and $\gamma$--ray energies. The observations of these sources indicate hard
X-ray and $\gamma$--ray spectra and absence of rapid flux variations in the multi-wavelength light
curves. These observational features challenge the leptonic models for blazars due to unusually
hard particle spectrum in the emission region of the blazar jet and provide a strong motivation for
exploring alternative scenarios to interpret the broad-band emission from blazars. At present,
only few TeV blazars have been observed as EHBL objects in the extragalactic Universe. Due to their
hard $\gamma$--ray spectra and long term variability, the observations of EHBL type of blazars
at different redshifts help in probing the cosmic magnetic field and extragalactic background
light in the Universe. Such objects also provide astrophysical sites to explore the particle acceleration
mechanisms like magnetic reconnection and second order Fermi acceleration. Therefore, it has
become important to identify more objects as EHBL using the observations available in the literature.
Recent studies on the blazar Mrk 501 indicate that this source may exhibit an EHBL behaviour. In this
paper, we use long term observations of Mrk 501 to explore its nature. Two sets of data, related to
low and high/flaring activity states of Mrk 501, have been presented and compared with the observed
features of a few well known EHBL type of blazars.
