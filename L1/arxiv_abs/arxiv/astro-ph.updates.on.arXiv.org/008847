In a previous communication we showed that a joint analysis of Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)
data and the current measurement of the local expansion rate favours a model with a scale invariant
spectrum (HZ) over the minimal $\Lambda$CDM scenario provided that the effective number of relativistic
degrees of freedom, $N_{eff}$, is taken as a free parameter. Such a result is basically obtained
due to the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) value of the Hubble constant, $H_0 = 73.24 \pm 1.74$ $\rm{km.s^{-1}.Mpc^{-1}}$
(68\% C.L.), as the CMB data alone discard the HZ+$N_{eff}$ model. Although such a model is not physically
motivated by current scenarios of the early universe, observations pointing to a scale invariant
spectrum may indicate that the origin of cosmic perturbations lies in an unknown physical process.
Here, we extend the previous results performing a Bayesian analysis using joint CMB, HST, and Baryon
Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) measurements. In order to take into account the well-known tension
on the value of the fluctuation amplitude parameter, $\sigma_8$, we also consider Cluster Number
counts (CN) and Weak Lensing (WL) data. We use two different samples of BAO data, which are obtained
using two-point spatial (BAO 2PCF) and angular (BAO 2PACF) correlation functions. Our results
show that a joint CMB+HST+BAO 2PCF analysis discards the HZP$+N_{eff}$ model with respect to the
minimal $\Lambda$CDM scenario whereas the combination CMB+HST+BAO 2PACF favours the former model,
even when an extended dataset with NC and WL is considered.
