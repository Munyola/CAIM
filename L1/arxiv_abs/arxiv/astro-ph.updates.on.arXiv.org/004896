Transmission spectroscopy provides a window to study exoplanetary atmospheres, but that window
is fogged by clouds and hazes. Clouds and haze introduce a degeneracy between the strength of gaseous
absorption features and planetary physical parameters such as abundances. One way to break that
degeneracy is via statistical studies. We collect all published HST/WFC3 transit spectra for 1.1-1.65
$\mu$m water vapor absorption, and perform a statistical study on potential correlations between
the water absorption feature and planetary parameters. We fit the observed spectra with a template
calculated for each planet using the Exo-Transmit code. We express the magnitude of the water absorption
in scale heights, thereby removing the known dependence on temperature, surface gravity, and mean
molecular weight. We find that the absorption in scale heights has a positive baseline correlation
with planetary equilibrium temperature; our hypothesis is that decreasing cloud condensation
with increasing temperature is responsible for this baseline slope. However, the observed sample
is also intrinsically degenerate in the sense that equilibrium temperature correlates with planetary
mass. We compile the distribution of absorption in scale heights, and we find that this distribution
is closer to log-normal than Gaussian. However, we also find that the distribution of equilibrium
temperatures for the observed planets is similarly log-normal. This indicates that the absorption
values are affected by observational bias, whereby observers have not yet targeted a sufficient
sample of the hottest planets.
