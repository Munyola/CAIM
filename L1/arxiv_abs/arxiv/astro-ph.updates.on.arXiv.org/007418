Recent studies have revealed intense UV metal emission lines in a modest sample of z>7 Lyman-alpha
emitters, indicating a hard ionizing spectrum is present. If such high ionization features are
shown to be common, it may indicate that extreme radiation fields play a role in regulating the visibility
of Lyman-alpha in the reionization era. Here we present deep near-infrared spectra of seven galaxies
with Lyman-alpha emission at 5.4<z<8.7 (including a newly-confirmed lensed galaxy at z=6.031)
and three bright z>7 photometric targets. In nine sources we do not detect UV metal lines. However
in the z=8.683 galaxy EGSY8p7, we detect a 4.6 sigma emission line in the narrow spectral window expected
for NV 1243. The feature is unresolved (FWHM<90 km/s) and is likely nebular in origin. A deep H-band
spectrum of EGSY8p7 reveals non-detections of CIV, He II, and OIII]. The presence of NV requires
a substantial flux of photons above 77 eV, pointing to a hard ionizing spectrum powered by an AGN or
fast radiative shocks. Regardless of its origin, the intense radiation field of EGSY8p7 may aid
the transmission of Lyman-alpha through what is likely a partially neutral IGM. With this new detection,
five of thirteen known Lyman-alpha emitters at z>7 have now been shown to have intense UV line emission,
suggesting that extreme radiation fields are commonplace among the Lyman-alpha population. Future
observations with JWST will eventually clarify the origin of these features and explain their role
in the visibility of Lyman-alpha in the reionization era.
