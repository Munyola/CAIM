In this chapter, after a brief introduction and overview of stellar evolution, we discuss the evolution
and nucleosynthesis of very massive stars (VMS: M>100 solar masses) in the context of recent
stellar evolution model calculations. This chapter covers the following aspects: general properties,
evolution of surface properties, late central evolution, and nucleosynthesis including their
dependence on metallicity, mass loss and rotation. Since very massive stars have very large convective
cores during the main-sequence phase, their evolution is not so much affected by rotational mixing,
but more by mass loss through stellar winds. Their evolution is never far from a homogeneous evolution
even without rotational mixing. All VMS at metallicities close to solar end their life as WC(-WO)
type Wolf-Rayet stars. Due to very important mass loss through stellar winds, these stars may have
luminosities during the advanced phases of their evolution similar to stars with initial masses
between 60 and 120 solar masses. A distinctive feature which may be used to disentangle Wolf-Rayet
stars originating from VMS from those originating from lower initial masses is the enhanced abundances
of neon and magnesium at the surface of WC stars. At solar metallicity, mass loss is so strong that
even if a star is born with several hundred solar masses, it will end its life with less than 50 solar
masses (using current mass loss prescriptions). At the metallicity of the LMC and lower, on the other
hand, mass loss is weaker and might enable star to undergo pair-instability supernovae.
