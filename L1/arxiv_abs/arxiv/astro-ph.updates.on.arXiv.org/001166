We investigate the effect of primordial non-Gaussianity on the cross-correlation between the
CMB anisotropies and the 21 cm fluctuations from the epoch of reionization. We assume an analytic
reionization model and an ionization fraction with $f_{\rm NL}$ induced scale dependent bias.
We estimate the angular power spectrum of the cross-correlation of the CMB and 21 cm. In order to evaluate
the detectability, the signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio for only a single redshift slice is also calculated
for current and future observations, such as CMB observations by Planck satellite and 21 cm observations
by Omniscope. The existence of the $f_{\rm NL}$ increases the signal of the cross-correlation at
large scales and the amplification does not depend on the reionization parameters in our reionization
model. However the cosmic variance is significant on such scales and the S/N ratio is suppressed.
The obtained S/N ratio is 2.8 (2.4) for $f_{\rm NL}=10$ (100) in our fiducial reionization model.
Our work suggests in the absence of significant foregrounds and systematics, the auto-correlations
of 21 cm is a better probe of $f_{\rm NL}$ than the cross-correlations (as expected since it depends
on $b^2$), while the cross-correlations contain only one factor of $b$. Nevertheless, it is interesting
to examine the cross-correlations between 21 cm and CMB, as the signal-to-noise ratio is not negligible
and it is more likely we can rid ourselves of systematics and foregrounds that are common to both CMB
and 21 cm experiments than completely clean 21 cm of all of the possible foregrounds and systematics
in large scales.
