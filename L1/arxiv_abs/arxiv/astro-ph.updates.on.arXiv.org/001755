Recent models of black hole growth in a cosmological context have forwarded a paradigm in which the
growth is self-regulated by feedback from the black hole itself. Here we use cosmological zoom simulations
of galaxy formation down to z = 2 to show that such strong self-regulation is required in the popular
spherical Bondi accretion model, but that a plausible alternative model in which black hole growth
is limited by galaxy-scale torques does not require self-regulation. Instead, this torque-limited
accretion model yields black holes and galaxies evolving on average along the observed scaling
relations by relying only on a fixed, 5% mass retention rate onto the black hole from the radius at
which the accretion flow is fed. Feedback from the black hole may (and likely does) occur, but does
not need to couple to galaxy-scale gas in order to regulate black hole growth. We show that this result
is insensitive to variations in the initial black hole mass, stellar feedback, or other implementation
details. The torque-limited model allows for high accretion rates at very early epochs (unlike
the Bondi case), which if viable can help explain the rapid early growth of black holes, while by z
= 2 it yields Eddington factors of 1%-10%. This model also yields a less direct correspondence between
major merger events and rapid phases of black hole growth. Instead, growth is more closely tied to
cosmological disk feeding, which may help explain observational studies showing that, at least
at z > 1, active galaxies do not preferentially show merger signatures.
