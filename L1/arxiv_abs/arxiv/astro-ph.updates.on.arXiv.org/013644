Jupiter's magnetic field is generated by the convection of liquid metallic hydrogen in its interior.
The transition from molecular hydrogen to metallic hydrogen as temperature and pressure increase
is believed to be a smooth one. As a result, the electrical conductivity in Jupiter varies continuously
from being negligible at the surface to a large value in the deeper region. Thus, unlike the Earth
where the upper boundary of the dynamo---the dynamo radius---is definitively located at the core-mantle
boundary, it is not clear at what depth dynamo action becomes significant in Jupiter. In this paper,
using a numerical model of the Jovian dynamo, we examine the magnetic energy spectrum at different
depth and identify a dynamo radius below which (and away from the deep inner core) the shape of the
magnetic energy spectrum becomes invariant. We find that this shift in the behaviour of the magnetic
energy spectrum signifies a change in the dynamics of the system as electric current becomes important.
Traditionally, a characteristic radius derived from the Lowes--Mauersberger spectrum---the
Lowes radius---gives a good estimate to the Earth's core-mantle boundary. We argue that in our model,
the Lowes radius provides a lower bound to the dynamo radius. We also compare the Lowes--Mauersberger
spectrum in our model to that obtained from recent Juno observations. The Lowes radius derived from
the Juno data is significantly lower than that obtained from our models. The existence of a stably
stratified region in the neighbourhood of the transition zone might provide an explanation of this
result.
