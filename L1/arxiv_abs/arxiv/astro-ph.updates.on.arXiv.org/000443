Classical novae are the result of thermonuclear flashes of H accreted by CO or ONe white dwarfs, leading
eventually to the dynamic ejection of the surface layers. These are observationally known to be
enriched in heavy elements, such as C, O and Ne that must originate in layers below the H-flash convection
zone. Building on our previous work we now present stellar evolution simulations of ONe nova, and
provide a comprehensive comparison of our models with previous work. Some of our models include
exponential convective boundary mixing model to account for the observed enrichment of the ejecta
even when accreting material with a solar abundance distribution. Our models produce maximum temperature
evolution profiles and nucleosynthesis yields in good agreement with models that generate enriched
ejecta by assuming that the accreted material was pre-enriched. We confirm for ONe nova the result
we reported previously, i.e. we found that 3He can be produced in situ in solar-composition envelopes
accreted with slow rates (dM/dt < 1e-10 M_sun/yr) by cold (T_WD < 1e7 K) CO WDs, and that convection
is triggered by 3He burning before the nova outburst in this case. In addition, we now find that the
interplay between the 3He production and destruction in the solar-composition envelope accreted
with an intermediate rate, e.g. dM/dt = 1e-10 M_sun/yr, by the 1.15 M_sun ONe WD with a relatively
high initial central temperature, e.g. T_WD = 15e6 K, leads to the formation of a thick radiative
buffer zone that separates the bottom of the convective envelope from the WD surface. (abridged)
