We present detailed observations of ZTF18abukavn (SN2018gep), discovered in high-cadence data
from the Zwicky Transient Facility as a rapidly rising (1.3 mag/hr) and luminous ($M_{g,\mathrm{peak}}=-20$
mag) transient. It is spectroscopically classified as a broad-lined stripped-envelope supernova
(Ic-BL SN). The rapid rise to peak bolometric luminosity and blue colors at peak ($t_\mathrm{rise}
\sim $0.5-3 days, $L_\mathrm{bol} \gtrsim 3 \times 10^{44}\,\mathrm{erg}\,\mathrm{sec}{}^{-1}$,
$g-r=-0.3$) resemble the high-redshift Ic-BL iPTF16asu, as well as several other unclassified
fast transients. The early discovery of SN2018gep (within an hour of shock breakout) enabled an
intensive spectroscopic campaign, including the highest-temperature ($T_\mathrm{eff}\gtrsim40,000\,$K)
spectra of a stripped-envelope SN. A retrospective search revealed luminous ($M_g \sim M_r \approx
-14\,$mag) emission in the days to weeks before explosion, the first definitive detection of precursor
emission for a Ic-BL. We find a limit on the isotropic gamma-ray energy release $E_\mathrm{\gamma,iso}<4.9
\times 10^{48}\,$erg, a limit on X-ray emission $L_{\mathrm{X}} < 10^{40}\,\mathrm{erg}\,\mathrm{sec}{}^{-1}$,
and a limit on radio emission $\nu L_\nu \lesssim 10^{37}\,\mathrm{erg}\,\mathrm{sec}{}^{-1}$.
Taken together, we find that the data are best explained by shock breakout in a massive shell of dense
circumstellar material (0.02 $M_\odot$) at large radii ($3 \times 10^{14}\,$cm) that was ejected
in eruptive pre-explosion mass-loss episodes.
