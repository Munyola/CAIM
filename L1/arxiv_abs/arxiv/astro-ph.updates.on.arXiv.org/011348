We report the results of long-term simultaneous X-ray and UV monitoring of the nearby (z=0.03145)
Seyfert 1.5 galaxy Mrk 817 using the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory XRT and UVOT. Prior work has revealed
that the X-ray flux from Mrk 817 has increased by a factor of 40 over the last 40 years, whereas the UV
emission has changed by a factor of 2.3. The X-ray emission of Mrk 817 now compares to some of the brightest
Seyferts, but it has been poorly studied in comparison. We find that the X-ray (0.3-10.0 keV) and
the UVM2 (roughly 2000--2500 Angstrom) fluxes have fractional variability amplitudes of 0.35
and 0.18, respectively, over the entire monitoring period (2017 Jan. 2 to 2018 Apr. 20). A cross-correlation
analysis is performed on the X-ray (0.3-10.0 keV) and UVM2 light curves over the entire monitoring
period, a period of less frequent monitoring (2017 Jan. 2 to 2017 Dec. 11), and a period of more frequent
monitoring (2018 Jan. 12 to 2018 Apr. 20). The analysis reveals no significant correlation between
the two at any given lag for all monitoring periods. Especially given that reverberation studies
have found significant lags between optical/UV continuum bands and broad optical lines in Mrk 817,
the lack of a significant X-ray-UV correlation may point to additional complexities in the inner
or intermediate disk. Mechanical (e.g.,a funnel in the inner disk) and/or relativistic beaming
of the X-ray emission could potentially explain the lack of a correlation. Alternatively, scattering
in an equatorial wind could also diminish the ability of more isotropic X-ray emission to heat the
disk itself.
