We analyze the applicability of far-infrared fine-structure lines [CII] 158 micron, [OI] 63 micron
and [OIII] 88 micron to reliably trace the star formation rate (SFR) in a sample of low-metallicity
dwarf galaxies from the Herschel Dwarf Galaxy Survey and compare with a broad sample of galaxies
of various types and metallicities in the literature. We study the trends and scatter in the relation
between the SFR (as traced by GALEX FUV and MIPS 24 micron) and far-infrared line emission, on spatially
resolved and global galaxy scales, in dwarf galaxies. We assemble far-infrared line measurements
from the literature and infer whether the far-infrared lines can probe the SFR (as traced by the total-infrared
luminosity) in a variety of galaxy populations. In metal-poor dwarfs, the [OI] and [OIII] lines
show the strongest correlation with the SFR with an accuracy on the SFR estimates better than a factor
of 2, while the link between [CII] emission and the SFR is more dispersed (factor of 2.5 accuracy).
The scatter in the SFR-L([CII]) relation increases towards low metal abundances, warm dust temperature,
large filling factors of diffuse, highly ionized gas (high values of [OIII]/[CII]+[OI]) and high
[O{\sc{i}}]$_{63}$/[CII]+[OI] line ratios. For the literature sample, we evaluate the correlations
for a number of different galaxy populations. The [CII] and [OI] lines are considered to be reliable
SFR tracers in starburst galaxies, recovering the star formation activity within a precision factor
of 2. [Abridged]
