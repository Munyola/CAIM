We investigate and quantify the observed scatter in the empirical relationship between the broad
line region size R and the luminosity of the active galactic nucleus (AGN), in order to better understand
its origin. This study is motivated by the indispensable role of this relationship in the mass estimation
of cosmologically distant black holes, but may also be relevant to the recently proposed application
of this relationship for measuring cosmic distances. We study six nearby reverberation-mapped
AGN for which simultaneous UV and optical monitoring data exist. We also examine the long-term optical
luminosity variations of Seyfert 1 galaxy NGC 5548 and employ Monte Carlo simulations to study the
effects of the intrinsic variability of individual objects on the scatter in the global relationship
for a sample of ~40 AGN. We find the scatter in this relationship has a correctable dependence on color.
For individual AGN, the size of the Hbeta emitting region has a steeper dependence on the nuclear
optical luminosity than on the UV luminosity, that can introduce a scatter of ~0.08 dex into the global
relationship, due the non-linear relationship between the variations in the ionizing continuum
and those in the optical continuum. Also, our analysis highlights the importance of understanding
and minimizing the scatter in the relationship traced by the intrinsic variability of individual
AGN, since it propagates directly into the global relationship. We find that using the UV luminosity
as a substitute for the ionizing luminosity can reduce a sizable fraction of the current observed
scatter of ~0.13 dex.
