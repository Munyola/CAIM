Planetary nebulae (PNe) are strong H$\alpha$ line-emitters and a lot of new PNe discoveries have
been made by the SuperCOSMOS AAO/UKST H$\alpha$ Survey (SHS) and the Isaac Newton Telescope Photometric
H$\alpha$ Survey (IPHAS). However, the list of auto-generated H$\alpha$-excess candidates from
these surveys as well as any photometric survey, prior to spectroscopic follow-up to confirm their
nature, contains all varieties of H$\alpha$-line emitters like young stellar objects (YSOs),
H II regions, compact PNe and emission line stars of all kinds. The aim of this work is to find new infrared
criteria that can better distinguish compact PNe from their mimics using a machine learning approach
and the photometric data from the Two-Micron All-Sky Survey and Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer.
Three classification tree models have been developed with the following colour criteria: W1-W4$\ge$7.87
and J-H$<$1.10; H-W2$\ge$2.24 and J-H$<$0.50; and Ks-W3$\ge$6.42 and J-H$<$1.31 providing a
list of candidates, characterized by a high probability to be genuine PNe. The contamination of
this list of candidates from Ha mimics is low but not negligible. By applying these criteria to the
IPHAS list of PN candidates and the entire IPHAS and VPHAS+ DR2 catalogues, we find 141 sources, from
which 92 are known PNe, 39 are new very likely compact PNe (without an available classification or
uncertain) and 10 are classified as H II regions, Wolf-Rayet stars, AeBe stars and YSOs. The occurrence
of false positive identifications in this technique is between 10 and 15 per cent.
