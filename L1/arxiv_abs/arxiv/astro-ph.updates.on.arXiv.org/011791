The next generation of solar neutrino detectors will provide a precision measure of the $^8$B electron-neutrino
spectrum in the energy range from 1-15 MeV. Although the neutrino spectrum emitted by $^8$B $\beta$-decay
reactions in the Sun's core is identical to the neutrino spectrum measured in the laboratory, due
to vacuum and matter flavor oscillations, this spectrum will be very different from that measured
on Earth by the different solar neutrino experiments. We study how the presence of dark matter (DM)
in the Sun's core changes the shape of the $^8$B electron-neutrino spectrum. These modifications
are caused by local variations of the electronic density and the $^8$B neutrino source, induced
by local changes of the temperature, density and chemical composition. Particularly relevant
are the shape changes at low and medium energy range $(E_\nu\le 10 {\; \rm MeV})$, for which the experimental
noise level is expected to be quite small. If such a distortion in the $^8$B$\nu_e$ spectrum were
to be observed, this would strongly hint in favor of the existence of DM in the Sun's core. The $^8$B
electron-neutrino spectrum provides a complementary method to helioseismology and total neutrino
fluxes for constraining the DM properties. In particular, we study the impact of light asymmetric
DM on solar neutrino spectra. Accurate neutrino spectra measurements could help to determine whether
light asymmetric DM exists in the Sun's core, since it has been recently advocated that this type
of DM might resolve the solar abundance problem.
