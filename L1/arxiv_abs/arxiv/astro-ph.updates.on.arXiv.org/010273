We use the Fermi-LAT gamma-ray observatory to search for gamma-ray emission from four nearby, debris
disk-hosting main sequence stars: $\tau$ Ceti, $\epsilon$ Eridani, Fomalhaut, and Vega. For three
stars ($\tau$ Ceti, Fomalhaut, and Vega), we establish upper limits that are consistent with theoretical
expectations. For $\epsilon$ Eridani, we find a possible spatially coincident source with a soft
energy spectrum of $dN/dE \sim E^{-3.6}$. However, at this stage we are unable to rule out that this
emission is due to a more extended feature in the diffuse background. In the interpretation that
the emission is due to $\epsilon$ Eridani, the $> 100$ MeV gamma-ray luminosity is $\sim 10^{27}$
erg/s $\simeq 3\times 10^{-7}$ L$_\odot$, which is $\sim 10^{10}$ times the gamma-ray luminosity
from the disk of the quiet Sun. We find $\lesssim 2 \sigma$ evidence of source variability over a $\sim
7$ year timescale. In the interpretation that the gamma-ray emission from $\epsilon$ Eridani itself,
we consider two possible models: 1) cosmic-ray collisions with solid bodies in the debris disk which
extends out $\sim$60 AU from the host star, and 2) emission from the stellar activity. For the former
model, assuming a total disk mass consistent with infrared measurements, we find that the size distribution
of bodies is steeper than expected for a collisional cascade state. If confirmed as being associated
with $\epsilon$ Eridani, this would be the first indication of gamma-ray emission from the vicinity
of a main sequence star other than the Sun.
