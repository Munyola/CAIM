We report observations of an eruptive X2.8 flare on 2013 May 13, which shows two distinct episodes
of energy release in the impulsive phase. The first episode is characterized by the eruption of a
magnetic flux rope, similar to the energy-release process in most standard eruptive flares. While
the second episode, which is stronger than the first normal one and shows enhanced high-energy X-ray
and even $\gamma$-ray emissions, is closely associated with magnetic reconnection of a large-scale
loop in the aftermath of the eruption. The reconnection inflow of the loop leg is observed in the Solar
Dynamics Observatory (SDO)/Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) 304 \r{A} passband and accelerates
towards the reconnection region to a speed as high as $\sim$130 km/s. Simultaneously the corresponding
outflow jets are observed in the AIA hot passbands with a speed of $\sim$740 km/s and mean temperature
of $\sim$14 MK. RHESSI observations show a strong burst of hard X-ray (HXR) and $\gamma$-ray emissions
with hard electron spectra of $\delta\approx3$, exhibiting a soft-hard-harder behavior. A distinct
altitude decrease of the HXR loop-top source coincides with the inward swing of the loop leg observed
in the AIA 304 \r{A} passband, which is suggested to be related to the coronal implosion. This fast
inflow of magnetic flux contained in the loop leg greatly enhances the reconnection rate and results
in very efficient particle acceleration in the second-step reconnection, which also helps to achieve
a second higher temperature peak up to T $\approx$ 30 MK.
