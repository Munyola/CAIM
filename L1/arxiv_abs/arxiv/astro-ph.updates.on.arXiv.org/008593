NGC 3393, a nearby Seyfert 2 galaxy with nuclear radio jets, large-scale and nuclear bars, and a posited
secondary super massive black hole, provides an interesting laboratory to test the physics of inflows
and outflows. Here we present and analyse the molecular gas (ALMA observations of CO J:2-1 emission
over a field of view (FOV) of 45\arcsec \times 45\arcsec, at 0\farcs56 (143 pc) spatial and 5 km/s
spectral resolution), ionised gas and stars (GEMINI-GMOS/IFU; over a FOV of 4\arcsec \times 5\arcsec,
at 0\farcs62 (159 pc) spatial and 23 km/s spectral resolution) in NGC 3393. The ionised gas emission,
detected over the complete GEMINI-GMOS FOV, has three identifiable kinematic components. A narrow
(\sigma < 115 km/s) component present in the complete FOV, which is consistent with rotation in the
galaxy disk. A broad (\sigma > 115 km/s) redshifted component, detected near the NE and SW radio lobes;
which we interpret as a radio jet driven outflow. And a broad (\sigma > 115 km/s) blueshifted component
that shows high velocities in a region perpendicular to the radio jet axis; we interpret this as an
equatorial outflow. The CO J:2-1 emission is detected in spiral arms on 5\arcsec - 20\arcsec scales,
and in two disturbed circumnuclear regions. The molecular kinematics in the spiral arms can be explained
by rotation. The highly disturbed kinematics of the inner region can be explained by perturbations
induced by the nuclear bar and interactions with the large scale bar. We find no evidence for, but
cannot strongly rule out, the presence of the posited secondary black hole.
