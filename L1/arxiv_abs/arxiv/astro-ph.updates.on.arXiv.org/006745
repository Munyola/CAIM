In the local Universe, there is a strong division in the star-forming properties of low-mass galaxies,
with star formation largely ubiquitous amongst the field population while satellite systems are
predominantly quenched. This dichotomy implies that environmental processes play the dominant
role in suppressing star formation within this low-mass regime (${M}_{\star} \sim 10^{5.5-8}~{\rm
M}_{\odot}$). As shown by observations of the Local Volume, however, there is a non-negligible
population of passive systems in the field, which challenges our understanding of quenching at
low masses. By applying the satellite quenching models of Fillingham et al. (2015) to subhalo populations
in the Exploring the Local Volume In Simulations (ELVIS) suite, we investigate the role of environmental
processes in quenching star formation within the nearby field. Using model parameters that reproduce
the satellite quenched fraction in the Local Group, we predict a quenched fraction -- due solely
to environmental effects -- of $\sim 0.52 \pm 0.26$ within $1< R/R_{\rm vir} < 2$ of the Milky Way and
M31. This is in good agreement with current observations of the Local Volume and suggests that the
majority of the passive field systems observed at these distances are quenched via environmental
mechanisms. Beyond $2~R_{\rm vir}$, however, dwarf galaxy quenching becomes difficult to explain
through an interaction with either the Milky Way or M31, such that more isolated, field dwarfs may
be self-quenched as a result of star-formation feedback.
