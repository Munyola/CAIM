Binary stars that are on close orbits around massive black holes (MBH) such as Sgr A* in the center
of the Milky Way are liable to undergo tidal disruption and eject a hypervelocity star. We study the
interaction between such a MBH and circular binaries for general binary orientations and penetration
depths (i.e. binaries penetrate into the tidal radius around the BH). We show that for very deep penetrators,
all binaries are disrupted when the binary rotation axis is roughly oriented toward the BH or it is
in the opposite direction. The surviving chance becomes significant when the angle between the
binary rotation axis and the BH direction is between \pi /4 and 3 \pi /4. The surviving chance is as
high as $\sim$ 20$\%$ when the binary rotation axis is perpendicular to the BH direction. The angular
dependence is opposite for very shallow penetrators where coplanar prograde orbits have the lowest
surviving chance (or equivalently most vulnerable). We provide numerical fits to the disruption
probability and energy gain at the the BH encounter as a function of the penetration depth. The latter
can be simply rescaled in terms of binary masses, their initial separation and the binary-to-BH
mass ratio to evaluate the ejection velocity of a binary members in various systems. We also investigate
the disruption of coplanar, eccentric binaries by a MBH. It is shown that for highly eccentric binaries
retrograde orbits have a significantly increased disruption probability and ejection velocities
compared to the circular binaries.
