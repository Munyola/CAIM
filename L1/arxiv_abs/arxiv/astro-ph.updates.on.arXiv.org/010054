We consider electromagnetic interaction and precursor emission of merging neutron stars. Orbital
motion of the magnetized neutron stars may revive pair production within the common magnetosphere
years before the merger, igniting pulsar-like magnetospheric dynamics. We identify two basic
scenarios: (i) only one star is magnetized (1M-DNS scenario) and (ii) both stars are magnetized
(2M-DNS scenario). Inductively created electric fields can have component along the total magnetic
field (gaps) and/or the electric field may exceed the value of the local magnetic field. The key to
the detection is orbital modulation of the emission. If only one star is magnetized (1M-DNS scenario)
the emission is likely to be produced along the direction of the magnetic field at the location of
the secondary; then, if the magnetic axis is misaligned with the orbital spin, this direction is
modulated on the orbital period. For the 2M-DNS scenario, the structure of the common magnetosphere
of the non-rotating neutron stars is complicated, with gaps, but no $E>B$ regions; there is strong
orbital variations for the case of misaligned magnetic moments. For the same parameters of neutron
stars the 2M-DNS scenario has intrinsically higher potential than the 1M-DNS one. The overall powers
are not very high, $\leq 10^{45} $ erg s$^{-1}$; the best chance to detect electromagnetic precursors
to the merging neutron stars is if the interaction of their magnetospheres leads to the production
of pulsar-like coherent radio emission modulated at the orbital period, with luminosity of up to
$\sim 1$ Jankys at the time the merger.
