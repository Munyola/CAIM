Neutron star interiors provide the opportunity to probe properties of cold dense matter in the QCD
phase diagram. Utilizing models of dense matter in accord with nuclear systematics at nuclear densities,
we investigate the compatibility of deconfined quark cores with current observational constraints
on the maximum mass and tidal deformability of neutron stars. We explore various methods of implementing
the hadron-to-quark phase transition, specifically, first-order transitions with sharp (Maxwell
construction) and soft (Gibbs construction) interfaces, and smooth crossover transitions. We
find that within the models we apply, hadronic matter has to be stiff for a first-order phase transition
and soft for a crossover transition. In both scenarios and for the equations of state we employed,
quarks appear at the center of pre-merger neutron stars in the mass range $\approx 1.0-1.6\,{\rm
M}_{\odot}$, with a squared speed of sound $c^2_{\rm QM}\gtrsim 0.4$ characteristic of strong
repulsive interactions required to support the recently discovered neutron star masses $\geq
2\,{\rm M}_{\odot}$. We also identify equations of state and phase transition scenarios that are
consistent with the bounds placed on tidal deformations of neutron stars in the recent binary merger
event GW170817. We emphasize that distinguishing hybrid stars with quark cores from normal hadronic
stars is very difficult from the knowledge of masses and radii alone, unless drastic sharp transitions
induce distinctive disconnected hybrid branches in the mass-radius relation.
