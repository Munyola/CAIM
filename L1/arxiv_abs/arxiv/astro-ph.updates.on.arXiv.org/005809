We present two hydrogen-rich superluminous supernovae (SLSNe), namely SN2013hx and PS15br. These
objects, together with SN2008es are the only SLSNe showing a distinct, broad Halpha feature during
the photospheric phase and also do not show any sign of strong interaction between fast-moving ejecta
and circumstellar shells in their early spectra. Despite PS15br peak luminosity is fainter than
the other two objects, the spectrophotometric evolution is similar to SN2013hx and different than
any other supernova in a similar luminosity space. We group all of them as SLSNe II and hence distinct
from the known class of SLSN IIn. Both transients show a strong, multi-component Halpha emission
after 200 days past maximum which we interpret as an indication of interaction of the ejecta with
an asymmetric, clumpy circumstellar material. The spectra and photometric evolution of the two
objects are similar to type II supernovae, although they have much higher luminosity and evolve
on slower timescales. This is qualitatively similar to how SLSNe I compare with normal type Ic in
that the former are brighter and evolve more slowly. We apply a magnetar and an interaction semi-analytical
codes to fit the light curves of our two objects and SN2008es. The overall observational dataset
would tend to favour the magnetar, or central engine, model as the source of the peak luminosity although
the clear signature of late-time interaction indicates that interaction can play a role in the luminosity
evolution of SLSNe II at some phases.
