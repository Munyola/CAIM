The INTEGRAL/SPI, X-gamma-ray spectrometer (20 keV - 8 MeV) is an instrument for which recovering
source intensity variations is not straightforward and can constitute a difficulty for data analysis.
In most cases, determining the source intensity changes between exposures is largely based on a
priori information. We propose techniques that help to overcome the difficulty related to source
intensity variations, which make this step more rational. In addition, the constructed "synthetic"
light curves should permit us to obtain a sky model that describes the data better and optimizes the
source signal-to-noise ratios. For this purpose, the time intensity variation of each source was
modeled as a combination of piecewise segments of time during which a given source exhibits a constant
intensity. To optimize the signal-to-noise ratios, the number of segments was minimized. We present
a first method that takes advantage of previous time series that can be obtained from another instrument
on-board the INTEGRAL observatory. A data segmentation algorithm was then used to synthesize the
time series into segments. The second method no longer needs external light curves, but solely SPI
raw data. For this, we developed a specific algorithm that involves the SPI transfer function. The
time segmentation algorithms that were developed solve a difficulty inherent to the SPI instrument,
which is the intensity variations of sources between exposures, and it allows us to obtain more information
about the sources' behavior.
