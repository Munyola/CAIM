One of the greatest challenges to theoretical models of massive galaxy formation is the regulation
of star formation at early times. The relative roles of molecular gas expulsion, depletion, and
stabilization are uncertain as direct observational constraints of the gas reservoirs in quenched
or quenching galaxies at high redshift are scant. We present ALMA observations of CO(2-1) in a massive
($\log M_{\star}/M_{\odot}=11.2$), recently quenched galaxy at $z=1.522$. The optical spectrum
of this object shows strong Balmer absorption lines, which implies that star formation ceased $\sim$0.8
Gyr ago. We do not detect CO(2-1) line emission, placing an upper limit on the molecular $\mathrm{H_2}$
gas mass of 1.1$\times10^{10}\,M_{\odot}$. The implied gas fraction is $f_{\rm{H_2}}{\equiv
M_{H_2}/M_{\star}}<7\%$, $\sim10\times$ lower than typical star forming galaxies at similar
stellar masses at this redshift, among the lowest gas fractions at this specific star formation
rate at any epoch, and the most stringent constraint on the gas contents of a $z>1$ passive galaxy
to date. Our observations show that the depletion of $\mathrm{H_2}$ from the interstellar medium
of quenched objects can be both efficient and fairly complete, in contrast to recent claims of significant
cold gas in recently quenched galaxies. We explore the variation in observed gas fractions in high-$z$
galaxies and show that galaxies with high stellar surface density have low $f_{\rm{H_2}}$, similar
to recent correlations between specific star formation rate and stellar surface density.
