Disks in binary systems can cause exotic eclipsing events. MWC 882 (BD-22 4376, EPIC 225300403)
is such a disk-eclipsing system identified from observations during Campaign 11 of the K2 mission.
We propose that MWC 882 is a post-Algol system with a B7 donor star of mass $0.542\pm0.053\,M_\odot$
in a 72 day period orbit around an A0 accreting star of mass $3.24\pm0.29\,M_\odot$. The $59.9\pm6.2\,R_\odot$
disk around the accreting star occults the donor star once every orbit, inducing 19 day long, 7% deep
eclipses identified by K2, and subsequently found in pre-discovery ASAS and ASAS-SN observations.
We coordinated a campaign of photometric and spectroscopic observations for MWC 882 to measure
the dynamical masses of the components and to monitor the system during eclipse. We found the photometric
eclipse to be gray to $\approx 1$%. We found the primary star exhibits spectroscopic signatures
of active accretion, and observed gas absorption features from the disk during eclipse. We suggest
MWC 882 initially consisted of a $\approx 3.6\,M_\odot$ donor star transferring mass via Roche
lobe overflow to a $\approx 2.1\,M_\odot$ accretor in a $\approx 7$ day initial orbit. Through angular
momentum conservation, the donor star is pushed outward during mass transfer to its current orbit
of 72 days. The observed state of the system corresponds with the donor star having left the Red Giant
Branch ~0.3 Myr ago, terminating active mass transfer. The present disk is expected to be short-lived
($10^2$ years) without an active feeding mechanism, presenting a challenge to this model.
