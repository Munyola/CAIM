In order to best improve constraints on cosmological parameters and on models of modified gravity
using current and future galaxy surveys it is necessary maximally exploit the available data. As
redshift-space distortions mean statistical translation invariance is broken for galaxy observations,
this will require measurement of the monopole, quadrupole and hexadecapole of not just the galaxy
power spectrum, but also the galaxy bispectrum. A recent (2015) paper by Scoccimarro demonstrated
how the standard bispectrum estimator may be expressed in terms of Fast Fourier Transforms (FFTs)
to afford an extremely efficient algorithm, allowing the bispectrum multipoles on all scales and
triangle shapes to be measured in comparable time to those of the power spectrum. In this paper we
present a suite of alternative proxies to measure the three-point correlation multipoles. In particular,
we describe a modal (or plane wave) decomposition to capture the information in each multipole in
a series of basis coefficients, and also describe three compressed estimators formed using the
skew-spectrum, the line correlation function and the integrated bispectrum, respectively. As
well as each of the estimators offering a different measurement channel, and thereby a robustness
check, it is expected that some (especially the modal estimator) will offer a vast data compression,
and so a much reduced covariance matrix. This compression may be vital to reduce the computational
load involved in extracting the available three-point information.
