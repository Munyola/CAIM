In symmetric gravitating systems experiencing rapid mass loss, particle orbits change almost
instantaneously, which can lead to the development of a sharply contoured density profile, including
singular caustics for collisionless systems. This framework can be used to model a variety of dynamical
systems, such as accretion disks following a massive black hole merger and dwarf galaxies following
violent early star formation feedback. Particle interactions in the high-density peaks seem a
promising source of observable signatures of these mass loss events (i.e. a possible EM counterpart
for black hole mergers or strong gamma-ray emission from dark matter annihilation around young
galaxies), because the interaction rate depends on the square of the density. We study post-mass-loss
density profiles, both analytic and numerical, in idealised cases and present arguments and methods
to extend to any general system. An analytic derivation is presented for particles on Keplerian
orbits responding to a drop in the central mass. We argue that this case, with initially circular
orbits, gives the most sharply contoured profile possible. We find that despite the presence of
a set of singular caustics, the total particle interaction rate is reduced compared to the unperturbed
system; this is a result of the overall expansion of the system dominating over the steep caustics.
Finally we argue that this result holds more generally, and the loss of central mass decreases the
particle interaction rate in any physical system.
