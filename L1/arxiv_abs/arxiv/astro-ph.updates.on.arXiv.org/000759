We present a new study of H{\alpha}/FUV flux ratios of star forming regions within a sample of nearby
spiral galaxies. We search for evidence of the existence of a cluster mass dependent truncation
in the underlying stellar initial mass function (IMF). We use an automated approach to identification
of extended objects based on the SExtractor algorithm to catalogue resolved Hii regions within
a set of nearby spiral galaxies. Corrections due to dust attenuation effects are applied to avoid
artificially boosted H{\alpha}/FUV values. We use the BPASS stellar population synthesis code
of Eldridge & Stanway (2009) to create a benchmark population of star forming regions to act
as a reference for our observations. Based on those models, we identify a zone of parameter space
populated by regions that cannot be obtained with a cluster mass dependent truncation in the stellar
IMF imposed. We find that the investigated galaxies display small subpopulations of star forming
regions falling within our zone of interest, which appears to be inconsistent with imposing an IMF
truncation at maximum stellar mass dependent on the total cluster mass. The presence of those regions
is expected in models using both stochastic and sorted sampling of the full extent of the stellar
IMF. This result persists after taking dust attenuation effects into account. We highlight the
significance of stochastic effects in environments with low star formation activity and in studies
describing systems associated with small physical scales.
