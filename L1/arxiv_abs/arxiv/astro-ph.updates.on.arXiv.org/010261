Order of magnitude variability has been observed in the blazar sub-class of Active Galactic Nuclei
on minute timescales. Such fast high energy flares are often difficult to explain with conventional
shock acceleration models due to the small size of the emitting region inferred by the light crossing
time. Recent particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations have shown that magnetic reconnection may offer
a viable explanation. In this paper, we present a macroscopic emission model physically motivated
by PIC simulations, where the energy for particle acceleration originates from the reconnecting
magnetic field. We track the radial growth and relative velocity of a reconnecting plasmoid, modelling
particle acceleration and radiative losses, which occur via synchrotron and synchrotron self-Compton
(SSC) emission. We assume the reconnection layer consists of merging plasmoids, which grow as they
merge. We use our model to successfully fit to the 2016 TeV flare of BL Lacertae, demonstrating that
reconnection is able to produce TeV flares on the observed timescales. We find that the flaring light
curve depends on the merge timescale and the magnetisation of the emitting plasma. However, the
SEDs produced by our model are all synchrotron-dominated, and observable reconnection plasmoids
have radii comparable to the jet radius. We conclude that while reconnection powered SSC flares
can produce flares on the correct timescale, the primary source of emission cannot be SSC and the
size of plasmoids required may be implausibly large.
