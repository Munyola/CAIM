According to the standard cold dark matter (CDM) cosmology, the structure of dark halos including
those of galaxy clusters reflects their mass accretion history. Older clusters tend to be more concentrated
than younger clusters. Their structure, represented by the characteristic radius $r_s$ and mass
$M_s$ of the Navarro--Frenk--White (NFW) density profile, is related to their formation time.
In~this study, we showed that $r_s$, $M_s$, and the X-ray temperature of the intracluster medium
(ICM), $T_X$, form a thin plane in the space of $(\log r_s, \log M_s, \log T_X)$. This tight correlation
indicates that the ICM temperature is also determined by the formation time of individual clusters.
Numerical simulations showed that clusters move along the fundamental plane as they evolve. The
plane and the cluster evolution within the plane could be explained by a similarity solution of structure
formation of the universe. The angle of the plane shows that clusters have not achieved "virial equilibrium"
in the sense that mass/size growth and pressure at the boundaries cannot be ignored. The distribution
of clusters on the plane was related to the intrinsic scatter in the halo concentration--mass relation,
which originated from the variety of cluster ages. The well-known mass--temperature relation
of clusters ($M_\Delta\propto T_X^{3/2}$) can be explained by the fundamental plane and the mass
dependence of the halo concentration without the assumption of virial equilibrium. The fundamental
plane could also be used for calibration of cluster masses.
