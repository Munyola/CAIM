Measurements of [Fe/H] and [$\alpha$/Fe] can probe the minor merging history of a galaxy, providing
a direct way to test the hierarchical assembly paradigm. While measurements of [$\alpha$/Fe] have
been made in the stellar halo of the Milky Way, little is known about detailed chemical abundances
in the stellar halo of M31. To make progress with existing telescopes, we apply spectral synthesis
to low-resolution DEIMOS spectroscopy (R $\sim$ 2500 at 7000 Angstroms) across a wide spectral
range (4500 Angstroms $<$ $\lambda$ $<$ 9100 Angstroms). By applying our technique to low-resolution
spectra of 170 giant stars in 5 MW globular clusters, we demonstrate that our technique reproduces
previous measurements from higher resolution spectroscopy. Based on the intrinsic dispersion
in [Fe/H] and [$\alpha$/Fe] of individual stars in our combined cluster sample, we estimate systematic
uncertainties of $\sim$0.11 dex and $\sim$0.09 dex in [Fe/H] and [$\alpha$/Fe], respectively.
We apply our method to deep, low-resolution spectra of 11 red giant branch stars in the smooth halo
of M31, resulting in higher signal-to-noise per spectral resolution element compared to DEIMOS
medium-resolution spectroscopy, given the same exposure time and conditions. We find $\langle$[$\alpha$/Fe]$\rangle$
= 0.49 $\pm$ 0.29 dex and $\langle$[Fe/H]$\rangle$ = 1.59 $\pm$ 0.56 dex for our sample. This implies
that---much like the Milky Way---the smooth halo of M31 is likely composed of disrupted dwarf galaxies
with truncated star formation histories that were accreted early in the halo's formation.
