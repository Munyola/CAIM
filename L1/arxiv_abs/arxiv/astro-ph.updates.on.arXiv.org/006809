Proxima Centauri has become the subject of intense study since the radial-velocity discovery by
Anglada-Escud\'e et al. 2016 of a planet orbiting this nearby M-dwarf every ~ 11.2 days. If Proxima
Centauri b transits its host star, independent confirmation of its existence is possible, and its
mass and radius can be measured in units of the stellar host mass and radius. To date, there have been
three independent claims of possible transit-like event detections in light curve observations
obtained by the MOST satellite (in 2014-15), the BSST telescope in Antarctica (in 2016), and the
Las Campanas Observatory (in 2016). The claimed possible detections are tentative, due in part
to the variability intrinsic to the host star, and in the case of the ground-based observations,
also due to the limited duration of the light curve observations. Here, we present preliminary results
from an extensive photometric monitoring campaign of Proxima Centauri, using telescopes around
the globe and spanning from 2006 to 2017, comprising a total of 329 observations. Considering our
data that coincide directly and/or phased with the previously published tentative transit detections,
we are unable to independently verify those claims. We do, however, verify the previously reported
ubiquitous and complex variability of the host star. We discuss possible interpretations of the
data in light of the previous claims, and we discuss future analyses of these data that could more
definitively verify or refute the presence of transits associated with the radial-velocity discovered
planet.
