The 511 keV line from positron annihilation in the Galaxy was the first $\gamma$-ray line detected
to originate from outside our solar system. Going into the fifth decade since the discovery, the
source of positrons is still unconfirmed and remains one of the enduring mysteries in $\gamma$-ray
astronomy. With a large flux of $\sim$10$^{-3}$ $\gamma$/cm$^{2}$/s, after 15 years in operation
INTEGRAL/SPI has detected the 511 keV line at $>50\sigma$ and has performed high-resolution spectral
studies which conclude that Galactic positrons predominantly annihilate at low energies in warm
phases of the interstellar medium. The results from imaging are less certain, but show a spatial
distribution with a strong concentration in the center of the Galaxy. The observed emission from
the Galactic disk has low surface brightness and the scale height is poorly constrained, therefore,
the shear number of annihilating positrons in our Galaxy is still not well know. Positrons produced
in $\beta^+$-decay of nucleosynthesis products, such as $^{26}$Al, can account for some of the
annihilation emission in the disk, but the observed spatial distribution, in particular the excess
in the Galactic bulge, remains difficult to explain. Additionally, one of the largest uncertainties
in these studies is the unknown distance that positrons propagate before annihilation. In this
paper, we will summarize the current knowledge base of Galactic positrons, and discuss how next-generation
instruments could finally provide the answers.
