Stars passing too close to a super massive black hole (SMBH) can produce tidal disruption events
(TDEs). Since the resulting stellar debris can produce an electromagnetic flare, TDEs are believed
to probe the presence of single SMBHs in galactic nuclei, which otherwise remain dark. In this paper,
we show how stars orbiting an IMBH secondary are perturbed by an SMBH primary. We find that the evolution
of the stellar orbits are severely affected by the primary SMBH due to secular effects and stars orbiting
with high inclinations with respect to the SMBH-IMBH orbital plane end their lives as TDEs due to
Kozai-Lidov oscillations, hence illuminating the secondary SMBH/IMBH. Above a critical SMBH
mass of $\approx 1.15 \times 10^8$ M$_{\odot}$, no TDE can occur for typical stars in an old stellar
population since the Schwarzschild radius exceeds the tidal disruption radius. Consequently,
any TDEs due to such massive SMBHs will remain dark. It follows that no TDEs should be observed in galaxies
more massive than $\approx 4.15\times 10^{10}$ M$_{\odot}$, unless a lower-mass secondary SMBH
or IMBH is also present. The secular mechanism for producing TDEs considered here therefore offers
a useful probe of SMBH-SMBH/IMBH binarity in the most massive galaxies. We further show that the
TDE rate can be $\approx 10^{-4}-10^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$, and that most TDEs occur on $\approx 0.5$ Myr.
Finally, we show that stars may be ejected with velocities up to thousands of km s$^{-1}$, which could
contribute to the observed population of Galactic hypervelocity stars.
