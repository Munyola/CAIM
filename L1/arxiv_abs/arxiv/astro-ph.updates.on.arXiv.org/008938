We present observations at 1.1 mm towards 16 powerful radio galaxies and a radio-quiet quasar at
0.5<z<6.3 acquired with the AzTEC camera mounted at the JCMT and ASTE to study the spatial distribution
of submillimeter galaxies towards possible protocluster regions. The survey covers a total area
of 1.01 square degrees with rms depths of 0.52 - 1.44 mJy and detects 728 sources above 3sigma. We find
overdensities of a factor of ~2 in the source counts of 3 individual fields (4C+23.56, PKS1138-262
and MRC0355-037) over areas of ~200 sq deg. When combining all fields, the source-count analysis
finds an overdensity that reaches a factor $\gtrsim 3$ at S$_{\rm{1.1mm}} \ge 4$ mJy covering a 1.5-arcmin-radius
area centred on the AGN. The large size of our maps allows us to establish that beyond a radius of 1.5
arcmin, the radial surface density of SMGs falls to that of a blank field. In addition, we find a trend
for SMGs to align closely to a perpendicular direction with respect to the radio jets of the powerful
central radio galaxies (73$_{+13}^{-14}$ degrees). This misalignment is found over projected
co-moving scales of 4-20 Mpc, departs from perfect alignment (0 deg) by ~5sigma, and apparently
has no dependence on SMG luminosity. Under the assumption that the AzTEC sources are at the redshift
of the central radio galaxy, the misalignment reported here can be interpreted as SMGs preferentially
inhabiting mass-dominant filaments funneling material towards the protoclusters, which are
also the parent structures of the radio galaxies.
