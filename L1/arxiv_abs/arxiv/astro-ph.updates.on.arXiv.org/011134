We calculate cosmic distributions in space and time of the formation sites of the first, "Pop III.1"
stars, exploring a model in which these are the progenitors of all supermassive black holes (SMBHs),
seen in the centers of most large galaxies. Pop III.1 stars are defined to form from primordial composition
gas in dark matter minihalos with $\sim10^6\:M_\odot$ that are isolated from neighboring astrophysical
sources by a given isolation distance, $d_{\rm{iso}}$. We assume Pop III.1 sources are seeds of
SMBHs, based on protostellar support by dark matter annihilation heating that allows them to accrete
a large fraction of their minihalo gas, i.e., $\sim10^5\:M_\odot$. Exploring $d_{\rm{iso}}$
from $10 - 100\:\rm{kpc}$ (proper distances), we predict the redshift evolution of Pop III.1 source
and SMBH remnant number densities. The local, $z=0$ density of SMBHs constrains $d_{\rm{iso}}\lesssim
100\:\rm{kpc}$ (i.e., $3\:\rm{Mpc}$ comoving distance at $z\simeq30$). In our simulated ($\sim60\:\rm{Mpc}$)$^3$
comoving volume, Pop III.1 stars start forming just after $z=40$. Their formation is largely complete
by $z\simeq25$ to $20$ for $d_{\rm{iso}}=100$ to $50\:\rm{kpc}$. We follow source evolution to
$z=10$, by which point most SMBHs reside in halos with $\gtrsim10^8\:M_\odot$. Over this period,
there is relatively limited merging of SMBHs for these values of $d_{\rm{iso}}$. We also predict
SMBH clustering properties at $z=10$: feedback suppression of neighboring sources leads to relatively
flat angular correlation functions.
