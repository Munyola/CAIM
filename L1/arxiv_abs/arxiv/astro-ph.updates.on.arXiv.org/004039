The growth of black holes (BHs) in disk galaxies lacking classical bulges, which implies an absence
of significant mergers, appears to be driven by secular processes. Short bars of sub-kiloparsec
radius have been hypothesized to be an important mechanism for driving gas inflows to small scale,
feeding central BHs. In order to quantify the maximum BH mass allowed by this mechanism, we examine
the robustness of short bars to the dynamical influence of BHs. Large-scale bars are expected to
be robust, long-lived structures; extremely massive BHs, which are rare, are needed to completely
destroy such bars. However, we find that short bars, which are generally embedded in large-scale
outer bars, can be destroyed quickly when BHs of mass $M_{\rm bh}\sim0.05-0.2\%$ of the total stellar
mass ($M_\star$) are present. In agreement with this prediction, all galaxies observed to host
short bars have BHs with a mass fraction less than $0.2\%M_\star$. Thus the dissolution of short
inner bars is possible, perhaps even frequent, in the universe. An important implication of this
result is that inner bar-driven gas inflows may be terminated when BHs grow to $\sim0.1\%M_\star$.
We predict that $0.2\%M_\star$ is the maximum mass of BHs allowed if they are fed predominately via
inner bars. This value matches well the maximum ratio of BH-to-host galaxy stellar mass observed
in galaxies with pseudo-bulges and most nearby AGN host galaxies. This hypothesis provides a novel
explanation for the lower $M_{\rm bh}/M_\star$ in galaxies which have avoided significant mergers
compared with galaxies with classical bulges.
