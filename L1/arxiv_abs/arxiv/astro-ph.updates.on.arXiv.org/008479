Six gravitational wave events have been reported by the LIGO-Virgo collaboration (LVC), five of
them associated with black hole binary (BHB) mergers and one with a double neutron star (DNS) merger,
while the coalescence of a black hole-neutron star (BHNS) binary is still missing. We investigate
the progenitors of double compact object binaries with our population-synthesis code MOBSE. MOBSE
includes advanced prescriptions for mass loss by stellar winds (depending on metallicity and on
the Eddington ratio) and a formalism for core-collapse, electron-capture and (pulsational) pair
instability supernovae. We investigate the impact of progenitor's metallicity, of the common-envelope
parameter $\alpha{}$ and of the natal kicks on the properties of DNSs, BHNSs and BHBs. We find that
neutron-star (NS) masses in DNSs span from 1.1 to 2.0 M$_\odot$, with a preference for light NSs,
while NSs in merging BHNSs have mostly large masses ($1.3-2.0$ M$_\odot$). BHs in merging BHNSs
are preferentially low mass ($5-15$ M$_\odot$). BH masses in merging BHBs strongly depend on the
progenitor's metallicity and span from $\sim{}5$ to $\sim{}45$ M$_\odot$. The local merger rate
density of both BHNSs and BHBs derived from our simulations is consistent with the values reported
by the LVC in all our simulations. In contrast, the local merger rate density of DNSs matches the value
inferred from the LVC only if low natal kicks are assumed. This result adds another piece to the intricate
puzzle of natal kicks and DNS formation.
