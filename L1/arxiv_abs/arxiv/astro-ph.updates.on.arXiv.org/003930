Massive galaxies display extended light profiles that can reach several hundreds of kilo parsecs.
These stellar halos provide a fossil record of galaxy assembly histories. Using data that is both
wide (~100 square degree) and deep (i>28.5 mag/arcsec^2 in i-band), we present a systematic study
of the stellar halos of a sample of more than 3000 galaxies at 0.3 < z < 0.5 with $\log M_{\star}/M_{\odot}
> 11.4$. Our study is based on high-quality (0.6 arcsec seeing) imaging data from the Hyper Suprime-Cam
(HSC) Subaru Strategic Program (SSP), which enables us to individually estimate surface mass density
profiles to 100 kpc without stacking. As in previous work, we find that more massive galaxies exhibit
more extended outer profiles. When this extended light is not properly accounted for as a result
of shallow imaging or inadequate profile modeling, the derived stellar mass function can be significantly
underestimated at the highest masses. Across our sample, the ellipticity of outer light profiles
increases substantially as we probe larger radii. We show for the first time that these ellipticity
gradients steepen dramatically as a function of galaxy mass, but we detect no mass-dependence in
outer color gradients. Our results support the two-phase formation scenario for massive galaxies
in which outer envelopes are built up at late times from a series of merging events. We provide surface
mass surface mass density profiles in a convenient tabulated format to facilitate comparisons
with predictions from numerical simulations of galaxy formation.
