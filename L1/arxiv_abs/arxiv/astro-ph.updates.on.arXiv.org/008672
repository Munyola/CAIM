Outbursts from active galactic nuclei (AGN) can inflate cavities in the intracluster medium (ICM)
of galaxy clusters and are believed to play the primary role in offsetting radiative cooling in the
ICM. However, the details of how the energy from AGN feedback thermalizes to heat the ICM is not well
understood, partly due to the unknown composition and energetics of the cavities. The Sunyaev-Zel'dovich
(SZ) effect, a measure of the integrated pressure along the line of sight, provides a direct means
of measuring the thermal contents of the cavities. Whether cavities are supported by thermal plasma,
as opposed to non-thermal plasma or magnetic fields, can be determined on the basis of the magnitude
of their SZ signal. Here we report measurements of the SZ effect at 30 GHz towards the galaxy cluster
MS 0735.6+7421 (MS0735), using the Combined Array for Millimeter-wave Astronomy (CARMA). MS0735
hosts the most energetic AGN outburst known and lobes of radio synchrotron emission coincident
with a pair of giant X-ray cavities $\sim 200$ kpc across. Our CARMA maps show a clear deficit in the
SZ signal coincident with the X-ray identified cavities, when compared to a smooth X-ray derived
pressure model. We find that the cavities have very little SZ-contributing material, suggesting
that they are either supported by very diffuse thermal plasma with temperature in excess of hundreds
of keV, or are not supported thermally. Our results represent the first detection (with $4.4 \sigma$
significance) of this phenomenon with the SZ effect.
