We present the gauge-invariant formalism of cosmological weak lensing, accounting for all the
relativistic effects due to the scalar, vector, and tensor perturbations at the linear order. While
the light propagation is fully described by the geodesic equation, the relation of the photon wavevector
to the physical quantities requires the specification of the frames, where they are defined. By
constructing the local tetrad bases at the observer and the source positions, we clarify the relation
of the weak lensing observables such as the convergence, the shear, and the rotation to the physical
size and shape defined in the source rest-frame and the observed angle and redshift measured in the
observer rest-frame. Compared to the standard lensing formalism, additional relativistic effects
contribute to all the lensing observables. We explicitly verify the gauge-invariance of the lensing
observables and compare our results to previous work. In particular, we demonstrate that even in
the presence of the vector and tensor perturbations, the physical rotation of the lensing observables
vanishes at the linear order, while the tetrad basis rotates along the light propagation compared
to a FRW coordinate. Though the latter is often used as a probe of primordial gravitational waves,
the rotation of the tetrad basis is indeed not a physical observable. We further clarify its relation
to the E-B decomposition in weak lensing. Our formalism provides a transparent and comprehensive
perspective of cosmological weak lensing.
