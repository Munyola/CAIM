In recent years, ultrafaint dwarf (UFD) galaxies have been found through systematic searches of
large optical surveys. However, the existence of Leo T, a nearby gas-rich dwarf, suggests that there
could be other nearby UFDs that are optically obscured but have gas detectable at nonoptical wavelengths.
With this in mind, we perform a search of the full Galactic Arecibo $L-$band Feed Array HI (GALFA-HI)
survey, a radio survey which covers one-third of the sky at velocities $-650 < V_{\rm{LSR}} < +650
\; \rm{km} \; \rm{s^{-1}}$, for neutral hydrogen sources. We are able to probe regions of the sky
at lower Galactic latitudes and smaller $|V_{LSR}|$ compared to previous explorations. We use
the Source Finding Application (SoFiA) on GALFA-HI and select all sources with similar properties
to Leo T and other local dwarf galaxies. We find 690 dwarf galaxy candidates, one of which is particularly
promising and likely a new galaxy near the Galactic plane ($b=-8^{\circ}$) that is comparable in
velocity width and HI-flux to other recently discovered local volume galaxies. We find we are sensitive
to Leo T-like objects out to $1 \; \rm{Mpc}$ at velocities clear from background HI emission. We check
each candidate's corresponding optical fields from Pan-STARRS and fit stars drawn from isochrones,
but find no evidence of stellar populations. We thus find no other Leo T-like dwarfs within $500 \;
\rm{kpc}$ of the Milky Way in the one-third of the sky covered by the GALFA-HI footprint and discuss
our nondetection in a cosmological context.
