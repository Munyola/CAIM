The quantity and quality of cosmic structure observations have greatly accelerated in recent years.
Further leaps forward will be facilitated by imminent projects, which will enable us to map the evolution
of dark and baryonic matter density fluctuations over cosmic history. The way that these fluctuations
vary over space and time is sensitive to the nature of dark matter and dark energy. Dark energy and
gravity both affect how rapidly structure grows; the greater the acceleration, the more suppressed
the growth of structure, while the greater the gravity, the more enhanced the growth. While distance
measurements also constrain dark energy, the comparison of growth and distance data tests whether
General Relativity describes the laws of physics accurately on large scales. Modified gravity
models are able to reproduce the distance measurements but at the cost of altering the growth of structure
(these signatures are described in more detail in the accompanying paper on Novel Probes of Gravity
and Dark Energy). Upcoming surveys will exploit these differences to determine whether the acceleration
of the Universe is due to dark energy or to modified gravity. To realize this potential, both wide
field imaging and spectroscopic redshift surveys play crucial roles. Projects including DES,
eBOSS, DESI, PFS, LSST, Euclid, and WFIRST are in line to map more than a 1000 cubic-billion-light-year
volume of the Universe. These will map the cosmic structure growth rate to 1% in the redshift range
0<z<2, over the last 3/4 of the age of the Universe.
