Solar flares are often associated with coronal eruptions, but there are confined ones without eruption,
even for some X-class flares. How such large flares occurred and why they are confined are still not
well understood. Here we studied a confined X2.2 flare in NOAA 12673 on 2017 September 6. It exhibits
two episodes of flare brightening with rather complex, atypical ribbons. Based on topology analysis
of extrapolated coronal magnetic field, we revealed that there is a two-step magnetic reconnection
process during the flare. Prior to the flare, there is a magnetic flux rope (MFR) with one leg rooted
in a rotating sunspot. Neighboring to the leg is a magnetic null-point structure. The sunspot drives
the MFR to expand, pushing magnetic flux to the null point, and reconnection is first triggered there.
The disturbance from the null-point reconnection triggers the second reconnection, i.e., a tether-cutting
reconnection below the rope. However, these two reconnections failed to produce an eruption, because
the rope is firmly held by its strapping flux. Furthermore, we compared this flare with an eruptive
X9.3 flare in the same region with 2 hours later, which has a similar MFR configuration. The key difference
between them is that, for the confined flare, the MFR is fully below the threshold of torus instability,
while for the eruptive one, the MFR reaches entirely above the threshold. This study provides a good
evidence supporting that reconnection alone may not be able to trigger eruption, rather, MHD instability
plays a more important role.
