The G2 object has recently passed its pericenter passage in our Galactic Center. While the $Br_\gamma$
emission shows clear signs of tidal interaction, the change in the observed luminosity is only of
about a factor of 2, in contention with all previous predictions. We present high resolution simulations
performed with the moving mesh code, RICH, together with simple analytical arguments that reproduce
the observed $Br_\gamma$ emission. In our model, G2 is a gas cloud that undergoes tidal disruption
in a dilute ambient medium. We find that during pericenter passage, the efficient cooling of the
cloud results in a vertical collapse, compressing the cloud by a factor of $\sim5000$. By properly
taking into account the ionization state of the gas, we find that the cloud is UV starved and are able
to reproduce the observed $Br_\gamma$ luminosity. For densities larger than $\approx500\;\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$
at pericenter, the cloud fragments, due to cooling instabilities and the emitted radiation is inconsistent
with observations. For lower densities, the cloud survives the pericenter passage intact and its
emitted radiation matches the observed lightcurve. From the duration of $Br_\gamma$ emission
which contains both redshifted and blueshifted components, we show that the cloud is not spherical
but rather elongated with a size ratio of 4 at year 2001. The simulated cloud's elongation grows as
it travels towards pericenter and is consistent with observations, due to viewing angles. The simulation
is also consistent with having a spherical shape at apocenter.
