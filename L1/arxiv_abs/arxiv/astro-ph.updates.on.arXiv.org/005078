The existence of hot Jupiters has challenged theories of planetary formation since the first extrasolar
planets were detected. Giant planets are generally believed to form far from their host stars, where
volatile materials like water exist in their solid phase, making it easier for giant planet cores
to accumulate. Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain how giant planets can migrate inward
from their birth sites to short-period orbits. One such mechanism, called Kozai-Lidov migration,
requires the presence of distant companions in orbits inclined by more than $\sim40$ degrees with
respect to the plane of the hot Jupiter's orbit. The high occurrence rate of wide companions in hot
Jupiter systems lends support to this theory for migration. However, the exact orbital inclinations
of these detected planetary and stellar companions is not known, so it is not clear whether the mutual
inclination of these companions is large enough for the Kozai-Lidov process to operate. This paper
shows that in systems orbiting cool stars with convective outer layers, the orbits of most wide planetary
companions to hot Jupiters must be well aligned with the orbits of the hot Jupiters and the spins of
the host stars. For a variety of possible distributions for the inclination of the companion, the
width of the distribution must be less than $\sim20$ degrees to recreate the observations with good
fidelity. As a result, the companion orbits are likely well-aligned with those of the hot Jupiters,
and the Kozai-Lidov mechanism does not enforce migration in these systems.
