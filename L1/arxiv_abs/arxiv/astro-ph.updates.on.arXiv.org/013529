The NRAO VLA Sky Survey (NVSS) Rotation Measure (RM) catalogue has enabled numerous studies in cosmic
magnetism, and will continue being a unique dataset complementing future polarisation surveys.
Robust comparisons with these new surveys will however require further understandings in the systematic
effects present in the NVSS RM catalogue. In this paper, we make careful comparisons between our
new on-axis broadband observations with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array and the NVSS RM results
for 23 sources. We found that two unpolarised sources were reported as polarised at about 0.5% level
in the RM catalogue, and noted significant differences between our newly derived RM values and the
catalogue values for the remaining 21 sources. These discrepancies are attributed to off-axis
instrumental polarisation in the NVSS RM catalogue. By adopting the 0.5% above as the typical off-axis
instrumental polarisation amplitude, we quantified its effect on the reported RMs with a simulation,
and found that on average the RM uncertainties in the catalogue have to be increased by $\approx$
10% to account for the off-axis instrumental polarisation effect. This effect is more substantial
for sources with lower fractional polarisation, and is a function of the source's true RM. Moreover,
the distribution of the resulting RM uncertainty is highly non-Gaussian. With the extra RM uncertainty
incorporated, we found that the RM values from the two observations for most (18 out of 21) of our polarised
targets can be reconciled. The remaining three are interpreted as showing hints of time variabilities
in RM.
