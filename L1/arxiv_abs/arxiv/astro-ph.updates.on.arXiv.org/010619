The origin of North Polar Spur (NPS) and Loop-I has been debated over almost half a century and is still
unresolved. Most of the confusion is caused by the absence of any prominent counterparts of these
structures in the southern Galactic hemisphere (SGH). This has also led to doubts over the claimed
connection between the NPS and Fermi Bubbles (FBs). I show in this paper, that such asymmetries of
NPS and Loop-I in both X-rays and $\gamma$-rays can be easily produced if the circumgalactic medium
(CGM) density in the southern hemisphere is only smaller by $\approx 20\%$ than the northern counterpart
in case of a star formation driven wind scenario. The required mechanical luminosity, $\mathcal{L}
\approx 4-5\times 10^{40} $ erg s$^{-1}$ (reduces to $\approx 0.3$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ including
the non-thermal pressure) and the age of the FBs, $t_{\rm age} \approx 28$ Myr, are consistent with
previous estimations in case of a star formation driven wind scenario. One of the main reasons for
the asymmetry is the projection effects at the Solar location. Such a proposition is also consistent
with the fact that the southern FB is $\approx 5^\circ$ bigger than the northern one. The results,
therefore, indicate towards a possibility for a common origin of the NPS, Loop-I and FBs from the
Galactic centre (GC). I also estimate the average sky brightness in X-ray towards the south Galactic
pole and North Galactic pole in the ROSAT-R67 band and find that the error in average brightness is
far too large to have any estimation of the deficiency in the southern hemisphere.
