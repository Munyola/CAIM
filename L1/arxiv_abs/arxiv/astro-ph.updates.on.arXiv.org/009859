The standard model for giant planet formation is based on the accretion of solids by a growing planetary
embryo, followed by rapid gas accretion once the planet exceeds a so-called critical mass. The dominant
size of the accreted solids (cm-size particles named pebbles or km to hundred km-size bodies named
planetesimals) is, however, unknown. Recently, high-precision measurements of isotopes in meteorites
provided evidence for the existence of two reservoirs in the early Solar System. These reservoirs
remained separated from ~1 until ~ 3 Myr after the beginning of the Solar System's formation. This
separation is interpreted as resulting from Jupiter growing and becoming a barrier for material
transport. In this framework, Jupiter reached ~20 Earth masses within ~1 Myr and slowly grew to ~50
Earth masses in the subsequent 2 Myr before reaching its present-day mass. The evidence that Jupiter
slowed down its growth after reaching 20 Earth masses for at least 2 Myr is puzzling because a planet
of this mass is expected to trigger fast runaway gas accretion. Here, we use theoretical models to
describe the conditions allowing for such a slow accretion and show that Jupiter grew in three distinct
phases. First, rapid pebble accretion brought the major part of Jupiter's core mass. Second, slow
planetesimal accretion provided the energy required to hinder runaway gas accretion during 2 Myr.
Third, runaway gas accretion proceeded. Both pebbles and planetesimals therefore have an important
role in Jupiter's formation.
