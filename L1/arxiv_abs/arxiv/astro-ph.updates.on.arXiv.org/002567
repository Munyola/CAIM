We present our initial results on the CO rotational spectral line energy distribution (SLED) of
the $J$ to $J$$-$1 transitions from $J=4$ up to $13$ from Herschel SPIRE spectroscopic observations
of 65 luminous infrared galaxies (LIRGs) in the Great Observatories All-Sky LIRG Survey (GOALS).
The observed SLEDs change on average from one peaking at $J \le 4$ to a broad distribution peaking
around $J \sim\,$6$-$7 as the IRAS 60-to-100 um color, $C(60/100)$, increases. However, the ratios
of a CO line luminosity to the total infrared luminosity, $L_{\rm IR}$, show the smallest variation
for $J$ around 6 or 7. This suggests that, for most LIRGs, ongoing star formation (SF) is also responsible
for a warm gas component that emits CO lines primarily in the mid-$J$ regime ($5 \lesssim J \lesssim
10$). As a result, the logarithmic ratios of the CO line luminosity summed over CO (5$-$4), (6$-$5),
(7$-$6), (8$-$7) and (10$-$9) transitions to $L_{\rm IR}$, $\log R_{\rm midCO}$, remain largely
independent of $C(60/100)$, and show a mean value of $-4.13$ ($\equiv \log R^{\rm SF}_{\rm midCO}$)
and a sample standard deviation of only 0.10 for the SF-dominated galaxies. Including additional
galaxies from the literature, we show, albeit with small number of cases, the possibility that galaxies,
which bear powerful interstellar shocks unrelated to the current SF, and galaxies, in which an energetic
active galactic nucleus contributes significantly to the bolometric luminosity, have their $R_{\rm
midCO}$ higher and lower than $R^{\rm SF}_{\rm midCO}$, respectively.
