Young massive clusters (YMCs) are usually accompanied by lower-mass clusters and unbound stars
with a total mass equal to several tens times the mass of the YMC. If this was also true when globular
clusters (GCs) formed, then their cosmic density implies that most star formation before redshift
~2 made a GC that lasted until today. Star-forming regions had to change after this time for the modern
universe to be making very few YMCs. Here we consider the conditions needed for the formation of a
~10^6 Msun cluster. These include a star formation rate inside each independent region that exceeds
~1 Msun/yr to sample the cluster mass function up to such a high mass, and a star formation rate per
unit area of Sigma_SFR ~ 1 Msun/kpc^2/yr to get the required high gas surface density from the Kennicutt-Schmidt
relation, and therefore the required high pressure from the weight of the gas. High pressures are
implied by the virial theorem at cluster densities. The ratio of these two quantities gives the area
of a GC-forming region, ~1 kpc^2, and the young stellar mass converted to a cloud mass gives the typical
gas surface density of 500-1000 Msun/pc^2 Observations of star-forming clumps in young galaxies
are consistent with these numbers, suggesting they formed today's GCs. Observations of the cluster
cut-off mass in local galaxies agree with the maximum mass calculated from Sigma_SFR. Metal-poor
stellar populations in local dwarf irregular galaxies confirm the dominant role of GC formation
in building their young disks.
