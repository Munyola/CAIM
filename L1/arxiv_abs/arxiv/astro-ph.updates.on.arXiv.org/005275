H$_2$O maser emission at 22 GHz in the circumstellar envelope is one of the good tracers of detailed
physics and kinematics in the mass loss process of asymptotic giant branch stars. Long-term monitoring
of an H$_2$O maser spectrum with high time resolution enables us to clarify acceleration processes
of the expanding shell in the stellar atmosphere. We monitored the H$_2$O maser emission of the semi-regular
variable R Crt with the Kagoshima 6-m telescope, and obtained a large data set of over 180 maser spectra
during 1.3 years with an observational span of a few days. Based on an automatic peak detection method
based on a least-squares fitting with a Gaussian basis function model, we exhaustively detected
peaks as significant velocity components with the radial velocity on a 0.1 km/s scale. This analysis
result shows that the radial velocity of red-shifted and blue-shifted components exhibits a change
between acceleration and deceleration on the time scale of a few hundred days. These velocity variations
are likely to correlate with the intensity variations, in particular during flaring state of H$_2$O
masers. It seems reasonable to consider that the velocity variation of the maser source is caused
by the shock propagation in the envelope due to stellar pulsation. However, it is difficult to explain
the relationship between the velocity variation and the intensity variation only from shock propagation
effects. We found that a time delay of the integrated maser intensity with respect to the optical
light curve is about 150 days.
