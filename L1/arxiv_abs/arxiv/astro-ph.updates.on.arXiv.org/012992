We present the results of CO(1-0) and CO(4-3) observations of the host galaxy of a long-duration
gamma-ray burst GRB080207 at z = 2.0858 by using the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array and the Atacama
Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. The host is detected in CO(1-0) and CO(4-3), becoming the
first case for a GRB host with more than two CO transitions detected combined with CO(2-1) and CO(3-2)
in the literature. Adopting a metallicity-dependent CO-to-H2 conversion factor, we derive a molecular
gas mass of Mgas = 8.7 x 10^10 Modot, which places the host in a sequence of normal star-forming galaxies
in a Mgas-star-formation rate (SFR) plane. A modified blackbody fit to the far-infrared--millimeter
photometry results in a dust temperature of 37 K and a dust mass of Mdust = 1.5 x 10^8 Modot. The spatially-resolving
CO(4-3) observations allow us to examine the kinematics of the host. The CO velocity field shows
a clear rotation and is reproduced by a rotation-dominated disk model with a rotation velocity of
350 km/s and a half-light radius of 2.4 kpc. The CO spectral line energy distribution derived from
the four CO transitions is similar to that of starburst galaxies, suggesting a high excitation condition.
Comparison of molecular gas properties between the host and normal (main-sequence) galaxies at
similar redshifts shows that they share common properties such as gas mass fraction, gas depletion
timescale, gas-to-dust ratio, location in the Mgas-SFR (or surface density) relation, and kinematics,
suggesting that long-duration GRBs can occur in normal star-forming environments at z ~ 2.
