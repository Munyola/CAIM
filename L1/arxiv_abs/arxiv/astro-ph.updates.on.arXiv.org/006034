About 3196 EA-type binaries (EAs) were observed by LAMOST by June 16, 2017 and their spectral types
were derived. Meanwhile stellar atmospheric parameters of 2020 EAs were determined. In the paper,
those EAs are catalogued and their physical properties and evolutionary states are investigated.
The period distribution of EAs suggests that the period limit of tidal locking for the close binaries
is about 6 days. It is found that the metallicity of EAs is higher than that of EWs indicating that EAs
are generally younger than EWs and they are the progenitors of EWs. The metallicities of long-period
EWs (0.4 < P < 1 days) are the same as those of EAs with the same periods, while their values of Log (g)
are usually smaller than those of EAs. These support the evolutionary process that EAs evolve into
long-period EWs through the combination of angular momentum loss (AML) via magnetic braking and
case A mass transfer. For short-period EWs, their metallicities are lower than those of EAs, while
their gravitational accelerations are higher. These reveal that they may be formed from cool short-period
EAs through AML via magnetic braking with little mass transfer. For some EWs with high metallicities,
they may be contaminated by material from the evolution of unseen neutron stars and black holes or
they have third bodies that may help them to form rapidly through a short timescale of pre-contact
evolution. The present investigation suggests that the modern EW populations may be formed through
the combination of aforementioned mechanisms.
