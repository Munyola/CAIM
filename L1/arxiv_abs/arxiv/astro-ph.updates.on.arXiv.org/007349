Modeling of the spectral line energy distribution (SLED) of the CO molecule can reveal the physical
conditions (temperature, density) of molecular gas in Galactic clouds and other galaxies. Recently,
the Herschel Space Observatory and ALMA have offered, for the first time, a comprehensive view of
the rotational J = 4-3 through J = 13-12 lines, which arise from a complex, diverse range of physical
conditions that must be simplified to one, two, or three components when modeled. Here we investigate
the recoverability of physical conditions from SLEDs produced by galaxy evolution simulations
containing a large dynamical range in physical properties. These simulated SLEDs were generally
fit well by one component of gas whose properties largely resemble or slightly underestimate the
luminosity-weighted properties of the simulations when clumping due to non-thermal velocity
dispersion is taken into account. If only modeling the first three rotational lines, the median
values of the marginalized parameter distributions better represent the luminosity-weighted
properties of the simulations, but the uncertainties in the fitted parameters are nearly an order
of magnitude, compared to approximately 0.2 dex in the "best-case" scenario of a fully sampled SLED
through J = 10-9. This study demonstrates that while common CO SLED modeling techniques cannot reveal
the underlying complexities of the molecular gas, they can distinguish bulk luminosity-weighted
properties that vary with star formation surface densities and galaxy evolution, if a sufficient
number of lines are detected and modeled.
