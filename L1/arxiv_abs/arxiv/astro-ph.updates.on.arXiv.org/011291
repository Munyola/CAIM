We study the drivers of the scatter in the IRX-beta relation using 23,000 low-redshift galaxies
from the GALEX-SDSS-WISE Legacy Catalog 2 (GSWLC-2). For each galaxy we derive, using CIGALE and
the SED+LIR fitting technique, the slope of the dust attenuation curve and the strength of the UV
bump, plus many other galaxy parameters. We find that the IRX-beta scatter is driven entirely by
a wide range of attenuation curves - primarily their slopes. Once the slope and the UV bump are fixed,
the scatter in the IRX-beta vanishes. The question of the IRX-beta scatter is the direct manifestation
of a more fundamental question of the diversity of dust attenuation curves. The predominant role
of the attenuation curve is the consequence of a narrow range of intrinsic UV slopes of star-forming
galaxies. Galaxies with different specific SFRs or population ages do not show strong trends in
the IRX-beta diagram because their attenuation curves are, on average, similar. Similarly, there
is no shift in the IRX-beta locus between starbursts and normal star-forming galaxies, both types
having, on average, steep attenuation curves. Optical opacity is identified as the strongest determinant
of the attenuation curve slope, and consequently the IRX-beta diversity. Despite the scatter,
the use of an average IRX-beta relation is justified to correct SFRs, adding a random error of <~0.15
dex. The form of the local correspondence between IRX-beta and attenuation curves is maintained
at high redshift as long as the evolution of the intrinsic UV slopes stays within a few tenths.
