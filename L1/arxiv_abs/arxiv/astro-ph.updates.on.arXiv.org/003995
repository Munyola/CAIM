Nuclear spiral arms are small-scale transient spiral structures found in the centers of galaxies.
Similarly to their galactic-scale counterparts, nuclear spiral arms can perturb the orbits of
stars. In the case of the Galactic Center (GC), these perturbations can affect the orbits of stars
and binaries in a region extending to several hundred parsecs around the supermassive black hole
(MBH), causing diffusion in orbital energy and angular momentum. This diffusion process can drive
stars and binaries to close approaches with the MBH, disrupting single stars in tidal disruption
events (TDEs), or disrupting binaries, leaving a star tightly bound to the MBH, and an unbound star
escaping the galaxy, i.e., a hypervelocity star (HVS). Here, we consider diffusion by nuclear spiral
arms in galactic nuclei, specifying to the Milky Way GC. We determine nuclear spiral arm-driven
diffusion rates using test-particle integrations, and compute disruption rates. Our TDE rates
are up to 20% higher compared to relaxation by single stars. For binaries, the enhancement is up to
a factor of ~100, and our rates are comparable to the observed numbers of HVSs and S-stars. Our scenario
is complementary to relaxation driven by massive perturbers. In addition, our rates depend on the
inclination of the binary with respect to the Galactic plane. Therefore, our scenario provides
a novel potential source for the observed anisotropic distribution of HVSs. Nuclear spiral arms
may also be important for accelerating the coalescence of binary MBHs, and for supplying nuclear
star clusters with stars and gas.
