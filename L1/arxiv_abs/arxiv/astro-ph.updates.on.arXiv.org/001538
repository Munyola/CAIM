The angular momentum of gaseous galactic discs in semi-analytic models of galaxy formation is usually
followed considering the angular momentum of their host haloes as well as contributions by material
that falls toward the discs. However, little attention is paid to the effects of accretion of material
with missaligned angular momenta. These effects are the subject of this paper, where we adopt a Monte-Carlo
simulation for the changes in the direction of the angular momentum of a galaxy disc as it accretes
matter. The Monte-Carlo simulation follows the probability of angular momentum slews and flips
in dark matter subhaloes accurately measured in the Millennium II simulation for masses $M>10^{10}$h$^{-1}M_{\odot}$.
Our implementation in a semi-analytic model is done such that the flip acting on the dark matter haloes
is assumed to be the same for the cold baryons; however, we assume that in the latter case the flip also
entails a difficulty for the disc to increase its angular momentum which causes the disc to become
smaller relative to a no-flip case by the cosine of the angle of the flip. This has several consequences
which make star formation occur faster, specially in low mass galaxies at all redshifts. In general,
small discs suffer a phase of fast cold gas mass growth, which is when the largest flips take place
making them denser and increasing their star formation activity. Therefore, the high mass end of
the high redshift stellar mass function reaches higher masses, in better agreement with observations.
