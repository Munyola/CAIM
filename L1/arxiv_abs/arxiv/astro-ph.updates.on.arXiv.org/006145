Low-mass galaxies radio observations show in many cases surprisingly high levels of magnetic field.
The mass and kinematics of such objects do not favour the development of effective large-scale dynamo
action. We attempted to check if the cosmic-ray-driven dynamo can be responsible for measured magnetization
in this class of poorly investigated objects. We investigated how starburst events on the whole,
as well as when part of the galactic disk, influence the magnetic field evolution. We created a model
of a dwarf/Magellanic-type galaxy described by gravitational potential constituted from two
components: the stars and the dark-matter halo. The model is evolved by solving a three-dimensional
(3D) magnetohydrodynamic equation with an additional cosmic-ray component, which is approximated
as a fluid. The turbulence is generated in the system via supernova explosions manifested by the
injection of cosmic-rays.The cosmic-ray-driven dynamo works efficiently enough to amplify the
magnetic field even in low-mass dwarf/Magellanic-type galaxies. The $e$-folding times of magnetic
energy growth are 0.50 and 0.25 Gyr for the slow (50 km/s) and fast (100 km/s) rotators, respectively.
The amplification is being suppressed as the system reaches the equipartition level between kinetic,
magnetic, and cosmic-ray energies. An episode of star formation burst amplifies the magnetic field
but only for a short time while increased star formation activity holds. We find that a substantial
amount of gas is expelled from the galactic disk, and that the starburst events increase the efficiency
of this process.
