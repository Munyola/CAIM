Though Lyman alpha emission (Lya) is one of the most used tracers of massive star formation at high
redshift, a correct understanding of radiation transfer effects by neutral gas is required to properly
quantify the star formation rate along the history of the Universe. We are embarked in a program to
study the properties of the Lya emission (spectral profile, spatial distribution, relation to
Balmer lines intensity,...) in several local starburst galaxies. We present here the results obtained
for IRAS 08339+6517. Using evolutionary population synthesis models, we have characterized the
properties of the starburst (UV continuum, Halpha, total infrared and X-ray emissions, etc.),
which transformed 1.4e+8 Mo of gas into stars around 5-6 Myr ago. In addition to the central compact
emission blob, we have identified a diffuse Lya emission component smoothly distributed over the
whole central area of IRAS 08339+6517. This diffuse emission is spatially decoupled from the UV
continuum, the Halpha emission or the Halpha/Hbeta ratio. Both locally and globally, the Lya/Halpha
ratio is lower than the Case B predictions, even after reddening correction, with an overall Lya
escape fraction of only 4%. We conclude that in IRAS 08339+6517 the resonant scattering of Lya photons
by an outflowing shell of neutral gas causes their highly-efficient destruction by dust, which
explains the low Lya escape fraction measured. These results stress again the importance of a proper
correction of scattering and transfer effects when using Lya to derive the star formation rate in
high-redshift galaxies.
