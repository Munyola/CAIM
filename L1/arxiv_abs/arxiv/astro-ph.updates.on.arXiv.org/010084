While highly evolved cataclysmic variables (CVs) with brown dwarf donors, often called "period
bouncers", are predicted to make up $\simeq40-70$ % of the Galactic CV population, only a handful
of such systems are currently known. The identification and characterization of additional period
bouncers is therefore important to probe this poorly understood phase of CV evolution. We investigate
the evolution of the CV QZ Lib following its 2004 super-outburst using multi-epoch spectroscopy.
From time-resolved spectroscopic observations we measure the orbital period of the system, $P_\mathrm{orb}=
0.06436(20)$ d, which, combined with the superhump period $P_\mathrm{SH}= 0.064602(24)$ d, yields
the system mass ratio, $q = 0.040(9)$. From the analysis of the spectral energy distribution we determine
the structure of the accretion disc and the white dwarf effective temperature, $T_\mathrm{eff}
= 10\,500 \pm 1500\,\mathrm{K}$. We also derive an upper limit on the effective temperature of the
secondary, $T_\mathrm{eff} \lesssim 1700\,\mathrm{K}$, corresponding to a brown dwarf of T spectral
type. The low temperature of the white dwarf, the small mass ratio and the fact that the donor is not
dominating the near-infrared emission are all clues of a post bounce system. Although it is possible
that QZ Lib could have formed as a white dwarf plus a brown dwarf binary, binary population synthesis
studies clearly suggest this scenario to be less likely than a period bouncer detection and we conclude
that QZ Lib is a CV that has already evolved through the period minimum.
