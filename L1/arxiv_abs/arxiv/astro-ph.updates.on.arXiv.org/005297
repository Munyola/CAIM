We present a census of variable stars in six M31 dwarf spheroidal satellites observed with the Hubble
Space Telescope. We detect 870 RR Lyrae (RRL) stars in the fields of And I (296), II (251), III (111),
XV (117), XVI (8), XXVIII (87). We also detect a total of 15 Anomalous Cepheids, three Eclipsing Binaries,
and seven field RRL stars compatible with being members of the M31 halo or the Giant Stellar Stream.
We derive robust and homogeneous distances to the six galaxies using different methods based on
the properties of the RRL stars. Working with the up-to-date set of Period-Wesenheit ($I$, $B$ -
$I$) relations published by Marconi et al., we obtain distance moduli of $\mu_0$ = [24.49, 24.16,
24.36, 24.42, 23.70, 24.43] mag (respectively), with systematic uncertainties of 0.08 mag and
statistical uncertainties $<$ 0.11 mag. We have considered an enlarged sample of sixteen M31 satellites
with published variability studies, and compared their pulsational observables (e.g., periods,
amplitudes), with those of fifteen Milky Way satellites for which similar data are available. The
properties of the (strictly old) RRL in both satellite systems do not show any significant difference.
In particular, we found a strikingly similar correlation between the mean period distribution
of the fundamental RRL pulsators (RRab) and the mean metallicities of the galaxies. This indicates
that the old RRL progenitors were similar at the early stage in the two environments, suggesting
very similar characteristics for the earliest stages of evolution of both satellite systems.
