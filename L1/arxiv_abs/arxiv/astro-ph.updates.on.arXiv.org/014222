In order to study the slope and strength of the non-stellar continuum, we analyzed a sample of nearby
Narrow Line Seyfert 1 (NLS1). Also, we re-examined the location of NLS1 galaxies on the M $-$ $\sigma$
relation using the stellar velocity dispersion and the [OIII]$\lambda$5007 emission line as surrogate
of the former. We studied spectra of a sample of 131 NLS1 galaxies taken from the Sloan Digital Sky
Survey (SDSS) DR7. We approached the determination of the non-stellar continuum using the spectral
synthesis technique using the code {\sc starlight}, adopting a power-law base to model the non-stellar
continuum. A composite spectra of NLS1 galaxies was also obtained based on the sample. In addition,
we obtained the stellar velocity dispersion from the code and by measuring Calcium II Triplet absorption
lines and [OIII] emission lines. From Gaussian decomposition of the H$\beta$ profile we calculated
the black hole mass. We obtained a median slope of $\beta$ = $-$1.6 with a median fraction of contribution
of the non-stellar continuum to the total flux of 0.64. We determined black hole masses in the range
of log(M$_{BH}$/M$_{\odot}$) = 5.6 $-$ 7.5 in agreement with previous works. We found a correlation
between the luminosity of the broad component of H$\beta$ and black hole mass with the fraction of
power law component. Finally, according to our results, NLS1 galaxies in our sample follow the relation
M $-$ $\sigma$, both considering the stellar velocity dispersion ($\sigma_{\star}$), and the
core component of [OIII]$\lambda$5007.
