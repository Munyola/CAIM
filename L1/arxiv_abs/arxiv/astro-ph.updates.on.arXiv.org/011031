We perform forecasts for how baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) scale and redshift-space distortion
(RSD) measurements from future spectroscopic emission line galaxy (ELG) surveys such as Euclid
are degraded in the presence of spectral line misidentification. Using analytic calculations
verified with mock galaxy catalogs from log-normal simulations we find that constraints are degraded
in two ways, even when the interloper power spectrum is modeled correctly in the likelihood. Firstly,
there is a loss of signal-to-noise ratio for the power spectrum of the target galaxies, which propagates
to all cosmological constraints and increases with contamination fraction, $f_c$. Secondly,
degeneracies can open up between $f_c$ and cosmological parameters. In our calculations this typically
increases BAO scale uncertainties at the 10-20% level when marginalizing over parameters determining
the broadband power spectrum shape. External constraints on $f_c$, or parameters determining
the shape of the power spectrum, for example from cosmic microwave background (CMB) measurements,
can remove this effect. There is a near-perfect degeneracy between $f_c$ and the power spectrum
amplitude for low $f_c$ values, where $f_c$ is not well determined from the contaminated sample
alone. This has the potential to strongly degrade RSD constraints. The degeneracy can be broken
with an external constraint on $f_c$, for example from cross-correlation with a separate galaxy
sample containing the misidentified line, or deeper sub-surveys.
