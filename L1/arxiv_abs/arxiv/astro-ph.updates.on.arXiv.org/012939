Massive stars are characterized by a significant loss of mass either via spherically symmetric
stellar winds or pre-explosion pulses, or by aspherical forms of circumstellar matter (CSM) such
as bipolar lobes or outflowing circumstellar equatorial disks. A significant fraction of most
massive stars end their lives by a core collapse; supernovae (SNe) are always located inside circumstellar
envelopes created by their progenitors. We study the dynamics and thermal effects of collision
between expanding ejecta of SNe and CSM that may be formed during, for example, a sgB[e] star phase,
a luminous blue variable phase, around PopIII stars, or by various forms of accretion. For time-dependent
hydrodynamic modeling we used our own code built with a finite volumes method. The code is highly
efficient for calculations of shocks and physical flows with large discontinuities. The initial
geometry of the disks corresponds to a density structure of a material that orbits in Keplerian trajectories.
We examine the behavior of the density, pressure, velocity of expansion, and temperature structure
in the interaction zone under various geometrical configurations of dense equatorial disks. Our
`low density' model shows significant asphericity in the case of the disk mass-loss rate $\dot{M}_\text{csd}=10^{-6}\,M_\odot\,\text{yr}^{-1}$.
The models also show the zones of overdensity in the SN - disk contact region and indicate the development
of Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities within the zones of shear between the disk and the more freely
expanding material outside the disk.
