Investigating the magnetic field structure in the innermost regions of relativistic jets is fundamental
to shed light on the crucial physical processes giving rise to the jet formation, as well as to its
extraordinary radiation output up to gamma-ray energies. We study the magnetic field structure
of the quasar CTA 102 with 3 and 7 mm-VLBI polarimetric observations, reaching an unprecedented
resolution (~50 microarcsec). We also investigate the variability and physical process occurring
in the source during the observing period which coincides with a very active state of the source till
high-energies. The Faraday rotation analysis between 3 and 7mm shows a gradient in rotation measure
with a maximum value of ~6X10^4 rad/m^2 and intrinsic electric vector position angles (EVPAs) oriented
around the centroid of the core, suggesting the presence of large-scale helical magnetic fields.
Such a magnetic field structure is also visible in 7 mm images when a new superluminal component is
crossing the core region. The 7mm EVPAs orientation is different when the component is exiting the
core or crossing a stationary feature at ~0.1 mas. The interaction between the superluminal component
and a recollimation shock at ~0.1 mas could have triggered the multi-wavelengths flares. The variability
Doppler factor associated with such interaction is large enough to explain the high energy emission,
as we infer from the analysis of gamma-ray and X-ray data, and it is in agreement with the Doppler factor
obtained to explain the extraordinary optical flare by Raiteri et al.(2017).
