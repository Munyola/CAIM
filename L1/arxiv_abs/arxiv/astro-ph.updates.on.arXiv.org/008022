Aims. We perform a detailed observational analysis of network jets to understand their kinematics,
rotational motion and underlying triggering mechanism(s). We have analyzed the quiet-Sun (QS)
data. Methods. IRIS high resolution imaging and spectral observations (SJI: Si iv 1400.0 \AA, Raster:
Si iv 1393.75 \AA) are used to analyze the omnipresent rotating network jets in the transition-region
(TR). In addition, we have also used Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) onboard Solar Dynamic Observation
(SDO) observations. Results. The statistical analysis of fifty-one network jets is performed
to understand various their mean properties, e.g., apparent speed (140.16+/-39.41 km/s), length
(3.16+/-1.18 Mm), lifetimes (105.49+/-51.75 s). The Si iv 1393.75 \AA line has secondary component
along with its main Gaussian, which is formed due to the high-speed plasma flows (i.e., network jets).
The variation of Doppler velocity across these jets (i.e., blue shift on one edge and red shift on
the other) signify the presence of inherited rotational motion. The statistical analysis predicts
that the mean rotational velocity (i.e., \delV) is 49.56 km/s. The network jets have high angular
velocity in comparison to the other class of solar jets. Conclusions. The signature of network jets
are inherited in TR spectral lines in terms of the secondary component of the Si iv 1393.75 \AA line.
The rotational motion of network jets is omnipresent, which is reported firstly for this class of
jet-like features. The magnetic reconnection seems to be the most favorable mechanism for the formation
of these network jets.
