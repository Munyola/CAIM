We have previously presented a reconstruction of Horndeski scalar-tensor theories from linear
cosmological observables. It includes free nonlinear terms which can be added onto the reconstructed
covariant theory without affecting the background and linear dynamics. After discussing the uniqueness
of these correction terms, we apply this nonlinear freedom to a range of different applications.
First we demonstrate how the correction terms can be configured to endow the reconstructed models
with screening mechanisms such as the chameleon, k-mouflage and Vainshtein effects. A further
implication is the existence of classes of Horndeski models that are degenerate with standard cosmology
to an arbitrary level in the cosmological perturbations. Particularly interesting examples are
kinetically self-accelerating models that mimic the dynamics of the cosmological constant to
an arbitrary degree in perturbations. Finally, we develop the reconstruction method further to
the level of higher-order effective field theory, which under the restriction to a luminal propagation
speed of gravitational waves introduces two new free functions per order. These functions determine
the corresponding correction terms in the linearly reconstructed action at the same order. Our
results enable the connection of linear cosmological constraints on generalised modifications
of gravity and dark energy with the nonlinear regime and astrophysical probes for a more global interpretation
of the wealth of forthcoming cosmological survey data.
