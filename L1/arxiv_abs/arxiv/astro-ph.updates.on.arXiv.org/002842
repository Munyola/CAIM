NGC 6819 is a richly populated, older open cluster situated within the Kepler field. A CCD survey
of the cluster on the uvbyCaHbeta system, coupled with proper-motion membership, has been used
to isolate 382 highly probable, single-star unevolved main-sequence members over a 20-arcminute
field centered on the cluster. From 278 F dwarfs with high precision photometry in all indices, a
mean reddening of E(b-y) = 0.117 +/- 0.005 or E(B-V) = 0.160 +/- 0.007 is derived, where the standard
errors of the mean include both internal errors and the photometric zero-point uncertainty. With
the reddening fixed, the metallicity derived from the same 278 stars is [Fe/H] = -0.116 +/- 0.101
from m_1 and -0.055 +/- 0.033 from hk, for a weighted average of [Fe/H] = -0.06 +/- 0.04, where the quoted
standard errors of the mean values include the internal errors from the photometric scatter plus
the uncertainty in the photometric zero points. If metallicity is derived using individual reddening
values for each star to account for potential reddening variation across the face of the cluster,
the analogous result is unchanged. The cluster members at the turnoff of the color-magnitude diagram
are used to test and confirm the recently discovered variation in reddening across the face of the
cluster, with a probable range in the variation of Delta[E(B-V)] = 0.045 +/-0.015. With the slightly
higher reddening and lower [Fe/H] compared to commonly adopted values, isochrone fitting leads
to an age of 2.3 +/- 0.2 Gyr for an apparent modulus of (m-M) = 12.40 +/-0.12.
