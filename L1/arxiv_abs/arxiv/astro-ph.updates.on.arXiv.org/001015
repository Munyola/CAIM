Studies of the evolution of massive protostars and the evolution of their host molecular cloud cores
are commonly treated as separate problems. However, interdependencies between the two can be significant.
Here, we study the simultaneous evolution of massive protostars and their host molecular cores
using a multi-dimensional radiation hydrodynamics code that incorporates the effects of the thermal
pressure and radiative acceleration feedback of the centrally forming protostar. The evolution
of the massive protostar is computed simultaneously using the stellar evolution code STELLAR,
modified to include the effects of variable accretion. The interdependencies are studied in three
different collapse scenarios. For comparison, stellar evolutionary tracks at constant accretion
rates and the evolution of the host cores using pre-computed stellar evolutionary tracks are computed.
The resulting interdependencies of the protostellar evolution and the evolution of the environment
are extremely diverse and depend on the order of events, in particular the time of circumstellar
accretion disk formation with respect to the onset of the bloating phase of the star. Feedback mechanisms
affect the instantaneous accretion rate and the protostar's radius, temperature and luminosity
on timescales equal or smaller than 5 kyr, corresponding to the accretion timescale and Kelvin-Helmholtz
contraction timescale, respectively. Nevertheless, it is possible to approximate the overall
protostellar evolution in many cases by pre-computed stellar evolutionary tracks assuming appropriate
constant average accretion rates.
