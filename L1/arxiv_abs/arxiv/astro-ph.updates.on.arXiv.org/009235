We develop a new spectral model for the broadband spectral energy distribution (SED) of Active Galactic
Nuclei (AGN). This includes an outer standard disc, an inner warm Comptonising region to produce
the soft X-ray excess and a hot corona. We tie these together energetically by assuming Novikov-Thorne
emissivity, and use this to define a size scale for the hard X-ray corona as equal to the radius where
the remaining accretion energy down to the black hole can power the observed X-ray emission. We test
this on three AGN with well defined SEDs as well as on larger samples to show that the average hard X-ray
luminosity is always approximately a few percent of the Eddington luminosity across a large range
of Eddington ratio. As a consequence, the radial size scale required for gravity to power the X-ray
corona has to decrease with increasing Eddington fraction. For the first time we hardwire this into
the spectral models, and set the hard X-ray spectral index self consistently from the ratio of the
hard X-ray luminosity to intercepted seed photon luminosity from the disc. This matches the observed
correlation of steeper spectral index with increasing Eddington ratio, as well as reproducing
the observed tight UV/X relation of quasars. We also include the reprocessed emission produced
by the hot inner flow illuminating the warm Comptonisation and standard disc regions and show that
this predicts a decreasing amount of optical variability with increasing Eddington ratio as observed,
though additional processes may also be required to explain the observed optical variability.
