We study the properties of 115 coronal holes in the time-range from 2010/08 to 2017/03, the peak velocities
of the corresponding high-speed streams as measured in the ecliptic at 1 AU, and the corresponding
changes of the Kp index as marker of their geo-effectiveness. We find that the peak velocities of
high-speed streams depend strongly on both the ar- eas and the co-latitudes of their solar source
coronal holes with regard to the heliospheric latitude of the satellites. Therefore, the co-latitude
of their source coronal hole is an im- portant parameter for the prediction of the high-speed stream
properties near the Earth. We derive the largest solar wind peak velocities normalized to the coronal
hole areas for coronal holes located near the solar equator, and that they linearly decrease with
increas- ing latitudes of the coronal holes. For coronal holes located at latitudes & 60{\deg},
they turn statistically to zero, indicating that the associated high-speed streams have a high
chance to miss the Earth. Similar, the Kp index per coronal hole area is highest for the coronal holes
located near the solar equator and strongly decreases with increasing latitudes of the coronal
holes. We interpret these results as an effect of the three-dimensional propaga- tion of high-speed
streams in the heliosphere, i.e., high-speed streams arising from coro- nal holes near the solar
equator propagate in direction towards and directly hit the Earth, whereas solar wind streams arising
from coronal holes at higher solar latitudes only graze or even miss the Earth.
