We analyze stellar age indicators (D$_n$4000 and EW(H$\delta$)) and sizes of 467 quiescent galaxies
with $M_\ast \geq 10^{10} M_\odot$ at $z\sim0.7$ drawn from DR2 of the LEGA-C survey. Interpreting
index variations in terms of equivalent single stellar population age, we find that the median stellar
population is younger for larger galaxies at fixed stellar mass. The effect is significant, yet
small; the ages of the larger and the smaller subsets differ by only $<500$ Myr, much less than the
age variation among individual galaxies ($\sim1.5$ Gyr). At the same time, quiescent galaxies
with the strongest H$\delta$ absorption --- those experienced recent and rapid quenching events
--- tend to be smaller than the average. These co-existing trends unify seemingly contradictory
results in the literature; the complex correlations between size and age indicators revealed by
our large sample of galaxies with high-quality spectra suggest that there are multiple evolutionary
pathways to quiescence. Regardless of the specific physical mechanisms responsible for the cessation
of star formation in massive galaxies, the large scatter in D$_n$4000 and EW(H$\delta$) immediately
implies that galaxies follow a large variety in evolutionary pathways. On the one hand, we see evidence
for a process that slowly shuts off star-formation and transforms star-forming galaxies to quiescent
galaxies without necessarily changing their structures. On the other hand, there is likely a mechanism
that rapidly quenches galaxies, an event that coincides with dramatic structural changes, producing
small post-starburst galaxies.
