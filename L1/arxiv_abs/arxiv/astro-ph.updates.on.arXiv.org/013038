Over the last four decades, persistent and flaring emission of magnetars observed by various telescopes
has provided us with a suite of light curves and spectra in soft and hard X-rays, with no emission yet
detected above around 1 MeV. Attenuation of such high-energy photons by magnetic pair creation
and photon splitting is expected to be active in the magnetospheres of magnetars, possibly accounting
for the paucity of gamma-rays in their signals. This paper explores polarization-dependent opacities
for these two QED processes in static vacuum dipole magnetospheres of highly-magnetized neutron
stars, calculating attenuation lengths and determining escape energies, which are the maximum
photon energies for transparency out to infinity. The numerical trajectory integral analysis
in flat and curved spacetimes provides upper bounds of a few MeV or less to the visible energies for
magnetars for locales proximate to the stellar surface. Photon splitting opacity alone puts constraints
on the possible emission locales in their magnetospheres: regions within field loops of maximum
altitudes 2-4 stellar radii are not commensurate with maximum detected energies of around 250 keV.
These constraints apply not only to magnetar flares but also to their quiescent hard X-ray tail emission.
An exploration of photon splitting attenuation in the context of a resonant inverse Compton scattering
model for the hard X-ray tails derives distinctive phase-resolved spectroscopic and polarimetric
signatures, of significant interest for future MeV-band missions such as AMEGO and e-ASTROGAM.
