The classic optical nebular diagnostics [N II], [O II], [O III], [S II], [S III], and [Ar III] are employed
to search for evidence of non-Maxwellian electron distributions, namely $\kappa$~distributions,
in a sample of well-observed Galactic H II regions. By computing new effective collision strengths
for all these systems and A-values when necessary (e.g. S II), and by comparing with previous collisional
and radiative datasets, we have been able to obtain realistic estimates of the electron-temperature
dispersion caused by the atomic data, which in most cases are not larger than $\sim 10$%. If the uncertainties
due to both observation and atomic data are then taken into account, it is plausible to determine
for some systems a representative average temperature while in others there are at least two plasma
excitation regions. For the latter, it is found that the diagnostic temperature differences in
the high-excitation region, e.g. $T_e$(O III), $T_e$(S III), and $T_e$(Ar III), cannot be conciliated
by invoking $\kappa$~distributions. For the low excitation region, it is possible in some, but
not all, cases to arrive at a common, lower temperature for [N II], [O II], and [S II] with $\kappa\approx
10$, which would then lead to significant abundance enhancements for these charge states. An analytic
formula is proposed to generate accurate $\kappa$-averaged excitation rate coefficients (better
than 10% for $\kappa \geq 5$) from temperature tabulations of the Maxwell-Boltzmann effective
collision strengths.
