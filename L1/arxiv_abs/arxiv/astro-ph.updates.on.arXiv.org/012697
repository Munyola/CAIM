We take advantage of new 100-hour Spitzer/IRAC observations available for MACS0647-JD, a strongly
lensed $z\approx11$ galaxy candidate, to provide improved constraints on its physical properties.
Probing the physical properties of galaxies at $z>8$ is challenging due to the inherent faintness
of such sources and the limited wavelength coverage available. Thanks to the high $\approx$2-6$\times$
lensing magnification of the multiple images of MACS0647-JD, we can use the sensitive Spitzer/IRAC
data to probe the rest-frame optical fluxes of MACS0647-JD and investigate its physical properties
including the age and the stellar mass. In deriving Spitzer/IRAC fluxes for MACS0647-JD, great
care is taken in coping with the impact of three bright ($\approx$8-16 mag) stars in our field to ensure
robust results. Assuming a constant star formation rate, the age, stellar mass, and rest-frame
UV slope we estimate for MACS0647-JD based on a stack of the photometry are log$_{10}$(age/yr) =
8.6$^{+0.1}_{-2.1}$, log$_{10}$(M$_{*}$/M$_{\odot}$) = 9.1$^{+0.2}_{-1.4}$, and $\beta
= -$1.3$\pm$0.6, respectively. We compare our results with expectations from the EAGLE simulation
and find that MACS0647-JD has properties consistent with corresponding to the most massive and
rapidly star-forming galaxies in the simulation. We also find that its radius, 105$\pm$28 pc, is
a factor of $\approx$2 smaller than the mean size in a separate simulation project DRAGONS. Interestingly
enough, the observed size is similar to the small sizes seen in very low-luminosity $z\approx$6-10
galaxies behind lensing clusters.
