We use the second data releases of the ESA Gaia astrometric survey and the high-resolution GALAH
spectroscopic survey to analyse the structure of our Galaxy's disc components. With GALAH, we separate
the alpha-rich and alpha-poor discs (with respect to Fe), which are superposed in both position
and velocity space, and examine their distributions in action space. We study the distribution
of stars in the zV_z phase plane, for both V_phi and V_R, and recover the remarkable "phase spiral"
discovered by Gaia. We identify the anticipated quadrupole signature in zV_z of a tilted velocity
ellipsoid for stars above and below the Galactic plane. By connecting our work with earlier studies,
we show that the phase spiral is likely to extend well beyond the narrow solar neighbourhood cylinder
in which it was found. The phase spiral is a signature of corrugated waves that propagate through
the disc, and the associated non-equilibrium phase mixing. The radially asymmetric distribution
of stars involved in the phase spiral reveals that the corrugation, which is mostly confined to the
alpha-poor disc, grows in z-amplitude with increasing radius. We present new simulations of tidal
disturbance of the Galactic disc by the Sagittarius (Sgr) dwarf. The effect on the zV_z phase plane
lasts >2 Gyr but a subsequent disc crossing wipes out the coherent structure. We find that the phase
spiral was excited < 0.5 Gyr ago by an object like Sgr with total mass 3 x 10^10 Msun (stripped down from
5 x 10^10 Msun when it first entered the halo) passing through the plane.
