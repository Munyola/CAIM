Supermassive black holes with up to a $\rm 10^{9} M_{\odot}$ dwell in the centers of present-day
galaxies, and their presence has been confirmed at z $\geq$ 6. Their formation at such early epochs
is still an enigma. Different pathways have been suggested to assemble supermassive black holes
in the first billion years after the Big Bang. Direct collapse has emerged as a highly plausible scenario
to form black holes as it provides seed black holes with $\rm 10^{5}-10^{6} M_{\odot}$. Gravitational
collapse in atomic cooling haloes with virial temperatures T$_{vir} \geq 10^{4}$ K may lead to the
formation of massive seed black holes in the presence of an intense background UV flux. Turbulence
may play a central role in regulating accretion and transporting angular momentum. We present here
the highest resolution cosmological large-eddy simulations to date which track the evolution
of high-density regions on scales of 0.25 AU beyond the formation of the first peak, and study the
impact of subgrid-scale turbulence. The peak density reached in these simulations is $\rm 1.2 \times
10^{-8} g cm^{-3}$. Our findings show that while fragmentation occasionally occurs, it does not
prevent the growth of a central massive object resulting from turbulent accretion and occasional
mergers. The central object reaches $\rm \sim 1000 M_{\odot}$ within 4 free-fall times, and we expect
further growth up to $\rm 10^{6} M_{\odot}$ through accretion in about 1 million years. The direct
collapse model thus provides a viable pathway of forming high-mass black holes at early cosmic times.
