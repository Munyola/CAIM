The main goal of this work is to compare the results of three dynamical mass estimators to the X-ray
hydrostatic values, focussing on massive galaxy clusters at intermediate redshifts $z\sim0.3$.
We estimated dynamical masses with the virial theorem, the Jeans equation, and the caustic method
using wide-field VIMOS spectroscopy. We investigated the role of colour selection and the impact
of substructures on the dynamical estimators. The Jeans and caustic methods give consistent results,
whereas the virial theorem leads to masses $\sim15\%$ larger. The Jeans, caustic, and virial masses
are respectively $\sim20\%$, $\sim30\%$, and $\sim50\%$ larger than the hydrostatic values.
Large scatters of $\gtrsim50\%$ are mainly due to the two outliers RXCJ0014 and RXCJ1347; excluding
the latter increases the mass ratios by $\sim10\%$, giving a fractional mass bias significant at
$\gtrsim2\sigma$. We found a correlation between the dynamical-to-hydrostatic mass ratio and
two substructure indicators, suggesting a bias in the dynamical measurements. The velocity dispersions
of blue galaxies are $\sim15\%$ ($\sim25\%$ after removing the substructures) larger than that
of the red-sequence galaxies; using the latter leads to dynamical masses $\sim10\%-15\%$ smaller.
Discarding the galaxies part of substructures reduces the masses by $\sim15\%$; the effect is larger
for the more massive clusters, owing to a higher level of substructures. After the substructure
analysis, the dynamical masses are in perfect agreement with the hydrostatic values and the scatters
around the mean ratios are divided by $\sim2$.
