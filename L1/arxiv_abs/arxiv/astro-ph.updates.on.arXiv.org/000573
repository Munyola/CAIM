We reexamine the general synchrotron model for GRBs' prompt emission and determine the regime in
the parameter phase space in which it is viable. We characterize a typical GRB pulse in terms of its
peak energy, peak flux and duration and use the latest Fermi observations to constrain the high energy
part of the spectrum. We solve for the intrinsic parameters at the emission region and find the possible
parameter phase space for synchrotron emission. Our approach is general and it does not depend on
a specific energy dissipation mechanism. Reasonable synchrotron solutions are found with energy
ratios of $10^{-4}<\epsilon_B/\epsilon_e<10$, bulk Lorentz factor values of $300<\Gamma<3000$,
typical electrons' Lorentz factor values of $3\times 10^3<\gamma_e<10^5$ and emission
radii of the order $10^{15}cm<R<10^{17}$cm. Most remarkable among those are the rather
large values of the emission radius and the electron's Lorentz factor. We find that soft (with peak
energy less than 100KeV) but luminous (isotropic luminosity of $~1.5 \times 10^{53}$) pulses are
inefficient. This may explain the lack of strong soft bursts. In cases when most of the energy is carried
out by the kinetic energy of the flow, such as in the internal shocks, the synchrotron solution requires
that only a small fraction of the electrons are accelerated to relativistic velocities by the shocks.
We show that future observations of very high energy photons from GRBs by CTA, could possibly determine
all parameters of the synchrotron model or rule it out altogether.
