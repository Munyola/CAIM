We present a detailed study of a unusually bright, lensed galaxy at $z=\laez$ discovered within
the CFHTLS imaging survey. With an observed flux of $i_{\rm AB}=23.0$, \cooname\ is one of the brightest
galaxies known at $z>5$. It is characterized by strong Ly$\alpha$ emission, reaching a peak in (observed)
flux density of $>10^{-16}~\flam$. A deep optical spectrum from the LBT places strong constraints
on \ion{N}{V} and \ion{C}{IV} emission, disfavouring an AGN source for the emission. However,
a detection of the \ion{N}{IV}]~$\lambda$1486 emission line indicates a hard ionizing continuum,
possibly from hot, massive stars. Resolved imaging from {\sl HST} deblends the galaxy from a foreground
interloper; these observations include narrowband imaging of the Ly$\alpha$ emission, which
is marginally resolved on $\sim$few~kpc scales and has EW$_0~\sim$ 260\AA. The Ly$\alpha$ emission
extends over $\sim2000~\kms$ and is broadly consistent with expanding shell models. SED fitting
that includes {\sl Spitzer}/IRAC photometry suggests a complex star formation history that include
both a recent burst and an evolved population. \lae\ lies 30\arcsec\ from the centre of a known lensing
cluster in the CFHTLS; combined with the foreground contribution this leads to a highly uncertain
estimate for the lensing magnification in the range $5 \la \mu \la 25$. Because of its unusual brightness
\lae\ affords unique opportunities for detailed study of an individual galaxy near the epoch of
reionization and a preview of what can be expected from upcoming wide-area surveys that will yield
hundreds of similar objects.
