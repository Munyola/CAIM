Stellar haloes encode a fossil record of a galaxy's accretion history, generally in the form of structures
of low surface brightness, such as stellar streams. While their low surface brightness makes it
challenging to determine their age, metallicity, kinematics and spatial structure, the infalling
galaxies also deposit globular clusters (GCs) in the halo, which are bright and therefore easier
to observe and characterise. To understand how GCs associated with stellar streams can be used to
estimate the stellar mass and the infall time of their parent galaxy, we examine a subset of 15 simulations
of galaxies and their star clusters from the E-MOSAICS project. E-MOSAICS is a suite of hydrodynamical
simulations incorporating a sub-grid model for GC formation and evolution. We find that more massive
accreted galaxies typically contribute younger and more metal rich GCs. This lower age results
from a more extended cluster formation history in more massive galaxies. In addition, at fixed stellar
mass, galaxies that are accreted later host younger clusters, because they can continue to form
GCs without being subjected to environmental influences for longer. This explains the large range
of ages observed for clusters associated with the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy in the halo of the Milky
Way compared to clusters which are thought to have formed in satellites accreted early in the Milky
Way's formation history. Using the ages of the GCs associated with the Sagittarius dwarf, we estimate
a virial radius crossing lookback time (infall time) of $9.3 \pm 1.8 Gyr$.
