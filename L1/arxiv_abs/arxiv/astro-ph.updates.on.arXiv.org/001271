We present the first simulation addressing the prospects of finding an electromagnetic (EM) counterpart
to gravitational wave detections (GW) during the early years of only two advanced interferometers.
The perils of such a search may have appeared insurmountable when considering the coarse ring-shaped
GW localizations spanning thousands of deg^2 using time-of-arrival information alone. We show
that leveraging the amplitude and phase information of the predicted GW signal narrows the localization
to arcs with a median area of only ~250 deg^2, thereby making an EM search tractable. Based on the locations
and orientations of the two LIGO detectors, we find that the GW sensitivity is limited to one polarization
and thus to only two sky quadrants. Thus, the rates of GW events with two interferometers is only ~40%
of the rate with three interferometers of similar sensitivity. Another important implication
of the sky quadrant bias is that EM observatories in North America and Southern Africa would be able
to systematically respond to GW triggers several hours sooner than Russia and Chile. Given the larger
sky areas and the relative proximity of detected mergers, 1m-class telescopes with very wide-field
cameras are well positioned for the challenge of finding an EM counterpart. Identification of the
EM counterpart amidst the even larger numbers of false positives further underscores the importance
of building a comprehensive catalog of foreground stellar sources, background AGN and potential
host galaxies in the local universe.
