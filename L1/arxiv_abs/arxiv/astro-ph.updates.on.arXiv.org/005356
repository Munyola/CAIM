We present a new perturbative approach to "constrained Ly$\alpha$ radiative transfer'" (RT) through
the circum- and inter-galactic medium (CGM and IGM). We constrain the HI content and kinematics
of the CGM and IGM in a physically motivated model, using the galaxy-Ly$\alpha$ forest clustering
data from spectroscopic galaxy surveys in QSO fields at $z\sim2-3$. This enables us to quantify
the impact of the CGM/IGM on Ly$\alpha$ emission in an observationally constrained, realistic
cosmological environment. Our model predicts that the CGM and IGM at these redshifts transmit $\approx80~\%$
of Ly$\alpha$ photons after having escaped from galaxies. This implies that while the inter-stellar
medium primarily regulates Ly$\alpha$ escape, the CGM has a non-negligible impact on the observed
Ly$\alpha$ line properties and the inferred Ly$\alpha$ escape fraction, even at $z\sim 2-3$. Ly$\alpha$
scattering in the CGM and IGM further introduces an environmental dependence in the (apparent)
Ly$\alpha$ escape fraction, and the observed population of Ly$\alpha$ emitting galaxies: the
CGM/IGM more strongly suppresses direct Ly$\alpha$ emission from galaxies in overdense regions
in the Universe, and redistributes this emission into brighter Ly$\alpha$ haloes. The resulting
mean surface brightness profile of the Ly$\alpha$ haloes is generally found to be a power-law $\propto
r^{-2.4}$. Our results demonstrate how (integral field) spectroscopic surveys of galaxies in
QSO fields constrain circumgalactic Ly$\alpha$ RT, and we discuss the potential of these models
for studying CGM physics, reionization and cosmology.
