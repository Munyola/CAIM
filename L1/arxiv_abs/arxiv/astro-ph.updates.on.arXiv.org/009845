The Panoramic Imaging Survey of Centaurus and Sculptor (PISCeS) is constructing a wide-field map
of the resolved stellar populations in the extended halos of these two nearby, prominent galaxies.
We present new Magellan/Megacam imaging of a $\sim3$ deg$^2$ area around Centaurus A (Cen A), which
filled in much of our coverage to its south, leaving a nearly complete halo map out to a projected radius
of $\sim$150 kpc and allowing us to identify two new resolved dwarf galaxies. We have additionally
obtained deep Hubble Space Telescope (HST) optical imaging of eleven out of the thirteen candidate
dwarf galaxies identified around Cen A and presented in Crnojevi\'c et al. (2016): seven are confirmed
to be satellites of Cen A, while four are found to be background galaxies. We derive accurate distances,
structural parameters, luminosities and photometric metallicities for the seven candidates
confirmed by our HST/ACS imaging. We further study the stellar population along the $\sim$60 kpc
long (in projection) stream associated with Dw3, which likely had an initial brightness of $M_{V}$$\sim$$-$15
and shows evidence for a metallicity gradient along its length. Using the total sample of eleven
dwarf satellites discovered by the PISCeS survey, as well as thirteen brighter previously known
satellites of Cen A, we present a revised galaxy luminosity function for the Cen A group down to a limiting
magnitude of $M_V\sim-8$, which has a slope of $-1.14\pm0.17$, comparable to that seen in the Local
Group and in other nearby groups of galaxies.
