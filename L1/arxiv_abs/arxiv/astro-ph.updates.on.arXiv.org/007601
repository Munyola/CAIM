We have catalogued 196 filament oscillations from the GONG $H{\alpha}$ network data during several
months near the maximum of solar cycle 24 (January - June 2014). Selected examples from the catalog
are described in detail, along with our statistical analyses of all events. Oscillations were classified
according to their velocity amplitude: 106 small-amplitude oscillations (SAOs), with velocities
$<10\mathrm{\, km \; s^{-1}}$, and 90 large-amplitude oscillations (LAOs), with velocities $>10\mathrm{\,
km \; s^{-1}}$. Both SAOs and LAOs are common, with one event of each class every two days on the visible
side of the Sun. For nearly half of the events we identified their apparent trigger. The period distribution
has a mean value of 58$\pm$15 min for both types of oscillations. The distribution of the damping
time per period peaks at $\tau/P=1.75$ and $1.25$ for SAOs and LAOs respectively. We confirmed that
LAO damping rates depend nonlinearly on the oscillation velocity. The angle between the direction
of motion and the filament spine has a distribution centered at $27^\circ$ for all filament types.
This angle agrees with the observed direction of filament-channel magnetic fields, indicating
that most of the catalogued events are longitudinal (i.e., undergo field-aligned motions). We
applied seismology to determine the average radius of curvature in the magnetic dips, $R\approx89$
Mm, and the average minimum magnetic-field strength, $B\approx16$ G. The catalog is available
to the community online, and is intended to be expanded to cover at least 1 solar cycle.
