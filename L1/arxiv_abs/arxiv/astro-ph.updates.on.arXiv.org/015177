The tomographic AP method is so far the best method in separating the Alcock-Paczynski (AP) signal
from the redshift space distortion (RSD) effects and deriving powerful constraints on cosmological
parameters using the $\lesssim40h^{-1}\ \rm Mpc$ clustering region. To guarantee that the method
can be safely applied to the future large scale structure (LSS) surveys, we perform a detailed study
on the systematics of the method. The major contribution of the systematics comes from the non-zero
redshift evolution of the RSD effects. It leads to non-negligible redshift evolution in the clustering
anisotropy, which is quantified by $\hat\xi_{\Delta s}(\mu,z)$ in our analysis, and estimated
using the BigMultidark N-body and COLA simulation samples. We find about 5\%/10\% evolution when
comparing the $\hat\xi_{\Delta s}(\mu,z)$ measured as $z=0.5$/$z=1$ to the measurements at $z=0$.
The inaccuracy of COLA is 5-10 times smaller than the intrinsic systematics, indicating that using
it to estimate the systematics is good enough. In addition, we find the magnitude of systematics
significantly increases if we enlarge the clustering scale to $40-150\ h^{-1}\ \rm Mpc$, indicating
that using the $\lesssim40h^{-1}\ \rm Mpc$ region is an optimal choice. Finally, we test the effect
of halo bias, and find $\lesssim$1.5\% change in $\hat\xi_{\Delta s}$ when varying the halo mass
within the range of $2\times 10^{12}$ to $10^{14}$ $M_{\odot}$. We will perform more studies to
achieve an accurate and efficient estimation of the systematics in redshift range $z=0-1.5$.
