In the hierarchical theory of galaxy formation, a galaxy overdensity is a hallmark of a massive cosmic
structure. However, it is less well understood how different types of galaxies trace the underlying
large-scale structure. Motivated by the discovery of a z=3.13 protocluster, we examine how the
same structure is populated by Ly$\alpha$-emitting galaxies (LAEs). To this end, we have undertaken
a deep narrow-band imaging survey sampling Ly$\alpha$ emission at this redshift. Of the 93 LAE candidates
within a 36'x36'~(70x70~Mpc^2) field, 21 galaxies form a significant surface overdensity (delta_g=3.3+/-0.9),
which is spatially segregated from the Lyman break galaxy (LBG) overdensity. One possible interpretation
is that they trace two separate structures of comparable masses (~ 10^{15}M_sun) where the latter
is hosted by a halo assembled at an earlier time. We speculate that the dearth of LAEs in the LBG overdensity
region may signal the role of halo assembly bias in galaxy formation, which would suggest that different
search techniques may be biased accordingly to the formation age or dynamical state of the host halo.
The median Ly$\alpha$- and UV luminosity is 30--70\% higher for the protocluster LAEs relative
to the field. This difference cannot be explained by the galaxy overdensity alone, and may require
a top-heavy mass function, higher star formation efficiency for protocluster halos, or suppression
of galaxy formation in low-mass halos. A luminous Ly$\alpha$ blob and an ultramassive galaxy found
in this region paint a picture consistent with the expected early growth of galaxies in clusters.
