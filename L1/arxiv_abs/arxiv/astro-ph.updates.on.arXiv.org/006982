The cosmic infrared background (CIB) contains emissions accumulated over the entire history of
the Universe, including from objects inaccessible to individual telescopic studies. The near-IR
(~1-10 mic) part of the CIB, and its fluctuations, reflects emissions from nucleosynthetic sources
and gravitationally accreting black holes (BHs). If known galaxies are removed to sufficient depths
the source-subtracted CIB fluctuations at near-IR can reveal sources present in the first-stars-era
and possibly new stellar populations at more recent times. This review discusses the recent progress
in this newly emerging field which identified, with new data and methodology, significant source-subtracted
CIB fluctuations substantially in excess of what can be produced by remaining known galaxies. The
CIB fluctuations further appear coherent with unresolved cosmic X-ray background (CXB) indicating
a very high fraction of BHs among the new sources producing the CIB fluctuations. These observations
have led to intensive theoretical efforts to explain the measurements and their properties. While
current experimental configurations have limitations in decisively probing these theories,
their potentially remarkable implications will be tested in the upcoming CIB measurements with
the ESA's Euclid dark energy mission. We describe the goals and methodologies of LIBRAE (Looking
at Infrared Background Radiation with Euclid), a NASA-selected project for CIB science with Euclid,
which has the potential for transforming the field into a new area of precision cosmology.
