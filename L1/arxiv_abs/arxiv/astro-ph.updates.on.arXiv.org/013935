We present ALMA CO(1-0) observations toward the dust lane of the nearest elliptical and radio galaxy,
NGC 5128 (Centaurus A), with high angular resolution ($\sim$ 1 arcsec, or 18 pc), including information
from large to small spatial scales and total flux. We find a total molecular gas mass of 1.6$\times$10$^9$
$M_\odot$ and we reveal the presence of filamentary components more extended than previously seen,
up to a radius of 4 kpc. We find that the global star formation rate is $\sim$1 \Msol yr$^{-1}$, which
yields a star formation efficiency (SFE) of 0.6 Gyr$^{-1}$ (depletion time $\tau =$1.5 Gyr), similar
to those in disk galaxies. We show the most detailed view to date (40\,pc resolution) of the relation
between molecular gas and star formation within the stellar component of an elliptical galaxy,
from several kpc scale to the circumnuclear region close to the powerful radio jet. Although on average
the SFEs are similar to those of spiral galaxies, the circumnuclear disk (CND) presents SFEs of 0.3
Gyr$^{-1}$, lower by a factor of 4 than the outer disk. The low SFE in the CND is in contrast to the high
SFEs found in the literature for the circumnuclear regions of some nearby disk galaxies with nuclear
activity, probably as a result of larger shear motions and longer AGN feedback. The higher SFEs in
the outer disk suggests that only central molecular gas or filaments with sufficient density and
strong shear motions will remain in $\sim$1 Gyr, which will later result in the compact molecular
distributions and low SFEs usually seen in other giant ellipticals with cold gas.
