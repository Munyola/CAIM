We present an investigation of long-term modulation in the X-ray light curves of five little-studied
candidate high-mass X-ray binaries using the Swift Burst Alert Telescope. IGR J14488-5942 and
AX J1700.2-4220 show strong modulation at periods of 49.6 and 44 days, respectively, which are interpreted
as orbital periods of Be star systems. For IGR J14488-5942, observations with Swift X-ray Telescope
show a hint of pulsations at 33.4 s. For AX J1700.2-4220, 54 s pulsations were previously found with
XMM. Swift J1816.7-1613 exhibits complicated behavior. The strongest peak in the power spectrum
is at a period near 150 days, but this conflicts with a determination of a period of 118.5 days by La
Parola et al. (2014). AX J1820.5-1434 has been proposed to exhibit modulation near 54 days, but the
extended BAT observations suggest modulation at slightly longer than double this at approximately
111 days. There appears to be a long-term change in the shape of the modulation near 111 days, which
may explain the apparent discrepancy. The X-ray pulsar XTE J1906+090, which was previously proposed
to be a Be star system with an orbital period of ~30 days from pulse timing, shows peaks in the power
spectrum at 81 and 173 days. The origins of these periods are unclear, although they might be the orbital
period and a superorbital period respectively. For all five sources, the long-term variability,
together with the combination of orbital and proposed pulse periods, suggests that the sources
contain Be star mass donors.
