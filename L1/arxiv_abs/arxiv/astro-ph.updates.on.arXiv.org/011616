We performed statistical and event studies of linear polarization in the H$\alpha$ line during
solar flares. The statistical study revealed that, among 71 H$\alpha$ flares analyzed, including
64 GOES flares, only one event shows significant linear polarization signals. Such an infrequent
occurrence of significant linear polarization in solar flares is consistent with the result by
Bianda et al. (2005), who studied 30 flares and found no polarization signals. In the event showing
the significant polarization, the maximum degree of linear polarization was 1.16$\pm$0.06\%,
and the average direction of the polarization deviated by -142.5$\pm$6.0 degrees from the solar
north. The observed polarization degrees and the directions are consistent with the preceding
reports (e.g. Henoux et al. 1990; Emslie et al. 2000; Hanaoka 2003). These strong linear polarization
signals did not appear at major flare ribbons, nor did they correlate with either hard or soft X-ray
emissions temporally or spatially. Instead they appeared at a minor flare kernel, which corresponds
to one of the footpoints of a coronal loop. The active region caused coronal dimming after the soft
X-ray peak. The observed flare show no direct evidence that the linear polarization is produced
by high energy particles, which are often considered to generate the polarization. On the other
hand, our study suggests the possibility that coronal mass ejections, which have been often observed
in flares showing linear polarization signals, play an important role for exciting linear polarization
at H$\alpha$ flare kernels.
