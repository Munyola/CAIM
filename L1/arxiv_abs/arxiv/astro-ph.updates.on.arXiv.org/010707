The field of Fast Radio Burst (FRB) science is currently thriving and growing rapidly. The lines
of active investigation include theoretical and observational aspects of these enigmatic millisecond
radio signals. These pursuits are for the most part intertwined so that each keeps the other in check,
characteristic of the healthy state of the field. The immediate future for FRB science is full of
promise --- we will in the next few years see two orders of magnitude more FRBs discovered by the now
diverse group of instruments spread across the globe involved in these efforts. This increased
crop, and the increased information obtained per event, will allow a number of fundamental questions
to be answered, and FRBs' potential as astrophysical and cosmological tools to be exploited. Questions
as to the exact detailed nature of FRB progenitors and whether or not there are one or more types of
progenitor will be answered. Questions as to source counts, the luminosity distribution and cosmological
density of FRBs will also be addressed. Looking further ahead, applications involving FRBs at the
highest redshifts look set to be a major focus of the field. The potential exists to evolve to a point
where statistically robust cosmological tests, orthogonal to those already undertaken in other
ways, will be achieved. Related work into FRB foregrounds, as well as how to identify new events in
ever more challenging radio-frequency interference environments, also appear likely avenues
for extensive investigations in the coming years.
