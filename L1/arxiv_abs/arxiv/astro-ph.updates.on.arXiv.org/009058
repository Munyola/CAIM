To our knowledge, R Mon is the only B0 star in which a gaseous Keplerian disk has been detected. However,
there is some controversy about the spectral type of R Mon. Some authors propose that it could be a
later B8e star, where disks are more common. We have re-evaluated the spectral type of R Mon using
the available continuum data and UVES emission lines. We used a power-law disk model to fit previous
12 CO 1-0 and 2-1 interferometric observations and the PACS CO data to investigate the disk structure.
Interferometric detections of 13 CO J=1-0, HCO+ 1-0, and CN 1-0 lines using the IRAM Plateau de Bure
Interferometer (PdBI) are presented. The HCN 1-0 line was not detected. Our analysis confirms that
R Mon is a B0 star. The disk model compatible with the 12 CO 1-0 and 2-1 interferometric observations
falls short of predicting the observed fluxes of the 14<Ju<31 PACS lines; this is consistent with
the scenario in which some contribution to these lines is coming from a warm envelope and/or UV-illuminated
outflow walls. More interestingly, the upper limits to the fluxes of the Ju>31 CO lines suggest the
existence of a region empty of CO at R<20 au in the proto-planetary disk. The intense emission of the
HCO+ and CN lines shows the strong influence of UV photons on gas chemistry. The observations gathered
in this paper are consistent with the presence around R Mon of a transition disk with a cavity about
20 au. This size is similar to the photoevaporation radius that supports the interpretation that
UV photoevaporation is main disk dispersal mechanism in massive stars
