Radio astronomical observation below 30 MHz is hampered by the refraction and absorption of the
ionosphere, and the radio frequency interference (RFI), so far high angular resolution sky intensity
map is not available. An interferometer array on lunar orbit provides a perfect observatory in this
frequency band: it is out of the ionosphere and the Moon helps to block the RFIs from the Earth. The
satellites can make observations on the far side of the Moon and then send back the data on the near
side part of the orbit. However, for such array the traditional imaging algorithm is not applicable:
the field of view is very wide (almost whole sky), and for baselines distributed on a plane, there
is a mirror symmetry between the two sides of the plane. A further complication is that for each baseline,
the Moon blocks part of the sky, but as the satellites orbit the Moon, both the direction of the baseline
and the blocked sky change, so even imaging algorithms which can deal with non-coplanar baseline
may not work in this case. Here we present an imaging algorithm based on solving the linear mapping
equations relating the sky intensity to the visibilities. We show that the mirror symmetry can be
broken by the three dimensional baseline distribution generated naturally by the precession of
the orbital plane of the satellites. The algorithm is applicable and good maps could be reconstructed,
even though for each baseline the sky blocking by the Moon is different. We also investigate how the
map-making is affected by inhomogeneous baseline distributions.
