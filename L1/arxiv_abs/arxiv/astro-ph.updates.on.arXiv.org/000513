We carry out an independent search of Kepler photometry for small transiting planets with sizes
0.5--8.0 times that of Earth and orbital periods between 5 and 50 days, with the goal of measuring
the fraction of stars harboring such planets. We use a new transit search algorithm, TERRA, optimized
to detect small planets. We restrict our stellar sample to include the 12,000 stars having the lowest
photometric noise in the Kepler survey. We report 129 planet candidates having radii less than 6
Earth-radii found in 3 years of Kepler photometry. Forty-seven of these candidates are not in Batalha
et al. (2012). We gather Keck HIRES spectra for the majority of these targets leading to precise stellar
radii and hence precise planet radii. We inject synthetic dimmings from mock transiting planets
into the actual Kepler photometry and analyze that photometry with TERRA to assess detection completeness.
We compute the occurrence of planets as a function of planet radius and period, correcting for the
detection completeness. The resulting distribution of planet sizes exhibits a power law rise in
occurrence from 5.7 Earth-radii down to 2 Earth-radii, as found in Howard et al. (2012). That rise
clearly ends at 2 Earth-radii. The occurrence of planets is consistent with constant from 2 Earth-radii
toward 1 Earth-radius. This unexpected plateau in planet occurrence at 2 Earth-radii suggests
distinct planet formation processes for planets above and below 2 Earth-radii. We find 15.1% of
solar type stars---roughly one in six---has a 1--2 Earth-radii planet with P = 5--50 days.
