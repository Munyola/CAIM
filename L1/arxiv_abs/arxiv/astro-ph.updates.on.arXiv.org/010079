Notwithstanding manufacture of complex organic molecules from impacting cometary and icy planet
surface analogues is well-established, dust grain-grain collisions driven by turbulence in interstellar
or circumstellar regions may represent a parallel chemical route toward the shock synthesis of
prebiotically relevant species. Here we report on a study, based on the multi-scale shock-compression
technique combined with ab initio molecular dynamics approaches, where the shock-waves-driven
chemistry of mutually colliding isocyanic acid (HNCO) containing icy grains has been simulated
by first-principles. At the shock wave velocity threshold triggering the chemical transformation
of the sample (7 km/s), formamide is the first synthesized species representing thus the spring-board
for the further complexification of the system. In addition, upon increasing the shock impact velocity,
formamide is formed in progressively larger amounts. More interestingly, at the highest velocity
considered (10 km/s), impacts drive the production of diverse carbon-carbon bonded species. In
addition to glycine, the building block of alanine (i.e., ethanimine) and one of the major components
of a plethora of amino-acids including, e.g., asparagine, cysteine, and leucine (i.e., vinylamine)
have been detected after shock compression of samples containing the most widespread molecule
in the universe (H2) and the simplest compound bearing all the primary biogenic elements (HNCO).
The present results indicate novel chemical pathways toward the chemical complexity typical of
interstellar and circumstellar regions.
