The Upsilon Andromedae system is the first exoplanetary system to have the relative inclination
of two planets' orbital planes directly measured, and therefore offers our first window into the
3-dimensional configurations of planetary systems. We present, for the first time, full 3-dimensional,
dynamically stable configurations for the 3 planets of the system consistent with all observational
constraints. While the outer 2 planets, c and d, are inclined by about 30 degrees, the inner planet's
orbital plane has not been detected. We use N-body simulations to search for stable 3-planet configurations
that are consistent with the combined radial velocity and astrometric solution. We find that only
10 trials out of 1000 are robustly stable on 100 Myr timescales, or about 8 billion orbits of planet
b. Planet b's orbit must lie near the invariable plane of planets c and d, but can be either prograde
or retrograde. These solutions predict b's mass is in the range 2 - 9 $M_{Jup}$ and has an inclination
angle from the sky plane of less than 25 degrees. Combined with brightness variations in the combined
star/planet light curve ("phase curve"), our results imply that planet b's radius is about 1.8 $R_{Jup}$,
relatively large for a planet of its age. However, the eccentricity of b in several of our stable solutions
reaches values greater than 0.1, generating upwards of $10^{19}$ watts in the interior of the planet
via tidal dissipation, possibly inflating the radius to an amount consistent with phase curve observations.
