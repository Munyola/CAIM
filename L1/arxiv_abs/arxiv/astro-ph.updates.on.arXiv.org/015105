We examine the formation of dark matter (DM) cores in dwarf galaxies simulated with the EAGLE model
of galaxy formation. As in earlier work, we find that the star formation (SF) gas density threshold
($\rho_{\rm th}$) plays a critical role. At low thresholds (LT), gas is unable to reach densities
high enough to dominate the gravitational potential before being dispersed by feedback from supernovae.
LT runs show little effect on the inner DM profile, even in systems with extended and bursty SF, two
ingredients often cited as critical for core formation. For higher thresholds, gas is able to dominate
the gravitational potential before being ejected by feedback. This can lead to a substantial reduction
in the inner DM content, but only if the gas is gravitationally important over an extended period
of time, allowing the halo to contract before gas removal. Rapid assembly and removal of gas in short
SF bursts is less effective at altering the inner DM content. Subsequent gas accretion may draw DM
back in and reform a cusp, unless SF is bursty enough to prevent it, preserving the core. Thus, for
the EAGLE SF+feedback model, there is no simple relation between core formation and SF history,
contrary to recent claims. The dependence of the inner DM content of dwarfs on $\rho_{\rm th}$ hinders
robust predictions and the interpretation of observations. A simulation of a $(12 \rm \ Mpc)^3$
volume with high $\rho_{\rm th}$ results in dwarfs with sizeable cores over a limited halo mass range,
but with insufficient variety in mass profiles to explain the observed diversity of dwarf galaxy
rotation curves.
