We study the evolution of star-forming galaxies with $10^{10} M_\odot<M_*<10^{11.6} M_\odot$
over the redshift range of 0.7<z<1.2 using the emission line galaxies (ELGs) in the extended Baryon
Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS). By applying the incomplete conditional stellar mass
function (ICSMF) model proposed in Guo et al. (2018), we simultaneously constrain the sample completeness,
the stellar--halo mass relation (SHMR) and the quenched galaxy fraction. We obtain the intrinsic
stellar mass functions for star-forming galaxies in the redshift bins of 0.7<z<0.8, 0.8<z<0.9,
0.9<z<1.0 and 1.0<z<1.2, as well as the stellar mass function for total galaxies in the redshift
bin of 0.7<z<0.8. We find that the eBOSS ELG sample only selects about 1% to 10% of the star-forming
galaxy population at the different redshifts, with the lower redshift samples to be more complete.
There is only weak evolution in the SHMR of the ELGs from z=1.2 to z=0.7, as well as the intrinsic galaxy
stellar mass functions for lower-mass galaxies of $M_*<10^{11} M_\odot$. There is significant
decrease of the stellar mass function for star-forming galaxies with redshift at the massive end.
Our best-fitting models show that the central ELGs at these redshifts live in halos of mass $M\sim10^{12}
M_\odot$ while the satellite ELGs occupy slightly more massive halos of $M\sim10^{12.6} M_\odot$.
The average satellite fraction of the observed ELGs varies from 13% to 17%, with the galaxy bias increasing
from 1.1 to 1.4 from z=0.7 to 1.2.
