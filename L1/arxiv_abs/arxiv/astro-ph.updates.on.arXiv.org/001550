The hierarchical galaxy formation picture suggests that super massive black holes (MBHs) observed
in galactic nuclei today have grown from coalescence of massive black hole binaries (MBHB) after
galaxy merging. Once the components of a MBHB become gravitationally bound, strong three-body
encounters between the MBHB and stars dominate its evolution in a "dry" gas free environment, and
change the MBHB's energy and angular momentum (semi-major axis, eccentricity and orientation).
Here we present high accuracy direct N-body simulations of spherical and axisymmetric (rotating)
galactic nuclei with order a million stars and two massive black holes that are initially unbound.
We analyze the properties of the ejected stars due to slingshot effects from three-body encounters
with the MBHB in detail. Previous studies have investigated the eccentricity and energy changes
of MBHs using approximate models or Monte-Carlo three body scatterings. We find general agreement
with the average results of previous semi-analytic models for spherical galactic nuclei, but our
results show a large statistical variation. Our new results show many more phase space details of
how the process works, and also show the influence of stellar system rotation on the process. We detect
that the angle between the orbital plane of the MBHBs and that of the stellar system (when it rotates)
influences the phase-space properties of the ejected stars. We also find that massive MBHB tend
to switch stars with counter-rotating orbits into co-rotating orbits during their interactions.
