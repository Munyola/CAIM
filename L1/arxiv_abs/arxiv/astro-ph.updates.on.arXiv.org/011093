Nearly half a century has passed since the initial indications that stellar rotation slows while
chromospheric activity weakens with a power-law dependence on age, the so-called Skumanich relations.
Subsequent characterization of the mass-dependence of this behavior up to the age of the Sun led
to the advent of gyrochronology, which uses the rotation rate of a star to infer its age from an empirical
calibration. The efficacy of the method relies on predictable angular momentum loss from a stellar
wind entrained in the large-scale magnetic field produced by global dynamo action. Recent observational
evidence suggests that the global dynamo begins to shut down near the middle of a star's main-sequence
lifetime, leading to a disruption in the production of large-scale magnetic field, a dramatic reduction
in angular momentum loss, and a breakdown of gyrochronology relations. For solar-type stars this
transition appears to occur near the age of the Sun, when rotation becomes too slow to imprint Coriolis
forces on the global convective patterns, reducing the shear induced by differential rotation,
and disrupting the large-scale dynamo. We use data from Barnes (2007) to reveal the signature of
this transition in the observations that were originally used to validate gyrochronology. We propose
that chromospheric activity may ultimately provide a more reliable age indicator for older stars,
and we suggest that asteroseismology can be used to help calibrate activity-age relations for field
stars beyond the middle of their main-sequence lifetimes.
