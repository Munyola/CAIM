We present integrated pulse profiles at 5~GHz for 71 pulsars, including eight millisecond pulsars
(MSPs), obtained using the Shanghai Tian Ma Radio Telescope (TMRT). Mean flux densities and pulse
widths are measured. For 19 normal pulsars and one MSP, these are the first detections at 5~GHz and
for a further 19, including five MPSs, the profiles have a better signal-to-noise ratio than previous
observations. Mean flux density spectra between 400~MHz and 9~GHz are presented for 27 pulsars
and correlations of power-law spectral index are found with characteristic age, radio pseudo-luminosity
and spin-down luminosity. Mode changing was detected in five pulsars. The separation between the
main pulse and interpulse is shown to be frequency independent for six pulsars but a frequency dependence
of the relative intensity of the main pulse and interpulse is found. The frequency dependence of
component separations is investigated for 20 pulsars and three groups are found: in seven cases
the separation between the outmost leading and trailing components decreases with frequency,
roughly in agreement with radius-to-frequency mapping; in eleven cases the separation is nearly
constant; in the remain two cases the separation between the outmost components increases with
frequency. We obtain the correlations of pulse widths with pulsar period and estimate the core widths
of 23 multi-component profiles and conal widths of 17 multi-component profiles at 5.0~GHz using
Gaussian fitting and discuss the width-period relationship at 5~GHz compared with the results
at at 1.0~GHz and 8.6~GHz.
