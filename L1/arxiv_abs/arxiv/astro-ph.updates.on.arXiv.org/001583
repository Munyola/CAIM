C$^+$ is a critical constituent of many regions of the interstellar medium, as it can be a major reservoir
of carbon and, under a wide range of conditions, the dominant gas coolant. Emission from its 158$\mu$m
fine structure line is used to trace the structure of photon dominated regions in the Milky Way and
is often employed as a measure of the star formation rate in external galaxies. Under most conditions,
the emission from the single [CII] line is proportional to the collisional excitation rate coefficient.
We here used improved calculations of the deexcitation rate of [CII] by collisions with H$_2$ to
calculate more accurate expressions for interstellar C$^+$ fine structure emission, its critical
density, and its cooling rate. The collision rates in the new quantum calculation are $\sim$ 25%
larger than those previously available, and narrow the difference between rates for excitation
by atomic and molecular hydrogen. This results in [CII] excitation being quasi-independent of
the molecular fraction and thus dependent only on the total hydrogen particle density. A convenient
expression for the cooling rate at temperatures between 20 K and 400 K, assuming an LTE H$_2$ ortho
to para ration is $\Lambda ({\rm LTE~OPR}) = \left(11.5 + 4.0\,e^{-100\,\mathrm K/T^{\rm kin}}\right)\;e^{-91.25\,\mathrm
K/T^{\rm kin}}\,n ({\rm C}^{+})\,n({\rm H}_2)\times 10^{-24}\;{\rm ergs}~{\rm cm}^{-3}~{\rm
s}^{-1}$. The present work should allow more accurate and convenient analysis of the [\CII] line
emission and its cooling.
