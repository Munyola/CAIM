Non-axisymmetries in the Galactic potential (spiral arms and bar) induce kinematic groups such
as the Hercules stream. Assuming that Hercules is caused by the effects of the Outer Lindblad Resonance
of the Galactic bar, we model analytically its properties as a function of position in the Galaxy
and its dependence on the bar's pattern speed and orientation. Using data from the RAVE survey we
find that the azimuthal velocity of the Hercules structure decreases as a function of Galactocentric
radius, in a manner consistent with our analytical model. This allows us to obtain new estimates
of the parameters of the Milky Way's bar. The combined likelihood function of the bar's pattern speed
and angle has its maximum for a pattern speed of $\Omega_b=(1.89 \pm 0.08) \times \Omega_0$ where
$\Omega_0$ is the local circular frequency. Assuming a Solar radius of 8.05 kpc and a local circular
velocity of 238 km/s, this corresponds to $\Omega_b=56\pm 2$ km/s/kpc. On the other hand, the bar's
orientation $\phi_b$ cannot be constrained with the available data. In fact, the likelihood function
shows that a tight correlation exists between the pattern speed and the orientation, implying that
a better description of our best fit results is given by the linear relation $\Omega_b/\Omega_0=1.91
+ 0.0044[\phi_b(\deg)-48]$, with standard deviation of 0.02. For example, for an angle of $\phi_b=30\deg$
the pattern speed is $54.0\pm0.5$ km/s/kpc. These results are not very sensitive to the other Galactic
parameters such as the circular velocity curve or the peculiar motion of the Sun, and are robust to
biases in distance.
