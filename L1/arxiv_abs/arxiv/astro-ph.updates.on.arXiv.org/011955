One of the fundamental challenges for quantum cosmology is to explain the emergence of our macroscopic
Universe from physics at the Planck scale. In the group field theory (GFT) approach to quantum gravity,
such a macroscopic universe results from the formation of a "condensate" of fundamentally discrete
degrees of freedom. It has been shown that the effective dynamics of such GFT condensates follows
the classical Friedmann dynamics at late times, while avoiding the classical singularity by a bounce
akin to the one of loop quantum cosmology (LQC). It was also shown how quantum fluctuations in a GFT
condensate provide an initial power spectrum of volume fluctuations around exact homogeneity.
Here we connect the results for quantum fluctuations in GFT to the usual formalism for cosmological
perturbations within quantum field theory in curved spacetime. We consider a bouncing universe
filled with a massless scalar field, in which perturbations are generated by vacuum fluctuations
in the contracting phase. Matching conditions at the bounce are provided by working within LQC.
We then compare the results to the GFT condensate scenario for quantum gravity with massless scalar
matter. Here, instead, an initial quantum phase described by a GFT condensate generates initial
scalar perturbations through quantum fluctuations. We show general agreement in the predictions
of both approaches, suggesting that GFT condensates can provide a physical mechanism for the emergence
of a slightly inhomogeneous universe from full quantum gravity.
