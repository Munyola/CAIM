Context. Large spectroscopic surveys open the way to explore our Galaxy. In order to use the data
from these surveys to understand the Galactic stellar population, we need to be sure that stars contained
in a survey are a representative subset of the underlying population. Without the selection function
taken into account, the results might reflect the properties of the selection function rather than
those of the underlying stellar population. Aims. In this work, we introduce a method to estimate
the selection function for a given spectroscopic survey. We apply this method to a large sample of
public spectroscopic surveys. Methods. We apply a median division binning algorithm to bin observed
stars in the colour-magnitude space. This approach produces lower uncertainties and lower biases
of the selection function estimate as compared to traditionally used 2D-histograms. We run a set
of simulations to verify the method and calibrate the one free parameter it contains. These simulations
allow us to test the precision and accuracy of the method. Results. We produce and publish estimated
values and uncertainties of selection functions for a large sample of public spectroscopic surveys.
We publicly release the code used to produce the selection function estimates. Conclusions. The
effect of the selection function on distance modulus and metallicity distributions of stars in
surveys is important for surveys with small and largely inhomogeneous spatial coverage. For surveys
with contiguous spatial coverage the effect of the selection function is almost negligible.
