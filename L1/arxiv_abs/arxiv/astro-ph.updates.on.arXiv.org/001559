The relationships between galaxies of intermediate stellar mass and moderate luminosity active
galactic nuclei (AGNs) at 1<z<3 are investigated with the Galaxy Mass Assembly ultra-deep
Spectroscopic Survey (GMASS) sample complemented with public data in the GOODS-South field. Using
X-ray data, hidden AGNs are identified in unsuspected star-forming galaxies with no apparent signs
of non-stellar activity. In the color-mass plane, two parallel trends emerge during the ~2 Gyr between
the average redshifts z~2.2 and z~1.3: while the red sequence becomes significantly more populated
by ellipticals, the majority of AGNs with L(2-10 keV)>10^42.3 erg s^-1 disappear from the blue
cloud/green valley where they were hosted predominantly by star-forming systems with disk and
irregular morphologies. These results are even clearer when the rest-frame colors are corrected
for dust reddening. At z~2.2, the ultraviolet spectra of active galaxies (including two Type 1 AGNs)
show possible gas outflows with velocities up to about -500 km s^-1 that are not observed neither
in inactive systems at the same redshift, nor at lower redshifts. Such outflows indicate the presence
of gas that can move faster than the escape velocities of active galaxies. These results suggest
that feedback from moderately luminous AGNs (logL_X<44.5 erg s^-1) played a key role at z>~2
by contributing to outflows capable of ejecting part of the interstellar medium and leading to a
rapid decrease in the star formation in host galaxies with stellar masses 10<logM<11 M_Sun.
