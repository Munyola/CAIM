Observational confirmation of hot accretion model predictions has been hindered by the challenge
to resolve spatially the Bondi radii of black holes with X-ray telescopes. Here, we use the Megasecond
Chandra X-ray Visionary Project (XVP) observation of the NGC~3115 supermassive black hole to place
the first direct observational constraints on the spatially and spectroscopically resolved structures
of the X-ray emitting gas inside the Bondi radius of a black hole. We measured temperature and density
profiles of the hot gas from a fraction out to tens of the Bondi radius (R_B = 2.4-4.8 arcsec = 112-224
pc). The projected temperature jumps significantly from ~0.3 keV beyond 5 arcsec to ~0.7 keV within
~4-5 arcsec, but then abruptly drops back to ~0.3 keV within ~3 arcsec. This is contrary to the expectation
that the temperature should rise toward the center for a radiatively inefficient accretion flow.
A hotter thermal component of ~1 keV inside 3 arcsec (~150 pc) is revealed using a two component thermal
model, with the cooler ~0.3 keV thermal component dominating the spectra. We argue that the softer
emission comes from diffuse gas physically located within $\sim 150$~pc from the black hole. The
density profile is broadly consistent with rho ~ r^{-1} within the Bondi radius for either the single
temperature or the two-temperature model. The X-ray data alone with physical reasoning argue against
the absence of a black hole, supporting that we are witnessing the onset of the gravitational influence
of the supermassive black hole.
