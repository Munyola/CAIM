We observed radio continuum emission in 27 local (D < 70 Mpc) star-forming galaxies with the Robert
C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope between 26 GHz and 40 GHz using the Caltech Continuum Backend. We obtained
detections for 22 of these galaxies at all four sub-bands and four more marginal detections by taking
the average flux across the entire bandwidth. This is the first detection (full or marginal) at these
frequencies for 22 of these galaxies. We fit spectral energy distributions (SEDs) for all of the
four-sub-band detections. For 14 of the galaxies, SEDs were best fit by a combination of thermal
free-free and nonthermal synchrotron components. Eight galaxies with four-sub-band detections
had steep spectra that were only fit by a single nonthermal component. Using these fits, we calculated
supernova rates, total number of equivalent O stars, and star formation rates within each ~23 arcsecond
beam. For unresolved galaxies, these physical properties characterize the galaxies' recent star
formation on a global scale. We confirm that the radio-far-infrared correlation holds for the unresolved
galaxies' total 33 GHz flux regardless of their thermal fractions, though the scatter on this correlation
is larger than that at 1.4 GHz. In addition, we found that for the unresolved galaxies, there is an
inverse relationship between the ratio of 33 GHz flux to total far-infrared flux and the steepness
of the galaxy's spectral index between 1.4 GHz and 33 GHz. This relationship could be an indicator
of the timescale of the observed episode of star formation.
