We develop a method for identifying a compact object in binary systems with astrometric measurements
and apply it to some binaries. Compact objects in some high-mass X-ray binaries and gamma-ray binaries
are unknown, which is responsible for the fact that emission mechanisms in such systems have not
yet confirmed. The accurate estimate of the mass of the compact object allows us to identify the compact
object in such systems. Astrometric measurements are expected to enable us to estimate the masses
of the compact objects in the binary systems via a determination of a binary orbit. We aim to evaluate
the possibility of the identification of the compact objects for some binary systems. We then calculate
probabilities that the compact object is correctly identified with astrometric observation (=
confidence level) by taking into account a dependence of the orbital shape on orbital parameters
and distributions of masses of white dwarfs, neutron stars, and black holes. We find that the astrometric
measurements with the precision of 70 $\mu$as for $\gamma$~Cas allows us to identify the compact
object at 99% confidence level if the compact object is a white dwarf with 0.6 M$_{\odot}$. In addition,
we can identify the compact object with the precision of 10 $\mu$as at 97% or larger confidence level
for LS~I~+61$^{\circ}$~303 and 99% or larger for HESS~J0632+057. These results imply that the
astrometric measurements with the 10-$\mu$as precision level can realize the identification
of compact objects for $\gamma$~Cas, LS~I~+61$^{\circ}$~303, and HESS~J0632+057.
