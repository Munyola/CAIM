Chemistry and kinematic studies can determine the origins of stellar population across the Milky
Way. The metallicity distribution function of the bulge indicates that it comprises multiple populations,
the more metal-poor end of which is particularly poorly understood. It is currently unknown if metal-poor
bulge stars ([Fe/H] $<$ -1 dex) are part of the stellar halo in the inner most region, or a distinct
bulge population or a combination of these. Cosmological simulations also indicate that the metal-poor
bulge stars may be the oldest stars in the Galaxy. In this study, we successfully target metal-poor
bulge stars selected using SkyMapper photometry. We determine the stellar parameters of 26 stars
and their elemental abundances for 22 elements using R$\sim$ 47,000 VLT/UVES spectra and contrast
their elemental properties with that of other Galactic stellar populations. We find that the elemental
abundances we derive for our metal-poor bulge stars have much lower overall scatter than typically
found in the halo. This indicates that these stars may be a distinct population confined to the bulge.
If these stars are, alternatively, part of the inner-most distribution of the halo, this indicates
that the halo is more chemically homogeneous at small Galactic radii than at large radii. We also
find two stars whose chemistry is consistent with second-generation globular cluster stars. This
paper is the first part of the Chemical Origins of Metal-poor Bulge Stars (COMBS) survey that will
chemo-dynamically characterize the metal-poor bulge population.
