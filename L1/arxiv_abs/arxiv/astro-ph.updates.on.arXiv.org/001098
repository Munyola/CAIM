We exploit the group environment of the CAmbridge Sloan Survey Of Wide ARcs in the skY (CASSOWARY)
z=0.3 lens J2158+0257 to measure the group dynamical mass as a complement to the central dynamical
and lensing mass constraints. Follow-up spectroscopy of candidate group members is performed
using VLT/FORS2. From the resulting N=21 confirmed members we measure the group dynamical mass
by calibrating an analytic tracer mass estimator with cosmological simulations. The luminosity
weighted line-of-sight velocity dispersion and the Einstein radius of the lens are used as mass
probes in the inner regions of the galaxy. Combining these three observational probes allows us
to independently constrain the mass and concentration of the dark matter halo, in addition to the
total stellar mass of the central galaxy. We find a dark matter halo in remarkably good agreement
with simulations (log_10 M_200/M_sun = 14.2 +/- 0.2, c_200 = 4.4 (+1.6, -1.4)) and a stellar mass-to-light
ratio which favors a Salpeter initial mass function ((M/L)* = 5.7 +/- 1.2). Our measurement of a normal
halo concentration suggests that there is no discrepancy between simulations and observations
at the group mass scale. This is in contrast to the cluster mass scale for which a number of studies
have claimed over-concentrated halos. While the halo mass is robustly determined, and the halo
concentration is not significantly affected by systematics, the resulting stellar mass-to-light
ratio is sensitive to the choice of stellar parameters, such as density profile and velocity anisotropy.
