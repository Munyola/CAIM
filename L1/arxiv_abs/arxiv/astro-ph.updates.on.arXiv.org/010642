The radio luminosity functions (RLFs) of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are traditionally measured
based on total emission, which doesn't reflect the current activity of the central black hole. The
increasing interest in compact radio cores of AGNs requires determination of the RLF based on core
emission (i.e., core RLF). In this work we have established a large sample (totaling 1207) of radio-loud
AGNs, mainly consisting of radio galaxies (RGs) and steep-spectrum radio quasars (SSRQs). Based
on the sample, we explore the relationship between core luminosity ($L_c$) and total luminosity
($L_t$) via a powerful statistical tool called "Copula". The conditional probability distribution
$p(\log L_{c} \mid \log L_{t})$ is obtained. We derive the core RLF as a convolution of $p(\log L_{c}
\mid \log L_{t})$ with the total RLF which was determined by previous work. We relate the separate
RG and SSRQ core RLFs via a relativistic beaming model and find that SSRQs have an average Lorentz
factor of $\gamma=9.84_{-2.50}^{+3.61}$, and that most are seen within $8^{\circ} \lesssim \theta
\lesssim 45^{\circ}$ of the jet axis. Compared with the total RLF which is mainly contributed by
extended emission, the core RLF shows a very weak luminosity-dependent evolution, with the number
density peaking around $z\thicksim 0.8$ for all luminosities. Differences between core and total
RLFs can be explained in a framework involving a combination of density and luminosity evolutions
where the cores have significantly weaker luminosity evolution than the extended emission.
