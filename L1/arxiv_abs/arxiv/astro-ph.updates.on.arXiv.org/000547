Context: Open clusters are very useful targets for examining possible trends in galactocentric
distance and age, especially when young and old open clusters are compared. Aims: We carried out
a detailed spectroscopic analysis to derive the chemical composition of seven red giants in the
young open cluster NGC 3114. Abundances of C, N, O, Li, Na, Mg, Al, Ca, Si, Ti, Ni, Cr, Y, Zr, La, Ce, and
Nd were obtained, as well as the carbon isotopic ratio. Methods: The atmospheric parameters of the
studied stars and their chemical abundances were determined using high-resolution optical spectroscopy.
We employed the local-thermodynamic-equilibrium model atmospheres of Kurucz and the spectral
analysis code MOOG. The abundances of the light elements were derived using the spectral synthesis
technique. Results: We found that NGC 3114 has a mean metallicity of [Fe/H] = -0.01+/-0.03. The isochrone
fit yielded a turn-off mass of 4.2 Msun. The [N/C] ratio is in good agreement with the models predicted
by first dredge-up. We found that two stars, HD 87479 and HD 304864, have high rotational velocities
of 15.0 km/s and 11.0 km/s; HD 87526 is a halo star and is not a member of NGC 3114. Conclusions: The carbon
and nitrogen abundance in NGC 3114 agree with the field and cluster giants. The oxygen abundance
in NGC 3114 is lower compared to the field giants. The [O/Fe] ratio is similar to the giants in young
clusters. We detected sodium enrichment in the analyzed cluster giants. As far as the other elements
are concerned, their [X/Fe] ratios follow the same trend seen in giants with the same metallicity.
