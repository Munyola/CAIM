The gas-phase metallicity of low-mass galaxies increases with increasing stellar mass ($M_\ast$)
and is nearly constant for high-mass galaxies. Theory suggests that this tight mass-metallicity
relationship is shaped by galactic outflows removing metal-enriched gas from galaxies. Here,
we observationally model the outflow metallicities of the warm outflowing phase from a sample of
seven local star-forming galaxies with stellar masses between 10$^{7}$-10$^{11}$ M$_\odot$.
We estimate the outflow metallicities using four weak rest-frame ultraviolet absorption lines,
the observed stellar continua, and photoionization models. The outflow metallicity is flat with
$M_\ast$, with a median metallicity of $1.0\pm0.6$ Z$_\odot$. The observed outflows are metal-enriched:
low and high-mass galaxies have outflow metallicities 10-50 and 2.6 times larger than their ISM
metallicities, respectively. The observed outflows are mainly composed of entrained ISM gas with
at most 22% of the metals directly coming from recent supernovae enrichment. The metal outflow rate
shallowly increases with $M_\ast$, as $M_\ast^{0.2 \pm 0.1}$, because the mass outflow rate shallow
increases with $M_\ast$. Finally, we normalize the metal outflow rate by the rate at which star formation
retains metals to calculate the metal-loading factor. The metal-loading factor inversely scales
with $M_\ast$. The normalization and scaling of the metal-loading factor agree with analytic expressions
that reproduce observed mass-metallicity relations. Galactic outflows fundamentally shape
the observed mass-metallicity relationship.
