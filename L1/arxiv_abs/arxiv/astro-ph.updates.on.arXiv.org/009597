With the recent discoveries of terrestrial planets around active M-dwarfs, destruction processes
masking the possible presence of life are receiving increased attention in the exoplanet community.
We investigate potential biosignatures of planets having Earth-like (N$_2$-O$_2$) atmospheres
orbiting in the habitable zone of the M-dwarf star AD Leo. These are bombarded by high energetic particles
which can create showers of secondary particles at the surface. We apply our cloud-free 1D climate-chemistry
model to study the influence of key particle shower parameters and chemical efficiencies of NOx
and HOx production from cosmic rays. We determine the effect of stellar radiation and cosmic rays
upon atmospheric composition, temperature, and spectral appearance. Despite strong stratospheric
O$_3$ destruction by cosmic rays, smog O$_3$ can significantly build up in the lower atmosphere
of our modeled planet around AD Leo related to low stellar UVB. N$_2$O abundances decrease with increasing
flaring energies but a sink reaction for N$_2$O with excited oxygen becomes weaker, stabilizing
its abundance. CH$_4$ is removed mainly by Cl in the upper atmosphere for strong flaring cases and
not via hydroxyl as is otherwise usually the case. Cosmic rays weaken the role of CH$_4$ in heating
the middle atmosphere so that H$_2$O absorption becomes more important. We additionally underline
the importance of HNO$_3$ as a possible marker for strong stellar particle showers. In a nutshell,
uncertainty in NOx and HOx production from cosmic rays significantly influences biosignature
abundances and spectral appearance.
