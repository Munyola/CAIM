It is generally accepted that the ion acoustic (IA) wave in plasmas containing ions and electrons
with the same temperature is of minor importance due to strong damping of the wave by hot resonant
ions. In this work it will be shown that the IA wave is susceptible to excitation even in plasmas with
hot ions when both an electromagnetic transverse wave and a background density gradient are present
in the plasma, and in addition the wave is in fact unstable (i.e., growing) in the case of permeating
homogeneous plasmas. The multi-component fluid theory is used to describe the IA wave susceptibility
for excitation in inhomogeneous plasmas and its coupling with electromagnetic waves. The growing
IA wave in permeating homogeneous plasmas is described by the kinetic theory. In plasmas with density
and temperature gradients the IA wave is effectively coupled with the electromagnetic waves. In
comparison to ordinary IA wave in homogeneous plasma, the Landau damping of the present wave is much
smaller, and to demonstrate this effect a simple but accurate fluid model is presented for the Landau
damping. In the case of permeating plasmas, a kinetic mechanism for the current-less IA wave instability
is presented, with a very low threshold for excitation as compared with ordinary electron-current-driven
kinetic instability. Such growing IA waves can effectively heat plasma in the upper solar atmosphere
by a stochastic heating mechanism presented in the work. The results of this work suggest that the
IA wave role in the heating of the solar atmosphere (chromosphere and corona) should be reexamined.
