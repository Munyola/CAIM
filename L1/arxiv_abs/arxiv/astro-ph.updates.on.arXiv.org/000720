The recent measurement of the gravitational redshifts of galaxies in galaxy clusters by Wojtak
et al. has opened a new observational window on dark matter and modified gravity. By stacking clusters
this determination effectively used the line of sight distortion of the cross-correlation function
of massive galaxies and lower mass galaxies to estimate the gravitational redshift profile of clusters
out to 4 Mpc/h. Here we use a halo model of clustering to predict the distortion due to gravitational
redshifts of the cross-correlation function on scales from 1 - 100 Mpc/h. We compare our predictions
to simulations and use the simulations to make mock catalogues relevant to current and future galaxy
redshift surveys. Without formulating an optimal estimator, we find that the full BOSS survey should
be able to detect gravitational redshifts from large-scale structure at the ~4 sigma level. Upcoming
redshift surveys will greatly increase the number of galaxies useable in such studies and the BigBOSS
and Euclid experiments should be capable of measurements with precision at the few percent level.
As has been recently pointed out by McDonald, Kaiser and Zhao et al, other interesting effects including
relativistic beaming and transverse Doppler shift can add additional asymmetric distortions
to the correlation function. While these contributions are subdominant to the gravitational redshift
on large scales, they represent additional opportunities to probe gravitational physics and indicate
that many qualitatively new measurements should soon be possible using large redshift surveys.
