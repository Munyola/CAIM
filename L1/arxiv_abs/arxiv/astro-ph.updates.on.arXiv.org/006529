The earliest galaxies are expected to emerge in the first billion years of the Universe during the
Epoch of Reionization. However, both the spectroscopic confirmation of photometrically-selected
galaxies at this epoch and the characterization of their early dynamical state has been hindered
by the lack of bright, accessible lines to probe the velocity structure of their interstellar medium.
We present the first ALMA spectroscopic confirmation of such sources at z > 6 using the far-infrared
[C II]{\lambda}157.74{\mu}m emission line, and, for the first time, measurement of the velocity
structure, for two galaxies at z = 6.8540+/-0.0003 and z = 6.8076+/-0.0002. Remarkably, the [C II]
line luminosity from these galaxies is higher than previously found in `normal' star-forming galaxies
at z > 6.5. This suggests that we are sampling a part of the galaxy population different from the galaxies
found through detection of the Ly{\alpha} line. The luminous and extended [C II] detections reveal
clear velocity gradients that, if interpreted as rotation, would suggest these galaxies have turbulent,
yet rotation-dominated disks, with similar stellar-to-dynamical mass fractions as observed
for H{\alpha} emitting galaxies 2 Gyr later at cosmic noon. Our novel approach for confirming galaxies
during Reionization paves the way for larger studies of distant galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts
from ALMA. Particularly important, this opens up opportunities for high angular-resolution [C
II] dynamics in galaxies less than one billion years after the Big Bang.
