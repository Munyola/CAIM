SN 2007bi and SN 1999as are among the first superluminous supernovae discovered. SN 2007bi was suggested
to be powered by the radioactive decay of a large amount (5 - 10 Msun) of 56Ni. SN 1999as has a similar
spectrum to SN 2007bi. One suggested way to synthesize such a large amount of 56Ni is through energetic
core-collapse supernovae from very massive progenitors. Although the synthetic light curves
of extremely energetic core-collapse supernovae have been shown to be consistent with SN 2007bi,
no synthetic spectra have been reported. Here, we present synthetic spectra of extremely energetic
core-collapse supernovae during the photospheric phases. We find that the ejecta density structure
above 13,000 - 16,000 km/s needs to be cut in order to explain the co-existing broad and narrow line
absorptions in SN 2007bi and SN 1999as. The density cut is likely caused by the interaction between
the supernova ejecta and a dense circumstellar medium. Our results indicate that about 3 Msun of
hydrogen-free dense circumstellar media might exist near the progenitors of SN 2007bi and SN 1999as.
These massive circumstellar media would significantly affect the light-curve and spectral properties
of the supernovae. The precursors that are sometimes observed in superluminous supernovae might
be related to the collision of the ejecta with such dense circumstellar media. We also confirm results
of previous studies that synthetic spectra from pair-instability supernova models do not match
the early spectra of SN 2007bi and SN 1999as.
