Numerically obtaining the inverse of a function is a common task for many scientific problems, often
solved using a Newton iteration method. Here we describe an alternative scheme, based on switching
variables followed by spline interpolation, which can be applied to monotonic functions under
very general conditions. To optimize the algorithm, we designed a specific spline routine that
is faster and more accurate than those that have been described in the literature. We also derive
analytically the theoretical errors of the method and test it on examples that are of interest in
physics. In particular, we compute the real branch of Lambert's $W(y)$ function, which is defined
as the inverse of $x \exp(x)$, and we solve Kepler's equation for the time evolution of planets and
spacecrafts. In all cases, our predictions for the theoretical errors are in excellent agreement
with our numerical results, and are smaller than what could be expected from the general error analysis
of spline interpolation by many orders of magnitude, namely by an astonishing $3\times 10^{-22}$
factor for the computation of $W$ in the range $W(y)\in [0,10]$. In our tests, this scheme is much
faster than the Newton-Raphson iteration method, by a factor in the range $10^{-4}$ to $10^{-3}$
for the execution time in the examples, when the values of the inverse function over an entire interval
or for a large number of points are requested. For Kepler's equation and tolerance $10^{-6}$ rad,
the algorithm outperforms Newton's method for all values of the number of points $N\ge 2$.
