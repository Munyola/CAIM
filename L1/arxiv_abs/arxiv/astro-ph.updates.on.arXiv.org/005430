Observations of exoplanet transit spectra are essential to understanding the physics and chemistry
of distant worlds. The effects of opacity sources and many physical processes combine to set the
shape of a transit spectrum. Two such key processes - refraction and cloud and/or haze forward scattering
- have seen substantial recent study. However, models of these processes are typically complex,
which prevents their incorporation into observational analyses and standard transit spectrum
tools. In this work, we develop analytic expressions that allow for the efficient parameterization
of forward scattering and refraction effects in transit spectra. We derive an effective slant optical
depth that includes a correction for forward scattered light, and present an analytic form of this
correction. We validate our correction against a full-physics transit spectrum model that includes
scattering, and we explore the extent to which the omission of forward scattering effects may bias
models. Also, we verify a common analytic expression for the location of a refractive boundary,
which we express in terms of the maximum pressure probed in a transit spectrum. This expression is
designed to be easily incorporated into existing tools, and we discuss how the detection of a refractive
boundary could help indicate the background atmospheric composition by constraining the bulk
refractivity of the atmosphere. Finally, we show that opacity from Rayleigh scattering and collision
induced absorption will outweigh the effects of refraction for Jupiter-like atmospheres whose
equilibrium temperatures are above 400-500 K.
