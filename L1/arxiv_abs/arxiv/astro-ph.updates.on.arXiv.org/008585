Emission from protostars at centimeter radio wavelengths has been shown to trace the free-free
emission arising from ionizing shocks as a result of jets and outflows driven by protostars. Therefore,
measuring properties of protostars at radio frequencies can provide valuable insights into the
nature of their outflows and jets. We present a C-band (4.1 cm and 6.4 cm) survey of all known protostars
(Class 0 and Class I) in Perseus as part of the VLA Nascent Disk and Multiplicity (VANDAM) Survey.
We examine the known correlations between radio flux density and protostellar parameters such
as bolometric luminosity and outflow force, for our sample. We also investigate the relationship
between radio flux density and far-infrared line luminosities from Herschel. We show that free-free
emission originates most likely from J-type shocks; however, the large scatter indicates that
those two types of emission probe different time and spatial scales. Using C-band fluxes, we removed
an estimation of free-free contamination from the corresponding Ka-band (9 mm) flux densities
that primarily probe dust emission from embedded disks. We find that the compact ($<$~1") dust emission
is lower for Class I sources (median dust mass 96 M$_{\oplus}$) relative to Class 0 (248 M$_{\oplus}$),
but several times higher than in Class II (5-15 M$_{\oplus}$). If this compact dust emission is tracing
primarily the embedded disk, as is likely for many sources, this result provides evidence for decreasing
disk masses with protostellar evolution, with sufficient mass for forming giant planet cores primarily
at early times.
