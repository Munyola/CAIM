FRB181228 was detected by the Molonglo Synthesis Radio Telescope (MOST) at a position and time coincident
with Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) observations, representing the first simultaneous
multi-wavelength data collection for a Fast Radio Burst (FRB). The large imaged field-of-view
of TESS allows a search over the uncertainty region produced by MOST. However, the TESS pixel scale
of 21" and the Full Frame Image (FFI) cadence of 30 minutes is not optimal for the detection of an FOB
with a possible millisecond duration. We search the TESS FFIs and find no events with a limiting TESS
magnitude of 16, assuming a 30 minute event duration, corresponding to an optical flux density upper
limit of approximately 2000 Jy for a ~ms signal duration, assuming no signal loss. In addition, the
cosmic ray mitigation method for TESS significantly reduces its sensitivity to short timescale
transients, which we quantify. We compare our results to the predictions of Yang, Zhang, and Wei
(2019) and find that the upper limit is a factor of two thousand higher than the predicted maximum
optical flux density. However, we find that if FRB181228 had occurred in the galaxy thought to host
the nearest FRB detection to date (37 Mpc), an FOB may have been detectable by TESS. In the near future,
when CHIME and ASKAP will detect hundreds to thousands of FRBs, TESS may be able to detect FOBs from
those rare bright and nearby FRBs within this large population (if more sophisticated cosmic ray
excision can be implemented).
