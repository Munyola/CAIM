The search for inflationary primordial gravitational waves and the measurement of the optical
depth to reionization, both through their imprint on the large angular scale correlations in the
polarization of the cosmic microwave background (CMB), has created the need for high sensitivity
measurements of polarization across large fractions of the sky at millimeter wavelengths. These
measurements are subject to instrumental and atmospheric $1/f$ noise, which has motivated the
development of polarization modulators to facilitate the rejection of these large systematic
effects. Variable-delay polarization modulators (VPMs) are used in the Cosmology Large Angular
Scale Surveyor (CLASS) telescopes as the first element in the optical chain to rapidly modulate
the incoming polarization. VPMs consist of a linearly polarizing wire grid in front of a movable
flat mirror. Varying the distance between the grid and the mirror produces a changing phase shift
between polarization states parallel and perpendicular to the grid which modulates Stokes U (linear
polarization at $45^\circ$) and Stokes V (circular polarization). The CLASS telescopes have VPMs
as the first optical element from the sky; this simultaneously allows a lock-in style polarization
measurement and the separation of sky polarization from any instrumental polarization further
along in the optical path. The Q-band CLASS VPM was the first VPM to begin observing the CMB full time,
starting in the Spring of 2016. The first W-band CLASS VPM was installed in the Spring of 2018.
