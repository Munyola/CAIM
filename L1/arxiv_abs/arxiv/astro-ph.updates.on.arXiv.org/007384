External cosmic rays impinging upon circumstellar disks associated with young stellar objects
provide an important source of ionization, and as such, play an important role in disk evolution
and planet formation. However, these incoming cosmic rays are affected by a variety of physical
processes internal to stellar/disk systems, including modulation by turbulent magnetic fields.
Globally, these fields naturally provide both a funneling effect, where cosmic rays from larger
volumes are focused into the disk region, and a magnetic mirroring effect, where cosmic rays are
repelled due to the increasing field strength. This paper considers cosmic ray propagation in the
presence of a turbulent spiral magnetic field, analogous to that produced by the Solar wind. The
interaction of this wind with the interstellar medium defines a transition radius, analogous to
the Heliopause, which provides the outer boundary to this problem. We construct a new coordinate
system where one coordinate follows the spiral magnetic field lines and consider magnetic perturbations
to the field in the perpendicular directions. The presence of magnetic turbulence replaces the
mirroring points with a distribution of values and moves the mean location outward. Our results
thus help quantify the degree to which cosmic ray fluxes are reduced in circumstellar disks by the
presence of magnetic field structures that are shaped by stellar winds. The new coordinate system
constructed herein should also be useful in other astronomical applications.
