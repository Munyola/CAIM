We combine the constraints on the population properties of double white dwarfs (DWDs) from two previous
radial-velocity-variation studies, one based on a sample of white dwarfs (WDs) from the Sloan Digital
Sky Survey (SDSS, which with its high spectral resolution probes systems at separations a<0.05
au), and one based on the ESO-VLT Supernova-Ia Progenitor surveY (SPY, which, with high spectral
resolution, is sensitive to a<4 au), to obtain new and precise information on the DWD population
and on its gravitational-wave-driven merger rate. From a joint likelihood analysis, the DWD fraction
among WDs is fbin=0.095+/-0.020 (1-sigma, random) +0.010 (systematic) in the separation range
~<4 au. The index of a power-law distribution of initial WD separations (at the start of solely gravitational-wave-driven
binary evolution), N(a)da ~ a^alpha da, is alpha=-1.30+/-0.15 (1-sigma) +0.1 (systematic). The
Galactic WD merger rate per WD is R_merge=(9.7+/-1.1)e-12 /yr. Integrated over the Galaxy lifetime,
this implies that 8.5-11 per cent of all WDs ever formed have merged with another WD. If most DWD mergers
end as a more-massive WD, then some 10 per cent of WDs are DWD-merger products, consistent with the
observed fraction of WDs in a "high-mass bump" in the WD mass function. The DWD merger rate is 4.5-7
times the Milky Way's specific Type-Ia supernova (SN Ia) rate. If most SN Ia explosions stem from
the mergers of some DWDs (say, those with massive-enough binary components) then ~15 per cent of
all WD mergers must lead to a SN Ia.
