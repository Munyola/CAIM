High angular resolution observations of young stellar objects are required to study the inner astronomical
units of protoplanetary disks in which the majority of planets form. As they evolve, gaps open up
in the inner disk regions and the disks are fully dispersed within ~10 Myrs. MWC 614 is a pre-transitional
object with a ~10au radius gap. We present a set of high angular resolution observations of this object
including SPHERE/ZIMPOL polarimetric and coronagraphic images in the visible, KECK/NIRC2 near-infrared
aperture masking observations and VLTI (AMBER, MIDI, and PIONIER) and CHARA (CLASSIC and CLIMB)
long-baseline interferometry at infrared wavelengths. We find that all the observations are compatible
with an inclined disk (i ~55deg at a position angle of ~20-30deg). The mid-infrared dataset confirms
the disk inner rim to be at 12.3+/-0.4 au from the central star. We determined an upper mass limit of
0.34 Msun for a companion inside the cavity. Within the cavity, the near-infrared emission, usually
associated with the dust sublimation region, is unusually extended (~10 au, 30 times larger than
the theoretical sublimation radius) and indicates a high dust temperature (T~1800 K). As a possible
result of companion-induced dust segregation, quantum heated dust grains could explain the extended
near-infrared emission with this high temperature. Our observations confirm the peculiar state
of this object where the inner disk has already been accreted onto the star exposing small particles
inside the cavity to direct stellar radiation.
