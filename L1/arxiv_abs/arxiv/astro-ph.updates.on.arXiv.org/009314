We report an analysis of the metal-rich tail ([Fe/H] $> -0.75$) of halo stars located at distances
from the Galactic plane $z$ up to $|z| \sim 10$ kpc, observed by the Apache Point Observatory Galactic
Evolution Experiment (APOGEE). We examine the chemistry, kinematics, and dynamics of this metal-rich
halo sample using chemical abundances and radial velocities provided by the fourteenth APOGEE
data release (DR14) and proper motions from the second Gaia data release (DR2). The analysis reveals
three chemically different stellar populations in the [Mg/Fe] vs. [Fe/H] space -- the two distinct
halo populations already reported in the literature, and a third group with intermediate [Mg/Fe]
$\sim$+0.1. We derive the $U$, $V$ and $W$ velocity components with respect to the Local Standard
of Rest, as well as orbits for the three stellar groups, and find that they differ also in their kinematical
and dynamical properties. The high-[Mg/Fe] population exhibits a mean prograde rotation, as well
as orbits that are more bound and closer to the plane, whereas the low-[Mg/Fe] population has $<V>$
closer to 0, and stars that move in less-bound orbits reaching larger distances from the centre and
the Galactic plane. The intermediate-Mg stars exhibit different orbital characteristics, moving
with a strong prograde rotation and low excentricity, but in less-bound orbits. This stellar population
resembles the two stellar overdensities lying about $|z| \sim 5$ kpc recently reported in the literature,
for which a disc origin has been claimed.
