The variability inherent in solar wind composition has implications for the variability of the
physical conditions in its coronal source regions, providing constraints on models of coronal
heating and solar wind generation. We present a generalized prescription for constructing a wavelet
power significance measure (confidence level) for the purpose of characterizing the effects of
missing data in high cadence solar wind ionic composition measurements. We describe the data gaps
present in the 12-minute ACE/SWICS observations of O7+/O6+ during 2008. The decomposition of the
in-situ observations into a `good measurement' and a `no measurement' signal allows us to evaluate
the performance of a filler signal, i.e., various prescriptions for filling the data gaps. We construct
Monte Carlo simulations of synthetic O7+/O6+ composition data and impose the actual data gaps that
exist in the observations in order to investigate two different filler signals: one, a linear interpolation
between neighboring good data points, and two, the constant mean value of the measured data. Applied
to these synthetic data plus filler signal combinations, we quantify the ability of the power spectra
significance level procedure to reproduce the ensemble-averaged time-integrated wavelet power
per scale of an ideal case, i.e. the synthetic data without imposed data gaps. Finally, we present
the wavelet power spectra for the O7+/O6+ data using the confidence levels derived from both the
Mean Value and Linear Interpolation data gap filling signals and discuss the results.
