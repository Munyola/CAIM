We present a comprehensive infrared study of supernova remnants (SNRs) in the Large Magellanic
Cloud (LMC) using near- to mid-infrared images taken by Infrared Array Camera (IRAC; 3.6, 4.5, 5.8,
and 8 {\mu}m) and Multiband Imaging Photometer (MIPS; 24 and 70 {\mu}m) onboard the Spitzer Space
Telescope. Among the 47 bona fide LMC SNRs, 29 were detected in infrared, giving a high detection
rate of 62%. All 29 SNRs show emission at 24 {\mu}m, and 20 out of 29 show emission in one or several IRAC
bands. We present their 4.5, 8, 24, and 70 {\mu}m images and a table summarizing their Spitzer fluxes.
We find that the LMC SNRs are considerably fainter than the Galactic SNRs, and that, among the LMC
SNRs, Type Ia SNRs are significantly fainter than core-collapse SNRs. We conclude that the MIPS
emission of essentially all SNRs origi- nates from dust emission, whereas their IRAC emissions
originate from ionic/molecular lines, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons emission, or synchrotron
emission. The infrared fluxes show correlation with radio and X-ray fluxes. For SNRs that have similar
mor- phology in infrared and X-rays, the ratios of 24 to 70 {\mu}m fluxes have good correlation with
the electron density of hot plasma. The overall correlation is explained well by the emission from
collisionally-heated silicate grains of 0.1 {\mu}m size, but for mature SNRs with relatively low
gas temperatures, the smaller-sized grain population is favored more. For those that appear different
between infrared and X-rays, the emission in the MIPS bands is probably from dust heated by shock
radiation.
