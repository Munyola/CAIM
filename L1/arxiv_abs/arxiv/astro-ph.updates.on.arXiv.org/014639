The structure and composition of the crust of neutron stars plays an important role in their thermal
and magnetic evolution, hence in setting their observational properties. One way to study the crust
properties is to measure how it cools after it has been heated during an accretion outburst in a low-mass
X-ray binary (LMXB). Such studies have shown that there is a tantalizing source of heat, of currently
unknown origin, that is located in the outer layers of the crust and has a strength that varies between
different sources and different outbursts. With the aim of understanding the mechanism behind
this "shallow heating", we present Chandra and Swift observations of the neutron star LMXB Aql X-1,
obtained after its bright 2016 outburst. We find that the neutron star temperature was initially
much lower, and started to decrease at much later time, than observed after the 2013 outburst of the
source, despite the fact that the properties of the two outbursts were very similar. Comparing our
data to thermal evolution simulations, we infer that the depth and magnitude of shallow heating
must have been much larger during the 2016 outburst than during the 2013 one. This implies that basic
neutron star parameters that do not change between outbursts, do not play a strong role in shallow
heating. Furthermore, it suggests that outbursts with a similar accretion morphology can give
rise to very different shallow heating. We also discuss alternative explanations for the difference
in quiescent evolution after the 2016 outburst.
