The origin of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) that inhabit the centers of massive galaxies is largely
unconstrained. Remnants from supermassive stars (SMSs) with masses around 10,000 solar masses
provide the ideal seed candidates, known as direct collapse black holes. However, their very existence
and formation environment in the early Universe are still under debate, with their supposed rarity
further exacerbating the problem of modeling their ab-initio formation. SMS models have shown
that rapid collapse, with an infall rate above a critical value, in metal-free haloes is a requirement
for the formation of a proto-stellar core which will then form an SMS. Using a radiation hydrodynamics
simulation of early galaxy formation, we show the natural emergence of metal-free haloes both massive
enough, and with sufficiently high infall rates, to form an SMS. We find that haloes that are exposed
to both a Lyman-Werner intensity of J_LW ~ 3 J_21 and that undergo at least one period of rapid growth
early in their evolution are ideal cradles for SMS formation. This rapid growth induces substantial
dynamical heating, amplifying the existing Lyman-Werner suppression originating from a group
of young galaxies 20 kiloparsecs away. Our results strongly indicate that structure formation
dynamics, rather than a critical Lyman-Werner (LW) flux, may be the main driver of massive black
hole formation in the early Universe. We find that massive black hole seeds may be much more common
in overdense regions of the early Universe than previously considered with a comoving number density
up to 10^-3 Mpc^-3.
