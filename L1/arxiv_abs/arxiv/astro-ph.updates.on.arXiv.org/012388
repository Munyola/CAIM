The discovery of thousands of planetary systems by Kepler has demonstrated that planets are ubiquitous.
However, a major challenge has been the confirmation of Kepler planet candidates, many of which
still await confirmation. One of the most enigmatic examples is KOI 4.01, Kepler's first discovered
planet candidate detection (as KOI 1.01, 2.01, and 3.01 were known prior to launch). Here we present
the confirmation and characterization of KOI 4.01 (now Kepler-1658), using a combination of asteroseismology
and radial velocities. Kepler-1658 is a massive, evolved subgiant (Mstar = 1.45 +/- 0.06 Msun, Rstar
= 2.89 +/- 0.12 Rsun) hosting a massive (Mp = 5.88 +/- 0.47 MJ, Rp = 1.07 +/- 0.05 RJ) hot Jupiter that
orbits every 3.85 days. Kepler-1658 joins a small population of evolved hosts with short-period
(<=100 days) planets and is now the closest known planet in terms of orbital period to an evolved star.
Because of its uniqueness and short orbital period, Kepler-1658 is a new benchmark system for testing
tidal dissipation and hot Jupiter formation theories. Using all 4 years of Kepler data, we constrain
the orbital decay rate to be Pdot <= -0.42 s/yr, corresponding to a strong observational limit of
Qstar >= 4.826 x 10^3 for the tidal quality factor in evolved stars. With an effective temperature
Teff ~6200 K, Kepler-1658 sits close to the spin-orbit misalignment boundary at ~6250 K, making
it a prime target for follow-up observations to better constrain its obliquity and to provide insight
into theories for hot Jupiter formation and migration.
