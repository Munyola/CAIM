We study the coronal dimming caused by the fast halo CME (deprojected speed v =1250 km s $^{-1})$ associated
with the C3.7 two-ribbon flare on 2012 September 27, using Hinode/EIS spectroscopy and SDO/AIA
Differential Emission Measure (DEM) analysis. The event reveals bipolar core dimmings encompassed
by hook-shaped flare ribbons located at the ends of the flare-related polarity inversion line,
and marking the footpoints of the erupting filament. In coronal emission lines of $\log T \, [{\rm
K}] = 5.8-6.3$, distinct double component spectra indicative of the superposition of a stationary
and a fast up-flowing plasma component with velocities up to 130 km s$^{-1}$ are observed at regions,
which were mapped by the scanning EIS slit close in time of their impulsive dimming onset. The outflowing
plasma component is found to be of the same order and even dominant over the stationary one, with electron
densities in the upflowing component of $2\times 10^{9}$cm$^{-3}$ at $\log T \, [{\rm K}] = 6.2$.
The density evolution in core dimming regions derived from SDO/AIA DEM analysis reveals impulsive
reductions by $40 - 50\%$ within $\lesssim$10 min, and remains at these reduced levels for hours.
The mass loss rate derived from the EIS spectroscopy in the dimming regions is of the same order than
the mass increase rate observed in the associated white light CME ($1 \times 10^{12} {\rm \; g \; s}^{-1}$),
indicative that the CME mass increase in the coronagraphic field-of-view results from plasma flows
from below and not from material piled-up ahead of the outward moving and expanding CME front.
