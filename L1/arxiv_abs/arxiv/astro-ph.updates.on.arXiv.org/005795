We present Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) observations of $^{12}$CO2$-$1 emission from
circumstellar material around the massive star $\eta$~Carinae. These observations reveal new
structural details about the cool equatorial torus located $\sim$4000 au from the star. The CO torus
is not a complete azimuthal loop, but rather, is missing its near side, which appears to have been
cleared away. The missing material matches the direction of apastron in the eccentric binary system,
making it likely that $\eta$~Car's companion played an important role in disrupting portions of
the torus soon after ejection. Molecular gas seen in ALMA data aligns well with the cool dust around
$\eta$~Car previously observed in mid-infrared (IR) maps, whereas hot dust resides at the inner
surface of the molecular torus. The CO also coincides with the spatial and velocity structure of
near-IR H$_2$ emission. Together, these suggest that the CO torus seen by ALMA is actually the pinched
waist of the Homunculus polar lobes, which glows brightly because it is close to the star and warmer
than the poles. The near side of the torus appears to be a blowout, associated with fragmented equatorial
ejecta. We discuss implications for the origin of various features northwest of the star. CO emission
from the main torus implies a total gas mass in the range of 0.2-1 $M_{\odot}$ (possibly up to 5 $M_{\odot}$
or more, although with questionable assumptions). Deeper observations are needed to constrain
CO emission from the cool polar lobes.
