We study the dynamical evolution of the TRAPPIST-1 system under the influence of orbital circularization
through tidal interaction with the central star. We find that systems with parameters close to the
observed one evolve into a state where consecutive planets are linked by first order resonances
and consecutive triples, apart from planets c, d and e, by connected three body Laplace resonances.
The system expands with period ratios increasing and mean eccentricities decreasing with time.
This evolution is largely driven by tides acting on the innermost planets which then influence the
outer ones. In order that deviations from commensurability become significant only on $Gy$ time
scales or longer, we require that the tidal parameter associated with the planets has to be such that
$Q' > \sim 10^{2-3}.$ At the same time, if we start with two subsystems, with the inner three planets
comprising the inner one, $Q'$ associated with the planets has to be on the order (and not significantly
exceeding) $10^{2-3}$ for the two subsystems to interact and end up in the observed configuration.
This scenario is also supported by modelling of the evolution through disk migration which indicates
that the whole system cannot have migrated inwards together. Also in order to avoid large departures
from commensurabilities, the system cannot have stalled at a disk inner edge for significant time
periods. We discuss the habitability consequences of the tidal dissipation implied by our modelling,
concluding that planets d, e and f are potentially in habitable zones.
