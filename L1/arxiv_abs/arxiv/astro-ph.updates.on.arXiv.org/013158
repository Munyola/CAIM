Molecular lines observed towards protoplanetary disks carry information about physical and chemical
processes associated with planet formation. We present ALMA Band 6 observations of C2H, HCN, and
C18O in a sample of 14 disks spanning a range of ages, stellar luminosities, and stellar masses. Using
C2H and HCN hyperfine structure fitting and HCN/H13CN isotopologue analysis, we extract optical
depth, excitation temperature, and column density radial profiles for a subset of disks. C2H is
marginally optically thick (\tau ~1-5) and HCN is quite optically thick (\tau ~ 5-10) in the inner
200 AU. The extracted temperatures of both molecules are low (10-30K), indicative of either sub-thermal
emission from the warm disk atmosphere or substantial beam dilution due to chemical substructure.
We explore the origins of C2H morphological diversity in our sample using a series of toy disk models,
and find that disk-dependent overlap between regions with high UV fluxes and high atomic carbon
abundances can explain a wide range of C2H emission features (e.g. compact vs. extended and ringed
vs. ringless emission). We explore the chemical relationship between C2H, HCN, and C18O and find
a positive correlation between C2H and HCN fluxes, but no relationship between C2H or HCN with C18O
fluxes. We also see no evidence that C2H and HCN are enhanced with disk age. C2H and HCN seem to share
a common driver, however more work remains to elucidate the chemical relationship between these
molecules and the underlying evolution of C, N, and O chemistries in disks.
