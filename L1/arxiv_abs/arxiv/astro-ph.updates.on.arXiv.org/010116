One of the most important problems in the context of cataclysmic variables (CVs) is the lack of observations
of systems with periods between 2 and 3.12 hours, known as the period gap. The orbital evolution of
CVs with periods shorter than those in the gap is dominated by gravitational radiation while for
periods exceeding those of the gap it is dominated by magnetic braking of the secondary star. Spruit
& Ritter (1983) showed that as periods approach 3 hours and secondary stars become fully convective
a sharp decline in magnetic dynamo and braking efficiency would result in such a gap. Recent X-ray
observations finding coronal magnetic energy dissipation is similar in fully convective and partly
radiative M dwarfs cast this theory into doubt. In this work, we use Zeeman-Doppler imaging observations
culled from the literature to show that the complexity of the surface magnetic fields of rapidly
rotating M dwarfs increases with decreasing rotation period. Garraffo et al. (2018) have shown
that the efficiency of angular momentum loss of cool stars declines strongly with increasing complexity
of their surface magnetic field. We explore the idea of Taam & Spruit (1989) that magnetic complexity
might then explain the period gap. By generating synthetic CV populations using a schematic CV evolutionary
approach, we show that the CV period gap can naturally arise as a consequence of a rise in secondary
star magnetic complexity near the long period edge of the gap that renders a sharp decline in their
angular momentum loss rate.
