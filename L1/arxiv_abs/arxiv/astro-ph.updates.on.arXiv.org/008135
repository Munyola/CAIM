Planet-planet collisions are a common outcome of instability in systems of transiting planets
close to the star, as well as occurring during in-situ formation of such planets from embryos. Previous
N-body studies of instability amongst transiting planets have assumed that collisions result
in perfect merging. Here, we explore the effects of implementing a more realistic collision prescription
on the outcomes of instability and in-situ formation at orbital radii of a few tenths of an au. There
is a strong effect on the outcome of the growth of planetary embryos, so long as the debris thrown off
in collisions is rapidly removed from the system (which happens by collisional processing to dust,
and then removal by radiation forces) and embryos are small ($< 0.1\mathrm{\,M}_\oplus$). If this
is the case, then systems form fewer detectable ($\gtrsim1\mathrm{\,M}_\oplus$) planets than
systems evolved under the assumption of perfect merging in collisions. This provides some contribution
to the "Kepler Dichotomy": the observed over-abundance of single-planet systems. The effects
of changing the collision prescription on unstable mature systems of super-Earths are less pronounced.
Perfect mergers only account for a minority of collision outcomes in such systems, but most collisions
resulting in mass loss are grazing impacts in which only a few per cent. of mass is lost. As a result,
there is little impact on the final masses and multiplicities of the systems after instability when
compared to systems evolved under the assumption that collisions always result in perfect merging.
