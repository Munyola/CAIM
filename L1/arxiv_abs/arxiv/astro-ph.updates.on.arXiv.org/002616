We describe a methodology to classify periodic variable stars identified using photometric time-series
measurements constructed from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) full-mission single-exposure
Source Databases. This will assist in the future construction of a WISE Variable Source Database
that assigns variables to specific science classes as constrained by the WISE observing cadence
with statistically meaningful classification probabilities. We have analyzed the WISE light
curves of 8273 variable stars identified in previous optical variability surveys (MACHO, GCVS,
and ASAS) and show that Fourier decomposition techniques can be extended into the mid-IR to assist
with their classification. Combined with other periodic light-curve features, this sample is
then used to train a machine-learned classifier based on the random forest (RF) method. Consistent
with previous classification studies of variable stars in general, the RF machine-learned classifier
is superior to other methods in terms of accuracy, robustness against outliers, and relative immunity
to features that carry little or redundant class information. For the three most common classes
identified by WISE: Algols, RR Lyrae, and W Ursae Majoris type variables, we obtain classification
efficiencies of 80.7%, 82.7%, and 84.5% respectively using cross-validation analyses, with 95%
confidence intervals of approximately +/-2%. These accuracies are achieved at purity (or reliability)
levels of 88.5%, 96.2%, and 87.8% respectively, similar to that achieved in previous automated
classification studies of periodic variable stars.
