Measurements of the cosmic ray antiproton spectrum can be used to search for contributions from
annihilating dark matter and to constrain the dark matter annihilation cross section. Depending
on the assumptions made regarding cosmic ray propagation in the Galaxy, such constraints can be
quite stringent. We revisit this topic, utilizing a set of propagation models fit to the cosmic ray
boron, carbon, oxygen and beryllium data. We derive upper limits on the dark matter annihilation
cross section and find that when the cosmic ray propagation parameters are treated as nuisance parameters
(as we argue is appropriate), the resulting limits are significantly less stringent than have been
previously reported. We also note (as have several previous groups) that simple GALPROP-like diffusion-reacceleration
models predict a spectrum of cosmic ray antiprotons that is in good agreement with PAMELA's observations
above ~5 GeV, but that significantly underpredict the flux at lower energies. Although the complexity
of modeling cosmic ray propagation at GeV-scale energies makes it difficult to determine the origin
of this discrepancy, we consider the possibility that the excess antiprotons are the result of annihilating
dark matter. Suggestively, we find that this excess is best fit for a dark matter mass of approximately
35 GeV and annihilation cross section of approximately 1e-26 cm^3/s (to b-bbar), in good agreement
with the mass and cross section previously shown to be required to generate the gamma-ray excess
observed from the Galactic Center.
