We present a study of planet-crossing asteroid (3200) Phaethon at three successive perihelia in
2009, 2010 and 2012, using the NASA STEREO spacecraft. Phaethon is clearly detected in 2009 and 2012,
but not in 2010. In both former years, Phaethon brightened unexpectedly by ~1 magnitude at large
phase angles, inconsistent with the ~1 magnitude of steady fading expected from a discrete, macroscopic
body over the same phase angle range. With a perihelion distance of 0.14 AU and surface temperatures
up to ~1000 K, a thermal origin of this anomalous brightening is strongly suspected. However, simple
thermal emission from Phaethon is too weak, by a factor >1000, to explain the brightening. Neither
can ice survive on this body, ruling out comet-like sublimation. Our preferred explanation is that
brightening occurs as a result of dust produced and ejected from Phaethon, perhaps by thermal fracture
and/or thermal decomposition of surface minerals when near perihelion. A contribution from prompt
emission by oxygen released by desiccation of surface minerals cannot be excluded. We infer an ejected
mass of order 4x10^8 a_mm kg per outburst, where a_mm is the mean dust radius in millimeters. For plausible
dust radii, this mass is small compared to the estimated mass of Phaethon (~2x10^14 kg) and to the
mass of the Geminid stream (10^12 kg to 10^13 kg) with which Phaethon is dynamically associated.
Perihelion mass-loss events like those observed in 2009 and 2012 contribute to, but do not necessarily
account for the Geminids stream mass.
