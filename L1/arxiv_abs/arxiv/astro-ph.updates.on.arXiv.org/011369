We present results obtained from Stromgren photometry of 13 young (~30-220 Myr) Magellanic Cloud
(MC) clusters, most of them lacking in the literature from direct metallicity measurements. We
derived for them [Fe/H] values from a high-dispersion spectroscopy-based empirical calibration
of the Stromgren metallicity sensitive index m1 for yellow and red supergiants (SGs). Particular
care was given while estimating their respective uncertainties. In order to obtain the mean cluster
metallicities, we used [Fe/H] values of selected SGs for which we required to be located within the
cluster radii, placed in the expected SG region in the cluster colour-magnitude diagrams, and with
[Fe/H] values within the FWHM of the observed cluster metallicity distributions. The resulting
metallicities for nearly 75 per cent of the cluster sample agree well with the most frequently used
values of the mean MCs' present-day metallicities. The remaining clusters have mean [Fe/H] values
that fall near the edge of the MC present-day metallicity distributions. When comparing the cluster
metallicities with their present positions, we found evidence that supports the claimed recent
interaction of the MCs with the Milky Way, that could have caused that some clusters were scattered
from their birthplaces. Indeed, we show examples of clusters with metal contents typical of the
galaxy inner regions placed outward them. Likewise, we found young clusters, at present located
in the inner regions of both MCs, formed out of gas that has remained unmixed since several Gyr ago.
