We present the first results of a project aimed at searching for gas accretion events and interactions
between late-type galaxies in the void environment. The project is based on long-slit spectroscopic
and scanning Fabry-Perot interferometer observations performed with the SCORPIO and SCORPIO-2
multimode instruments at the Russian 6-m telescope, as well as archival multiwavelength photometric
data. In the first paper of the series we describe the project and present a sample of 18 void galaxies
with oxygen abundances that fall below the reference `metallicity-luminosity' relation, or with
possible signs of recent external accretion in their optical morphology. To demonstrate our approach,
we considered the brightest sample galaxy NGC 428, a late-type barred spiral with several morphological
peculiarities. We analysed the radial metallicity distribution, the ionized gas line-of-sight
velocity and velocity dispersion maps together with WISE and SDSS images. Despite its very perturbed
morphology, the velocity field of ionized gas in NGC 428 is well described by pure circular rotation
in a thin flat disc with streaming motions in the central bar. We also found some local non-circular
gas motions clearly related to stellar feedback processes. At the same time, we revealed a circumnuclear
inclined disc in NGC 428 and a region with significant residual velocities that could be considered
as a result of a recent (<0.5 Gyr) accretion event. The observed oxygen abundance gradient does not
contradict this conclusion.
