We present the results of Galaxy Nurseries project, which was designed to enable crowdsourced analysis
of slitless spectroscopic data by volunteer citizen scientists using the Zooniverse online interface.
The dataset was obtained by the WFC3 Infrared Spectroscopic Parallel (WISP) Survey collaboration
and comprises NIR grism (G102 and G141) and direct imaging. Volunteers were instructed to evaluate
indicated spectral features and decide whether it was a genuine emission line or more likely an artifact.
Galaxy Nurseries was completed in only 40 days, gathering 414,360 classifications from 3003 volunteers
for 27,333 putative emission lines. The results of Galaxy Nurseries demonstrate the feasibility
of identifying genuine emission lines in slitless spectra by citizen scientists. Volunteer responses
for each subject were aggregated to compute $f_{\mathrm{Real}}$, the fraction of volunteers who
classified the corresponding emission line as "Real". To evaluate the accuracy of volunteer classifications,
their aggregated responses were compared with independent assessments provided by members of
the WISP Survey Science Team (WSST). Overall, there is a broad agreement between the WSST and volunteers'
classifications, although we recognize that robust scientific analyses typically require samples
with higher purity and completeness than raw volunteer classifications provide. Nonetheless,
choosing optimal threshold values for $f_{\mathrm{Real}}$ allows a large fraction of spurious
lines to be vetoed, substantially reducing the timescale for subsequent professional analysis
of the remaining potential lines.
