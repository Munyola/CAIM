We have studied long-term optical, ultraviolet (UV) and X-ray observations of OJ 287 collected
with the UVOT and XRT instruments mounted on board the Swift satellite to quantify spectral and temporal
variability patterns observed during different activity states. We characterized the flux variations
using the data collected during almost 11 yr of the monitoring of the blazar. Significant variability
of the blazar has been detected both in the flux and spectral index from the optical to X-ray regimes.
We noted that the variability patterns observed in the optical range are more pronounced than the
ones in the X-ray band. There is no clear relation between the optical/UV and X-ray emission, neither
during the quiescence state nor during outbursts. The most significant flares in the optical/UV
regime were detected in 2015 December-2016 January. The shortest variability time-scale is one
day and it is limited by the observation pointing. A low activity state of OJ 287 was observed at the
end of 2014, while the beginning of 2015 revealed a flat X-ray spectrum, which has been observed for
the first time. On one hand, this can be a spectral upturn where the synchrotron and inverse Compton
components meet, but on the other hand, it can be generated by an additional emission component.
The spectral studies have not revealed any bluer-when-brighter or redder-when-brighter chromatism
in the colour-magnitude diagram for OJ 287 in any state of the source's activity. A harder-when-brighter
behaviour was noticed for OJ 287 only in the case of the X-ray observations.
