Context. The Galactic magnetic field (GMF) has a huge impact on the evolution of the Milky Way. Yet
currently there exists no standard model for it, as its structure is not fully understood. In the
past many parametric GMF models of varying complexity have been developed that all have been fitted
to an individual set of observational data complicating comparability. Aims. Our goal is to systematize
parameter inference of GMF models. We want to enable a statistical comparison of different models
in the future, allow for simple refitting with respect to newly available data sets and thereby increase
the research area's transparency. We aim to make state-of-the-art Bayesian methods easily available
and in particular to treat the statistics related to the random components of the GMF correctly.
Methods. To achieve our goals, we built IMAGINE, the Interstellar Magnetic Field Inference Engine.
It is a modular open source framework for doing inference on generic parametric models of the Galaxy.
We combine highly optimized tools and technology such as the MultiNest sampler and the information
field theory framework NIFTy in order to leverage existing expertise. Results. We demonstrate
the steps needed for robust parameter inference and model comparison. Our results show how important
the combination of complementary observables like synchrotron emission and Faraday depth is while
building a model and fitting its parameters to data. IMAGINE is open-source software available
