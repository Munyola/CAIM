Shell galaxies are understood to form through the collision of a dwarf galaxy with an elliptical
galaxy. Shell structures and kinematics have been noted to be independent tools to measure the gravitational
potential of the shell galaxies. We compare theoretically the formation of shells in Type I shell
galaxies in different gravity theories in this work because this is so far missing in the literature.
We include Newtonian plus dark halo gravity, and two non-Newtonian gravity models, MOG and MOND,
in identical initial systems. We investigate the effect of dynamical friction, which by slowing
down the dwarf galaxy in the dark halo models limits the range of shell radii to low values. Under the
same initial conditions, shells appear on a shorter timescale and over a smaller range of distances
in the presence of dark matter than in the corresponding non-Newtonian gravity models. If galaxies
are embedded in a dark matter halo, then the merging time may be too rapid to allow multi-generation
shell formation as required by observed systems because of the large dynamical friction effect.
Starting from the same initial state, in the dark halo model the observation of small bright shells
should be accompanied by large faint ones, while for the case of MOG, the next shell generation patterns
iterate with a specific time delay. The first shell generation pattern shows a degeneracy with the
age of the shells and in different theories, but the relative distance of the shells and the shell
expansion velocity can break this degeneracy.
