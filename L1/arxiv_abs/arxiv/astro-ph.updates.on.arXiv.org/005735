The search for extra dimensions is a challenging endeavor to probe physics beyond the Standard Model.
The joint detection of gravity waves (GW) and electromagnetic (EM) signals from the merging of a
binary system of compact objects like neutron stars (NS), can help constrain the geometry of extra
dimensions. In particular, if our observable Universe is a 3+1 hypersurface, or brane, embedded
in a higher 4+1 Anti-de Sitter (AdS$_5$) spacetime, in which gravity is the only field that propagates
through the infinite bulk space, while other fields are confined to the brane, then GW and EM signals
between two points on the brane would, in general, travel different paths. This would result in a
time-lag between the detection of GW and EM signals emitted simultaneously from the same source.
Assuming the standard $\Lambda$-Cold Dark Matter ($\Lambda$CDM) scenario and performing a conservative
analysis in which we assume that the time-lag between the event GW170817 by the LIGO/VIRGO collaborations
and the GRB170817A signal detected by the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor collaboration is entirely
due to astrophysical processes associated with the NS-NS merger, we set a bound on the AdS$_5$ radius
of curvature $\ell \lesssim 46\,$kpc at $68\%$ confidence level. Although the bound is not competitive
with current Solar System constraints, it is the first time that data from a multi-messenger GW-EM
measurement can be used to constrain the physics of extra dimensions. Thus, our work provides a proof-of-principle
of the possibility of using multi-messenger astronomy for probing the geometry of our space-time.
