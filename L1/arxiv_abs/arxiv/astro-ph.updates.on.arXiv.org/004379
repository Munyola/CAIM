Exoplanet science promises a continued rapid accumulation of new observations in the near future,
energizing a drive to understand and interpret the forthcoming wealth of data to identify signs
of life beyond our Solar System. The large statistics of exoplanet samples, combined with the ambiguity
of our understanding of universal properties of life and its signatures, necessitate a quantitative
framework for biosignature assessment Here, we introduce a Bayesian framework for guiding future
directions in life detection, which permits the possibility of generalizing our search strategy
beyond biosignatures of known life. The Bayesian methodology provides a language to define quantitatively
the conditional probabilities and confidence levels of future life detection and, importantly,
may constrain the prior probability of life with or without positive detection. We describe empirical
and theoretical work necessary to place constraints on the relevant likelihoods, including those
emerging from stellar and planetary context, the contingencies of evolutionary history and the
universalities of physics and chemistry. We discuss how the Bayesian framework can guide our search
strategies, including determining observational wavelengths or deciding between targeted searches
or larger, lower resolution surveys. Our goal is to provide a quantitative framework not entrained
to specific definitions of life or its signatures, which integrates the diverse disciplinary perspectives
necessary to confidently detect alien life.
