The fraction of ionizing photons that escape from young star-forming galaxies is one of the largest
uncertainties in determining the role of galaxies in cosmic reionization. Yet traditional techniques
for measuring this fraction are inapplicable at the redshifts of interest due to foreground screening
by the Lyman alpha forest. In an earlier study, we demonstrated a reduction in the equivalent width
of low-ionization absorption lines in composite spectra of Lyman break galaxies at z=4 compared
to similar measures at z=3. This might imply a lower covering fraction of neutral gas and hence an
increase with redshift in the escape fraction of ionizing photons. However, our spectral resolution
was inadequate to differentiate between several alternative explanations, including changes
with redshift in the outflow kinematics. Here we present higher quality spectra of 3 gravitationally
lensed Lyman break galaxies at z=4 with a spectral resolution sufficient to break this degeneracy
of interpretation. We present a method for deriving the covering fraction of low-ionization gas
as a function of outflow velocity and compare the results with similar quality data taken for galaxies
at lower redshift. We find a significant trend of lower covering fractions of low-ionization gas
for galaxies with strong \Lya emission. In combination with the demographic trends of \Lya emission
with redshift from our earlier work, our results provide new evidence for a reduction in the average
H I covering fraction, and hence an increase in the escape fraction of ionizing radiation from Lyman
break galaxies, with redshift.
