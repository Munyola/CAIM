We investigated the detailed radio structure of the jet of 1H 0323+342 using high-resolution multi-frequency
Very Long Baseline Array observations. This source is known as the nearest $\gamma$-ray emitting
radio-loud narrow-line Seyfert 1 (NLS1) galaxy. We discovered that the morphology of the inner
jet is well characterized by a parabolic shape, indicating the jet being continuously collimated
near the jet base. On the other hand, we found that the jet expands more rapidly at larger scales, resulting
in a conical-like shape. The location of the "collimation break" is coincident with a bright quasi-stationary
feature at 7 mas from core (corresponding to a deprojected distance of the order of $\sim$100pc),
where the jet width locally contracts together with highly polarized signals, suggesting a recollimation
shock. We found that the collimation region is coincident with the region where the jet speed gradually
accelerates, suggesting the coexistence of the jet acceleration and collimation zone, ending
up with the recollimation shock, which could be a potential site of high-energy $\gamma$-ray flares
detected by the Fermi-LAT. Remarkably, these observational features of the 1H 0323+342 jet are
overall very similar to those of the nearby radio galaxy M87 and HST-1 as well as some blazars, suggesting
that a common jet formation mechanism might be at work. Based on the similarity of the jet profile
between the two sources, we also briefly discuss the mass of the central black hole of 1H 0323+342,
which is also still highly controversial on this source and NLS1s in general.
