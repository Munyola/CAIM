We construct new equations of state for baryons at sub-nuclear densities for the use in core-collapse
simulations of massive stars. The abundance of various nuclei is obtained together with thermodynamic
quantities. A model free energy is constructed, based on the relativistic mean field theory for
nucleons and the mass formula for nuclei with the proton number up to ~ 1000. The formulation is an
extension of the previous model, in which we adopted the liquid drop model to all nuclei under the
nuclear statistical equilibrium. We reformulate the new liquid drop model so that the temperature
dependences of bulk energies could be taken into account. Furthermore, we extend the region in the
nuclear chart, in which shell affects are included, by using theoretical mass data in addition to
experimental ones. We also adopt a quantum theoretical mass evaluation of light nuclei, which incorporates
the Pauli- and self-energy shifts that are not included in the ordinary liquid drop model. The pasta
phases for heavy nuclei are taken into account in the same way as in the previous model. We find that
the abundances of heavy nuclei are modified by the shell effects of nuclei and temperature dependence
of bulk energies. These changes may have an important effect on the rates of electron captures and
coherent neutrino scatterings on nuclei in supernova cores. The abundances of light nuclei are
also modified by the new mass evaluation, which may affect the heating and cooling rates of supernova
cores and shocked envelopes.
