We develop a broadband spectral model, agnsli}, to describe super-Eddington black hole accretion
disc spectra. This is based on the slim disc emissivity, where radial advection keeps the surface
luminosity at the local Eddington limit, resulting in L(r)~ r^{-2} rather than the r^{-3} expected
from the Novikov-Thorne (standard, sub-Eddington) disc emissivity. Wind losses should also be
important but these are expected to produce a similar radiative emissivity. We assume that the flow
is radially stratified, with an outer standard disc, an inner hot Comptonising region and an intermediate
warm Comptonising region to produce the soft X-ray excess. This gives the model enough flexibility
to fit the observed data, but with the additional requirement of energy conservation to give physical
constraints. We use this to fit the broadband spectrum of one of the most extreme Active Galactic
Nuclei, the Narrow Line Seyfert 1 RX J0439.6-5311, which has a black hole mass of (6~9) times 10^6
solar mass as derived from the H_beta line width. This cannot be fit with the standard disc emissivity
at this mass, as even zero spin models overproduce the observed luminosity. Instead, we show that
the spectrum is well reproduced by the slim disc model, giving mass accretion rates around (5~10)
times Eddington limit. There is no constraint on black hole spin as the efficiency is reduced by advection.
Such extreme accretion rates should be characteristic of the first Quasars, and we demonstrate
this by fitting to the spectrum of a recently discovered super-Eddington Quasar, PSO J006+39, at
z=6.6.
