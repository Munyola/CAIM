The cosmic X-ray background (XRB) spectrum and active galaxy number counts encode essential information
about the spectral evolution of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and have been successfully modeled
by XRB synthesis models for many years. Recent measurements of the $8$--$24$ keV AGN number counts
by NuSTAR and Swift-BAT are unable to be simultaneously described by existing XRB synthesis models,
indicating a fundamental breakdown in our understanding of AGN evolution. Here we show that the
$8$--$24$ keV AGN number counts can be successfully modeled with an XRB synthesis model in which
the reflection strength ($R$) in the spectral model increases with redshift. We show that an increase
in reflection strength with redshift is a natural outcome of (1) connecting $R$ to the incidence
of high column density gas around AGNs, and (2) the growth in the AGN obscured fraction to higher redshifts.
In addition to the redshift evolution of $R$, we also find tentative evidence that an increasing
Compton-thick fraction with $z$ is necessary to describe the $8$--$24$ keV AGN number counts determined
by NuSTAR. These results show that, in contrast to the traditional orientation-based AGN unification
model, the nature and covering factor of the absorbing gas and dust around AGNs evolve over time and
must be connected to physical processes in the AGN environment. Future XRB synthesis models must
allow for the redshift evolution of AGN spectral parameters. This approach may reveal fundamental
connections between AGNs and their host galaxies.
