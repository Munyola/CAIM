Likelihood-free inference provides a framework for performing rigorous Bayesian inference using
only forward simulations, properly accounting for all physical and observational effects that
can be successfully included in the simulations. The key challenge for likelihood-free applications
in cosmology, where simulation is typically expensive, is developing methods that can achieve
high-fidelity posterior inference with as few simulations as possible. Density-estimation likelihood-free
inference (DELFI) methods turn inference into a density estimation task on a set of simulated data-parameter
pairs, and give orders of magnitude improvements over traditional Approximate Bayesian Computation
approaches to likelihood-free inference. In this paper we use neural density estimators (NDEs)
to learn the likelihood function from a set of simulated datasets, with active learning to adaptively
acquire simulations in the most relevant regions of parameter space on-the-fly. We demonstrate
the approach on a number of cosmological case studies, showing that for typical problems high-fidelity
posterior inference can be achieved with just $\mathcal{O}(10^3)$ simulations or fewer. In addition
to enabling efficient simulation-based inference, for simple problems where the form of the likelihood
is known, DELFI offers a fast alternative to MCMC sampling, giving orders of magnitude speed-up
in some cases. Finally, we introduce \textsc{pydelfi} -- a flexible public implementation of DELFI
with NDEs and active learning -- available at \url{https://github.com/justinalsing/pydelfi}.
