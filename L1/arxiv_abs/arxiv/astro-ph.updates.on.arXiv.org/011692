A sequence of events, dominated by two outbursts and ending with the preperihelion disintegration
of comet C/2017 S3, is examined. The onset times of the outbursts are determined with high accuracy
from the light curve of the nuclear condensation before it disappeared following the second outburst.
While the brightness of the condensation was declining precipitously, the total brightness continued
to grow in the STEREO-A's HI1 images until two days before perihelion. The red magnitudes measured
in these images refer to a uniform cloud of nuclear fragments, 2200 km^2 in projected area, that began
to expand at a rate of 76 m s^(-1) at the time of the second outburst. A tail extension, detected in some
STEREO-A images, consisted of dust released far from the Sun. Orbital analysis of the ground-based
observations shows that the comet had arrived from the Oort Cloud in a gravitational orbit. Treating
positional residuals as offsets of a companion of a split comet, we confirm the existence of the cloud
of radiation-pressure driven millimeter-sized dust grains emanating from the nucleus during
the second outburst. We detect a similar, but compact and much fainter cloud (or a sizable fluffy
dust aggregate fragment) released at the time of the first outburst. --- The debris would make a sphere
of 140 m across and its kinetic energy is equivalent to the heat of crystallization liberated by 100
tons of amorphous water ice. Ramifications for short-lived companions of the split comets and for
1I `Oumuamua are discussed.
