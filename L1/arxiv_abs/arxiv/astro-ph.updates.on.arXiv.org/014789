A suite of idealised, global, gravitationally unstable, star-forming galactic disc simulations
with 2 pc spatial resolution, performed with the adaptive mesh refinement code RAMSES is used in
this paper to predict the emergent effects of supernova feedback. The simulations include a simplified
prescriptions for formation of single stellar populations of mass $\sim 100 \, M_{\odot}$, radiative
cooling, photoelectric heating, an external gravitational potential for a dark matter halo and
an old stellar disc, self-gravity, and a novel implementation of supernova feedback. The results
of these simulations show that gravitationally unstable discs can generate violent supersonic
winds with mass loading factors $\eta \gtrsim 10$, followed by a galactic fountain phase. These
violent winds are generated by highly clustered supernovae exploding in dense environments created
by gravitational instability, and they are not produced in simulation without self-gravity. The
violent winds significantly perturb the vertical structure of the disc, which is later re-established
during the galactic fountain phase. Gas resettles into a quasi-steady, highly turbulent disc with
volume-weighted velocity dispersion $\sigma > 50 \, {\rm km/s}$. The new configuration drives
weaker galactic winds with mass loading factor $\eta \leq 0.1$. The whole cycle takes place in $\leq
10$ dynamical times. Such high time variability needs to be taken into account when interpreting
observations of galactic winds from starburst and post-starburst galaxies.
