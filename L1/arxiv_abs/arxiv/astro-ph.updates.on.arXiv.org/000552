We perform local, vertically stratified shearing-box MHD simulations of protoplanetary disks
(PPDs) at a fiducial radius of 1 AU that take into account the effects of both Ohmic resistivity and
ambipolar diffusion (AD). The magnetic diffusion coefficients are evaluated self-consistently
from a look-up table based on equilibrium chemistry. We first show that the inclusion of AD dramatically
changes the conventional picture of layered accretion. Without net vertical magnetic field, the
system evolves into a toroidal field dominated configuration with extremely weak turbulence in
the far-UV ionization layer that is far too inefficient to drive rapid accretion. In the presence
of a weak net vertical field (plasma beta~10^5 at midplane), we find that the MRI is completely suppressed,
resulting in a fully laminar flow throughout the vertical extent of the disk. A strong magnetocentrifugal
wind is launched that efficiently carries away disk angular momentum and easily accounts for the
observed accretion rate in PPDs. Moreover, under a physical disk wind geometry, all the accretion
flow proceeds through a strong current layer with thickness of ~0.3H that is offset from disk midplane
with radial velocity of up to 0.4 times the sound speed. Both Ohmic resistivity and AD are essential
for the suppression of the MRI and wind launching. The efficiency of wind transport increases with
increasing net vertical magnetic flux and the penetration depth of the FUV ionization. Our laminar
wind solution has important implications on planet formation and global evolution of PPDs.
