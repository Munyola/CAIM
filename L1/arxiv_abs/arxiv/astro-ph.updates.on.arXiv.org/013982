We examine the relationship between a number of long gamma-ray burst (lGRB) properties (isotropic
emitted energy, luminosity, intrinsic duration, jet opening angle) and redshift. We find that
even when accounting for conservative detector flux limits, there appears to be a significant correlation
between isotropic equivalent energy and redshift, suggesting cosmological evolution of the lGRB
progenitor. Analyzing a sub-sample of lGRBs with jet opening angle estimates, we find the beaming-corrected
lGRB emitted energy does not correlate with redshift, but jet opening angle does. Additionally,
we find a statistically significant anti-correlation between the intrinsic prompt duration and
redshift, even when accounting for potential selection effects. We also find that - for a given redshift
- isotropic energy is positively correlated with intrinsic prompt duration. None of these GRB properties
appear to be correlated with galactic offset. From our selection-effect-corrected redshift distribution,
we estimate a co-moving rate density for lGRBs, and compare this to the global cosmic star formation
rate (SFR). We find the lGRB rate mildly exceeds the global star formation rate between a redshift
of 3 and 5, and declines rapidly at redshifts above this (although we cannot constrain the lGRB rate
above a redshift of about 6 due to sample incompleteness). We find the lGRB rate diverges significantly
from the SFR at lower redshifts. We discuss both the correlations and lGRB rate density in terms of
various lGRB progenitor models and their apparent preference for low-metallicity environments.
