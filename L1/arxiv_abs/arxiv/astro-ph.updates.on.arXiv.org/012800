Decades of studies have suggested several criteria to detect Interplanetary coronal mass ejections
(ICME) in time series from in-situ spacecraft measurements. Among them the most common are an enhanced
and smoothly rotating magnetic field, a low proton temperature and a low plasma beta. However, these
features are not all observed for each ICME due to their strong variability. Visual detection is
time-consuming and biased by the observer interpretation leading to non exhaustive, subjective
and thus hardly reproducible catalogs. Using convolutional neural networks on sliding windows
and peak detection, we provide a fast, automatic and multi-scale detection of ICMEs. The method
has been tested on the in-situ data from WIND between 1997 and 2015 and on the 657 ICMEs that were recorded
during this period. The method offers an unambiguous visual proxy of ICMEs that gives an interpretation
of the data similar to what an expert observer would give. We found at a maximum 197 of the 232 ICMEs
of the 2010-2015 period (recall 84 +-4.5 % including 90% of the ICMEs present in the lists of Nieves-Chinchilla
et al. (2015) and Chi et al. (2016). The minimal number of False Positives was 25 out of 158 predicted
ICMEs (precision 84+-2.6%). Although less accurate, the method also works with one or several missing
input parameters. The method has the advantage of improving its performance by just increasing
the amount of input data. The generality of the method paves the way for automatic detection of many
different event signatures in spacecraft in-situ measurements.
