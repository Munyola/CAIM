Interacting galaxies provide us with an excellent laboratory for studying a number of physical
phenomena associated with these processes. In this paper, we present a spectroscopic and kinematic
analysis of the interacting galaxy NGC 4656 and its companion Tidal Dwarf Galaxy (TDG) candidate,
NGC 4656UV. Using Fabry-Perot and GMOS multi-slit data, we investigated the possible origin of
NGC 4656UV. We found that NGC 4656UV has a low metallicity (12+log(O/H)$\sim$8.2) and it follows
the mass-metallicity relation (MZR) for normal dwarf galaxies. For NGC 4656, we estimated a flat
oxygen abundance gradient of $\beta$ = -0.027$\pm$0.029 dex kpc$^{-1}$, which suggests the presence
of gas flows induced by gravitational interactions. By analysing radial velocity profiles and
by fitting a kinematic model of the observed velocity field, we confirm the literature result that
NGC 4656 consists of one single body instead of two objects. We estimated a dynamical mass of $6.8^{1.8}_{-0.6}\times10^{9}$
M$_{\odot}$ and R of 12.1 kpc from the kinematic model of NGC 4656. Although the observed velocity
field is dominated by rotation at large scales (V$_{max}$/$\sigma\gtrsim$2.8), important non-rotational
motions are present at small scales. Based on these new results, and on previously published information,
we propose that NGC 4656 and 4656UV are a pair of interacting galaxies. NGC 4656UV is a companion of
NGC 4656 and it does not have a tidal origin. The interaction between the two could have triggered
the star formation in NGC 4656UV and increased the star formation in the northeast side of NGC 4656.
