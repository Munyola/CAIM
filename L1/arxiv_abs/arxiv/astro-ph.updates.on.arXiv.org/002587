Galactic interstellar extinction maps are powerful and necessary tools for Milky Way structure
and stellar population analyses, particularly toward the heavily-reddened bulge and in the midplane.
However, due to the difficulty of obtaining reliable extinction measures and distances for a large
number of stars that are independent of these maps, tests of their accuracy and systematics have
been limited. Our goal is to assess a variety of photometric stellar extinction estimates, including
both 2D and 3D extinction maps, using independent extinction measures based on a large spectroscopic
sample of stars towards the Milky Way bulge. We employ stellar atmospheric parameters derived from
high-resolution $H$-band APOGEE spectra, combined with theoretical stellar isochrones, to calculate
line-of-sight extinction and distances for a sample of more than 2400 giants towards the Milky Way
bulge. We compare these extinction values to those predicted by individual near-IR and near+mid-IR
stellar colors, 2D bulge extinction maps and 3D extinction maps. The long baseline, near+mid-IR
stellar colors are, on average, the most accurate predictors of the APOGEE extinction estimates,
and the 2D and 3D extinction maps derived from different stellar populations along different sightlines
show varying degrees of reliability. We present the results of all of the comparisons and discuss
reasons for the observed discrepancies. We also demonstrate how the particular stellar atmospheric
models adopted can have a strong impact on this type of analysis, and discuss related caveats.
