We describe a new method for reducing the shape noise in weak lensing measurements by an order of magnitude.
Our method relies on spectroscopic measurements of disk galaxy rotation and makes use of the Tully-Fisher
relation in order to control for the intrinsic orientations of galaxy disks. For this new proposed
method, so-called Kinematic Lensing (KL), the shape noise ceases to be an important source of statistical
error. We use the CosmoLike software package to simulate likelihood analyses for two Kinematic
Lensing survey concepts (roughly similar in scale to Dark Energy Survey Task Force Stage III and
Stage IV missions) and compare their constraining power to a cosmic shear survey from the Large Synoptic
Survey Telescope (LSST). Our forecasts in seven-dimensional cosmological parameter space include
statistical uncertainties resulting from shape noise, cosmic variance, halo sample variance,
and higher-order moments of the density field. We marginalize over systematic uncertainties arising
from photometric redshift errors and shear calibration biases considering both optimistic and
conservative assumptions about LSST systematic errors. We find that even the KL-Stage III is highly
competitive with the optimistic LSST scenario, while evading the most important sources of theoretical
and observational systematic error inherent in traditional weak lensing techniques. Furthermore,
the KL technique enables a narrow-bin cosmic shear tomography approach to tightly constrain time-dependent
signatures in the dark energy phenomenon.
