We report a solar jet phenomenon associated with successive flares on November 10th 2014. These
explosive events were involved with the satellite spots' emergence around a delta-type sunspot
in the decaying active region NOAA 12205. The data of this jet was provided by Solar Dynamic Observatory
(SDO), X-Ray Telescope (XRT) aboard Hinode, Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS) and
Domeless Solar Telescope (DST) at Hida Observatory, Kyoto University. These plentiful data enabled
us to present this series of papers to discuss the entire processes of the observed phenomena including
the energy storage, event trigger, and energy release. In this paper, we focus on the energy build-up
and trigger phases, by analyzing the photospheric horizontal flow field around the active region
with an optical flow method. The analysis reveals the following three. (i) The observed explosive
phenomena involved three satellite spots, the magnetic fluxes of which successively reconnected
with their pre-existing ambient fields. (ii) All of these satellite spots emerged in the moat region
of a pivotal delta-type sunspot, especially near its convergent boundary with the neighboring
supergranules or moat regions of adjacent sunspots. (iii) Around the jet ejection site, the positive
polarities of satellite spot and adjacent emerging flux encountered the global magnetic field
with negative polarity in the moat region of the pivotal delta-type sunspot, and thus the polarity
inversion line was formed along the convergent boundary of the photospheric horizontal flow channels.
