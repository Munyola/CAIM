We report the results of monitoring of the radio galaxy 3C 120 with the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory,
Very Long Baseline Array, and Mets\"ahovi Radio Observatory. The UV-optical continuum spectrum
and R-band polarization can be explained by a superposition of an inverted-spectrum source with
a synchrotron component containing a disordered magnetic field. The UV-optical and X-ray light
curves include dips and flares, while several superluminal knots appear in the parsec-scale jet.
The recovery time of the second dip was longer at UV-optical wavelengths, in conflict with a model
in which the inner accretion disk (AD) is disrupted during a dip and then refilled from outer to inner
radii. We favor an alternative scenario in which occasional polar alignments of the magnetic field
in the disk and corona cause the flux dips and formation of shocks in the jet. Similar to observations
of Seyfert galaxies, intra-band time lags of flux variations are longer than predicted by the standard
AD model. This suggests that scattering or some other reprocessing occurs. The 37 GHz light curve
is well correlated with the optical-UV variations, with a ~20-day delay. A radio flare in the jet
occurred in a superluminal knot 0.14 milliarcseconds downstream of the 43 GHz "core," which places
the site of the preceding X-ray/UV/optical flare within the core 0.5-1.3 pc from the black hole.
The inverted UV-optical flare spectrum can be explained by a nearly mono-energetic electron distribution
with energy similar to the minimum energy inferred in the TeV gamma-ray emitting regions of some
BL Lacertae objects.
