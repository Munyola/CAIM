We use Gaia DR2 astrometric and photometric data, combined with MESA isochrone and luminosity function
models and radial velocities from literature to infer distances, orbits, surface gravities, and
effective temperatures for all ultra metal-poor stars ($\FeH< -4$ dex) available in the literature.
Assuming that these stars are old ($>11\Gyr$) and that they are expected to belong to the Milky Way
halo, we find that these 41 stars (18 dwarf stars and 23 giants or sub-giants) are currently within
$\sim20$ kpc from the Sun and that they map a wide variety of orbits. A large fraction of those stars
remains confined to the inner parts of the halo and was likely formed or accreted early-on in the history
of the Milky Way, while others have larger apocentres ($>30\kpc$), hinting at later accretion from
dwarf galaxies. Of particular interest, we find evidence that a significant fraction of all known
UMP stars ($\sim29$\%) are on prograde orbits confined within $3\kpc$ of the Milky Way plane ($J_z
< 100 \kms \kpc$). One intriguing interpretation is that these stars belonged to the massive building
block(s) of the proto-Milky Way that formed the backbone of the Milky Way disc. Alternatively, they
may have been brought into the Milky Way by one or more accretion events whose orbit was dragged into
the plane by dynamical friction before disruption. The combination of the exquisite Gaia DR2 data
and surveys of the very metal-poor sky opens an exciting era in which we can trace the very early formation
of the Milky Way.
