We compare the average photospheric current helicity $H_c$, photospheric twist parameter $\alpha$
(a well-known proxy for the full relative magnetic helicity), and subsurface kinetic helicity
$H_k$ for 194 active regions observed between 2006-2013. We use 2440 Hinode photospheric vector
magnetograms, and the corresponding subsurface fluid velocity data derived from GONG (2006-2012)
and HMI (2010-2013) Dopplergrams. We find a significant hemispheric bias in all three parameters.
The subsurface kinetic helicity is preferentially positive in the southern hemisphere and negative
in the northern hemisphere. The photospheric current helicity and the $\alpha$ parameter have
the same bias for strong fields ($|B|>1000$ G) and no significant bias for weak fields (100 G $<|B|<500$
G). We find no significant region-by-region correlation between the subsurface kinetic helicity
and either the strong-field current helicity or $\alpha$. Subsurface fluid motions of a given handedness
correspond to photospheric helicities of both signs in approximately equal numbers. However,
common variations appear in annual averages of these quantities over all regions. Furthermore,
in a subset of 77 regions we find significant correlations between the temporal profiles of the subsurface
and photospheric helicities. In these cases, the sign of the linear correlation coefficient matches
the sign relationship between the helicities, indicating that the photospheric magnetic field
twist is sensitive to the twisting motions below the surface.
