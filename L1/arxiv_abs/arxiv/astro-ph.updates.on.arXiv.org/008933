Dual/binary Supermassive Black Hole (SMBH) systems are the inevitable consequence of the current
Lambda Cold Dark Matter cosmological paradigm. In this context, we discuss here the properties
of MCG+11-11-032, a local (z=0.0362) Seyfert 2 galaxy. This source was proposed as a dual AGN candidate
on the basis of the presence of double-peaked [OIII] emission lines in its optical spectrum. MCG+11-11-032
is also an X-ray variable source and was observed several times by the Swift X-ray Telescope (XRT)
on time scales from days to years. In this work, we analyze the SDSS-DR13 spectrum and find evidence
for double-peaked profiles in all the strongest narrow emission lines. We also study the XRT light
curve and unveil the presence of an alternating behavior of the intrinsic 0.3-10 keV flux, while
the 123-month Swift BAT light curve supports the presence of almost regular peaks and dips almost
every 25 months. In addition, the XRT spectrum suggests for the presence of two narrow emission lines
with rest-frame energies of E~6.16 keV and E~6.56 keV. Although by considering only the optical
emission lines, different physical mechanisms may be invoked to explain the kinematical properties,
the X-ray results are most naturally explained by the presence of a binary SMBH in the center of this
source. In particular, we evidence a remarkable agreement between the putative SMBH pair orbital
velocity derived from the BAT light curve and the velocity offset derived by the rest-frame Delta_E
between the two X-ray line peaks in the XRT spectrum (i.e. Delta_v~0.06c).
