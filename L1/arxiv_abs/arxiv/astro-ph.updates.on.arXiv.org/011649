We study the relativistic, time-independent, low angular momentum, inviscid, advective accretion
flow around Kerr black hole. Considering the relativistic equation of state (REoS), we examine
the transonic properties of the flow and find that there exists an upper bound of the location of the
physically accepted critical point ($r^{\rm max}_{\rm out}$). However, no such limit exists when
an ideal gas equation of state (IEoS) is assumed to describe the flow. Further, we calculate the global
accretion solutions that contain shock waves and separate the domain of parameter space in angular
momentum ($\lambda$) and energy (${\cal E}$) plane. We find ample disagreement between the shock
parameter spaces obtained for REoS and IEoS, respectively. In general, post-shock flow (equivalently
post-shock corona, hereafter PSC) is characterized by shock location ($r_s$) and compression
ratio ($R$, measure of density compression across the shock front) which are uniquely determined
for flow with given input parameters, namely $({\cal E}, \lambda)$. Using $r_s$ and $R$, we empirically
compute the oscillation frequency ($\nu_{QPO}$) of the shock front which is in general quasi-periodic
(QP) in nature and retrace the domain of shock parameter space in the $r_s-R$ plane in terms of $\nu_{QPO}$
for REoS around the weakly as well as rapidly rotating black holes. Finally, we indicate the relevance
of the present work to explain the plausible origin of high frequency QPO (HFQPO) and its connection
with the spin ($a_k$) of the Galactic black hole sources.
