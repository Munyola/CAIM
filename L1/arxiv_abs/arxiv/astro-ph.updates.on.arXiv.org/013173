The Reduced Relativistic Gas (RRG) is a simplified version of the ideal relativistic gas, which
assumes that all particles have the same momentum magnitude. Although this is a very idealized situation,
the resulting model preserves the phenomenology of Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution and, in some
situations, can be described as a perfect fluid, without introducing large errors in both cosmological
background and first-order perturbations. The perfect fluid description of RRG model was already
used to study the warmness of dark matter, massive neutrinos and interaction of baryons and photons
before recombination, showing very good agreement with previous works based on the full Einstein-Boltzmann
system of equations. In order to understand these results and construct a more general and formal
framework for RRG, we develop a theoretical description of first-order cosmological perturbations
of RRG, based on a distribution function which encodes the simplifying assumption that all particles
have the same momentum magnitude. The full set of Einstein-Boltzmann equations for RRG distribution
are derived and quantities beyond the perfect fluid approximation are studied. Using RRG to describe
warm dark matter, we show that, for particles with $m \sim \text{keV}$, the perfect fluid approximation
is valid on scales $k < 10\, \text{h}/\text{Mpc}$, for most of the universe evolution. We also determine
initial conditions for RRG in the early universe and study the evolution of potential in a toy model
of universe composed only by RRG.
