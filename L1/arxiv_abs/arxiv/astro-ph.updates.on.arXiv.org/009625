We study the evolution of binary systems of Ultra-luminous X-ray sources and compute their optical
emission assuming accretion onto a black hole via a non standard, advection-dominated slim disc
with an outflow. We consider systems with black holes of $20M_{\odot}$ and $100M_{\odot}$, and
donor masses between $8M_{\odot}$ and $25M_{\odot}$. Super-critical accretion has considerable
effects on the optical emission. The irradiating flux in presence of an outflow remains considerably
stronger than that produced by a standard disc. However, at very high accretion rates the contribution
of X-ray irradiation becomes progressively less important in comparison with the intrinsic flux
emitted from the disc. After Main Sequence the evolutionary tracks of the optical counterpart on
the colour-magnitude diagram are markely different from those computed for Eddington-limited
accretion. Systems with stellar-mass black holes and $12-20 M_{\odot}$ donors accreting supercritically
are characterized by blue colors (F450W -- F555W $\simeq - 0.2 : +0.1$) and high luminosity ($M_{V}
\simeq - 4 : - 6.5$). Systems with more massive black holes accreting supercritically from evolved
donors of similar mass have comparable colours but can reach $M_V \simeq - 8$. We apply our model to
NGC 1313 X-2 and NGC 4559 X-7. Both sources are well represented by a system accreting above Eddington
from a massive evolved donor. For NGC 1313 X-2 the agreement is for a $\sim 20M_{\odot}$ black hole,
while NGC4559 X-7 requires a significantly more massive black hole.
