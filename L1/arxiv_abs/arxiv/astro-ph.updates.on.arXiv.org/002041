We use a parent sample of 118 gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglows, with known redshift and host galaxy
extinction, to separate afterglows with and without signatures of dominant reverse-shock emission
and to determine which physical conditions lead to a prominent reverse-shock emission. We identify
10 GRBs with reverse shock signatures - GRBs 990123, 021004, 021211, 060908, 061126, 080319B, 081007,
090102, 090424 and 130427A. By modeling their optical afterglows with reverse and forward shock
analytic light curves and using Monte Carlo simulations, we estimate the parameter space of the
physical quantities describing the ejecta and circumburst medium. We find that physical properties
cover a wide parameter space and do not seem to cluster around any preferential values. Comparing
the rest-frame optical, X-ray and high-energy properties of the larger sample of non-RS-dominated
GRBs, we show that the early-time ($<$ 1ks) optical spectral luminosity, X-ray afterglow luminosity
and $\gamma$-ray energy output of our reverse-shock dominated sample do not differ significantly
from the general population at early times. However, the GRBs with dominant reverse shock emission
have fainter than average optical forward-shock emission at late time ($>$ 10 ks). We find that
GRBs with an identifiable reverse shock component show high magnetization parameter $R_{\mathrm{B}}
= \varepsilon_{\rm B,r}/\varepsilon_{\rm B,f} \sim 2 - 10^4$. Our results are in agreement with
the mildly magnetized baryonic jet model of GRBs.
