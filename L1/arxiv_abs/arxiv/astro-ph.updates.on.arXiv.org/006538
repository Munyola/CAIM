How can scientists conclude with high confidence that an exoplanet hosts life? As telescopes come
on line over the next 20 years that can directly observe photons from terrestrial exoplanets, this
question will dictate the activities of many scientists across many fields. The expected data will
be sparse and with low signal-to-noise, which will make disentangling biosignatures from abiotic
features challenging. Our Earth is not just unique in that it hosts life, it is also the only terrestrial
planet with direct observations of its interior through seismic waves, and compositional evolution
through field and laboratory measurements. This extensive research reveals a planet born from
collisions between worlds, followed by a complicated biogeochemical evolution. Exoplanet interiors,
on the other hand, can only be constrained by the following observations: 1) photometric and spectroscopic
analysis of the planet's atmosphere, 2) spectroscopic and photometric analysis of the host star,
and 3) companion planet properties. From these (future) data, astrobiologists must generate plausible
compositional and evolutionary models that constrain a potentially habitable exoplanet's internal
properties and history, provide environmental context, and rule out geochemical explanations
for any putative biosignatures. The goal of this white paper is to frame the role of geophysical and
geochemical processes relevant to the search for life beyond the Solar System and to identify critical,
but understudied, areas of future research.
