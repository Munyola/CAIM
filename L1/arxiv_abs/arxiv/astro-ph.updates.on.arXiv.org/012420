We perform hydrodynamical simulations of the interaction between supernova (SN) ejecta and circumstellar
medium (CSM) for SN 1993J and SN 2011dh, and calculate the radio and X-ray emissions expected from
the shocked gas at late epochs ($t$). Considering the ejecta structure from multi-group radiation
hydrodynamics simulation, we find that the observed rapid drop in radio and X-ray light curves of
SN 1993J at $t>$3000 days can be due to a change in the mass-loss rate ($\dot M$) around $\sim$6500
years prior to the explosion of the SN. The exact epoch scales inversely with the assumed wind velocity
of $v_{\rm w}=10~ km~s^{-1}$. The progenitor of this SN very likely belonged to a binary system,
where, during its evolution, the primary had transferred material to the secondary. It is argued
in the paper that the change in $\dot M$ can happen because of a change in the mass accretion efficiency
($\eta$) of the companion star. It is possible that before $\sim6500~(v_{\rm w}/10~km~s^{-1})^{-1}$years
prior to the explosion, $\eta$ was high, thus the CSM was tenuous, which causes the late time downturn
in fluxes. In the case of SN 2011dh, the late time evolution is found to be consistent with a wind medium
with $\dot M/v_{\rm w}=4\times10^{-6 }~M_{\odot}~ yr^{-1}/10 ~{km ~s^{-1}}$. It is difficult
from our analysis to predict whether the progenitor of this SN had a binary companion, however, if
future observations show similar decrease in radio and X-ray fluxes, then that would give strong
support to a scenario where both SNe had undergone similar kind of binary evolution before explosion.
