We present a multiwavelength examination of the supernova remnant (SNR) S26 in the nearby galaxy
NGC 300 using data from Chandra X-ray Observatory, XMM-Newton X-ray Observatory, Hubble Space
Telescope (HST), the Very Large Array, and the Australia Telescope Compact Array. We simultaneously
fit all of the available X-ray data with a thermal plasma model and find a temperature of $0.77 \pm
0.13$ keV with a hydrogen column density of ($9.7^{+6.4}_{-4.8}$)$\times 10^{20}$ cm$^{-2}$.
HST imaging allows us to measure a semimajor axis of $0.78 \pm 0.10$ arcsec ($7.5 \pm 1.0$ pc) and a
semiminor axis of $0.69^{+0.14}_{-0.12}$ arcsec ($6.7^{+1.2}_{-1.4}$ pc). This precise size
helps to constrain the age and velocity of the shock to be ($3.3^{+0.7}_{-0.6}$)$\times 10^{3}$
yr and $411^{+275}_{-122}$ km s$^{-1}$. We also fit photometry of the surrounding stars to infer
the age and mass of the progenitor star to be $8 \pm 1$ Myr and $25^{+1}_{-5}$ M$_{\odot}$. Based on
measured radio properties of the source and assuming equipartition, the estimated radio luminosity
of $\sim 1.7 \times 10^{34}$ erg s$^{-1}$ over the $10^{8}-10^{11}$ Hz frequency range results
in a minimum magnetic field associated with this SNR of $0.067$ mG and the minimum energy needed to
power the observed synchrotron emission of $1.5 \times 10^{49}$ erg. The size and temperature of
N300-S26 appear to be similar to the Galactic SNR G311.5-0.3 except that G311.5-0.3 has a significantly
lower X-ray luminosity, is older, and has a slower shock velocity.
