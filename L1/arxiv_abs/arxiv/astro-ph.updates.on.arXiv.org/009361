The Mexico-UK Sub-millimetre Camera for AsTronomy (MUSCAT) is a large-format, millimetre-wave
camera consisting of 1,500 background-limited lumped-element kinetic inductance detectors
(LEKIDs) scheduled for deployment on the Large Millimeter Telescope (Volc\'an Sierra Negra, Mexico)
in 2018. MUSCAT is designed for observing at 1.1 mm and will utilise the full 40' field of view of the
LMTs upgraded 50-m primary mirror. In its primary role, MUSCAT is designed for high-resolution
follow-up surveys of both galactic and extra-galactic sub-mm sources identified by Herschel.
MUSCAT is also designed to be a technology demonstrator that will provide the first on-sky demonstrations
of novel design concepts such as horn-coupled LEKID arrays and closed continuous cycle miniature
dilution refrigeration. Here we describe some of the key design elements of the MUSCAT instrument
such as the novel use of continuous sorption refrigerators and a miniature dilutor for continuous
100-mK cooling of the focal plane, broadband optical coupling to Aluminium LEKID arrays using waveguide
chokes and anti-reflection coating materials as well as with the general mechanical and optical
design of MUSCAT. We explain how MUSCAT is designed to be simple to upgrade and the possibilities
for changing the focal plane unit that allows MUSCAT to act as a demonstrator for other novel technologies
such as multi-chroic polarisation sensitive pixels and on-chip spectrometry in the future. Finally,
we will report on the current status of MUSCAT's commissioning.
