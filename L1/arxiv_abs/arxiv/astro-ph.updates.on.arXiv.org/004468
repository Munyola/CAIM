Observations of the meridional circulation of the Sun, which plays a key role in the operation of
the solar dynamo, indicate that its speed varies with the solar cycle, becoming faster during the
solar minima and slower during the solar maxima. To explain this variation of the meridional circulation
with the solar cycle, we construct a theoretical model by coupling the equation of the meridional
circulation (the $\phi$ component of the vorticity equation within the solar convection zone)
with the equations of the flux transport dynamo model. We consider the back reaction due to the Lorentz
force of the dynamo-generated magnetic fields and study the perturbations produced in the meridional
circulation due to it. This enables us to model the variations of the meridional circulation without
developing a full theory of the meridional circulation itself. We obtain results which reproduce
the observational data of solar cycle variations of the meridional circulation reasonably well.
We get the best results on assuming the turbulent viscosity acting on the velocity field to be comparable
to the magnetic diffusivity (i.e. on assuming the magnetic Prandtl number to be close to unity).
We have to assume an appropriate bottom boundary condition to ensure that the Lorentz force cannot
drive a flow in the subadiabatic layers below the bottom of the tachocline. Our results are sensitive
to this bottom boundary condition. We also suggest a hypothesis how the observed inward flow towards
the active regions may be produced.
