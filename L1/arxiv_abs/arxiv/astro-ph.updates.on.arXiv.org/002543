A key test of the supernova triggering and injection hypothesis for the origin of the solar system's
short-lived radioisotopes is to reproduce the inferred initial abundances of these isotopes.
We present here the most detailed models to date of the shock wave triggering and injection process,
where shock waves with varied properties strike fully three dimensional, rotating, dense cloud
cores. The models are calculated with the FLASH adaptive mesh hydrodynamics code. Three different
outcomes can result: triggered collapse leading to fragmentation into a multiple protostar system;
triggered collapse leading to a single protostar embedded in a protostellar disk; or failure to
undergo dynamic collapse. Shock wave material is injected into the collapsing clouds through Rayleigh-Taylor
fingers, resulting in initially inhomogeneous distributions in the protostars and protostellar
disks. Cloud rotation about an axis aligned with the shock propagation direction does not increase
the injection efficiency appreciably, as the shock parameters were chosen to be optimal for injection
even in the absence of rotation. For a shock wave from a core-collapse supernova, the dilution factors
for supernova material are in the range of $\sim 10^{-4}$ to $\sim 3 \times 10^{-4}$, in agreement
with recent laboratory estimates of the required amount of dilution for $^{60}$Fe and $^{26}$Al.
We conclude that a type II supernova remains as a promising candidate for synthesizing the solar
system's short-lived radioisotopes shortly before their injection into the presolar cloud core
by the supernova's remnant shock wave.
