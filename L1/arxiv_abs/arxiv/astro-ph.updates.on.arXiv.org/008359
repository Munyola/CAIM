Zonal flows in rotating systems have been previously shown to be suppressed by the imposition of
a background magnetic field aligned with the direction of rotation. Understanding the physics
behind the suppression may be important in systems found in astrophysical fluid dynamics, such
as stellar interiors. However, the mechanism of suppression has not yet been explained. In the idealized
setting of a magnetized beta plane, we provide a theoretical explanation that shows how magnetic
fluctuations directly counteract the growth of weak zonal flows. Two distinct calculations yield
consistent conclusions. The first, which is simpler and more physically transparent, extends
the Kelvin-Orr shearing wave to include magnetic fields and shows that weak, long-wavelength shear
flow organizes magnetic fluctuations to absorb energy from the mean flow. The second calculation,
based on the quasilinear, statistical CE2 framework, is valid for arbitrary wavelength zonal flow
and predicts a self-consistent growth rate of the zonal flow. We find that a background magnetic
field suppresses zonal flow if the bare Alfven frequency is comparable to or larger than the bare
Rossby frequency. However, suppression can occur for even smaller magnetic field if the resistivity
is sufficiently small enough to allow sizable magnetic fluctuations. Our calculations reproduce
the $\eta/B_0^2 = \text{const.}$ scaling that describes the boundary of zonation, as found in previous
work, and we explicitly link this scaling to the amplitude of magnetic fluctuations.
