Using GALEX, UVOT and optical photometry, we explore the prevalence and strength of the UV-upturn
in the spectra of quiescent early type galaxies in several nearby clusters. Even for galaxies with
completely passive optical colours, there is a large spread in vacuum UV colour consistent with
almost all having some UV upturn component. Combining GALEX and UVOT data below 3000\AA, we generate
for the first time comparatively detailed UV SEDs for Coma cluster galaxies. Fitting the UV upturn
component with a blackbody, twenty six of these show a range of characteristic temperatures (10000--21000K)
for the UV upturn population. Assuming a single temperature to explain GALEX-optical colours could
underestimate the fraction of galaxies with UV upturns and mis-classify some as systems with residual
star formation. The UV upturn phenomenon is not an exclusive feature found only in giant galaxies;
we identify galaxies with similar (or even bluer) $FUV-V$ colours to the giants with upturns over
a range of fainter luminosities. The temperature and strength of the UV upturn are correlated with
galaxy mass. Under the plausible hypothesis that the sources of the UV upturn are blue horizontal
branch stars, the most likely mechanism for this is the presence of a substantial (between 4\% and
20\%) Helium rich ($Y > 0.3$) population of stars in these galaxies, potentially formed at $z\sim
4$ and certainly at $z>2$; this plausibly sets a lower limit of $\sim {\rm 0.3 - 0.8} \times 10^{10}$
$M_{\odot}$ to the {\it in situ} stellar mass of $\sim L^*$ galaxies at this redshift.
