The study of quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) of X-ray flux observed in the stellar-mass black
hole binaries can provide a powerful tool for testing of the phenomena occurring in strong gravity
regime. The high frequency (HF) QPOs usually come in pairs of double peaks which have a frequency
ratio close to $3:2$. In addition to HF QPOs, some sources display simultaneous existence of the
low frequency (LF) QPOs in Fourier power spectra. We demonstrate that the explanation of these phenomena
can be well related to the epicyclic oscillations of charged particles in accretion disks orbiting
Kerr black holes immersed in external large-scale magnetic fields. Magnetized versions of the
standard geodesic models of QPOs can explain the observationally fixed data from the three microquasars.
We perform a successful fitting of the HF QPOs observed in three microquasars, GRS 1915+105, XTE
1550-564 and GRO 1655-40, containing black holes, for magnetised versions of both epicyclic rezonance
and relativistic precession models and discuss the corresponding constraints of parameters of
the model, which are the mass and spin of black hole and the parameter related to the external magnetic
field. Assuming the main source of synchrotron radiation producing X-rays are the relativistic
electrons, we estimate the magnetic field in the vicinity of the black hole in the three sources to
be of order $10^{-5}$ Gs which can serve as possible signature of the Galactic magnetic field magnitude.
For heavier particles (protons, ions) larger magnetic fields are necessary for fitting the data.
