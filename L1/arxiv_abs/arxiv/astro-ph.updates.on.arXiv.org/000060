The Solar Diameter Imager and Surface Mapper (SODISM) on board the PICARD space mission provides
wide-field images of the photosphere and chromosphere of the Sun in five narrow pass bands (centered
at 215.0, 393.37, 535.7, 607.1, and 782.2 nm). PICARD is a space mission, which was successfully
launched on 15 June 2010 into a Sun synchronous dawn-dusk orbit. It represents a European asset aiming
at collecting solar observations that can serve to estimate some of the inputs to Earth climate models.
The scientific payload consists of the SODISM imager and of two radiometers, SOVAP (SOlar VAriability
PICARD) and PREMOS (PREcision MOnitor Sensor), which carry out measurements that allow estimating
the Total Solar Irradiance (TSI) and the Solar Spectral Irradiance (SSI) from the middle ultraviolet
to the red. The SODISM telescope monitors solar activity continuously. It thus produces images
that can also feed SSI reconstruction models. Further, the objectives of SODISM encompass the probing
of the interior of the Sun via helioseismic analysis of observations in intensity (on the solar disc
and at the limb), and via astrometric investigations at the limb. The latter addresses especially
the spectral dependence of the radial limb shape, and the temporal evolution of the solar diameter
and asphericity. After a brief review of its original science objectives, this paper presents the
detailed design of the SODISM instrument, its expected performance, and the scheme of its flight
operations. Some observations with SODISM are presented and discussed.
