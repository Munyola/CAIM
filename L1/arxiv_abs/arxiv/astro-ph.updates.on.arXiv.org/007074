We propose a Bayesian uncertainty quantification method for large-scale imaging inverse problems.
Our method applies to all Bayesian models that are log-concave, where maximum-a-posteriori (MAP)
estimation is a convex optimization problem. The method is a framework to analyse the confidence
in specific structures observed in MAP estimates (e.g., lesions in medical imaging, celestial
sources in astronomical imaging), to enable using them as evidence to inform decisions and conclusions.
Precisely, following Bayesian decision theory, we seek to assert the structures under scrutiny
by performing a Bayesian hypothesis test that proceeds as follows: firstly, it postulates that
the structures are not present in the true image, and then seeks to use the data and prior knowledge
to reject this null hypothesis with high probability. Computing such tests for imaging problems
is generally very difficult because of the high dimensionality involved. A main feature of this
work is to leverage probability concentration phenomena and the underlying convex geometry to
formulate the Bayesian hypothesis test as a convex problem, that we then efficiently solve by using
scalable optimization algorithms. This allows scaling to high-resolution and high-sensitivity
imaging problems that are computationally unaffordable for other Bayesian computation approaches.
We illustrate our methodology, dubbed BUQO (Bayesian Uncertainty Quantification by Optimization),
on a range of challenging Fourier imaging problems arising in astronomy and medicine.
