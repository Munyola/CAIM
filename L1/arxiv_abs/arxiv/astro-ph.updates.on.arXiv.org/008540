Context. With the outstanding spatial resolution and sensitivity of the Atacama Large Millimeter/sub-millimeter
Array (ALMA), molecular gas other than the abundant CO can be observed and resolved in circumstellar
envelopes (CSEs) around evolved stars, such as the binary S-type Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB)
star W Aquilae. Aims. We aim to constrain the chemical composition of the CSE and determine the radial
abundance distribution, the photospheric peak abundance, and isotopic ratios of a selection of
chemically important molecular species in the innermost CSE of W Aql. The derived parameters are
put into the context of the chemical evolution of AGB stars and are compared with theoretical models.
Methods. We employ one-dimensional radiative transfer modeling - with the accelerated lambda
iteration (ALI) radiative transfer code - of the radial abundance distribution of a total of five
molecular species (CS, SiS, 30SiS, 29SiO and H13CN) and determine the best fitting model parameters
based on high-resolution ALMA observations as well as archival single-dish observations. The
additional advantage of the spatially resolved ALMA observations is that we can directly constrain
the radial profile of the observed line transitions from the observations. Results. We derive abundances
and e-folding radii for CS, SiS, 30SiS, 29SiO and H13CN and compare them to previous studies, which
are based only on unresolved single-dish spectra. Our results are in line with previous results
and are more accurate due to resolution of the emission regions.
