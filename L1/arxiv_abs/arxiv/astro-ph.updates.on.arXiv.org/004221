Using a potential field source surface (PFSS) model, we recently analyzed the global topology of
the background coronal magnetic field for a sequence of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) that occurred
on 2010 August 1-2. Here we repeat this analysis for the background field reproduced by a magnetohydrodynamic
(MHD) model that incorporates plasma thermodynamics. As for the PFSS model, we find that all three
CME source regions contain a coronal hole that is separated from neighboring coronal holes by topologically
very similar pseudo-streamer structures. However, the two models yield very different results
for the size, shape, and flux of the coronal holes. We find that the helmet-streamer cusp line, which
corresponds to a source-surface null line in the PFSS model, is structurally unstable and does not
form in the MHD model. Our analysis indicates that generally, in MHD configurations, this line rather
consists of a multiple-null separator passing along the edge of disconnected flux regions. Some
of these regions are transient and may be the origin of so-called streamer blobs. We show that the
core topological structure of such blobs is a three-dimensional "plasmoid", consisting of two
conjoined flux ropes of opposite handedness, which connect at a spiral null point of the magnetic
field. Our analysis reveals that such plasmoids appear also in pseudo-streamers on much smaller
scales. These new insights into the coronal magnetic topology provide some intriguing implications
for solar energetic particle events and for the properties of the slow solar wind.
