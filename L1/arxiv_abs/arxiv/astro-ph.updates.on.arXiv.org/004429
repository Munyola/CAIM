We use a new contiguous imaging survey conducted using the Dark Energy Camera to investigate the
distribution and properties of young stellar populations in the Magellanic inter-Cloud region.
These young stars are strongly spatially clustered, forming a narrow chain of low-mass associations
that trace the densest HI gas in the Magellanic Bridge and extend, in projection, from the SMC to the
outer disk of the LMC. The associations in our survey footprint have ages $\lesssim 30$ Myr, masses
in the range $\sim 100-1200\,{\rm M}_\odot$, and very diffuse structures with half-light radii
of up to $\sim 100$ pc. The two most populous are strongly elliptical, and aligned to $\approx 10^{{\rm
o}}$ with the axis joining the centres of the LMC and SMC. These observations strongly suggest that
the young inter-Cloud populations formed in situ, likely due to the compression of gas stripped
during the most recent close LMC-SMC encounter. The associations lie at distances intermediate
between the two Clouds, and we find no evidence for a substantial distance gradient across the imaged
area. Finally, we identify a vast shell of young stars surrounding a central association, that is
spatially coincident with a low column density bubble in the HI distribution. The properties of
this structure are consistent with a scenario where stellar winds and supernova explosions from
massive stars in the central cluster swept up the ambient gas into a shell, triggering a new burst
of star formation. This is a prime location for studying stellar feedback in a relatively isolated
environment.
