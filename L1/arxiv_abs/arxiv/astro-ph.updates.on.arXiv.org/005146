Faint star-forming galaxies at $z\sim 2-3$ can be used as alternative background sources to probe
the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest in addition to quasars, yielding high sightline densities that enable
3D tomographic reconstruction of the foreground absorption field. Here, we present the first data
release from the COSMOS Lyman-Alpha Mapping And Mapping Observations (CLAMATO) Survey, which
was conducted with the LRIS spectrograph on the Keck-I telescope. Over an observational footprint
of 0.157$\mathrm{deg}^2$ within the COSMOS field, we used 240 galaxies and quasars at $2.17<z<3.00$,
with a mean comoving transverse separation of $2.37\,h^{-1}\,\mathrm{Mpc^3}$, as background
sources probing the foreground Lyman-$\alpha$ forest absorption at $2.05<z<2.55$. The Lyman-$\alpha$
forest data was then used to create a Wiener-filtered tomographic reconstruction over a comoving
volume of $3.15\,\times 10^5\,h^{-3}\,\mathrm{Mpc^3}$ with an effective smoothing scale of
$2.5\,h^{-1}\,\mathrm{Mpc}$. In addition to traditional figures, this map is also presented
as a virtual-reality YouTube360 video visualization and manipulable interactive figure. We see
large overdensities and underdensities that visually agree with the distribution of coeval galaxies
from spectroscopic redshift surveys in the same field, including overdensities associated with
several recently-discovered galaxy protoclusters in the volume. This data release includes the
redshift catalog, reduced spectra, extracted Lyman-$\alpha$ forest pixel data, and tomographic
map of the absorption.
