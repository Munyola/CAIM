We use a particle tracking analysis to study the origins of the circumgalactic medium (CGM), separating
it into (1) accretion from the intergalactic medium (IGM), (2) wind from the central galaxy, and
(3) gas ejected from other galaxies. Our sample consists of 21 FIRE-2 simulations, spanning the
halo mass range log(Mh/Msun) ~ 10-12 , and we focus on z=0.25 and z=2. Owing to strong stellar feedback,
only ~L* halos retain a baryon mass >~50% of their cosmic budget. Metals are more efficiently retained
by halos, with a retention fraction >~50%. Across all masses and redshifts analyzed >~60% of the
CGM mass originates as IGM accretion (some of which is associated with infalling halos). Overall,
the second most important contribution is wind from the central galaxy, though gas ejected or stripped
from satellites can contribute a comparable mass in ~L* halos. Gas can persist in the CGM for billions
of years, resulting in well-mixed halo gas. Sight lines through the CGM are therefore likely to intersect
gas of multiple origins. For low-redshift ~L* halos, cool gas (T<10^4.7 K) is distributed on average
preferentially along the galaxy plane, however with strong halo-to-halo variability. The metallicity
of IGM accretion is systematically lower than the metallicity of winds (typically by >~1 dex), although
CGM and IGM metallicities depend significantly on the treatment of subgrid metal diffusion. Our
results highlight the multiple physical mechanisms that contribute to the CGM and will inform observational
efforts to develop a cohesive picture.
