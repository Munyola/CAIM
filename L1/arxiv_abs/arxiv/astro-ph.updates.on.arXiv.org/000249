We present a study of correlations between the elemental abundances and galaxy morphologies of
91 blue compact galaxies (BCGs) at z=0.20-0.35 with Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) DR7 data. We
classify the morphologies of the galaxies as either 'disturbed' or 'undisturbed', by visual inspection
of the SDSS images, and using the Gini coefficient and M_20. We derive oxygen and nitrogen abundances
using the T_e method. We find that a substantial fraction of BCGs with disturbed morphologies, indicative
of merger remnants, show relatively high N/O and low O/H abundance ratios. The majority of the disturbed
BCGs exhibit higher N/O values at a given O/H value compared to the morphologically undisturbed
galaxies, implying more efficient nitrogen enrichment in disturbed BCGs. We detect Wolf-Rayet
(WR) features in only a handful of the disturbed BCGs, which appears to contradict the idea that WR
stars are responsible for high nitrogen abundance. Combining these results with Galaxy Evolution
Explorer (GALEX) GR6 ultraviolet (UV) data, we find that the majority of the disturbed BCGs show
systematically lower values of the H alpha to near-UV star formation rate ratio. The equivalent
width of the H beta emission line is also systematically lower in the disturbed BCGs. Based on these
results, we infer that disturbed BCGs have undergone star formation over relatively longer time
scales, resulting in a more continuous enrichment of nitrogen. We suggest that this correlation
between morphology and chemical abundances in BCGs is due to a difference in their recent star formation
histories.
