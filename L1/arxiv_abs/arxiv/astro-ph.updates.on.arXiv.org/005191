Spinning small silicate grains were recently invoked to account for the Galactic foreground anomalous
microwave emission. These grains, if present, will absorb starlight in the far ultraviolet (UV).
There is also renewed interest in attributing the enigmatic 2175 Angstrom interstellar extinction
bump to small silicates. To probe the role of silicon in the UV extinction, we explore the relations
between the amount of silicon required to be locked up in silicates [Si/H]_{dust} and the 2175 Angstrom
bump or the far-UV extinction rise, based on an analysis of the extinction curves along 46 Galactic
sightlines for which the gas-phase silicon abundance [Si/H]_{gas} is known. We derive [Si/H]_{dust}
either from {[Si/H]_{ISM} - [Si/H]_{gas}} or from the Kramers-Kronig relation which relates the
wavelength-integrated extinction to the total dust volume, where [Si/H]_{ISM} is the interstellar
silicon reference abundance and taken to be that of proto-Sun or B stars. We also derive [Si/H]_{dust}
from fitting the observed extinction curves with a mixture of amorphous silicates and graphitic
grains. We find that in all three cases [Si/H]_{dust} shows no correlation with the 2175 Angstrom
bump, while the carbon depletion [C/H]_{dust} tends to correlate with the 2175 Angstrom bump. This
supports carbon grains instead of silicates as the possible carrier of the 2175 Angstrom bump. We
also find that neither [Si/H]_{dust} nor [C/H]_{dust} alone correlates with the far-UV extinction,
suggesting that the far-UV extinction is a combined effect of small carbon grains and silicates.
