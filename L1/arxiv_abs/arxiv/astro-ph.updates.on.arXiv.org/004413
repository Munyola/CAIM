The blazar 3C454.3 exhibited a strong flare seen in gamma-rays, X-rays, and optical/NIR bands during
3--12 December 2009. Emission in the V and J bands rose more gradually than did the gamma-rays and
soft X-rays, though all peaked at nearly the same time. Optical polarization measurements showed
dramatic changes during the flare, with a strong anti-correlation between optical flux and degree
of polarization (which rose from ~ 3% to ~ 20%) during the declining phase of the flare. The flare was
accompanied by large rapid swings in polarization angle of ~ 170 degree. This combination of behaviors
appear to be unique. We have cm-band radio data during the same period but they show no correlation
with variations at higher frequencies. Such peculiar behavior may be explained using jet models
incorporating fully relativistic effects with a dominant source region moving along a helical
path or by a shock-in-jet model incorporating three-dimensional radiation transfer if there is
a dominant helical magnetic field. We find that spectral energy distributions at different times
during the flare can be fit using modified one-zone models where only the magnetic field strength
and particle break frequencies and normalizations need change. An optical spectrum taken at nearly
the same time provides an estimate for the central black hole mass of ~ 2.3 * 10^9 M_sun. We also consider
two weaker flares seen during the $\sim 200$ d span over which multi-band data are available. In one
of them, the V and J bands appear to lead the $\gamma$-ray and X-ray bands by a few days; in the other,
all variations are simultaneous.
