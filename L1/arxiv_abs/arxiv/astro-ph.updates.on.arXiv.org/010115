The dust-to-metals ratio describes the fraction of the heavy elements contained in dust grains,
and its variation provides key insights into the life cycle of dust. We measure the dust-to-metals
ratio in M101, a nearby galaxy with a radial metallicity (Z) gradient spanning $\sim$1 dex. We fit
the dust spectral energy distribution from 100 to 500 $\mu m$ with five variants of the modified blackbody
dust emission model in which we vary the temperature distribution and how emissivity depends on
wavelength. Among them, the model with a single temperature blackbody modified by a broken power-law
emissivity gives the statistically best fit and physically most plausible results. Using these
results, we show that the dust-to-gas ratio is proportional to $\rm Z^{1.7}$. This implies that
the dust-to-metals ratio is not constant in M101, but decreases as a function of radius, equivalent
to a lower fraction of metals trapped in dust at low metallicity (large radius). The dust-to-metals
ratio in M101 remains at or above what would be predicted by the minimum depletion level of metals
observed in the Milky Way. Our current knowledge of metallicity-dependent CO-to-H$_2$ conversion
factor suggests that variations in the conversion factor cannot be responsible for the dust-to-metals
ratio trends we observe. This change of dust-to-metals ratio is significantly correlated with
molecular hydrogen fraction, which suggests that the accretion of gas phase metals onto existing
dust grains could be a mechanism contributing to a variable dust-to-metals ratio.
