While we observe a large amount of cold interstellar gas and dust in a subset of the early-type galaxy
(ETG) population, the source of this material remains unclear. The two main, competing scenarios
are external accretion of lower mass, gas-rich dwarfs and internal production from stellar mass
loss and/or cooling from the hot interstellar medium (ISM). We test these hypotheses with measurements
of the stellar and nebular metallicities of three ETGs (NGC 2768, NGC 3245, and NGC 4694) from new
long-slit, high signal-to-noise ratio spectroscopy from the Multi-Object Double Spectographs
(MODs) on the Large Binocular Telescope (LBT). These ETGs have modest star formation rates and minimal
evidence of nuclear activity. We model the stellar continuum to derive chemical abundances and
measure gas-phase abundances with standard nebular diagnostics. We find that the stellar and gas-phase
abundances are very similar, which supports internal production and is very inconsistent with
the accretion of smaller, lower metallicity dwarfs. All three of these galaxies are also consistent
with an extrapolation of the mass-metallicity relation to higher mass galaxies with lower specific
star formation rates. The emission line flux ratios along the long-slit, as well as global line ratios
clearly indicate that photoionization dominates and ionization by alternate sources including
AGN activity, shocks, cosmic rays, dissipative magnetohydrodynamic waves, and single degenerate
Type Ia supernovae progenitors do not significantly affect the line ratios.
