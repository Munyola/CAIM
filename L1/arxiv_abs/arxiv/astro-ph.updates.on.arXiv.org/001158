We present new, accurate quantum calculations of the reaction rates of methyldyne depleted by hydrogen
atoms for temperature ranging from 10 K to 1000 K. Although a wide range of calculations have been
presented over the years on the chemistry of CH+, no final assessment for this reaction has been given
in the literature. In this study, the negative imaginary potential (NIP) approach, which has been
previously shown in other systems to provide accurate results for ionic reactions, was employed
to generate quantum reaction cross sections for the depletion path: CH+ + H -> C+ + H2. The relevant
rates obtained have been compared with the available experimental data and with various earlier
calculations. Our results were found to be in very good agreement with the quantum close-coupling
results reported by Warmbier et al. 2011 and also follow the general behaviour found from cold-trap
experiment. The new rates have been then included in a sub-network we have chosen from the well-known,
extensive UMIST database and their influence on the evolution of the interstellar medium environment
was analysed. In particular we report results for the photon dominated regions (PDR) and for the
molecular clouds (MC) conditions by varying the extinction coefficient Av. As additional tests
on the relevance of our new depletion quantum rates we have run a series of models which include rates
proposed by earlier works to the CH+ chemistry. The differences between the UMIST database and our
updated sub-network are also discussed in some detail.
