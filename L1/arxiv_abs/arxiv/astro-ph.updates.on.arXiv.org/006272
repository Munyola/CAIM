The shape of LOSVDs (line-of-sight velocity distributions) carries important information about
the internal dynamics of galaxies. The skewness of LOSVDs represents their asymmetric deviation
from a Gaussian profile. Correlations between the skewness parameter ($h_3$) and the mean velocity
(\vm) of a Gauss-Hermite series reflect the underlying stellar orbital configurations of different
morphological components. Using two self-consistent $N$-body simulations of disk galaxies with
different bar strengths, we investigate \hv\ correlations at different inclination angles. Similar
to previous studies, we find anticorrelations in the disk area, and positive correlations in the
bar area when viewed edge-on. However, at intermediate inclinations, the outer parts of bars exhibit
anticorrelations, while the core areas dominated by the boxy/peanut-shaped (B/PS) bulges still
maintain weak positive correlations. When viewed edge-on, particles in the foreground/background
disk (the wing region) in the bar area constitute the main velocity peak, whereas the particles in
the bar contribute to the high-velocity tail, generating the \hv\ correlation. If we remove the
wing particles, the LOSVDs of the particles in the outer part of the bar only exhibit a low-velocity
tail, resulting in a negative \hv\ correlation, whereas the core areas in the central region still
show weakly positive correlations. We discuss implications for IFU observations on bars, and show
that the variation of the \hv\ correlation in the disk galaxy may be used as a kinematic indicator
of the bar and the B/PS bulge.
