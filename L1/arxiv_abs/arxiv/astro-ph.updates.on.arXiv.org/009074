Oxygen sequence Wolf-Rayet stars (WO) are thought to be the final evolution phase of some high mass
stars, as such they may be the progenitors of type Ic SNe as well as potential progenitors of broad-lined
Ic and long gamma-ray bursts. We present the first spectropolarimetric observations of the Galactic
WO stars WR93b and WR102 obtained with FORS1 on the VLT. We find no sign of a line effect, which could
be expected if these stars were rapid rotators. We also place constraints on the amplitude of a potentially
undetected line effect. This allows us to derive upper limits on the possible intrinsic continuum
polarisation, and find P$_{\rm cont}$ < 0.077 percent and P$_{\rm cont}$ < 0.057 percent for WR93b
and WR102, respectively. Furthermore, we derive upper limits on the rotation of our WO stars by considering
our results in the context of the wind compression effect. We estimate that for an edge-on case the
rotational velocity of WR93b is v$_{\rm rot}$ < 324 km/s while for WR102 v$_{\rm rot}$ < 234 km/s.
These correspond to values of v$_{\rm rot}$/v$_{\rm crit}$ <19 percent and <10 percent, respectively,
and values of log(j)<18.0 cm$^2$/s for WR93b and <17.6 cm^2 /s for WR102. The upper limits found on
v$_{\rm rot}$/v$_{\rm crit}$ and log(j) for our WO stars are therefore similar to the estimates
calculated for Galactic WR stars that do show a line effect. Therefore, although the presence of
a line effect in single WR stars is indicative of fast rotation, the absence of a line effect does not
rule out significant rotation, even when considering the edge-on scenario.
