We investigate the accretion rate, bolometric luminosity, black hole (BH) growth time and BH spin
in a large AGN sample under the assumption that all such objects are powered via thin or slim accretion
discs (ADs). We use direct estimates of the mass accretion rate, Mdot, to show that many currently
used values of Lbol and Ledd are either under estimated or over estimated because they are based on
bolometric correction factors that are adjusted to the properties of moderately accreting active
galactic nuclei (AGN) and do not take into account the correct combination of BH mass, spin and accretion
rate. The consistent application of AD physics to our sample of Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) AGN
leads to the following findings: 1. Even the most conservative assumption about the radiative efficiency
of fast accreting BHs shows that many of these sources must contain slim ADs. We illustrate this by
estimating the fraction of such objects at various redshifts. 2. Many previously estimated BH growth
times are inconsistent with the AD theory. In particular, the growth times of the fastest accreting
BHs were over estimated in the past by large factors with important consequences to AGN evolution.
3. Currently used bolometric correction factors for low accretion rate very massive SDSS BHs, are
inconsistent with the AD theory. Applying the AD set of assumptions to such objects, combined with
standard photoionization calculations of broad emission lines, leads to the conclusion that many
such objects must contain fast spinning BHs.
