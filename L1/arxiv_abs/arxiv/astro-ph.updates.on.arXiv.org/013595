Observationally, for neutron star low-mass X-ray binaries, so far, the correlation between the
radio luminosity $L_{\rm R}$ and the X-ray luminosity $L_{\rm X}$, i.e., $L_{\rm R}\propto L_{\rm
X}^{\beta}$, has been reasonably well-established only in three sources 4U 1728-34, Aql X-1 and
EXO 1745-248 in their hard state. The slope $\beta$ of the radio/X-ray correlation of the three sources
is different, i.e., $\beta \sim 1.4$ for 4U 1728-34, $\beta \sim 0.4$ for Aql X-1, and $\beta \sim
1.6$ for EXO 1745-248. In this paper, for the first time we explain the different radio/X-ray correlation
of 4U 1728-34, Aql X-1 and EXO 1745-248 with the coupled advection-dominated accretion (ADAF)-jet
model respectively. We calculate the emergent spectrum of the ADAF-jet model for $L_{\rm X}$ and
$L_{\rm R}$ at different $\dot m$ ($\dot m=\dot M/\dot M_{\rm Edd}$), adjusting $\eta$ ($\eta \equiv
\dot M_{\rm jet}/\dot M$, describing the fraction of the accreted matter in the ADAF transfered
vertically forming the jet) to fit the observed radio/X-ray correlations. Then we derive a fitting
formula of $\eta$ as a function of $\dot m$ for 4U 1728-34, Aql X-1 and EXO 1745-248 respectively.
If the relation between $\eta$ and $\dot m$ can be extrapolated down to a lower value of $\dot m$, we
find that in a wide range of $\dot m$, the value of $\eta$ in Aql X-1 is greater than that of in 4U 1728-34
and EXO 1745-248, implying that Aql X-1 may have a relatively stronger large-scale magnetic field,
which is supported by the discovery of the coherent millisecond X-ray pulsation in Aql X-1.
