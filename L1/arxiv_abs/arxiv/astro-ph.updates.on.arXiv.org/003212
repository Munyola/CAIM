We explore the effects of long term secular perturbations on the distribution of dark matter particles
around Supermassive Black Hole (BH) binaries. We show that in the hierarchical (in separation)
three-body problem, one of the BHs and a dark matter particle form an inner binary. Gravitational
perturbations from the BH companion, on a much wider orbit, can cause the dark matter particle to
reach extremely high eccentricities and even get accreted onto the BH, by what is known as the Eccentric
Kozai-Lidov (EKL) mechanism. We show that this may produce a torus-like configuration for the dark
matter distribution around the less massive member of the BH binary. We first consider an Intermediate
BH (IMBH) in the vicinity of our Galactic Center, which may be a relic of a past minor merger. We show
that if the IMBH is close enough (i.e., near the stellar disk) the EKL mechanism is very efficient
in exciting the eccentricity of dark matter particles in near-polar configurations to extremely
high values where they are accreted by the IMBH. We show that this mechanism is even more effective
if the central BH grows in mass, where we have assumed adiabatic growth. Since near-polar configurations
are disrupted, a torus-like shape is formed. We also show that this behavior is also likely to be relevant
for Supermassive BH binaries. We suggest that if the BHs are spinning, the accreted dark matter particles
may linger in the ergosphere and thereby may generate self-annihilations and produce an indirect
signature of potential interest.
