Ground-based ultra-high contrast imaging, as required for direct imaging of exoplanets and other
solar systems, is limited by difficulty of separating the planetary emission from the effects of
optical aberrations that are not compensated by the adaptive optics (AO) system, so-called "non-common
path aberrations" (NCPAs). Simultaneous ($\sim$ millisecond) exposures by the science camera
and the AO system enable the use of "phase diversity" to estimate both the NCPAs and the scene via a
processing procedure first described by the author (R. Frazin 2013, ApJ, 767, article id. 21). This
method is fully compatible with more standard concepts used in long-exposure high-contrast imaging,
such as angular differential imaging and spectral deconvolution. Long-exposure methods find
time-dependent NCPAs, such as those caused by vibrations, particularly challenging. Here, an
NCPA of the form of $\alpha \exp[j(k \cdot r - \omega t + \vartheta)]$ is considered. It is shown that,
when sampled at millisecond time-scales, the image plane data are sensitive to $\mbox{arg}(\alpha)$,
$\vartheta$ and $\omega$, and, therefore such NCPAs can be simultaneously estimated with the scene.
Simulations of observations with ms exposure times are reported. These simulations include substantial
detector noise and a sinusoidal NCPA that places a speckle exactly at the location of a planet. Simulations
show that the effects of detector noise can be mitigated by mixing exposures of various lengths,
allowing estimation of the planet's brightness.
