In situ measurements of the fast solar wind reveal non-thermal distributions of electrons, protons
and, minor ions extending from $0.3$ AU to the heliopause. The physical mechanisms responsible
for these non-thermal properties and the location where these properties originate remain open
questions. Here we present spectroscopic evidence, from extreme ultraviolet spectroscopy, that
the velocity distribution functions (VDFs) of minor ions are already non-Gaussian at the base of
the fast solar wind in a coronal hole, at altitudes of $< 1.1 R_{\odot}$. Analysis of Fe, Si, and Mg
spectral lines reveal a peaked line-shape core and broad wings that can be characteristed by a kappa
VDF. A kappa distribution fit gives very small kappa indices off-limb of $\kappa\approx1.9-2.5$,
indicating either (a) ion populations far from thermal equilibrium, (b) fluid motions such as non-Gaussian
turbulent fluctuations or non-uniform wave motions, or (c) some combination of both. These observations
provide important empirical constraints for the source region of the fast solar wind and for the
theoretical models of the different acceleration, heating, and energy deposition processes therein.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that the ion VDF in the fast solar wind has been probed
so close to its source region. The findings are also a timely precursor to the upcoming 2018 launch
of the Parker Solar Probe, which will provide the closest in situ measurements of the solar wind at
approximately $0.04$ AU ($8.5$ solar radii).
