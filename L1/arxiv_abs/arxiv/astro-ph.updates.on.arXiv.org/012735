During its two year prime mission the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) will perform
a time-series photometric survey covering over 80% of the sky. This survey comprises observations
of 26 24 x 96 degree sectors that are each monitored continuously for approximately 27 days. The main
goal of TESS is to find transiting planets around 200,000 pre-selected stars for which fixed aperture
photometry is recorded every two minutes. However, TESS is also recording and delivering Full-Frame
Images (FFIs) of each detector at a 30 minute cadence. We have created an open-source tool, eleanor,
to produce light curves for objects in the TESS FFIs. Here, we describe the methods used in eleanor
to produce light curves that are optimized for planet searches. The tool performs background subtraction,
aperture and PSF photometry, decorrelation of instrument systematics, and cotrending using principal
component analysis. We recover known transiting exoplanets in the FFIs to validate the pipeline
and perform a limited search for new planet candidates in Sector 1. Our tests indicate that eleanor
produces light curves with significantly less scatter than other tools that have been used in the
literature. Cadence-stacked images, and raw and detrended eleanor light curves for each analyzed
star will be hosted on MAST, with planet candidates on ExoFOP-TESS as Community TESS Objects of Interest
(CTOIs). This work confirms the promise that the TESS FFIs will enable the detection of thousands
of new exoplanets and a broad range of time domain astrophysics.
