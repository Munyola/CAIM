Bow-shock pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe) show a variety of morphological shapes. We attribute this
diversity to the geometrical factors: relative orientations of the pulsar rotation axis, proper
velocity, and the line of sight (magnetic inclination angle may also have a certain influence on
the morphology). We identify three basic types of bow-shock nebulae: (i) a "Rifle Bullet" (pulsar
spin axis and proper velocity are aligned); (ii) a "Frisbee" (pulsar spin axis and proper velocity
are orthogonal with the spin axis lying in the plane of the sky), and (iii) a Cart Wheel" (like frisbee
but the spin axis is perpendicular to the plane of the sky). Using 3D RMHD simulations, as well as analytical
calculations, we reproduce the key morphological features of the bow-shock PWNe, as well as variations,
are seen across different systems. magnetic stresses within the shocked pulsar wind affect the
overall structure strongly, producing "whiskers", "tails", "filled-in" and "mushroom" shapes,
as well as non-symmetric morphologies. On the other hand, the interstellar medium inhomogeneities
and the anisotropy of the energy flux in the pulsar wind have only a mild impact of the PWN morphology.
In a few cases, when we clearly identify specific morphological structures, our results do not favor
alignment of the pulsar spin axis and proper velocity. Our calculations of the underlying emission
processes explain the low synchrotron X-ray efficiency (in terms of the spin-down luminosity)
and imply an energetical subdominant contribution of the inverse Compton process.
