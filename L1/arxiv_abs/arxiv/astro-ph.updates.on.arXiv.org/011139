We present a suite of high resolution radiation hydrodynamic simulations of a small patch ($1 \ {\rm
kpc}^2$) of the inter-stellar medium (ISM) performed with Arepo-RT, with the aim to quantify the
efficacy of various feedback processes like supernovae explosions (SNe), photoheating and radiation
pressure in low gas surface density galaxies ($\Sigma_{\rm gas} \simeq 10 \ {\rm M}_\odot \ {\rm
pc}^{-2}$). We show that radiation fields decrease the star formation rate and therefore the total
stellar mass formed by a factor of $\sim 2$. This increases the gas depletion timescale and brings
the simulated Kennicutt-Schmidt relation closer to the observational estimates. Radiation feedback
coupled with SNe is more efficient at driving outflows with the mass and energy loading increasing
by a factor of $\sim 10$. This increase is mainly driven by the additional entrainment of medium density
($10^{-2} \leq n< 1 \ {\rm cm}^{-3}$), warm ($300 \ {\rm K}\leq T<8000 \ {\rm K}$) material. Therefore
including radiation fields tends to launch colder, denser and higher mass and energy loaded outflows.
This is because photoheating of the high density gas around a newly formed star over-pressurises
the region, causing it to expand. This reduces the ambient density in which the SNe explode by a factor
of $10-100$ which in turn increases their momentum output by a factor of $\sim 1.5-2.5$. Finally,
we note that in these low gas surface density environments, radiation fields primarily impact the
ISM via photoheating and radiation pressure has only a minimal role in regulating star formation.
