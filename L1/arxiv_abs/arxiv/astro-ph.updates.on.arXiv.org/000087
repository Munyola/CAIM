In this paper we present a detailed spectroscopic analysis of the suspected marginal Am star HD\,71297.
Our goal is to test the accuracy of two different approaches to determine the atmospheric parameters
effective temperature, gravity, projected rotational velocity, and chemical abundances. The
methods used in this paper are: classical spectral synthesis and the {\it Versatile Wavelength
Analysis} ({\sl VWA}) software. Since our star is bright and very close to the Sun, we were able to
determine its effective temperature and gravity directly through photometric, interferometric,
and parallax measurements. The values found were taken as reference to which we compare the values
derived by spectroscopic methods. Our analysis leads us to conclude that the spectroscopic methods
considered in this study to derive fundamental parameters give consistent results, if we consider
all the sources of experimental errors, that have been discussed in the text. In addition, our study
shows that the spectroscopic results are quite as accurate as those derived from direct measurements.
As for the specific object analyzed here, according to our analysis, HD\,71297 has chemical abundances
not compatible with the previous spectral classification. We found moderate underabundances
of carbon, sodium, magnesium, and iron-peak elements, while oxygen, aluminum, silicon, sulfur,
and heavy elements (Z $\geq$ 39) are solar in content. This chemical pattern has been confirmed by
the calculations performed with both methods.
