We report the detection and investigate the properties of high-excitation lambda-doubling line
emission of hydroxyl (OH) detected towards three asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars (W Hya, R Dor,
and IK Tau) using ALMA. The OH lines are produced very close to the central stars and seem optically
thin and with no maser effect. We analyse the molecular excitation using population diagrams and
find rotational temperatures of $\sim 2500$ K and column densities of $\sim 10^{19}$ cm$^{-2}$
for both W Hya and R Dor. For W Hya, we observe emission from vibrationally excited H2O arising from
the same region as the OH emission. Moreover, CO $v = 1; J = 3 - 2$ emission also shows a brightness peak
in the same region. Considering optically thin emission and the rotational temperature derived
for OH, we find a CO column density $\sim 15$ times higher than that of OH, within an area of ($92 \times
84$) mas$^2$ centred on the OH emission peak. These results should be considered tentative because
of the simple methods employed. The observed OH line frequencies differ significantly from the
predicted transition frequencies in the literature, and provide the possibility of using OH lines
observed in AGB stars to improve the accuracy of the Hamiltonian used for the OH molecule. We predict
stronger OH lambda-doubling lines at millimetre wavelengths than those we detected. These lines
will be a good probe of shocked gas in the extended atmosphere and are possibly even suitable as probes
of the magnetic field in the atmospheres of close-by AGB stars through the Zeeman effect.
