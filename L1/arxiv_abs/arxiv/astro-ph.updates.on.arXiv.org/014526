We study the global star-formation rate (SFR) vs. stellar mass (M$_*$) correlation, and the spatially-resolved
SFR surface density ($\Sigma_{SFR}$) vs. stellar mass surface density (\Sm) correlation, in a
sample of $\sim2,000$ galaxies from the MaNGA MPL-5 survey. We classify galaxies and spatially-resolved
areas into star-forming and retired according to their ionization processes. We confirm the existence
of a Star-Forming Main Sequence (SFMS) for galaxies and spatially-resolved areas, and show that
they have the same nature, with the global as a consequence of the local one. The latter presents a
bend below a limit \Sm value, $\approx 3\times 10^7$ M$_\odot$kpc$^{-2}$, which is not physical.
Using only star-forming areas (SFAs) above this limit, a slope and a scatter of $\approx1$ and $\approx0.27$
dex are determined. The retired galaxies/areas strongly segregate from their respective SFMS's,
by $\sim -1.5$ dex on average. We explore how the global/local SFMS's depend on galaxy morphology,
finding that for star-forming galaxies and SFAs, there is a trend to lower values of star-formation
activity with earlier morphological types, which is more pronounced for the local SFMS. The morphology
not only affects the global SFR due to the diminish of SFAs with earlier types, but also affects the
local SF process. Our results suggest that the local SF at all radii is established by some universal
mechanism partially modulated by morphology. Morphology seems to be connected to the slow aging
and sharp decline of the SF process, and on its own it may depend on other properties as the environment.
