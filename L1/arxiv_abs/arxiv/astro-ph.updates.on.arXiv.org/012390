We report results from the X-ray and optical monitoring of the black hole candidate MAXI J1820+070
(=ASSASN-18ey) over the entire period of its outburst from March to October 2018.In this outburst,
the source exhibited two sets of `fast rise and slow decay'-type long-term flux variations. We found
that the 1--100 keV luminosities at two peaks were almost the same, although a significant spectral
softening was only seen in the second flux rise. This confirms that the state transition from the
low/hard state to the high/soft state is not determined by the mass accretion rate alone. The X-ray
spectrum was reproduced with the disk blackbody emission and its Comptonization, and the long-term
spectral variations seen in this outburst were consistent with a disk truncation model. The Comptonization
component, with a photon index of 1.5-1.9 and electron temperature of ~>40 keV, was dominant during
the low/hard state periods, and its contribution rapidly decreased (increased) during the spectral
softening (hardening). During the high/soft state period, in which the X-ray spectrum became dominated
by the disk blackbody component, the inner disk radius was almost constant, suggesting that the
standard disk was present down to the inner most stable circular orbit. The long-term evolution
of optical and X-ray luminosities and their correlation suggest that the jets substantially contributed
to the optical emission in the low/hard state, while they are quenched and the outer disk emission
dominated the optical flux in the intermediate state and the high/soft state.
