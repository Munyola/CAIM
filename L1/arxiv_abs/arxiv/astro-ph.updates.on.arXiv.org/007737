The X-ray signal from hydrogen-rich supernovae (SNe II) in the first tens to hundreds of days after
the shock breakout encodes important information about the circumstellar material (CSM) surrounding
their progenitors before explosion. In this study, we describe a way to generate the SN II X-ray light
curves from hydrodynamical simulations performed with the code Athena++, using the X-ray package
XSPEC. In addition, we employ a radiation diffusion hydrodynamic code SNEC for generating the optical
light curves in different bands. In this numerical setup, we model the X-ray and optical emission
from a set of progenitor models, consisting of either two (red supergiant + low density steady wind),
or three (red supergiant + dense CSM + low density steady wind) components. We vary the density in
the wind and the slope in the CSM to see how these parameters influence the resulting X-ray and optical
light curves. Among our models, we identify one that is able to roughly reproduce both optical and
X-ray data of the well observed SN 2013ej. In order to achieve this, the slope of the dense CSM in this
model should be steeper than the one of a steady wind ($\rho\propto r^{-2}$), and closer to $\rho\propto
r^{-5}$. On the other hand, we show that too steep and extended CSM profiles may produce excessive
X-ray emission in the first few tens of days, up to a few orders of magnitude larger than observed.
We conclude that ability to reproduce the observed X-ray signal from SNe~II together with their
optical light curves is crucial in establishing the validity of different CSM models.
