We investigate the abundance and properties (especially, grain size) of dust in galaxy halos using
available observational data in the literature. There are two major sets of data. One is (i) the reddening
curves at redshifts $z\sim 1$ and 2 derived for Mg II absorbers, which are assumed to trace the medium
in galaxy halos. The other is (ii) the cosmic extinction up to $z\sim 2$ mainly traced by distant background
quasars. For (i), the observed reddening curves favor a grain radius of $a\sim 0.03~\mu$m for silicate,
while graphite is not supported because of its strong 2175 \AA\ bump. Using amorphous carbon improves
the fit to the reddening curves compared with graphite if the grain radius is $a\lesssim 0.03~\mu$m.
For (ii), the cosmic extinction requires $\eta\gtrsim 10^{-2}$ ($\eta$ is the ratio of the halo
dust mass to the stellar mass; the observationally suggested value is $\eta\sim 10^{-3}$) for silicate
if $a\sim 0.03~\mu$m as suggested by the reddening curve constraint. Thus, for silicate, we do not
find any grain radius that satisfies both (i) and (ii) unless the halo dust abundance is much larger
than suggested by the observations. For amorphous carbon, in contrast, a wide range of grain radius
($a\sim 0.01$--0.3~$\mu$m) is accepted by the cosmic extinction; thus, we find that a grain radius
range of $a\sim 0.01$--0.03 $\mu$m is supported by combining (i) and (ii). We also discuss the origin
of dust in galaxy halos, focusing on the importance of grain size in the physical mechanism of dust
supply to galaxy halos.
