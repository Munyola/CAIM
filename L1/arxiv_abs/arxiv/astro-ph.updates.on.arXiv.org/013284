Metal absorption line systems in distant quasar spectra probe of the history of gas content in the
universe. The MgII $\lambda \lambda$ 2796, 2803 doublet is one of the most important absorption
lines since it is a proxy of the star formation rate and a tracer of the cold gas associated with high
redshift galaxies. Machine learning algorithms have been used to detect absorption lines systems
in large sky surveys, such as Principle Component Analysis (PCA), Gaussian Process (GP) and decision
trees. A very powerful algorithm in the field of machine learning called deep neural networks, or
'' deep learning'' is a new structure of neural network that automatically extracts semantic features
from raw data and represents them at a high level. In this paper, we apply a deep convolutional neural
network for absorption line detection. We use the previously published DR7 MgII catalog (Zhu et
al. 2013) as the training and validation sample and the DR12 MgII catalog as the test set. Our deep
learning algorithm is capable of detecting MgII absorption lines with an accuracy of $\sim$94%
. It takes only $\sim 9$ seconds to analyze $\sim$ 50000 quasar spectra with our deep neural network,
which is ten thousand times faster than traditional methods, while preserving high accuracy with
little human interference. Our study shows that Mg II absorption line detection accuracy of a deep
neutral network model strongly depends on the filter size in the filter layer of the neural network,
and the best results are obtained when the filter size closely matches the absorption feature size.
