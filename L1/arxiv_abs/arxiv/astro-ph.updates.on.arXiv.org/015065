The detection of an astrophysical flux of high-energy neutrinos by IceCube is a major step forward
in the search for the origin of cosmic rays, as this emission is expected to originate in hadronic
interactions taking place in or near cosmic-ray accelerators. No neutrino point sources, or significant
correlation with known astrophysical objects, have been identified in the IceCube data so far.
The hadronic interactions responsible for the neutrino emission should also lead to the production
of high-energy gamma rays. The search for neutrino sources can then be performed by studying the
spatial and temporal correlations between neutrino events and very high energy (VHE, E > 100 GeV)
gamma rays. We report here on the search for VHE gamma-ray emission with the H.E.S.S. imaging air
Cherenkov telescopes (IACTs) at the reconstructed position of muon neutrino events detected by
IceCube. We will provide an up-to-date summary of the extensive program to perform prompt IACT observations
of realtime IceCube neutrino event positions. A recent highlight of this program are the H.E.S.S.
observations during the broad multi-wavelength campaign that followed the detection of the neutrino
event IceCube-170922A arriving from a direction consistent with the location of a flaring gamma-ray
blazar TXS 0506+056 in September 2017. We'll present the H.E.S.S. observations obtained within
~4h hours of the neutrino detection as well as a complementary search for gamma-ray emission at longer
timescales and put them into the multi-wavelength and multi-messenger context.
