Recently, a new planet candidate was discovered on direct images around the young (10-17 Myr) A-type
star HD95086. The strong infrared excess of the system indicates that, similarly to HR8799, {\ss}
Pic, and Fomalhaut, the star harbors a circumstellar disk. Aiming to study the structure and gas
content of the HD95086 disk, and to investigate its possible interaction with the newly discovered
planet, here we present new optical, infrared and millimeter observations. We detected no CO emission,
excluding the possibility of an evolved gaseous primordial disk. Simple blackbody modeling of
the spectral energy distribution suggests the presence of two spatially separate dust belts at
radial distances of 6 and 64 AU. Our resolved images obtained with the Herschel Space Observatory
reveal a characteristic disk size of ~6.0x5.4 arcsec (540x490 AU) and disk inclination of ~25 degree.
Assuming the same inclination for the planet candidate's orbit, its re-projected radial distance
from the star is 62 AU, very close to the blackbody radius of the outer cold dust ring. The structure
of the planetary system at HD95086 resembles the one around HR8799. Both systems harbor a warm inner
dust belt and a broad colder outer disk and giant planet(s) between the two dusty regions. Modelling
implies that the candidate planet can dynamically excite the motion of planetesimals even out to
270 AU via their secular perturbation if its orbital eccentricity is larger than about 0.4. Our analysis
adds a new example to the three known systems where directly imaged planet(s) and debris disks co-exist.
