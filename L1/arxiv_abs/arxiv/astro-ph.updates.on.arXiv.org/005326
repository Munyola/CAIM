We present an analysis of stellar populations in passive galaxies in seven massive X-ray clusters
at z=0.19-0.89. Based on absorption line strengths measured from our high signal-to-noise spectra,
the data support primarily passive evolution of the galaxies. We use the scaling relations between
velocity dispersions and the absorption line strengths to determine representative mean line
strengths for the clusters. From the age determinations based on the line strengths (and stellar
population models), we find a formation redshift of z_form=1.96(-0.19,+0.24). Based on line strength
measurements from high signal-to-noise composite spectra of our data, we establish the relations
between velocity dispersion, ages, metallicities [M/H] and abundance ratios [alpha/Fe] as a function
of redshift. The [M/H]-velocity dispersion and [alpha/Fe]-velocity dispersion relations are
steep and tight. The age-velocity dispersion relation is flat, with zero point changes reflecting
passive evolution. The scatter in all three parameters are within 0.08-0.15 dex at fixed velocity
dispersions, indicating a large degree of synchronization in the evolution of the galaxies. We
find indication of cluster-to-cluster differences in metallicities and abundance ratios. However,
variations in stellar populations with the cluster environment can only account for a very small
fraction of the intrinsic scatter in the scaling relations. Thus, within these very massive clusters
the main driver of the properties of the stellar populations in passive galaxies appears to be the
galaxy velocity dispersion.
