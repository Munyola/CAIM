Type II supernovae (SNe II) show strong hydrogen features in their spectra throughout their whole
evolution while type IIb supernovae (SNe IIb) spectra evolve from dominant hydrogen lines at early
times to increasingly strong helium features later on. However, it is currently unclear whether
the progenitors of these supernova (SN) types form a continuum in pre-SN hydrogen mass or whether
they are physically distinct. SN light-curve morphology directly relates to progenitor and explosion
properties such as the amount of hydrogen in the envelope, the pre-SN radius, the explosion energy
and the synthesized mass of radioactive material. In this work we study the morphology of the optical-wavelength
light curves of hydrogen-rich SNe II and hydrogen-poor SNe IIb to test whether an observational
continuum exists between the two. Using a sample of 95 SNe (73 SNe II and 22 SNe IIb), we define a range
of key observational parameters and present a comparative analysis between both types. We find
a lack of events that bridge the observed properties of SNe II and SNe IIb. Light curve parameters
such as rise times and post-maximum decline rates and curvatures clearly separate both SN types
and we therefore conclude that there is no continuum, with the two SN types forming two observationally
distinct families. In the V-band a rise time of 17 days (SNe II lower, SNe IIb higher), and a magnitude
difference between 30 and 40 days post explosion of 0.4 mag (SNe II lower, SNe IIb higher) serve as
approximate thresholds to differentiate both types.
