The colour evolution of reddened Type Ia supernovae can place strong constraints on the location
of dust and help address the question of whether the observed extinction stems from the interstellar
medium or from circumstellar material surrounding the progenitor. Here we analyse BV photometry
of 48 reddened Type Ia supernovae from the literature and estimate the dust location from their $B-V$
colour evolution. We find a time-variable colour excess $E(B-V)$ for 15 supernovae in our sample
and constrain dust to distances between 0.013 and 45 pc ($4\times10^{16}-10^{20}$ cm). For the
remaining supernovae, we obtain a constant $E(B-V)$ evolution and place lower limits on the dust
distance from the explosion. In all the 48 supernovae, the inferred dust location is compatible
with an interstellar origin for the extinction. This is corroborated by the observation that supernovae
with relatively nearby dust ($\lesssim$ 1 pc) are located close to the center of their host galaxy,
in high-density dusty regions where interactions between the supernova radiation and interstellar
clouds close by are likely to occur. For supernovae showing time-variable $E(B-V)$, we identify
a potential preference for low $R_\mathrm{V}$ values, unusually strong sodium absorption and
blue-shifted and time-variable absorption features. Within the interstellar framework, this
brings evidence to a proposed scenario where cloud-cloud collisions induced by the supernova radiation
pressure can shift the grain size distribution to smaller values and enhance the abundance of sodium
in the gaseous phase.
