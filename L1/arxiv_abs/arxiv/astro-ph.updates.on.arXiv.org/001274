Determining the Galactic distribution and numbers of massive stars, such as Wolf-Rayet stars (WRs),
is hampered by intervening Galactic or local circumstellar dust obscuration. In order to probe
such regions of the Galaxy we can use infrared observations, which provide a means for finding such
hidden populations through the dust. The availability of both 2MASS and Spitzer/GLIMPSE large-scale
survey data provides infrared colours from 1.25 to 8$\mu$m for a large fraction of the inner Galactic
plane. In 2005 we initiated a pilot study of the combined set of infrared colours for two GLIMPSE fields
and showed that WRs typically occupy a sparsely populated region of the colour space. We followed
up 42 of our WR candidates spectroscopically in the near-infrared, and with limited additional
observations of some of these candidates in the optical. Six new WRs, four late-type WN and two late-type
WC stars, were discovered as a result. Of the remaining $\sim$86% of the sample, five appear to be
O-type stars. 21 stars are likely of type Be, and 10 stars appear to be of late-type, or possibly young
stellar objects, which have "contaminated" the infrared color space. The survey is generally unbiased
towards clusters or field stars, and the new WRs found are in both the field and in and around the RCW
49 region (including cluster Westerlund 2). In this work, and in our other recent work, we show that
the infrared broad-band colours to be the most efficient means of identifying (particularly, dust-obscured)
candidate massive stars, notably WRs.
