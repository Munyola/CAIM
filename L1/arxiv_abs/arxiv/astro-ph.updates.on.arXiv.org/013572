We describe the circumstances that led to the discovery of Kepler-36b, and the subsequent characterization
of its host planetary system. The Kepler-36 system is remarkable for its physical properties: the
close separation of the planets, the contrasting densities of the planets despite their proximity,
and the short chaotic timescale. Its discovery and characterization was also remarkable for the
novelty of the detection technique and for the precise characterization due to the large transit-timing
variations caused by the close proximity of the planets, as well as the precise stellar parameters
due to asteroseismology. This was the first multi-planet system whose transit data was processed
using a fully consistent photometric-dynamical model, using population Markov Chain Monte Carlo
techniques to precisely constrain system parameters. Amongst those parameters, the stellar density
was found to be consistent with a complementary, concurrent asteroseismic analysis. In a first,
the 3D orientation of the planets was constrained from the lack of transit-duration variations.
The system yielded insights into the composition and evolution of short-period planet systems.
The denser planet appears to have an Earth-like composition, with uncertainties comparable to
the highest precision rocky exoplanet measurements, and the planet densities foreshadowed the
rocky/gaseous boundary. The formation of this system remains a mystery, but should yield insights
into the migration and evolution of compact exoplanet systems.
