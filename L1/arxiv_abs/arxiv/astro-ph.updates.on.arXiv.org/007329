Using the atmospheric structure from a 3D global radiation-hydrodynamic simulation of HD 189733b
and the open-source BART code, we investigate the difference between the secondary-eclipse temperature
structure produced with a 3D simulation and the best-fit 1D retrieved model. Synthetic data are
generated by integrating the 3D models over the Spitzer, HST, and JWST bandpasses, covering the
wavelength range between 1 and 11 um. Using the data from different observing instruments, we present
detailed comparisons between the temperature-pressure profiles recovered by BART and those from
the 3D simulations. We calculate several averages of the 3D thermal structure and implement two
temperature parameterizations to investigate different thermal profile shapes. To assess which
part of the thermal structure is best constrained by the data, we generate contribution functions
for both our theoretical model and each of our retrieved models. Our conclusions are strongly affected
by the spectral resolution of the instruments included, their wavelength coverage, and the number
of data points combined. We also see some limitations in each of the temperature parametrizations.
The results show that our 1D retrieval is recovering a temperature and pressure profile that most
closely matches the arithmetic average of the 3D thermal structure. When we use a higher resolution,
more data points, and a parametrized temperature profile that allows more flexibility in the middle
part of the atmosphere, we find a better match between the retrieved temperature and pressure profile
and the arithmetic average.
