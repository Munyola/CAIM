Superluminous supernovae have been proposed to arise from Population III progenitors that explode
as pair-instability supernovae. Pop III stars are the first generation of stars in the Universe,
and are thought to form as late as $z \sim 6$. Future near-infrared imaging facilities such as ULTIMATE-Subaru
can potentially detect and identify these PISNe with a dedicated survey. Gravitational lensing
by intervening structure in the Universe can aid in the detection of these rare objects by magnifying
the high-$z$ source population into detectability. We perform a mock survey with ULTIMATE-Subaru,
taking into account lensing by line-of-sight structure to evaluate its impact on the predicted
detection rate. We compare a LOS mass reconstruction using observational data from the Hyper Suprime
Cam survey to results from cosmological simulations to test their consistency in calculating the
magnification distribution in the Universe to high-$z$, but find that the data-based method is
still limited by an inability to accurately characterize structure beyond $z \sim1.2$. We also
evaluate a survey strategy of targeting massive galaxy clusters to take advantage of their large
areas of high magnification. We find that targeting clusters can result in a gain of a factor of $\sim$two
in the predicted number of detected PISNe at $z > 5$, and even higher gains with increasing redshift,
given our assumed survey parameters. For the highest-redshift sources at $z \sim 7-9$, blank field
surveys will not detect any sources, and lensing magnification by massive clusters will be necessary
to observe this population.
