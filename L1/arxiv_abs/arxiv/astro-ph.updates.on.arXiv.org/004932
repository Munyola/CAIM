Spatially resolved observations of protoplanetary discs are revealing that their inner regions
can be warped or broken from the outer disc. A few mechanisms are known to lead to such 3D structures;
among them, the interaction with a stellar companion. We perform a 3D SPH simulation of a circumbinary
disc misaligned by $60^\circ$ with respect to the binary orbital plane. The inner disc breaks from
the outer regions, precessing as a rigid body, and leading to a complex evolution. As the inner disc
precesses, the misalignment angle between the inner and outer discs varies by more than $100^\circ$.
Different snapshots of the evolution are post-processed with a radiative transfer code, in order
to produce observational diagnostics of the process. Even though the simulation was produced for
the specific case of a circumbinary disc, most of the observational predictions hold for any disc
hosting a precessing inner rim. Synthetic scattered light observations show strong azimuthal
asymmetries, where the pattern depends strongly on the misalignment angle between inner and outer
disc. The asymmetric illumination of the outer disc leads to azimuthal variations of the temperature
structure, in particular in the upper layers, where the cooling time is short. These variations
are reflected in asymmetric surface brightness maps of optically thick lines, as CO $J$=3-2. The
kinematical information obtained from the gas lines is unique in determining the disc structure.
The combination of scattered light images and (sub-)mm lines can distinguish between radial inflow
and misaligned inner disc scenarios.
