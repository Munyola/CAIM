GW170817 is the first gravitational wave event detected from a double neutron star merger. Recent
long-term radio follow-up observations reveals a simple power-law rising light curve, with a slope
of $t^{0.78}$, up to 93 days after the merger. The latest X-ray detection at 109 days is also consistent
with such a temporal slope. Such a shallow rise behavior requires a mildly relativistic outflow
with a steep velocity gradient profile, so that slower material with larger energy catches up with
the decelerating ejecta and re-energizes it. It has been suggested that this mildly relativistic
outflow may represent a cocoon of material. We suggest that the velocity gradient profile may form
during the stag that the cocoon is breaking out of the merger ejecta. The cooling of the hot relativistic
cocoon material immediately after it breaks out should have produced soft X-ray to UV radiation
at tens of seconds to hours after the merger. The soft X-ray emission has a luminosity of $L_{\rm X}\sim
10^{45}{\rm erg s^{-1}}$ over a period of tens of seconds for a merger event like GW 170817. The UV
emission shows a rise initially and peaks at about a few hours with a luminosity of $L_{\rm UV}\sim
10^{42} {\rm erg s^{-1}}$. The soft X-ray transients could be detected by future wide-angle X-ray
detectors, such as the Chinese mission Einstein Probe. This soft X-ray/UV emission would serve
as one of the earliest electromagnetic counterparts of gravitation waves from double neutron star
mergers and could provide the earliest localization of the sources.
