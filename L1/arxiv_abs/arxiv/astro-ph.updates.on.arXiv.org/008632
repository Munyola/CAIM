Due to its accuracy and generality, Monte Carlo radiative transfer (MCRT) has emerged as the prevalent
method for Ly$\alpha$ radiative transfer in arbitrary geometries. The standard MCRT encounters
a significant efficiency barrier in the high optical depth, diffusion regime. Multiple acceleration
schemes have been developed to improve the efficiency of MCRT but the noise from photon packet discretization
remains a challenge. The discrete diffusion Monte Carlo (DDMC) scheme has been successfully applied
in state-of-the-art radiation hydrodynamics (RHD) simulations. Still, the established framework
is not optimal for resonant line transfer. Inspired by the DDMC paradigm, we present a novel extension
to resonant DDMC (rDDMC) in which diffusion in space and frequency are treated on equal footing.
We explore the robustness of our new method and demonstrate a level of performance that justifies
incorporating the method into existing Ly$\alpha$ codes. We present computational speedups of
$\sim 10^2$-$10^6$ relative to contemporary MCRT implementations with schemes that skip scattering
in the core of the line profile. This is because the rDDMC runtime scales with the spatial and frequency
resolution rather than the number of scatterings - the latter is typically $\propto \tau_0$ for
static media, or $\propto (a \tau_0)^{2/3}$ with core-skipping. We anticipate new frontiers in
which on-the-fly Ly$\alpha$ radiative transfer calculations are feasible in 3D RHD. More generally,
rDDMC is transferable to any computationally demanding problem amenable to a Fokker-Planck approximation
of frequency redistribution.
