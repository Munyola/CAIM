We investigate the linear radio size properties of the $\mu$Jy populations of radio-selected active
galactic nuclei (AGN) and star-forming galaxies (SFGs) using a multi-resolution catalog based
on the original VLA-COSMOS 3\,GHz 0\farcs75 resolution mosaic and its convolved images (up to a
resolution of 2\farcs2). The final catalog contains 6\,399 radio sources above a 3\,GHz total flux
density of $S_T>20$ $\mu$Jy (median $<S_T>=37$ $\mu$Jy), with redshift information (median $<z>=1.0$),
and multi-wavelength classification as SFGs, radio-excess AGN (RX-AGN), or non-radio-excess
AGN (NRX-AGN). RX-AGN are those whose radio emission exceeds the star formation rate derived by
fitting the global spectral energy distribution. We derive the evolution with redshift and luminosity
of the median linear sizes of each class of objects. We find that RX-AGN are compact, with median sizes
of $\sim$ 1-2 kpc and increasing with redshift, corresponding to an almost constant angular size
of 0\farcs25. NRX-AGN typically have radio sizes a factor of 2 larger than the RX-AGN. The median
radio size of SFGs is about 5 kpc up to $z\sim 0.7$, and it decreases beyond this redshift. Using luminosity-complete
subsamples of objects, we separately investigate the effect of redshift and luminosity dependance.
We compare the radio sizes of SFGs with those derived in the rest-frame far-infrared (FIR) and UV
bands. We find that SFGs have comparable sizes (within 15\%) in the radio and rest-frame FIR, while
the sizes measured in the UV-band are systematically larger than the radio sizes.
