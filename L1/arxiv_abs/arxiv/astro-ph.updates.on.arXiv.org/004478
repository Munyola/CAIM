Accretion of gas and interaction of matter and radiation are at the heart of many questions pertaining
to black hole (BH) growth and coevolution of massive BHs and their host galaxies. To answer them it
is critical to quantify how the ionizing radiation that emanates from the innermost regions of the
BH accretion flow couples to the surrounding medium and how it regulates the BH fueling. In this work
we use high resolution 3-dimensional (3D) radiation-hydrodynamic simulations with the code Enzo,
equipped with adaptive ray tracing module Moray, to investigate radiation-regulated BH accretion
of cold gas. Our simulations reproduce findings from an earlier generation of 1D/2D simulations:
the accretion powered UV and X-ray radiation forms a highly ionized bubble, which leads to suppression
of BH accretion rate characterized by quasi-periodic outbursts. A new feature revealed by the 3D
simulations is the highly turbulent nature of the gas flow in vicinity of the ionization front. During
quiescent periods between accretion outbursts, the ionized bubble shrinks in size and the gas density
that precedes the ionization front increases. Consequently, the 3D simulations show oscillations
in the accretion rate of only ~2-3 orders of magnitude, significantly smaller than 1D/2D models.
We calculate the energy budget of the gas flow and find that turbulence is the main contributor to
the kinetic energy of the gas but corresponds to less than 10% of its thermal energy and thus does not
contribute significantly to the pressure support of the gas.
