We study interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs) measured by probes at different heliocentric
distances (0.3-1AU) to investigate the propagation of ICMEs in the inner heliosphere and determine
how the generic features of ICMEs change with heliospheric distance. Using data from the MESSENGER,
Venus Express and ACE spacecraft, we analyze with the superposed epoch technique the profiles of
ICME substructures, namely the sheath and the magnetic ejecta. We determine that the median magnetic
field magnitude in the sheath correlates well with ICME speeds at 1 AU and we use this proxy to order
the ICMEs at all spacecraft. We then investigate the typical ICME profiles for three categories
equivalent to slow, intermediate and fast ICMEs. Contrary to fast ICMEs, slow ICMEs have a weaker
solar wind field at the front and a more symmetric magnetic field profile. We find the asymmetry to
be less pronounced at Earth than at Mercury, indicating a relaxation taking place as ICMEs propagate.
We also find that the magnetic field intensities in the wake region of the ICMEs do not go back to the
pre-ICME solar wind intensities, suggesting that the effects of ICMEs on the ambient solar wind
last longer than the duration of the transient event. Such results provide an indication of physical
processes that need to be reproduced by numerical simulations of ICME propagation. The samples
studied here will be greatly improved by future missions dedicated to the exploration of the inner
heliosphere, such as Parker Solar Probe and Solar Orbiter.
