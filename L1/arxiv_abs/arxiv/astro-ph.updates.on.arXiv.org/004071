We perform a general computational analysis of possible post-collision mass distributions in
high-speed galaxy cluster collisions in the presence of weakly self-interacting dark matter.
Using this analysis, we show that weakly self-scattering dark matter can impart subtle yet measurable
features in the mass distributions of colliding galaxy clusters even without significant disruptions
to the dark matter halos of the colliding galaxy clusters themselves. Most profound such evidences
are found to reside in the tails of dark matter halos' distributions, in the space between the colliding
galaxy clusters. This feature appears in our simulations as shells of scattered dark matter expanding
in alignment with the outgoing original galaxy clusters, contributing significant densities
to projected mass distributions at large distances from collision centers and large scattering
angles up to $90^\circ$. Our simulations indicate that as much as 20% of the total collision's mass
may be deposited into such structures without noticeable disruptions to the main galaxy clusters.
Such structures at large scattering angles are forbidden however in purely gravitational high-speed
galaxy cluster collisions. Convincing identification of such structures in real colliding galaxy
clusters would be a clear indication of the self-interacting nature of dark matter. Our findings
may explain the dark matter ring feature recently found in the long-range reconstructions of the
mass distribution of the colliding galaxy cluster CL0024+017.
