We reported the monitoring results on spectrophotometry, photometry and imaging of comet 103P/Hartley
2 obtained at Lulin (1m), Calar Alto (2.2m) and Beijing Astronomical (2.16m) Observatory from April
to December 2010. We found that a dust feature at sunward direction was detected starting from the
end of September until the beginning of December (our last observation from the Lulin and Calar Alto
observatory). Two distinct sunward jet features in the processed images were observed on October
11 and after October 29 until November 2. In parallel, the CN images reveal two asymmetrical jet features
which are nearly perpendicular to the Sun-nucleus direction and this asymmetrical features implies
that the comet was in a nearly side-on view in late-October and early-November. Additional to the
jet features, the average result of the C2-to-CN production rate ratio ranges from 0.7 to 1.5 which
places 103P/Hartley 2 as being of typical cometary chemistry. We found that the $r_h$ dependence
for the dust production rate, Afrho (5,000 km), is -3.75+-0.45 before perihelion and is -3.44 +-1.20
during post-perihelion period. We detected the higher dust reddening is around the optocenter
and getting bluer outward along the sunward jet feature and concluded that the former one, higher
dust reddening, could be associated with strong jet activity and the latter one, the lowering of
the reddening, might imply the optical properties changed or could be associated with outburst.
The average dust color did not appear to vary significantly as the comet passed through perihelion.
