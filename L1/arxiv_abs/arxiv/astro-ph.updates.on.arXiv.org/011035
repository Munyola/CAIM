Active solar-type stars show large quasi-periodic brightness variations caused by stellar rotations
with star spots, and the amplitude changes as the spots emerge and decay. The Kepler data are suitable
for investigations on the emergence and decay processes of star spots, which are important to understand
underlying stellar dynamo and stellar flares. In this study, we measured temporal evolutions of
star spot area with Kepler data by tracing local minima of the light curves. In this analysis, we extracted
temporal evolutions of star spots showing clear emergence and decay without being disturbed by
stellar differential rotations. We applied this method to 5356 active solar-type stars observed
by Kepler and obtained temporal evolutions of 56 individual star spots. We calculated lifetimes,
emergence and decay rates of the star spots from the obtained temporal evolutions of spot area. As
a result, we found that lifetimes ($T$) of star spots are ranging from 10 to 350 days when spot areas
($A$) are 0.1-2.3 percent of the solar hemisphere. We also compared them with sunspot lifetimes,
and found that the lifetimes of star spots are much shorter than those extrapolated from an empirical
relation of sunspots ($T\propto A$), while being consistent with other researches on star spot
lifetimes. The emerging and decay rates of star spots are typically $5 \times 10^{20}$ $\rm Mx\cdot
h^{-1}$ ($8$ $\rm MSH\cdot h^{-1}$) with the area of 0.1-2.3 percent of the solar hemisphere and
are mostly consistent with those expected from sunspots, which may indicate the same underlying
processes.
