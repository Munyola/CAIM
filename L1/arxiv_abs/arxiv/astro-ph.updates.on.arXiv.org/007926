We present a new Galaxy population synthesis Model (GalMod). GalMod is a star-count model featuring
an asymmetric bar/bulge as well as spiral arms and related extinction. The model, initially introduced
in Pasetto et al. (2016b), has been here completed with a central bar, a new bulge description, new
disk vertical profiles and several new bolometric corrections. The model can generate synthetic
mock catalogs of visible portions of the Milky Way (MW), external galaxies like M31, or N-body simulation
initial conditions. At any given time, e.g., a chosen age of the Galaxy, the model contains a sum of
discrete stellar populations, namely bulge/bar, disk, halo. These populations are in turn the
sum of different components: the disk is the sum of spiral arms, thin disks, a thick disk, and various
gas components, while the halo is the sum of a stellar component, a hot coronal gas, and a dark matter
component. The Galactic potential is computed from these population density profiles and used
to generate detailed kinematics by considering up to the first four moments of the collisionless
Boltzmann equation. The same density profiles are then used to define the observed color-magnitude
diagrams in a user-defined field of view from an arbitrary solar location. Several photometric
systems have been included and made available on-line and no limits on the size of the field of view
are imposed thus allowing full sky simulations, too. Finally, we model the extinction adopting
a dust model with advanced ray-tracing solutions. The model's web page (and tutorial) can be accessed
