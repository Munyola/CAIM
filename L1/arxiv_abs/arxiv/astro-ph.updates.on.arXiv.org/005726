We report on three-dimensional (3D) Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of recurrent eruptions
in emerging flux regions. We find that reconnection of sheared fieldlines, along the polarity inversion
line of an emerging bipolar region, leads to the formation of a new magnetic structure, which adopts
the shape of a magnetic flux rope during its rising motion. Initially, the flux rope undergoes a slow-rise
phase and, eventually, it experiences a fast-rise phase and ejective eruption towards the outer
solar atmosphere. In total, four eruptions occur during the evolution of the system. For the first
eruption, our analysis indicates that the torus instability initiates the eruption and that tether-cutting
reconnection of the fieldlines, which envelope the flux rope, triggers the rapid acceleration
of the eruptive field. For the following eruptions, we conjecture that it is the interplay between
tether-cutting reconnection and torus instability, which causes the onset of the various phases.
We show the 3D shape of the erupting fields, focusing more on how magnetic fieldlines reconnect during
the eruptions. We find that when the envelope fieldlines reconnect mainly with themselves, hot
and dense plasma is transferred closer to the core of the erupting flux rope. The same area appears
to be cooler and less dense when the envelope fieldlines reconnect with neighboring sheared fieldlines.
The plasma density and temperature distribution, together with the rising speeds, the energies
and the size of the erupting fields indicate that they may account for small-scale (mini) Coronal
Mass Ejections (CMEs).
