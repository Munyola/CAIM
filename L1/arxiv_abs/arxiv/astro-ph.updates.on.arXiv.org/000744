Mars is likely to be a planetary embryo formed through collisions with planetesimals, which can
explain its small mass and rapid formation timescale obtained from 182Hf-182$W chronometry. In
the classical theory of planet formation, the final embryo mass is determined only by the solid surface
density. However, embryos can stir surrounding planetesimals, leading to fragmentation through
erosive (cratering) collisions. We find that radial drift of small fragments can drastically reduce
the solid surface density. On the other hand, embryo growth is accelerated by fragment accretion.
Since collisional fragmentation efficiency depends on the initial size of planetesimals, the
final embryo mass and its growth time are determined by the initial planetesimal size and disk surface
density. We have investigated the effect of these two parameters on the mass of Mars and the predicted
radiogenic excess of 182W in the martian mantle. Two scenarios can explain the rapid formation of
small Mars: (i) it formed by accretion of small planetesimals in a massive disk or (ii) it formed from
large planetesimals but its growth was arrested by the inward then outward migration of Jupiter.
Taking into account all constraints, we conclude that Mars is likely to have formed in a massive disk
of about ~ 0.1 solar mass from planetesimals smaller than ~ 10 km in radius. Such small planetesimal
size cannot explain core accretion of Jupiter, suggesting that there may have been a heliocentric
gradient in planetesimal size in the solar nebula.
