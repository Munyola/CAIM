The growth channel of massive galaxies involving mergers can be studied via close pairs as putative
merger progenitors, where the stellar populations of the satellite galaxies will be eventually
incorporated into the massive primaries. We extend our recent analysis of the GAMA-based sample
of close pairs presented in Ferreras et al. to the general spectroscopic dataset of SDSS galaxies
(DR14), for which the high S/N of the data enables a detailed analysis of the differences between
satellite galaxies with respect to the mass of the primary galaxy. A sample of approximately two
thousand satellites of massive galaxies is carefully selected within a relatively narrow redshift
range (0.07<z<0.14). Two main parameters are considered as major drivers of the star formation
history of these galaxies, namely: the stellar velocity dispersion of the satellite ($\sigma$),
as a proxy of "local" drivers, and the ratio between the stellar mass of the satellite and the primary,
$\mu=M_{\rm SAT}/M_{\rm PRI}$, meant to serve as an indicator of environment. Consistently with
the independent, GAMA-based work, we find that satellites around the most massive primaries appear
older, at fixed velocity dispersion, with respect to satellites of lower mass primaries. This trend
is more marked in lower mass satellites ($\sigma$~100 km/s), with SSP-equivalent age differences
up to ~0.5 Gyr, and can be interpreted as a one-halo assembly bias, so that satellites corresponding
to smaller values of the mass ratio $\mu$ represent older structures, akin to fossil groups.
