We use ALMA observations of the host galaxy of the quasar ULAS-J1342+0928 at z=7.54 to study the dust
continuum and far infrared lines emitted from its interstellar medium. The Rayleigh-Jeans tail
of the dust continuum is well sampled with eight different spectral setups, and from a modified black
body fit we obtain an emissivity coefficient of beta=1.85+-0.3. Assuming a standard dust temperature
of 47 K we derive a dust mass of Mdust=0.35x10^8 Msol and a star formation rate of 150+-30 Msol/yr.
We have >4sigma detections of the [CII]_158, [OIII]_88 and [NII]_122 atomic fine structure lines
and limits on the [CI]_369, [OI]_146 and [NII]_205 emission. We also report multiple limits of CO
rotational lines with Jup >= 7, as well as a tentative 3.3sigma detection of the stack of four CO lines
(Jup=11, 10, 8, 7). We find line deficits that are in agreement with local ultra luminous infrared
galaxies. Comparison of the [NII]_122 and [CII]_158 lines indicates that the [CII]_158 emission
arises predominantly from the neutral medium, and we estimate that the photo-disassociation regions
in J1342+0928 have densities <~5x10^4cm^-3. The data suggest that ~16% of hydrogen is in ionized
form and that the HII regions have high electron densities of n_e>180 cm^-3. Our observations favor
a low gas-to-dust ratio of <100 and a metallicity of the interstellar medium comparable to the Solar
value. All the measurements presented here suggest that the host galaxy of J1342+0928 is highly
enriched in metal and dust, despite being observed just 680 Myr after the Big Bang.
