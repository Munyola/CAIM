Many hot Jupiter (HJ) systems have been observed to have their stellar spin axis misaligned with
the planet's orbital angular momentum axis. The origin of this spin-orbit misalignment and the
formation mechanism of HJs remain poorly understood. A number of recent works have suggested that
gravitational interactions between host stars, protoplanetary disks, and inclined binary companions
may tilt the stellar spin axis with respect to the disk's angular angular momentum axis, producing
planetary systems with misaligned orbits. These previous works considered idealized disk evolution
models and neglected the gravitational influence of newly formed planets. In this paper, we explore
how disk photoevaporation and planet formation and migration affect the inclination evolution
of planet-star-disk-binary systems. We take into account planet-disk interactions and the gravitational
spin-orbit coupling between the host star and the planet. We find that the rapid depletion of the
inner disk via photoevaporation reduces the excitation of stellar obliquities. Depending on the
formation and migration history of HJs, the spin-orbit coupling between the star and the planet
always reduces and may even completely suppress the excitation of stellar obliquities. In particular,
we find that HJs formed in-situ experience negligible excitation of spin-orbit misalignment.
Our work constrains the formation/migration history of HJs. On the other hand, planetary systems
with "cold" Jupiters or close-in super-earths may experience excitation of stellar obliquities
in the presence of distant inclined companions.
