Observations of clustering among the orbits of the most distant trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs)
has inspired interest in the possibility of an undiscovered ninth planet lurking in the outskirts
of the solar system. Numerical simulations by a number of authors have demonstrated that, with appropriate
choices of planet mass and orbit, such a planet can maintain clustering in the orbital elements of
the population of distant TNOs, similar to the observed sample. However, many aspects of the rich
underlying dynamical processes induced by such a distant eccentric perturber have not been fully
explored. We report the results of our investigation of the dynamics of coplanar test-particles
that interact with a massive body on an circular orbit (Neptune) and a massive body on a more distant,
highly eccentric orbit (the putative Planet Nine). We find that a detailed examination of our idealized
simulations affords tremendous insight into the rich test-particle dynamics that are possible.
In particular, we find that chaos and resonance overlap plays an important role in particles' dynamical
evolution. We develop a simple mapping model that allows us to understand, in detail, the web of overlapped
mean-motion resonances explored by chaotically evolving particles. We also demonstrate that
gravitational interactions with Neptune can have profound effects on the orbital evolution of
particles. Our results serve as a starting point for a better understanding of the dynamical behavior
observed in more complicated simulations that can be used to constrain the mass and orbit of Planet
9.
