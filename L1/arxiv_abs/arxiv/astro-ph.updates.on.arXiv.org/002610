The composition of planets is largely determined by the chemical and dynamical evolution of the
disk during planetesimal formation and growth. To predict the diversity of exoplanet compositions,
previous works modeled planetesimal composition as the equilibrium chemical composition of a
proto- planetary disk at a single time. However, planetesimals form over an extended period of time,
during which, elements sequentially condense out of the gas as the disk cools and are accreted onto
planetesi- mals. To account for the evolution of the disk during planetesimal formation, we couple
models of disk chemistry and dynamics with a prescription for planetesimal formation. We then follow
the growth of these planetesimals into terrestrial planets with N-body simulations of late stage
planet formation to evaluate the effect of sequential condensation on the bulk composition of planets.
We find that our model produces results similar to those of earlier models for disks with C/O ratios
close to the solar value (0.54). However, in disks with C/O ratios greater than 0.8, carbon rich planetesimals
form throughout a much larger radial range of the disk. Furthermore, our model produces carbon rich
planetesimals in disks with C/O ratios as low as ~0.65, which is not possible in the static equilibrium
chemistry case. These results suggest that (1) there may be a large population of short period carbon
rich planets around moderately carbon enhanced stars (0.65 < C/O < 0.8) and (2) carbon rich
planets can form throughout the terrestrial planet region around carbon rich stars (C/O > 0.8).
