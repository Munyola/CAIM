A recent analysis of data collected by the Planck satellite detected a net dipole at the location
of X-ray selected galaxy clusters, corresponding to a large-scale bulk flow extending at least
to $z\sim 0.18$, the median redshift of the cluster sample. The amplitude of this flow, as measured
with Planck, is consistent with earlier findings based on data from the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy
Probe (WMAP). However, the uncertainty assigned to the dipole by the Planck team is much larger than
that found in the WMAP studies, leading the authors of the Planck study to conclude that the observed
bulk flow is not statistical significant. We here show that two of the three implementations of random
sampling used in the error analysis of the Planck study lead to systematic overestimates in the uncertainty
of the measured dipole. The first method, rotation around the Galactic pole (the Z axis), increases
the uncertainty of the X and Y components of the dipole and artificially reduces the significance
of the dipole detection from 98-99% to less than 90% confidence. The second method, utilizing random
simulations of the sky, does not take into account that the actual realization of the sky leads to
filtered data that have a 12% lower root-mean-square dispersion than the average simulation. When
either effect is taken into account, the corrected errors agree with those obtained with the third
estimation method, and the resulting statistical significance of the dipole measured by Planck
is consistent with that of the WMAP results.
