We report a possible discovery of a relic star cluster in the Sextans dwarf spheroidal galaxy. Using
the \textit{hk} index ($\equiv$($Ca-b$)$-$($b-y$)) as a photometric metallicity indicator,
we discriminate the metal-poor and metal-rich stars in the galaxy and find unexpected number density
excess of metal-poor stars located 7'.7 ($\sim$190 pc in projected distance) away from the known
galactic center. The $V-I$ color$-$magnitude diagram (CMD) for stars around the density excess
reveals that both the main sequence and the giant branch are considerably narrower and redder than
the bulk of field stars in Sextans. Our stellar population models show (a) that the narrow CMD is best
reproduced by a simple stellar population with an age of $\sim$13 Gyr and [Fe/H] of $\sim$$-$2.3
dex, and (b) that the redder $V-I$ color of the $hk$-weak population is explained $only$ if it is $\sim$2
Gyr older than the field stars. The results lead us to conclude that the off-centered density peak
is likely associated with an old, metal-poor globular cluster. The larger spatial extent ($>$ 80
pc in radius) and the smaller number of stars ($\sim$1000) than typical globular clusters point
to a star cluster that is in the process of dissolution. The finding serves as the first detection
of a surviving star cluster in Sextans, supporting previous suggestions of the presence of star
cluster remnants in the galaxy. If confirmed, the survival of a relic star cluster until now implies
a $cored$ dark matter halo profile for this dwarf galaxy.
