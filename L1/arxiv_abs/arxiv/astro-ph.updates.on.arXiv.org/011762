Recent observations suggest that dense gas clouds can survive even in hot galactic winds. Here we
show that the inclusion of turbulent densities with different statistical properties has significant
effects on the evolution of wind-swept clouds. We investigate how the initial standard deviation
of the log-normal density field influences the dynamics of quasi-isothermal clouds embedded in
supersonic winds. We compare uniform, fractal solenoidal, and fractal compressive cloud models
in both 3D and 2D hydrodynamical simulations. We find that the processes of cloud disruption and
dense gas entrainment are functions of the initial density distribution in the cloud. Fractal clouds
accelerate, mix, and are disrupted earlier than uniform clouds. Within the fractal cloud sample,
compressive clouds retain high-density nuclei, so they are more confined, less accelerated, and
have lower velocity dispersions than their solenoidal counterparts. Compressive clouds are also
less prone to Kelvin-Helmholtz and Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities, so they survive longer than
solenoidal clouds. By comparing the cloud properties at the destruction time, we find that dense
gas entrainment is more effective in uniform clouds than in either of the fractal clouds, and it is
more effective in solenoidal than in compressive models. In contrast, mass loading into the wind
is more efficient in compressive cloud models than in uniform or solenoidal models. Overall, wide
density distributions lead to inefficient entrainment, but they facilitate mass loading and favour
the survival of very dense gas in hot galactic winds.
