Cross correlation with thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ) effect in cosmic microwave background
observation and weak gravitational lensing effect in galaxy imaging survey opens a new window on
constraining matter contents in the Universe at redshift less than 1. In this paper, we study the
impact of radio sources and cosmic infrared background (CIB) on observed tSZ-lensing correlation.
Assuming the best-fit model of CIB by the Planck satellite, we estimate that the residual correlation
of CIB with large-scale structures will be of an order of $2\%$ of expected tSZ-lensing correlation
from intracluster medium in current lensing surveys. On the other hand, despite large model uncertainties,
we find that correlation of lensing and radio sources can induce a negative correction for the observed
tSZ-lensing correlation with a $\sim10-30\%$ level. This is originated from positive cross correlation
with radio sources and lensing at $\sim100\, {\rm GHz}$ frequency, whereas tSZ-lensing correlation
should show a negative value in temperature fluctuations at that frequency. We also show that the
negative correction by radio-lensing correlation can solve the tension between recent measurements
of tSZ-lensing correlation and an expected signal from "universal" gas pressure profile of nearby
galaxy clusters, when the radio sources with flat-spectral index are assumed to populate massive
cluster-sized dark matte halos. Our results indicate that minor source population in radio bands
can play an important role in determining observed tSZ-lensing correlation at $<10$ arcmin.
