We have recently introduced in the first work of this series, an extension of the RAR model for the
distribution of DM in galaxies. Being built upon self-gravitating fermions at finite temperatures,
the RAR model solutions develop a characteristic $\textit{dense quantum core-diluted halo}$
morphology which, for fermion masses in the range $mc^2 \approx 10 - 345\,{\rm keV}$, was shown to
provide good fits to the Milky Way rotation curve. We study here for the first time the applicability
of the extended RAR model to other galaxy types from dwarf to ellipticals, pointing out the relevant
case of $mc^2 = 48\,{\rm keV}$. By making a full coverage of the remaining free parameters of the theory,
and for each galaxy type, we present a complete family of astrophysical RAR profiles which satisfy
realistic halo boundary conditions inferred from observational data. Each family-set of RAR solutions
predicts given windows of total halo masses and central quantum-core masses, the latter opening
the interesting possibility to interpret them as alternatives either to intermediate-mass BHs
(in the case of dwarf galaxies), or to supermassive BHs (SMBHs, in the case of spiral and elliptical
galaxies). The model is shown to be in good agreement with different observationally inferred scaling
relations such as: (1) the "Ferrarese relation" connecting DM halos with supermassive dark central
objects, and (2) the nearly constant DM surface density of galaxies. Finally, the theory provides
a natural mechanism for the formation of SMBHs of few $10^8\,M_\odot$ via the gravitational collapse
of unstable DM quantum-cores.
