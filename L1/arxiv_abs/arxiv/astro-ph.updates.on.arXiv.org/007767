Using the disc instability model we investigate the stability of accretion discs in long--period
binary systems. We simulate outbursts due to the thermal-viscous instabilities for two symbiotic
systems, RS Ophiuchi and Z Andromedae. The outbursts properties deduced from our simulations suggest
that although the recurrent nova events observed in RS Oph are due to a thermonuclear runaway at the
white dwarf surface, these runaways are triggered by accretion disc instabilities. In quiescence,
the disc builds up its mass and it is only during the disc-instability outburst that mass is accreted
onto the white dwarf at rates comparable to or larger than the mass-transfer rate. If the mass transfer
rate is in the range $10^{-8}$ -- $10^{-7}~{\rm M_{\odot}}$/yr, the accretion rate and the mass
accreted are sufficient to lead to a thermonuclear runaway during one of a series of a few dwarf nova
outbursts, barely visible in the optical, but easily detectable in X-rays. In the case of Z And, persistent
irradiation of the disc by the very hot white--dwarf surface strongly modifies the dwarf-nova outbursts
properties, making them significant only for very high mass transfer rates, of the order of $10^{-6}~{\rm
M_{\odot}}$/yr, much higher than the expected secular mean in this system. It is thus likely that
the so-called "combination nova" \citep{sokoloski2006b} outburst observed in years 2000-2002
was triggered not by a dwarf-nova instability but by a mass--transfer enhancement from the giant
companion, leading to an increase of nuclear burning at the accreting white-dwarf surface.
