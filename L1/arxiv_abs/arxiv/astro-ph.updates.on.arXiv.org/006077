In a low-density region of the Shapley supercluster we identified an interacting galaxy pair at
redshift z=0.04865 in which the Seyfert-2 nucleus of the main galaxy (ShaSS 073) is exciting an extended
emission line region (EELR, ~170 kpc^2) in the disk of the less massive companion (ShaSS 622). New
integral-field spectroscopy and the multi-band data-set, spanning from far-ultraviolet to far-infrared
and radio wavelengths, allowed us to obtain a detailed description of the ShaSS 622-073 system.
The gas kinematics shows hints of interaction, although the overall velocity field shows a quite
regular rotation in both galaxies, thus suggesting that we are observing their first encounter
as confirmed by the estimated distance of 21 kpc between the two galaxy centers. The detected ~2-3
kpc AGN outflow and the geometry of the EELR in ShaSS 622 support the presence of a hollow bicone structure.
The status and sources of the ionization across the whole system have been analysed through photoionization
models and a Bayesian approach which prove a clear connection between the AGN and the EELR. The luminosity
of the AGN (2.4x10^44 erg/s) is a factor 20 lower than the power needed to excite the gas in the EELR
(4.6x10^45 erg/s) indicating a dramatic fading of the AGN in the last 3x10^4 yr. ShaSS 073-622 provides
all the ingredients listed in the recipe of a light echo where a highly ionised region maintains memory
of a preceding more energetic phase of a now faded AGN. This is the first case of a light echo observed
between two galaxies.
