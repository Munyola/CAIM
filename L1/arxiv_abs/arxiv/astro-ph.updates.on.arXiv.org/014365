Recent detailed observations of protoplanetary discs revealed a lot of sub-structures which are
mostly ring-like. One interpretation is that these rings are caused by growing planets. These potential
planets are not yet opening very deep gaps in their discs. These planets instead form small gaps in
the discs to generate small pressure bumps exterior to their orbits that stop the inflow of the largest
dust particles. In the pebble accretion paradigm, this planetary mass corresponds to the pebble
isolation mass, where pebble accretion stops and efficient gas accretion starts. We perform planet
population synthesis via pebble and gas accretion including type-I and type-II migration. In the
first stage of our simulations, we investigate the conditions necessary for planets to reach the
pebble isolation mass and compare their position to the observed gaps. We find that in order to match
the gap structures 2000 M E in pebbles is needed, which would be only available for the most metal rich
stars. We then follow the evolution of these planets for a few My to compare the resulting population
with the observed exoplanet populations. Planet formation in discs with these large amounts of
pebbles result in mostly forming gas giants and only very little super-Earths, contradicting observations.
This leads to the conclusions that either (i) the observed discs are exceptions, (ii) not all gaps
in observed discs are caused by planets or (iii) that we miss some important ingredients in planet
formation related to gas accretion and/or planet migration.
