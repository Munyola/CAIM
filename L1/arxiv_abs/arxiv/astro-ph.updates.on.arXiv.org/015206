We study the optical morphology of galaxies in a large-scale hydrodynamic cosmological simulation,
the EAGLE simulation. Galaxy morphologies were characterized using non-parametric statistics
(Gini, $M_{20}$, Concentration and Asymmetry) derived from mock images computed using a 3D radiative
transfer technique and post-processed to approximate observational surveys. The resulting morphologies
were contrasted to observational results from a sample of $\log_{10}(M_{*}/M_\odot) > 10$ galaxies
at $z \sim 0.05$ in the GAMA survey. We find that the morphologies of EAGLE galaxies reproduce observations,
except for asymmetry values which are larger. Additionally, we study the effect of spatial resolution
in the computation of non-parametric morphologies, finding that Gini and Asymmetry values are
systematically reduced with decreasing spatial resolution. Gini values for lower mass galaxies
are especially affected. Comparing against other large scale simulations, the non-parametric
statistics of EAGLE galaxies largely agree with those found in IllustrisTNG. Additionally, EAGLE
galaxies mostly reproduce observed trends between morphology and star formation rate and galaxy
size. Finally, We also find a significant correlation between optical and kinematic estimators
of morphologies, although galaxy classification based on an optical or a kinematic criteria results
in different galaxy subsets. The correlation between optical and kinematic morphologies is stronger
in central galaxies than in satellites, indicating differences in morphological evolution.
