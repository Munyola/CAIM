We present results from two-dimensional, general relativistic, viscous, radiation hydrodynamic
numerical simulations of Shakura-Sunyaev thin disks accreting onto stellar mass Schwarzschild
black holes. We consider cases on both the gas- and radiation-pressure-dominated branches of the
thermal equilibrium curve, with mass accretion rates spanning the range from $\dot{M} = 0.01 L_\mathrm{Edd}/c^2$
to $10 L_\mathrm{Edd}/c^2$. The simulations directly test the stability of this standard disk
model on the different branches. We find clear evidence of thermal instability for all radiation-pressure-dominated
disks, resulting universally in the vertical collapse of the disks, which in some cases then settle
onto the stable, gas-pressure-dominated branch. Although these results are consistent with decades-old
theoretical predictions, they appear to be in conflict with available observational data from
black hole X-ray binaries. We also find evidence for a radiation-pressure-driven instability
that breaks the unstable disks up into alternating rings of high and low surface density on a timescale
comparable to the thermal collapse. Since radiation is included self-consistently in the simulations,
we are able to calculate lightcurves and power density spectra (PDS). For the most part, we measure
radiative efficiencies (ratio of luminosity to mass accretion rate) close to 6%, as expected for
a non-rotating black hole. The PDS appear as broken power laws, with a break typically around 100
Hz. There is no evidence of significant excess power at any frequencies, i.e. no quasi-periodic
oscillations are observed.
