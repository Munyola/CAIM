A wide variety of outstanding problems in astrophysics involve the motion of a large number of particles
($N\gtrsim 10^{6}$) under the force of gravity. These include the global evolution of globular
clusters, tidal disruptions of stars by a massive black hole, the formation of protoplanets and
the detection of sources of gravitational radiation. The direct-summation of $N$ gravitational
forces is a complex problem with no analytical solution and can only be tackled with approximations
and numerical methods. To this end, the Hermite scheme is a widely used integration method. With
different numerical techniques and special-purpose hardware, it can be used to speed up the calculations.
But these methods tend to be computationally slow and cumbersome to work with. Here we present a new
GPU, direct-summation $N-$body integrator written from scratch and based on this scheme. This
code has high modularity, allowing users to readily introduce new physics, it exploits available
high-performance computing resources and will be maintained by public, regular updates. The code
can be used in parallel on multiple CPUs and GPUs, with a considerable speed-up benefit. The single
GPU version runs about 200 times faster compared to the single CPU version. A test run using 4 GPUs
in parallel shows a speed up factor of about 3 as compared to the single GPU version. The conception
and design of this first release is aimed at users with access to traditional parallel CPU clusters
or computational nodes with one or a few GPU cards.
