The XMM-XXL Survey spans two fields of $\rm 25$ deg$^2$ each observed for more than 6Ms with XMM, which
provided a sample of tens of thousands of point sources with a flux limit of $\sim 2.2 \times 10^{-15}$
and $\sim 1.4 \times 10^{-14}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{2}$, corresponding to 50% of the area curve, in
the soft band and hard band, respectively. In this paper we present the spatial clustering properties
of $\sim 3100$ and $\sim 1900$ X-ray active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in the 0.5-2 and 2-10 keV bands,
respectively, which have been spectroscopically observed with the AAOmega facility. This sample
is 90% redshift complete down to an optical magnitude limit of $r\lesssim 21.8$. The sources span
the redshift interval $0<z<5.2$, although in the current analysis we limit our samples to $z\le
3$, with corresponding sample median values of $\bar{z}\simeq 0.96$ and 0.79 for the soft band and
hard band, respectively. We employ the projected two-point correlation function to infer the spatial
clustering and find a correlation length $r_0=7.0 (\pm 0.34)$ and 6.42$(\pm 0.42)$ $h^{-1}$ Mpc,
respectively, for the soft- and hard-band detected sources with a slope for both cases of $\gamma=1.44
(\pm 0.1)$. The power-law clustering was detected within comoving separations of 1 and $\sim$25
$h^{-1}$ Mpc. These results, as well as those derived in two separate redshift ranges, provide bias
factors of the corresponding AGN host dark matter halos that are consistent with a halo mass of $\log_{10}
[M_h/(h^{-1} M_{\odot})]=13.04\pm 0.06$, confirming the results of most recent studies based
on smaller X-ray AGN samples.
