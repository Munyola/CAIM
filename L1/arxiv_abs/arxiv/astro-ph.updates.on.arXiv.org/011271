The systematic analysis of optical large-scale surveys has revealed a population of dwarf galaxies
hosting AGN, which have been confirmed by X-ray follow-up observations. Recently, the MaNGA survey
identified six dwarf galaxies that appear to have an AGN that is preventing on-going star formation.
It is therefore timely to study the physical properties of dwarf galaxies, in particular whether
the presence of an AGN can affect their evolution. Using the moving mesh code AREPO, we have investigated
different models of AGN activity, ranging from simple energy-driven spherical winds to collimated,
mass-loaded, bipolar outflows in high resolution simulations of isolated dwarf galaxies hosting
an active black hole. Our simulations also include a novel implementation of star formation and
mechanical supernova (SN) feedback. We find that AGN outflows have a small but systematic effect
on the central star formation rates (SFRs) for all set-ups explored, while substantial effects
on the global SFR are only obtained with strong SNe and a sustained high-luminosity AGN with an isotropic
wind. This suggests that AGN feedback in dwarf galaxies is unlikely to directly regulate their global
SFRs. There is, however, a significant effect on outflow properties, which are notably enhanced
by the AGN to much higher outflow temperatures and velocities, in agreement with kinematic signatures
from the MaNGA survey. This indicates that AGN may play an indirect role in regulating the baryon
cycle in dwarf galaxies by hindering cosmic gas inflows.
