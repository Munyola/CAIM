Interstellar dust is an important component of the galactic ecosystem, playing a key role in multiple
galaxy formation processes. We present a novel numerical framework for the dynamics and size evolution
of dust grains implemented in the moving-mesh hydrodynamics code AREPO suited for cosmological
galaxy formation simulations. We employ a particle-based method for dust subject to dynamical
forces including drag and gravity. The drag force is implemented using a second-order semi-implicit
integrator and validated using several dust-hydrodynamical test problems. Each dust particle
has a grain size distribution, describing the local abundance of grains of different sizes. The
grain size distribution is discretised with a second-order piecewise linear method and evolves
in time according to various dust physical processes, including accretion, sputtering, shattering,
and coagulation. We present a novel scheme for stochastically forming dust during stellar evolution
and new methods for sub-cycling of dust physics time-steps. Using this model, we simulate an isolated
disc galaxy to study the impact of dust physical processes that shape the interstellar grain size
distribution. We demonstrate, for example, how dust shattering shifts the grain size distribution
to smaller sizes resulting in a significant rise of radiation extinction from optical to near-ultraviolet
wavelengths. Our framework for simulating dust and gas mixtures can readily be extended to account
for other dynamical processes relevant in galaxy formation, like magnetohydrodynamics, radiation
pressure, and thermo-chemical processes.
