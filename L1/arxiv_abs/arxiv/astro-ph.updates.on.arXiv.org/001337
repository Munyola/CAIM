The organic haze of aerosols that shrouds the Saturnian moon Titan has previously been studied by
both observations and laboratory simulation experiments. Here we report the abiotic formation
of amino acid precursors in complex organic molecules during experimental simulation of the environment
near Titan's surface with proton irradiation. Pyrolysis of the organic molecules formed in the
simulated Titan atmosphere by proton irradiation at 600 degree-C yielded compounds that contained
HCN and NH3. These experimental results are consistent with the molecular information obtained
by pyrolysis gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (pyrolysis GC-MS) of samples collected by
the Huygens probe to Titan. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and three-dimensional atomic force
microscopy (AFM) images of the irradiation products reveal nanometer-scale filaments and globules
in complex amorphous structures (approximately 1000 Da). Isotope probing experiments by matrix-assisted
laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) show that oxygen
atoms were incorporated into the racemic amino acids by hydrolysis of 18O- labeled water. We suggest
that the amino acid precursors possibly formed after water hydrolysis, as suggested in a previous
observational study (C. A. Griffith, T. Owen, T. R. Geballe, J. Rayner, and P. Rannou, Science, 2003,
300, 628). We propose that cosmic rays are a significant and effective energy source for producing
complex organics and amino acid precursors in Titan's atmospheric haze.
