We study the evidence for a symbiotic connection between active galactic nuclei (AGN) fueling and
star formation by investigating the relationship between the X-ray luminosities of AGN and the
star formation rates (SFRs) of their host galaxies. We identify a sample of 309 AGN with X-ray luminosities
$10^{41}<L_\mathrm{X}<10^{44} $ erg s$^{-1}$ at $0.2 < z < 1.2$ in the PRIMUS spectroscopic
redshift survey. There is a wide range of SFR at a given $L_X$, and we do not find a significant correlation
between SFR and the observed instantaneous $L_X$ for star forming galaxies. However, there is a
weak but significant correlation between the mean $L_\mathrm{X}$ of detected AGN and SFR, which
likely reflects that $L_\mathrm{X}$ varies on shorter timescales than SFR. We also find no correlation
between stellar mass and AGN luminosity. AGN are found in star forming and quiescent galaxies, and
both galaxy populations have a similar power-law distribution in the probability of hosting an
AGN as a function of specific accretion rate. However, a higher fraction of AGN hosts are classified
as star forming with increasing $L_\mathrm{X}$, and a star forming galaxy is $\sim2-3$ times more
likely to host an AGN of a given specific accretion rate than a quiescent galaxy of the same stellar
mass. The probability of a galaxy hosting an AGN remains constant across the main sequence of star
formation. These results indicate that there is an underlying connection between star formation
and the presence of AGN, but AGN are also widespread in quiescent galaxies.
