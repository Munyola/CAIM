Galaxy clusters are the endpoints of structure formation and are continuously growing through
the merging and accretion of smaller structures. Numerical simulations predict that a fraction
of their energy content is not yet thermalized, mainly in the form of kinetic motions (turbulence,
bulk motions). Measuring the level of non-thermal pressure support is necessary to understand
the processes leading to the virialization of the gas within the potential well of the main halo and
to calibrate the biases in hydrostatic mass estimates. We present high-quality measurements of
hydrostatic masses and intracluster gas fraction out to the virial radius for a sample of 12 nearby
clusters with available XMM-Newton and Planck data. We compare our hydrostatic gas fractions with
the expected universal gas fraction to constrain the level of non-thermal pressure support. We
find that hydrostatic masses require little correction and infer a median non-thermal pressure
fraction of $\sim6\%$ and $\sim10\%$ at $R_{500}$ and $R_{200}$, respectively. Our values are
lower than the expectations of hydrodynamical simulations, possibly implying a faster thermalization
of the gas. If instead we use the mass calibration adopted by the Planck team, we find that the gas fraction
of massive local systems implies a mass bias $1-b=0.85\pm0.05$ for SZ-derived masses, with some
evidence for a mass-dependent bias. Conversely, the high bias required to match Planck CMB and cluster
count cosmology is excluded by the data at high significance, unless the most massive halos are missing
a substantial fraction of their baryons.
