We study the galactic bulges in the Auriga simulations, a suite of thirty cosmological magneto-hydrodynamical
zoom-in simulations of late-type galaxies in Milky Way-sized dark matter haloes performed with
the moving-mesh code AREPO. We aim to characterize bulge formation mechanisms in this large suite
of galaxies simulated at high resolution in a fully cosmological context. The bulges of the Auriga
galaxies show a large variety in their shapes,sizes and formation histories. According to observational
classification criteria, such as Sersic index and degree of ordered rotation, the majority of the
Auriga bulges can be classified as pseudo-bulges, while some of them can be seen as composite bulges
with a classical component; however, none can be classified as a classical bulge. Auriga bulges
show mostly an in-situ origin, 21 percent of them with a negligible accreted fraction (facc < 0.01).
In general,their in-situ component was centrally formed, with 75 percent of the bulges forming
most of their stars inside the bulge region at z=0. Part of their in-situ mass growth is rapid and is
associated with the effects of mergers, while another part is more secular in origin. In 90 percent
of the Auriga bulges, the accreted bulge component originates from less than four satellites.We
investigate the relation between the accreted stellar haloes and the bulges of the Auriga simulations.
The total bulge mass shows no correlation with the accreted stellar halo mass, as in observations.
However, the accreted mass of bulges tends to correlate with their respective accreted stellar
halo mass.
