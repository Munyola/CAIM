Current lunar origin scenarios suggest that Earth's Moon may have resulted from the merger of two
(or more) smaller moonlets. Dynamical studies of multiple moons find that these satellite systems
are not stable, resulting in moonlet collision or loss of one or more of the moonlets. We perform Smoothed
Particle Hydrodynamic (SPH) impact simulations of two orbiting moonlets inside the planetary
gravitational potential and find that the classical outcome of two bodies impacting in free space
is altered as erosive mass loss is more significant with decreasing distance to the planet. Depending
on the conditions of accretion, each moonlet could have a distinct isotopic signature, therefore,
we assess the initial mixing during their merger, in order to estimate whether future measurements
of surface variations could distinguish between lunar origin scenarios (single vs. multiple moonlets).
We find that for comparable-size impacting bodies in the accretionary regime, surface mixing is
efficient, but in the hit-and-run regime, only a small amount of material is transferred between
the bodies. However, sequences of hit-and-run impacts are expected, which will enhance the surface
mixing. Overall, our results show that large scale heterogeneities can arise only from the merger
of drastically different component masses. Surfaces of moons resulting from the merger of comparable-sized
components have little material heterogeneities, and such impacts are preferred, as the relatively
massive impactor generates more melt, extending the lunar magma ocean phase.
