It is challenging to reliably identify stars that were born together outside of actively star-forming
regions and bound stellar systems. However, co-natal stars should be present throughout the Galaxy,
and their demographics can shed light on the clustered nature of star formation and the dynamical
state of the disk. In previous work we presented a set of simulations of the Galactic disk that followed
the clustered formation and dynamical evolution of 4 billion individual stars over the last 5 Gyr.
The simulations predict that a high fraction of co-moving stars with physical and 3D velocity separation
of $\Delta r < 20$ pc and $\Delta v < 1.5$ km s$^{-1}$ are co-natal. In this \textit{Letter}, we use
\textit{Gaia} DR2 and LAMOST DR4 data to identify and study co-moving pairs. We find that the distribution
of relative velocities and separations of pairs in the data is in good agreement with the predictions
from the simulation. We identify 111 co-moving pairs in the Solar neighborhood with reliable astrometric
and spectroscopic measurements. These pairs show a strong preference for having similar metallicities
when compared to random field pairs. We therefore conclude that these pairs were very likely born
together. The simulations predict that co-natal pairs originate preferentially from high-mass
and relatively young ($< 1$ Gyr) star clusters. \textit{Gaia} will eventually deliver well-determined
metallicities for the brightest stars, enabling the identification of thousands of co-natal pairs
due to disrupting star clusters in the solar neighborhood.
