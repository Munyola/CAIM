e-ASTROGAM is a concept for a breakthrough observatory space mission carrying a gamma-ray telescope
dedicated to the study of the non-thermal Universe in the photon energy range from 0.15 MeV to 3 GeV.
The lower energy limit can be pushed down to energies as low as 30 keV for gamma-ray burst detection
with the calorimeter. The mission is based on an advanced space-proven detector technology, with
unprecedented sensitivity, angular and energy resolution, combined with remarkable polarimetric
capability. Thanks to its performance in the MeV-GeV domain, substantially improving its predecessors,
e-ASTROGAM will open a new window on the non-thermal Universe, making pioneering observations
of the most powerful Galactic and extragalactic sources, elucidating the nature of their relativistic
outflows and their effects on the surroundings. With a line sensitivity in the MeV energy range one
to two orders of magnitude better than previous and current generation instruments, e-ASTROGAM
will determine the origin of key isotopes fundamental for the understanding of supernova explosion
and the chemical evolution of our Galaxy. The mission will be a major player of the multiwavelength,
multimessenger time-domain astronomy of the 2030s, and provide unique data of significant interest
to a broad astronomical community, complementary to powerful observatories such as LISA, LIGO,
Virgo, KAGRA, the Einstein Telescope and the Cosmic Explorer, IceCube-Gen2 and KM3NeT, SKA, ALMA,
JWST, E-ELT, LSST, Athena, and the Cherenkov Telescope Array.
