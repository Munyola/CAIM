The accretion disk that forms after a neutron star merger is a source of neutron-rich ejecta. The
ejected material contributes to a radioactively-powered electromagnetic transient, with properties
that depend sensitively on the composition of the outflow. Here we investigate how the spin of the
black hole remnant influences mass ejection on the thermal and viscous timescales. To this end,
we carry out two-dimensional, time-dependent hydrodynamic simulations of merger remnant accretion
disks including viscous angular momentum transport and approximate neutrino self-irradiation.
The gravity of the spinning black hole is included via a pseudo-Newtonian potential. We find that
a disk around a spinning black hole ejects more mass, up to a factor of several, relative to the non-spinning
case. The enhanced mass loss is due to energy release by accretion occurring deeper in the gravitational
potential, raising the disk temperature and hence the rate of viscous heating in regions where neutrino
cooling is ineffective. The mean electron fraction of the outflow increases moderately with BH
spin due to a highly-irradiated (though not neutrino-driven) wind component. While the bulk of
the ejecta is still very neutron-rich, the leading edge of the wind contains a small amount of Lanthanide-free
material. This component can give rise to a ~1 day blue optical `bump' in a kilonova light curve, which
may facilitate its detection. We discuss implications for the generation of r-process elements
and for the radioactively-powered transient expected from these mergers.
