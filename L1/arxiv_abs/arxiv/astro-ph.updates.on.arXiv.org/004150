Plasma turbulence occurs ubiquitously in space and astrophysical plasmas, mediating the nonlinear
transfer of energy from large-scale electromagnetic fields and plasma flows to small scales at
which the energy may be ultimately converted to plasma heat. But plasma turbulence also generically
leads to a tangling of the magnetic field that threads through the plasma. The resulting wander of
the magnetic field lines may significantly impact a number of important physical processes, including
the propagation of cosmic rays and energetic particles, confinement in magnetic fusion devices,
and the fundamental processes of turbulence, magnetic reconnection, and particle acceleration.
The various potential impacts of magnetic field line wander are reviewed in detail, and a number
of important theoretical considerations are identified that may influence the development and
saturation of magnetic field line wander in astrophysical plasma turbulence. The results of nonlinear
gyrokinetic simulations of kinetic Alfven wave turbulence of sub-ion length scales are evaluated
to understand the development and saturation of the turbulent magnetic energy spectrum and of the
magnetic field line wander. It is found that turbulent space and astrophysical plasmas are generally
expected to contain a stochastic magnetic field due to the tangling of the field by strong plasma
turbulence. Future work will explore how the saturated magnetic field line wander varies as a function
of the amplitude of the plasma turbulence and the ratio of the thermal to magnetic pressure, known
as the plasma beta.
