We report our first discoveries of high-redshift supernovae from the Subaru HIgh-Z sUpernova CAmpaign
(SHIZUCA), a transient survey using Subaru/Hyper Suprime-Cam. We report the discovery of three
supernovae at spectroscopically-confirmed redshifts of 2.399 (HSC16adga), 1.965 (HSC17auzg),
and 1.851 (HSC17dbpf), and two supernova candidates with host-galaxy photometric redshifts of
3.2 (HSC16apuo) and 4.2 (HSC17dsid), respectively. In this paper, we present their photometric
properties and the spectroscopic properties of the confirmed high-redshift supernovae are presented
in the accompanying paper Curtin et al. (2018). The supernovae with the confirmed redshifts of z
~ 2 have rest ultraviolet peak magnitudes of around -21 mag, which make them superluminous supernovae.
The discovery of three supernovae at z ~ 2 roughly corresponds to an event rate of ~ 900 Gpc-3 yr-1,
which is already consistent with the total superluminous supernova rate estimated by extrapolating
the local rate based on the cosmic star-formation history. Adding unconfirmed superluminous supernova
candidates would increase the event rate. Our superluminous supernova candidates at the redshifts
of around 3 and 4 indicate minimum superluminous supernova rates of ~ 400 Gpc-3 yr-1 (z ~ 3) and ~ 500
Gpc-3 yr-1 (z ~ 4). Because we have only performed a pilot search for high-redshift supernovae so
far and have not completed selecting all the high-redshift supernova candidates, these rates are
lower limits. Our initial results demonstrate the amazing capability of Hyper Suprime-Cam to discover
high-redshift supernovae.
