In this work, by using strong gravitational lensing (SGL) observations along with Type Ia Supernovae
(Union2.1) and gamma ray burst data (GRBs), we propose a new method to study a possible redshift evolution
of $\gamma(z)$, the mass density power-law index of strong gravitational lensing systems. In this
analysis, we assume the validity of cosmic distance duality relation and the flat universe. In order
to explore the $\gamma(z)$ behavior, three different parametrizations are considered, namely:
(P1) $\gamma(z_l)=\gamma_0+\gamma_1 z_l$, (P2) $\gamma(z_l)=\gamma_0+\gamma_1 z_l/(1+z_l)$
and (P3) $\gamma(z_l)=\gamma_0+\gamma_1 \ln(1+z_l)$, where $z_l$ corresponds to lens redshift.
If $\gamma_0=2$ and $\gamma_1=0$ the singular isothermal sphere model is recovered. Our method
is performed on SGL sub-samples defined by different lens redshifts and velocity dispersions.
For the former case, the results are in full agreement with each other, while a 1$\sigma$ tension
between the sub-samples with low ($\leq 250$ km/s) and high ($>250$ km/s) velocity dispersions
was obtained on the ($\gamma_0$-$\gamma_1$) plane. By considering the complete SGL sample, we
obtain $\gamma_0 \approx 2$ and $ \gamma_1 \approx 0$ within 1$\sigma$ c.l. for all $\gamma(z)$
parametrizations. However, we find the following best fit values of $\gamma_1$: $-0.085$, $-0.16$
and $-0.12$ for P1, P2 and P3 parametrizations, respectively, suggesting a mild evolution for $\gamma(z)$.
By repeating the analysis with Type Ia Supernovae from JLA compilation, GRBs and SGL systems this
mild evolution is reinforced.
