New generation of radio interferometers are envisaged to produce high quality, high dynamic range
Stokes images of the observed sky from the corresponding under-sampled Fourier domain measurements.
In practice, these measurements are contaminated by the instrumental and atmospheric effects
that are well represented by Jones matrices, and are most often varying with observation direction
and time. These effects, usually unknown, act as a limiting factor in achieving the required imaging
performance and thus, their calibration is crucial. To address this issue, we develop a global algorithm,
named Polca SARA, aiming to perform full polarization, direction-dependent calibration and sparse
imaging by employing a non-convex optimization technique. In contrast with the existing approaches,
the proposed method offers global convergence guarantees and flexibility to incorporate sophisticated
priors to regularize the imaging as well as the calibration problem. Thus, we adapt a polarimetric
imaging specific method, enforcing the physical polarization constraint along with a sparsity
prior for the sought images. We perform extensive simulation studies of the proposed algorithm.
While indicating the superior performance of polarization constraint based imaging, the obtained
results also highlight the importance of calibrating for direction-dependent effects as well
as for off-diagonal terms (denoting polarization leakage) in the associated Jones matrices, without
inclusion of which the imaging quality deteriorates.
