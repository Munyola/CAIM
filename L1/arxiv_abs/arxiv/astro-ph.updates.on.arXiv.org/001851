IRAS20126+4104 is a well studied B0.5 protostar that is surrounded by a ~1000 au Keplerian disk and
is where a large-scale outflow originates. Both 6.7-GHz CH3OH masers and 22-GHz H2O masers have
been detected toward this young stellar object. The CH3OH masers trace the Keplerian disk, while
the H2O masers are associated with the surface of the conical jet. Recently, observations of dust
polarized emission (350 um) at an angular resolution of 9 arcseconds (~15000 au) have revealed an
S-shaped morphology of the magnetic field around IRAS20126+4104. The observations of polarized
maser emissions at milliarcsecond resolution (~20 au) can make a crucial contribution to understanding
the orientation of the magnetic field close to IRAS20126+4104. This will allow us to determine whether
the magnetic field morphology changes from arcsecond resolution to milliarcsecond resolution.
The European VLBI Network was used to measure the linear polarization and the Zeeman splitting of
the 6.7-GHz CH3OH masers toward IRAS20126+4104. The NRAO Very Long Baseline Array was used to measure
the linear polarization and the Zeeman splitting of the 22-GHz H2O masers toward the same region.
We detected 26 CH3OH masers and 5 H2O masers at high angular resolution. Linear polarization emission
was observed toward three CH3OH masers and toward one H2O maser. Significant Zeeman splitting was
measured in one CH3OH maser (\Delta V_{Z}=-9.2 +/- 1.4 m/s). No significant (5 sigma) magnetic field
strength was measured using the H2O masers. We found that in IRAS20126+4104 the rotational energy
is less than the magnetic energy.
