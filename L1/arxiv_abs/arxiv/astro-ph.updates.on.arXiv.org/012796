We perform as the first time hydrodynamic simulations to study the properties of hot accretion flow
(HAF) around a neutron star (NS). The energy carried by the HAF will eventually be radiated out at
the surface of the NS. The emitted photons can propagate inside the HAF and cool the HAF via Comptonization.
We find that the Compton cooling can affect the properties of HAF around a NS significantly. We define
the Eddington accretion rate as $\dot M_{\rm Edd}=10L_{\rm Edd}/c^2$, with $L_{\rm Edd}$ and $c$
being the Eddington luminosity and the speed of light, respectively. We define $\dot m$ as the mass
accretion rate at the NS surface in unit of $\dot M_{\rm Edd}$. When $\dot m > 10^{-4}$, Compton cooling
can effectively cool the HAF and suppress wind. Therefore, the mass accretion rate is almost a constant
with radius. The density profile is $\rho \propto r^{-1.4}$. When $\dot m < 10^{-4}$, the Compton
cooling effects become weaker, wind becomes stronger, accretion rate is proportional to $r^{0.3-0.5}$.
Consequently, the density profile becomes flatter, $\rho \propto r^{-1 \sim -0.8}$. When $\dot
m < 10^{-6}$, the Compton cooling effects can be neglected. We find that with a same accretion rate,
the temperature of HAF around a NS is significantly lower than that of HAF around a black hole (BH).
Also, the Compton $y-$parameter of HAF around a NS is significantly smaller than that of HAF around
a BH. This result predicts that HAF around a NS will produce a softer spectrum compared to HAF around
a BH, which is consistent with observations.
