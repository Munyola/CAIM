We model the size distribution of supernova remnants to infer the surrounding ISM density. Using
simple, yet standard SNR evolution models, we find that the distribution of ambient densities is
remarkably narrow; either the standard assumptions about SNR evolution are wrong, or observable
SNRs are biased to a narrow range of ambient densities. We show that the size distributions are consistent
with log-normal, which severely limits the number of model parameters in any SNR population synthesis
model. Simple Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate that the size distribution is indistinguishable
from log-normal when the SNR sample size is less than 600. This implies that these SNR distributions
provide only information on the mean and variance, yielding additional information only when the
sample size grows larger than $\sim{600}$ SNRs. To infer the parameters of the ambient density,
we use Bayesian statistical inference under the assumption that SNR evolution is dominated by the
Sedov phase. In particular, we use the SNR sizes and explosion energies to estimate the mean and variance
of the ambient medium surrounding SNR progenitors. We find that the mean ISM particle density around
our sample of SNRs is $\mu_{\log{n}} = -1.33$, in $\log_{10}$ of particles per cubic centimeter,
with variance $\sigma^2_{\log{n}} = 0.49$. If interpreted at face value, this implies that most
SNRs result from supernovae propagating in the warm, ionized medium. However, it is also likely
that either SNR evolution is not dominated by the simple Sedov evolution or SNR samples are biased
to the warm, ionized medium (WIM).
