We investigate the formation of molecular clouds from atomic gas by using three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamical
simulations including chemical reactions and heating/cooling processes. We consider super-Alfv\'enic
head-on colliding flows of atomic gas possessing the two-phase structure. We examine how the molecular
cloud formation changes depending on the angle $\theta$ between the upstream flow and mean magnetic
field. If the atomic gas is compressed almost along the mean magnetic field, super-Alfv\'enic anisotropic
turbulence is maintained by accretion of the highly inhomogeneous upstream atomic gas, and the
post-shock layer rapidly expands. Even a small obliqueness of the magnetic field drastically changes
the physical properties of the post-shock layers. The shock compression amplifies the tangential
component of the magnetic field which weakens the post-shock turbulence, making the post-shock
layer denser. If the magnetic field is further inclined to the upstream flow, the shock-amplified
magnetic pressure suppresses gas compression, leading to an extended post-shock layer. Our results,
therefore, show that there is a critical angle $\theta_\mathrm{cr}$. Compression with $\theta<\theta_\mathrm{cr}$
generates largely-extended turbulence-dominated cold clouds. Around $\theta\sim \theta_\mathrm{cr}$,
dense cold clouds form. For $\theta\gg \theta_\mathrm{cr}$, the strong magnetic pressure suppresses
the formation of cold clouds. Efficient MC formation is expected if $\theta$ is less than a few times
$\theta_\mathrm{cr}$.
