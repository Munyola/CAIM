We first present new Subaru narrow-band observations of the Ly$\alpha$ halo around the quasi-stellar
object (QSO) CFHQ J232908-030158 at $z=6.42$, which give a higher luminosity with a larger extent
than previous studies. Then, combining these measurements with available data in the literature,
we find two different evolutions of QSOs' Ly$\alpha$ halos. First is a possible short-term evolution
with QSO age seen in four $z>6$ QSOs. We find that the luminosity and extent of Ly$\alpha$ halos anti-correlate
with QSOs' IR luminosity, with J2329-0301's halo being the brightest and largest. It indicates
that ionizing photons escape more easily out to circum-galactic regions when host galaxies are
less dusty. We also find a positive correlation between IR luminosity and black hole mass ($M_\text{BH}$).
Considering $M_\text{BH}$ as an indicator of QSO age, we propose a hypothesis that a large Ly$\alpha$
halo mainly comes into existence around QSOs in the young phase of their activity due to a small amount
of dust. The second is an evolution with cosmic time seen over $z\sim2-5$. We find that the surface
brightness increases toward lower-redshift with a similar growth rate to that of dark matter halos
which evolve to $M_\text{DH}=10^{12}-10^{13}$ M$_\odot$ at $z=2$. The extent of Ly$\alpha$ halos
is also found to increase at a rate scaling with the virial radius of growing dark matter halos, $r_\text{vir}
\propto M_\text{DH}^{1/3}$($1+z$)$^{-1}$. These increases are consistent with a scenario that
the CGM around QSOs evolves in mass and size keeping pace with hosting dark matter halos.
