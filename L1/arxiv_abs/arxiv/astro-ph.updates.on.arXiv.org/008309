The young energetic pulsar J1747-2958 ($\tau=26$ kyr, $\dot{E}=2.5\times 10^{36}$ erg s$^{-1}$)
powers the Mouse pulsar wind nebula (PWN), famous for its spectacular tail spanning 45$"$ in X-rays
and 12$'$ in radio ($d\sim5$ kpc). We present the results of Chandra observations of the PWN and the
analysis of archival lower-frequency data. The Chandra HRC image reveals a point-like source at
the pulsar position, $\approx$1$'$ behind the bow shock apex of the PWN. The flattened appearance
of the compact nebula is consistent with an equatorial outflow deformed by the ram pressure, implying
that the angle between the pulsar's spin axis and line of sight is $\sim70^\circ$ (in agreement with
the radio and $\gamma$-ray pulse profiles). The spatially-resolved spectroscopy with Chandra
ACIS shows that the power-law (PL) spectrum steepens from $\Gamma=1.65\pm0.02$ to $3.0\pm0.1$
over the 45$'$ extent of the X-ray tail. However, the tail's X-ray spectrum integrated over its 45$"$
length fits a single absorbed PL with $\Gamma=2.09\pm0.03$. We also found the Mouse PWN in 150 MHz
GMRT data, and a possible counterpart in 24 ${\rm \mu}$m Spitzer data. The multiwavelength data
suggest that, at low frequencies, the spectrum of the X-ray-emitting tail region can be described
by a broken PL with at least one turnover between radio and X-rays. This is consistent with synchrotron
cooling of electrons injected at the termination shock (with an SED slope of 2.2) in an equipartition
magnetic field $B\sim200$ ${\rm \mu G}$ and a bulk flow speed $v\sim4000$ km s$^{-1}$.
