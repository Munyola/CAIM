The Cepheid Period-Luminosity law is a key rung on the extragalactic distance ladder. However,
numerous Cepheids are known to undergo period variations. Monitoring, refining, and understanding
these period variations allows us to better determine the parameters of the Cepheids themselves
and of the instability strip in which they reside, and to test models of stellar evolution. VZ Cyg,
a classical Cepheid pulsating at $\sim$4.864 days, has been observed for over 100 years. Combining
data from literature observations, the Kilodegree Extremely Little Telescope (KELT) transit
survey, and new targeted observations with the Robotically Controlled Telescope (RCT) at Kitt
Peak, we find a period change rate of $dP/dt = -0.0642 \pm 0.0018$ sec yr$^{-1}$. However, when only
the recent observations are examined, we find a much higher period change rate of $dP/dt = - 0.0923
\pm 0.0110$ sec yr$^{-1}$. This higher rate could be due to an apparent long-term (P $\approx$ 26.5
yr) cyclic period variation. The possible interpretations of this single Cepheid's complex period
variations underscore both the need to regularly monitor pulsating variables, and the important
benefits that photometric surveys such as KELT can have on the field. Further monitoring of this
interesting example of Cepheid variability is recommended to confirm and better understand the
possible cyclic period variations. Further, Cepheid timing analyses are necessary to fully understand
their current behaviors and parameters, as well as their evolutionary histories.
