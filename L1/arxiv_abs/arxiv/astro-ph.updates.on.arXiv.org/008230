The potential habitability of an exoplanet is traditionally assessed by determining if its orbit
falls within the circumstellar `habitable zone' of its star, defined as the distance at which water
could be liquid on the surface of a planet (Kopparapu et al., 2013). Traditionally, these limits
are determined by radiative-convective climate models, which are used to predict surface temperatures
at user-specified levels of greenhouse gases. This approach ignores the vital question of the (bio)geochemical
plausibility of the proposed chemical abundances. Carbon dioxide is the most important greenhouse
gas in Earth's atmosphere in terms of regulating planetary temperature, with the long term concentration
controlled by the balance between volcanic outgassing and the sequestration of CO2 via chemical
weathering and sedimentation, as modulated by ocean chemistry, circulation and biological (microbial)
productivity. We develop a model incorporating key aspects of Earth's short and long-term biogeochemical
carbon cycle to explore the potential changes in the CO2 greenhouse due to variance in planet size
and stellar insolation. We find that proposed changes in global topography, tectonics, and the
hydrological cycle on larger planets results in proportionally greater surface temperatures
for a given incident flux. For planets between 0.5 to 2 R_earth the effect of these changes results
in average global surface temperature deviations of up to 20 K, which suggests that these relationships
must be considered in future studies of planetary habitability.
