NGC 253 hosts the nearest nuclear starburst. Previous observations show a region rich in molecular
gas, with dense clouds associated with recent star formation. We used ALMA to image the 350 GHz dust
continuum and molecular line emission from this region at 2 pc resolution. Our observations reveal
~14 bright, compact (~2-3 pc FWHM) knots of dust emission. Most of these sources are likely to be forming
super star clusters (SSCs) based on their inferred dynamical and gas masses, association with 36
GHz radio continuum emission, and coincidence with line emission tracing dense, excited gas. One
source coincides with a known SSC, but the rest remain invisible in Hubble near-infrared (IR) imaging.
Our observations imply that gas still constitutes a large fraction of the overall mass in these sources.
Their high brightness temperature at 350 GHz also implies a large optical depth near the peak of the
IR spectral energy distribution. As a result, these sources may have large IR photospheres and the
IR radiation force likely exceeds L/c. Still, their moderate observed velocity dispersions suggest
that feedback from radiation, winds, and supernovae are not yet disrupting most sources. This mode
of star formation appears to produce a large fraction of stars in the burst. We argue for a scenario
in which this phase lasts ~1 Myr, after which the clusters shed their natal cocoons but continue to
produce ionizing photons. The strong feedback that drives the observed cold gas and X-ray outflows
likely occurs after the clusters emerge from this early phase.
