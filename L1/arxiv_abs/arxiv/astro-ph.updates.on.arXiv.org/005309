We analyse Chandra X-ray Observatory observations of a set of galaxy clusters selected by the South
Pole Telescope using a new publicly-available forward-modelling projection code, MBProj2, assuming
hydrostatic equilibrium. By fitting a powerlaw plus constant entropy model we find no evidence
for a central entropy floor in the lowest-entropy systems. A model of the underlying central entropy
distribution shows a narrow peak close to zero entropy which accounts for 60 per cent of the systems,
and a second broader peak around 130 keV cm^2. We look for evolution over the 0.28 to 1.2 redshift range
of the sample in density, pressure, entropy and cooling time at 0.015 R_500 and at 10 kpc radius. By
modelling the evolution of the central quantities with a simple model, we find no evidence for a non-zero
slope with redshift. In addition, a non-parametric sliding median shows no significant change.
The fraction of cool-core clusters with central cooling times below 2 Gyr is consistent above and
below z=0.6 (~30-40 per cent). Both by comparing the median thermodynamic profiles, centrally
biased towards cool cores, in two redshift bins, and by modelling the evolution of the unbiased average
profile as a function of redshift, we find no significant evolution beyond self-similar scaling
in any of our examined quantities. Our average modelled radial density, entropy and cooling-time
profiles appear as powerlaws with breaks around 0.2 R_500. The dispersion in these quantities rises
inwards of this radius to around 0.4 dex, although some of this scatter can be fit by a bimodal model.
