The nature of 1I/'Oumuamua (henceforth, 1I), the first interstellar object known to pass through
the solar system, remains mysterious. Feng \& Jones noted that the incoming 1I velocity vector "at
infinity" ($\textbf{v}_{\infty}$) is close to the motion of the Pleiades dynamical stream (or
Local Association), and suggested that 1I is a young object ejected from a star in that stream. Micheli
$\textit{et al.}$ subsequently detected non-gravitational acceleration in the 1I trajectory;
this acceleration would not be unusual in an active comet, but 1I observations failed to reveal any
signs of activity. Bialy $\&$ Loeb hypothesized that the anomalous 1I acceleration was instead
due to radiation pressure, which would require an extremely low mass-to-area ratio (or area density).
Here I show that a low area density can also explain the very close kinematic association of 1I and
the Pleiades stream, as it renders 1I subject to drag capture by interstellar gas clouds. This supports
the radiation pressure hypothesis and suggests that there is a significant population of low area
density ISOs in the Galaxy, leading, through gas drag, to enhanced ISO concentrations in the galactic
dynamical streams. Any interstellar object entrained in a dynamical stream will have a predictable
incoming $\textbf{v}_{\infty}$; targeted deep surveys using this information should be able
to find dynamical stream objects months to as much as a year before their perihelion, providing the
lead time needed for fast-response missions for the future $\textit{in situ}$ exploration of such
objects.
