In this paper, we use $\textit{B}$-band, $\textit{I}$-band, and 3.6 $\mu$m azimuthal light profiles
of four low surface brightness (LSB) galaxies (UGC 628, F568-1, F568-3, F563-V2) to characterise
three bar parameters: length, strength, and corotation radius. We employ three techniques to measure
the radius of the bars, including a new method using the azimuthal light profiles. We find comparable
bar radii between the $\textit{I}$-band and 3.6 $\mu$m for all four galaxies when using our azimuthal
light profile method, and that our bar lengths are comparable to those in high surface brightness
galaxies (HSBs). In addition, we find the bar strengths for our galaxies to be smaller than those
for HSBs. Finally, we use Fourier transforms of the $\textit{B}$-band, $\textit{I}$-band, and
3.6 $\mu$m images to characterise the bars as either `fast' or `slow' by measuring the corotation
radius via phase profiles. When using the $\textit{B}$ and $\textit{I}$-band phase crossings,
we find three of our galaxies have faster than expected relative bar pattern speeds for galaxies
expected to be embedded in centrally-dense cold dark matter haloes. When using the $\textit{B}$-band
and 3.6 $\mu$m phase crossings, we find more ambiguous results, although the relative bar pattern
speeds are still faster than expected. Since we find a very slow bar in F563-V2, we are confident that
we are able to differentiate between fast and slow bars. Finally, we find no relation between bar
strength and relative bar pattern speed when comparing our LSBs to HSBs.
