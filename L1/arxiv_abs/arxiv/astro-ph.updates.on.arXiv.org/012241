PSR J1141$-$6545 is a precessing binary pulsar that has the rare potential to reveal the two-dimensional
structure of a non-recycled pulsar emission cone. It has undergone $\sim 25 \deg$ of relativistic
spin precession in the $\sim18$ years since its discovery. In this paper, we present a detailed Bayesian
analysis of the precessional evolution of the width of the total intensity profile, to understand
the changes to the line-of-sight impact angle ($\beta$) of the pulsar using four different physically
motivated prior distribution models. Although we cannot statistically differentiate between
the models with confidence, the temporal evolution of the linear and circular polarisations strongly
argue that our line-of-sight crossed the magnetic pole around MJD 54000 and that only two models
remain viable. For both these models, it appears likely that the pulsar will precess out of our line-of-sight
in the next $3-5$ years, assuming a simple beam geometry. Marginalising over $\beta$ suggests that
the pulsar is a near-orthogonal rotator and provides the first polarization-independent estimate
of the scale factor ($\mathbb{A}$) that relates the pulsar beam opening angle ($\rho$) to its rotational
period ($P$) as $\rho = \mathbb{A}P^{-0.5}$ : we find it to be $> 6 \rm~deg~s^{0.5}$ at 1.4 GHz with
99\% confidence. If all pulsars emit from opposite poles of a dipolar magnetic field with comparable
brightness, we might expect to see evidence of an interpulse arising in PSR J1141$-$6545, unless
the emission is patchy.
