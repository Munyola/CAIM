Microwave Kinetic Inductance Detectors (MKIDs) provide a compelling path forward to the large-format
polarimeter, imaging, and spectrometer arrays needed for next-generation experiments in millimeter-wave
cosmology and astronomy. We describe the development of feedhorn-coupled MKID detectors for the
TolTEC millimeter-wave imaging polarimeter being constructed for the 50-meter Large Millimeter
Telescope (LMT). Observations with TolTEC are planned to begin in early 2019. TolTEC will comprise
$\sim$7,000 polarization sensitive MKIDs and will represent the first MKID arrays fabricated
and deployed on monolithic 150 mm diameter silicon wafers -- a critical step towards future large-scale
experiments with over $10^5$ detectors. TolTEC will operate in observational bands at 1.1, 1.4,
and 2.0 mm and will use dichroic filters to define a physically independent focal plane for each passband,
thus allowing the polarimeters to use simple, direct-absorption inductive structures that are
impedance matched to incident radiation. This work is part of a larger program at NIST-Boulder to
develop MKID-based detector technologies for use over a wide range of photon energies spanning
millimeter-waves to X-rays. We present the detailed pixel layout and describe the methods, tools,
and flexible design parameters that allow this solution to be optimized for use anywhere in the millimeter
and sub-millimeter bands. We also present measurements of prototype devices operating in the 1.1
mm band and compare the observed optical performance to that predicted from models and simulations.
