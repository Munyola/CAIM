The stellar populations in the inner kiloparsecs of the Milky Way (MW) show complex kinematical
and chemical structures. The origin and evolution of these structures is still under debate. Here
we study the central region of a $fully$ $cosmological$ $hydrodynamical$ simulation of a disc galaxy
that reproduces key properties of the inner kiloparsecs of the Milky Way: it has a boxy morphology
and shows an overall rotation and dispersion profile in agreement with observations. We use a clustering
algorithm on stellar kinematics to identify a number of discrete kinematic components: a thin and
thick disc, a stellar halo and two bulge components; one fast rotating and one non-rotating. We focus
on the two bulge components and show that the slow rotating one is spherically symmetric while the
fast rotating component shows a boxy/peanut morphology. Although the two bulge components are
kinematically discrete populations, they are $both$ mostly formed over similar time scales, from
disc material. We find that stellar particles with lower initial birth angular momentum end up in
the non-rotating spherical bulge, while stars with higher birth angular momentum are found in the
peanut bulge. This has the important consequence that a bulge population with a spheroidal morphology
does not necessarily indicate a merger origin. In fact, we do find that only $\sim2.3$\% of the stars
in the bulge components are ex-situ stars brought in by accreted dwarf galaxies early on. We identify
these ex-situ stars as the oldest and most metal-poor stars in the bulge.
