We assume a scenario in which transition discs (i.e. discs around young stars that have signatures
of cool dust but lack significant near infra-red emission from warm dust) are associated with the
presence of planets (or brown dwarfs). These are assumed to filter the dust content of any gas flow
within the planetary orbit and produce an inner `opacity hole'. In order to match the properties
of transition discs with the largest (~50 A.U. scale) holes, we place such `planets' at large radii
in massive discs and then follow the evolution of the tidally coupled disc-planet system, comparing
the system's evolution in the plane of mm flux against hole radius with the properties of observed
transition discs. We find that, on account of the high disc masses in these systems, all but the most
massive `planets' (100 Jupiter masses) are conveyed to small radii by Type II migration without
significant fading at millimetre wavelengths. Such behaviour would contradict the observed lack
of mm bright transition discs with small (<10 A.U.) holes. On the other hand, imaging surveys
clearly rule out the presence of such massive companions in transition discs. We conclude that this
is a serious problem for models that seek to explain transition discs in terms of planetary companions
unless some mechanism can be found to halt inward migration and/or suppress mm flux production.
We suggest that the dynamical effects of substantial accretion on to the planet/through the gap
may offer the best prospect for halting such migration but that further long term simulations are
required to clarify this issue.
