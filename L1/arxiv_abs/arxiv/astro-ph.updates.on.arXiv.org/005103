Prior high angular resolution spectroscopic observations of the Low-ionization nuclear emission-line
region (Liner) in NGC 3998 obtained with the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) aboard
the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) revealed a rich UV-visible spectrum consisting of broad permitted
and broad forbidden emission lines. The photoionization code XSTAR is employed together with reddening-insensitive
emission line diagnostics to constrain a dynamical model for the broad-line region (BLR) in NGC
3998. The BLR is modelled as a large H$^+$ region ${\sim}$ 7 pc in radius consisting of dust-free,
low density ${\sim}$ 10$^4$ cm$^{-3}$, low metallicity ${\sim}$ 0.01 $Z/Z_\odot$ gas. Modelling
the shape of the broad H${\alpha}$ emission line significantly discriminates between two independent
measures of the black hole mass, favouring the estimate of de Francesco et al. (2006). Interpreting
the broad H${\alpha}$ emission line in terms of a steady-state spherically symmetric inflow leads
to a mass inflow rate of 1.4 ${\times}$ 10$^{-2}$ M$_\odot$/yr, well within the present uncertainty
of calculations that attempt to explain the observed X-ray emission in terms of an advection-dominated
accretion flow (ADAF). Collectively, the model provides an explanation for the shape of the H${\alpha}$
emission line, the relative intensities and luminosities for the H Balmer, [O III], and potentially
several of the broad UV emission lines, as well as refining the initial conditions needed for future
modelling of the ADAF.
