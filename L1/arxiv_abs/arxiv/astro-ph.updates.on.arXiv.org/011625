The bright transient AT2018cow has been unlike any other known type of transient. Its high brightness,
rapid rise and decay and initially nearly featureless spectrum are unprecedented and difficult
to explain using models for similar burst sources. We present evidence for faint gamma-ray emission
continuing for at least 8 days, and featureless spectra in the ultraviolet bands -- both unusual
for eruptive sources. The X-ray variability of the source has a burst-like character. The UV-optical
spectrum does not show any CNO line but is well described by a blackbody. We demonstrate that a model
invoking the tidal disruption of a 0.1 - 0.4 Msun Helium White Dwarf (WD) by a 100,000 to one million
solar mass Black Hole (BH) located in the outskirts of galaxy Z~137-068 could provide an explanation
for most of the characteristics shown in the multi-wavelength observations. A blackbody-like
emission is emitted from an opaque photosphere, formed by the debris of the WD disruption. Broad
features showing up in the optical/infrared spectra in the early stage are probably velocity broadened
lines produced in a transient high-velocity outward moving cocoon. The asymmetric optical/infrared
lines that appeared at a later stage are emission from an atmospheric layer when it detached from
thermal equilibrium with the photosphere, which undergoes more rapid cooling. The photosphere
shrinks when its temperature drops, and the subsequent infall of the atmosphere produced asymmetric
line profiles. Additionally, a non-thermal jet might be present, emitting X-rays in the 10-150
keV band.
