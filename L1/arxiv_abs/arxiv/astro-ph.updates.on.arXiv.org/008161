We present optical observations of supernova (SN) 2014ek discovered during the Tsinghua-NAOC
Transient Survey (TNTS), which shows properties that are consistent with those of SN 2002cx-like
events (dubbed as SNe Iax). The photometry indicates that it is underluminous compared to normal
SNe Ia, with the absolute $V$-band peak magnitude being as $-17.66\pm0.20$ mag. The spectra are
characterized by highly ionized Fe {\sc iii} and intermediate-mass elements (IMEs). The expansion
velocity of the ejecta is found to be $\sim$5000 km s$^{-1}$ near the maximum light, only half of that
measured for normal SNe Ia. The overall spectral evolution is quite similar to SN 2002cx and SN 2005hk,
while the absorption features of the main IMEs seem to be relatively weaker. The ${}^{56}$Ni mass
synthesized in the explosion is estimated to be about 0.08 M$_{\odot}$ from the pseudo bolometric
light curve. Based on a large sample of SNe Iax, we examined the relations between peak luminosity,
ejecta velocity, decline rate, and peak $V - R$ color but did not find noticeable correlations between
these observables, in particular when a few extreme events like SN 2008ha are excluded in the analysis.
For this sample, we also studied the birthplace environments and confirm that they still hold the
trend of occurring preferentially in late-type spiral galaxies. Moreover, SNe Iax tend to occur
in large star-forming regions of their host galaxies, more similar to SNe Ibc than SNe II, favoring
that their progenitors should be associated with very young stellar populations.
