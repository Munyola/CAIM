The source X 1822-371 is an eclipsing compact binary system with a period close to 5.57 hr and an orbital
period derivative $\dot{P}_{\rm orb}$ of 1.51(7)$\times 10^{-10}$ s s$^{-1}$. The very large
value of $\dot{P}_{\rm orb}$ is compatible with a super-Eddington mass transfer rate from the companion
star, as suggested by X-ray and optical data. The XMM-Newton observation taken in 2017 allows us
to update the orbital ephemeris and verify whether the orbital period derivative has been stable
over the last 40 yr. We added to the X-ray eclipse arrival times from 1977 to 2008 two new values obtained
from the RXTE and XMM-Newton observations performed in 2011 and 2017, respectively. We estimated
the number of orbital cycles and the delays of our eclipse arrival times spanning 40 yr using as reference
time the eclipse arrival time obtained from the Rossi-XTE observation taken in 1996. Fitting the
delays with a quadratic model, we found an orbital period $P_{\rm orb}=5.57062957(20)$ hr and a
$\dot{P}_{\rm orb}$ value of $1.475(54) \times 10^{-10}$ s s$^{-1}$. The addition of a cubic term
to the model does not significantly improve the quality of the fit. We also determined a spin-period
value of $P_{\rm spin}=0.5915669(4)$ s and its first derivative $\dot{P}_{\rm spin}= -2.595(11)
\times 10^{-12}$ s s$^{-1}$. The obtained results confirm the scenario of a super-Eddington mass
transfer rate; we also exclude a gravitational coupling between the orbit and the change in the oblateness
of the companion star triggered by the nuclear luminosity of the companion star.
