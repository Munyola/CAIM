The X9.3 flare of September 6, 2017, was the most powerful flare of Solar Cycle 24. It generated strong
white-light emission and multiple helioseismic waves (sunquakes). By using data from Helioseismic
and Magnetic Imager (HMI) onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) as well as hard X-ray data
from KONUS instrument onboard WIND spacecraft, and Anti-Coincidence System (ACS) onboard the
INTERGRAL space observatory, we investigate spatio-temporal dynamics of photospheric emission
sources, identify sources of helioseismic waves and compare the flare photospheric dynamics with
the hard X-ray (HXR) temporal profiles. The results show that the photospheric flare impacts started
to develop in compact regions in close vicinity of the magnetic polarity inversion line (PIL) in
the pre-impulsive phase before detection of the HXR emission. The initial photospheric disturbances
were localized in the region of strong horizontal magnetic field of the PIL, and, thus, are likely
associated with a compact sheared magnetic structure elongated along the PIL. The acoustic egression
power maps revealed two primary sources of generation of sunquakes, which were associated with
places of the strongest photospheric impacts in the pre-impulsive phase and the early impulsive
phase. This can explain the two types of helioseismic waves observed in this flare. Analysis of the
high-cadence HMI filtergrams suggests that the flare energy release developed in the form of sequential
involvement of compact low-lying magnetic loops that were sheared along the PIL.
