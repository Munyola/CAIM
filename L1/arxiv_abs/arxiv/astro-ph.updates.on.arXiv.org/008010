We present a comparison of mass estimates for $54$ galaxy cluster candidates from the second Planck
catalogue (PSZ2) of Sunyaev-Zel'dovich sources. We compare the mass values obtained with data
taken from the Arcminute Microkelvin Imager (AMI) radio interferometer system and from the Planck
satellite. The former of these uses a Bayesian analysis pipeline that parameterises a cluster in
terms of its physical quantities, and models the dark matter & baryonic components of a cluster using
NFW and GNFW profiles respectively. Our mass estimates derived from Planck data are obtained from
the results of the Bayesian detection algorithm PowellSnakes (PwS), are based on the methodology
detailed in the PSZ2 paper, and produce two sets of mass estimates; one estimate is calculated directly
from the angular radius $\theta$ - integrated Comptonisation parameter $Y$ posterior distributions,
and the other uses a `slicing function' to provide information on $\theta$ based on X-ray measurements
and previous Planck mission samples. We find that for $37$ of the clusters, the AMI mass estimates
are lower than both values obtained from Planck data. However the AMI and slicing function estimates
are within one combined standard deviation of each other for $31$ clusters. We also generate cluster
simulations based on the slicing-function mass estimates, and analyse them in the same way as we
did the real AMI data. We find that inclusion in the simulations of radio-source confusion & CMB noise
and measurable radio-sources causes AMI mass estimates to be systematically low.
