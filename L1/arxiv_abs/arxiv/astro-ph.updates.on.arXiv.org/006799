We study the spatially resolved star formation of 1494 galaxies in the SDSSIV-MaNGA Survey. SFRs
are calculated using a two-step process, using $H_\alpha$ in star forming regions and $D_n4000$
in regions identified as AGN/LI(N)ER or lineless. The roles of secular and environmental quenching
processes are investigated by studying the dependence of the radial profiles of specific star formation
rate on stellar mass, galaxy structure and environment. We report on the existence of `Centrally
Suppressed' galaxies, which have suppressed SSFR in their cores compared to their disks. The profiles
of centrally suppressed and unsuppressed galaxies are distibuted in a bimodal way. Galaxies with
high stellar mass and core velocity dispersion are found to be much more likely to be centrally suppressed
than low mass galaxies, and we show that this is related to morphology and the presence of AGN/LI(N)ER
like emission. Centrally suppressed galaxies also display lower star formation at all radii compared
to unsuppressed galaxies. The profiles of central and satellite galaxies are also compared, and
we find that satellite galaxies experience lower specific star formation rates at all radii than
central galaxies. This uniform suppression could be a signal of the stripping of hot halo gas in the
process known as strangulation. We find that satellites are not more likely to be suppressed in their
cores than centrals, indicating that the core suppression is an entirely internal process. We find
no correlation between the local environment density and the profiles of star formation rate surface
density.
