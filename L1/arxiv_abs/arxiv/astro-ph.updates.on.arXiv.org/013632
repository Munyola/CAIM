Centaurus A (Cen~A) is the nearest active radio galaxy, which has kiloparsec (kpc) scale jets and
{giant lobes detected by various instruments in radio and X-ray frequency ranges}. The $Fermi$--Large
Area Telescope and High Energy Stereoscopic System (HESS) confirmed, that Cen~A is a very high-energy
(VHE; $> 0.1$~TeV) $\gamma$-ray emitter with a known spectral {softening} in the energy range from
a few GeV to TeV. In this work, we consider a synchrotron self-Compton model in the nucleus for the
broad band spectrum {below the break energy} and an external Compton model in kpc-scale jets for
the $\gamma$-ray excess. Our results show that the observed $\gamma$-ray excess can be suitably
described by the inverse Compton scattering of the starlight photons in the kpc-scale jets, which
is consistent with the recent tentative report by the HESS on the spatial extension of the TeV emission
along the jets. Considering the spectral fitting results, the excess can only be seen in Cen~A, which
is probably due to two factors: (1) the host galaxy is approximately 50 times more luminous than other
typical radio galaxies and (2) the core $\gamma$-ray spectrum quickly decays above a few MeV due
to the low maximum electron Lorentz factor of $\gamma_{\rm c}=2.8 \times 10^3$ resulting from the
large magnetic field of 3.8~G in the core. By the comparison with other $\gamma$-ray detected radio
galaxies, we found that the magnetic field strength of relativistic jets scales with the distance
from the central black holes $d$ with $B (d) \propto d^{-0.88 \pm 0.14}$.
