We present new proper motion (PM) measurements of the dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) Draco and
Sculptor using multi-epoch images obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope ACS/WFC. Our PM results
have uncertainties far lower than previous measurements (even made with the same instrument) thanks
to the long time-baseline of 9-11 years. (abridged due to arXiv abstract limit) We study the detailed
orbital history of both Draco and Sculptor via numerical orbit integrations. Orbital periods of
Draco and Sculptor are found to be 1-2 and 2--5 Gyrs, respectively, accounting for uncertainties
in the MW mass. We also study the influence of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) on the orbits of Draco
and Sculptor. Overall, the inclusion of the LMC increases the scatter in the orbital results. Based
on our calculations for a plausible ranges of masses for the MW and the LMC, Draco and Sculptor have
likely been orbiting around the MW for the past 6 Gyr, but we can not completely rule out a scenario
where Draco and/or Sculptor are on their first infall towards the MW. Whereas Draco shows a rather
wide range of orbital parameters depending on the MW mass and inclusion/exclusion of the LMC, Sculptor's
orbit is very well constrained with its most recent pericentric approach to the MW being 0.3-0.4
Gyr ago. Our new PMs imply that the orbital trajectories of both Draco and Sculptor are confined within
the Disk of Satellites (DoS), better so than implied by earlier PM measurements, and likely rule
out the possibility that these two galaxies were accreted together as part of a tightly bound group.
