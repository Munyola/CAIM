A statistical study of the chromospheric ribbon evolution in H$\alpha$ two-ribbon flares is performed.
The data set consists of 50 confined ($62\,\%$) and eruptive ($38\,\%$) flares that occurred from
June 2000 to June 2015. The flares are selected homogeneously over the H$\alpha$ and $\textit{GOES}$
(Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite) classes, with an emphasis on including
powerful confined flares and weak eruptive flares. H$\alpha$ filtergrams from Kanzelh\"ohe Observatory
in combination with $\textit{MDI}$ (Michelson Doppler Imager) and $\textit{HMI}$ (Helioseismic
and Magnetic Imager) magnetograms are used to derive the ribbon separation, the ribbon-separation
velocity, the magnetic-field strength, and the reconnection electric field. We find that eruptive
flares reveal statistically larger ribbon separation and higher ribbon-separation velocities
than confined flares. In addition, the ribbon separation of eruptive flares correlates with the
GOES SXR flux, whereas no clear dependence was found for confined flares. The maximum ribbon-separation
velocity is not correlated with the GOES flux, but eruptive flares reveal on average a higher ribbon-separation
velocity (by $\approx 10~$km$~$s$^{-1}$). The local reconnection electric field of confined
($cc=0.50~\pm~0.02$) and eruptive ($cc=0.77~\pm~0.03$) flares correlates with the GOES flux,
indicating that more powerful flares involve stronger reconnection electric fields. In addition,
eruptive flares with higher electric-field strengths tend to be accompanied by faster coronal
mass ejections.
