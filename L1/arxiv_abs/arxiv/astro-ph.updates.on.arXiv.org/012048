We present new cosmological hydrodynamic simulations that incorporate Dark Matter Annihilation
Feedback (DMAF), whereby energy released from the annihilation of dark matter particles through
decay channels such as photon or positron-electron pairs provide additional heating sources for
local baryonic material. For annihilation rates comparable to WIMP-like particles, we find that
the key influence of DMAF is to inhibit gas accretion onto halos. Such diminished gas accretion early
in the lifetimes of halos results in reduced gas fractions in smaller halos, and the delayed halo
formation times of larger structures, suggesting that DMAF could impact the stellar age distribution
in galaxies, and morphology of dwarfs. For a dark matter particle mass of $m_\chi\sim10$~MeV, there
is a `critical halo mass' of $\sim10^{13}$ M$_{\odot}$ at $z=0$, below which there are large differences
when compared to $\Lambda$CDM, such as a reduction in the abundance of halo structures as large as
25 percent, reduced gas content by 50 percent and central gas densities reduced down to 10 percent
within halos of mass $\sim10^{12}$ M$_{\odot}$ but with increasing effects in smaller halos. Higher
dark matter particle mass models have a smaller `critical halo mass'. For a $m_\chi\sim100$~MeV
model, we find differences start appearing below halo masses of $\sim10^{12}$ M$_\odot$ and a $m_\chi\gtrsim
1$~GeV model, this mass scale lies below the resolution of our simulations, though we still observe
changes in the morphology of dwarf galaxies.
