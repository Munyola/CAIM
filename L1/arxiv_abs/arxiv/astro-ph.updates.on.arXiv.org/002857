Coalescing neutron-star-black-hole (NS-BH) binaries are a promising source of gravitational-wave
(GW) signals detectable with large-scale laser interferometers such as Advanced LIGO and Virgo.
They are also one of the main short gamma-ray burst (SGRB) progenitor candidates. If the BH tidally
disrupts its companion, an SGRB may be ignited when a sufficiently massive accretion disk forms
around the remnant BH. Detecting an NS-BH coalescence both in the GW and electromagnetic (EM) spectrum
offers a wealth of information about the nature of the source. How much can actually be inferred from
a joint detection is unclear, however, as a mass/spin degeneracy may reduce the GW measurement accuracy.
To shed light on this problem and on the potential of joint EM+GW observations, we here combine recent
semi-analytical predictions for the remnant disk mass with estimates of the parameter-space portion
that is selected by a GW detection. We identify cases in which an SGRB ignition is supported, others
in which it can be excluded, and finally others in which the outcome depends on the chosen model for
the currently unknown NS equation of state. We pinpoint a range of systems that would allow us to place
lower bounds on the equation of state stiffness if both the GW emission and its EM counterpart are
observed. The methods we develop can broaden the scope of existing GW detection and parameter-estimation
algorithms and could allow us to disregard about half of the templates in an NS-BH search following
an SGRB trigger, increasing its speed and sensitivity.
