During the lifetime of sun-like or low mass stars a significant amount of angular momentum is removed
through magnetised stellar winds. This process is often assumed to be governed by the dipolar component
of the magnetic field. However, observed magnetic fields can host strong quadrupolar and/or octupolar
components, which may influence the resulting spin-down torque on the star. In Paper I, we used the
MHD code PLUTO to compute steady state solutions for stellar winds containing a mixture of dipole
and quadrupole geometries. We showed the combined winds to be more complex than a simple sum of winds
with these individual components. This work follows the same method as Paper I, including the octupole
geometry which increases the field complexity but also, more fundamentally, looks for the first
time at combining the same symmetry family of fields, with the field polarity of the dipole and octupole
geometries reversing over the equator (unlike the symmetric quadrupole). We show, as in Paper I,
that the lowest order component typically dominates the spin down torque. Specifically, the dipole
component is the most significant in governing the spin down torque for mixed geometries and under
most conditions for real stars. We present a general torque formulation that includes the effects
of complex, mixed fields, which predicts the torque for all the simulations to within 20% precision,
and the majority to within ~5%. This can be used as an input for rotational evolution calculations
in cases where the individual magnetic components are known.
