We use high resolution 3D hydrodynamical simulations to quantify the amount of mass accreted onto
the secondary star of the binary system Eta Carinae, exploring two sets of stellar masses which had
been proposed for the system, the conventional mass model ($M_1=120 M_{\odot}$ and $M_2=30 M_{\odot}$)
and the high mass model ($M_1=170 M_{\odot}$ and $M_2=80 M_{\odot}$). The system consists of two
very massive stars in a highly eccentric orbit. Every cycle close to periastron passage the system
experiences a spectroscopic event during which many lines change their appearance, accompanied
by a decline in x-ray emission associated with the destruction wind collision structure and accretion
of the primary wind onto the secondary. We take four different numerical approaches to simulate
the response of the secondary wind to accretion, each affects the mass loss rate of the secondary
differently, and in turn determines the amount of accreted mass. The high mass model gives for most
approaches much more accreted gas and longer accretion phase. We find that the effective temperature
of the secondary can be significantly reduced due to accretion. We also test different eccentricity
values and a higher primary mass loss rate and find their effect on the duration of the spectroscopic
event. We conclude that the high mass model is better compatible with the amount of accreted mass,
$\approx 3 \times 10^{-6} M_{\odot}$, required for explaining the reduction in secondary ionization
photons during the spectroscopic event and compatible with its observed duration.
