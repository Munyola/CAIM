We used optical imaging and spectroscopic data to derive substructure estimates for local Universe
($z < 0.11$) galaxy clusters from two different samples. The first was selected through the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich
(SZ) effect by the Planck satellite and the second is an X-ray selected sample. In agreement to X-ray
substructure estimates we found that the SZ systems have a larger fraction of substructure than
the X-ray clusters. We have also found evidence that the higher mass regime of the SZ clusters, compared
to the X-ray sample, explains the larger fraction of disturbed objects in the Planck data. Although
we detect a redshift evolution in the substructure fraction, it is not sufficient to explain the
different results between the higher-z SZ sample and the X-ray one. We have also verified a good agreement
($\sim$60$\%$) between the optical and X-ray substructure estimates. However, the best level
of agreement is given by the substructure classification given by measures based on the brightest
cluster galaxy (BCG), either the BCG$-$X-ray centroid offset, or the magnitude gap between the
first and second BCGs. We advocate the use of those two parameters as the most reliable and cheap way
to assess cluster dynamical state. We recommend an offset cut of $\sim$0.01$\times$R$_{500}$
to separate relaxed and disturbed clusters. Regarding the magnitude gap the separation can be done
at $\Delta m_{12} = 1.0$. The central galaxy paradigm (CGP) may not be valid for $\sim$20$\%$ of relaxed
massive clusters. This fraction increases to $\sim$60$\%$ for disturbed systems.
