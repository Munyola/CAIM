We present the results of a photometric and spectroscopic monitoring campaign of SN 2012ec, which
exploded in the spiral galaxy NGC 1084, during the photospheric phase. The photometric light curve
exhibits a plateau with luminosity L= 0.9 times 10 to 42 (erg s to -1) and duration ~90 days; which is
shorter than standard Type IIP supernovae. We estimate the nickel mass M(56Ni)= 0.040 pm 0.015 Msun
from the luminosity at the beginning of the radioactive tail of the light curve. The explosion parameters
of SN 2012ec were estimated from the comparison of the bolometric light curve and temperature and
velocity evolution of the ejecta with predications from a hydrodynamical model. We derived an envelope
mass of 12.6 Msun, an initial progenitor radius of 1.6 times 10 to 13 (cm) and explosion energy of 1.2
foe. These estimates agree with an independent study of the progenitor star identified in pre-explosion
images, for which an initial mass of M=14-22 Msun was determined. We have applied the same analysis
to two other type IIP supernovae (SNe 2012aw and 2012A), and carried out a comparison with the properties
of SN 2012ec derived in this paper. We find a reasonable agreement between the masses of progenitor
obtained from pre-explosion images and the masses derived from hydrodynamical models. We estimate
distances to SN 2012ec with Standardized Candle Method (SCM) and compare with other estimates based
on other primary and secondary indicators. SNe 2012A, 2012aw and 2012ec all follow the standard
relations for SCM for the use of Type IIP SNe as distance indicators.
