We present extensive data sets for a class of intermediate-luminosity optical transients known
as ``luminous red novae'' (LRNe). These transients show double-peaked light curves, with a first
rapid luminosity rise to a blue peak (at -13 to -15 mag), which is followed by a longer-duration red
peak, that sometimes is attenuated resembling a plateau. The progenitors of three of them (NGC4490-2011OT1,
M101-2015OT1 and SNhunt248), likely intermediate-mass yellow supergiants, were also observed
in a pre-eruptive stage, when their luminosity was slowly increasing. Early spectra, obtained
during the first peak, show a blue continuum with superposed prominent narrow Balmer lines, with
P~Cygni profiles. Lines of Fe II are also clearly detected, mostly in emission. During the second
peak, the spectral continuum becomes much redder, Halpha is barely detected, and a forest of narrow
metal lines is observed in absorption. Very late-time spectra (~6 months after blue peak) show an
extremely red spectral continuum, peaking in the infrared domain. Halpha is detected in pure emission
at such late phases, along with broad absorption bands due to molecular overtones (TiO, VO). We discuss
a few alternative scenarios for LRNe. Although major instabilities of single massive stars cannot
be definitely ruled out, we favour a binary system scenario, with a common envelope ejection possibly
ending with a final merging event. The similarity between LRNe and the outburst observed a few months
before the explosion of the Type IIn SN 2011ht is also discussed.
