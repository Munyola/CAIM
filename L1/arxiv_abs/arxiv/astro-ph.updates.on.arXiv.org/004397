We conducted a detailed radiative transfer modeling of the dust emission from the circumstellar
disk around HL Tau. The goal of our study is to derive the surface density profile of the inner disk
and its structure. In addition to the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array images at Band
3 (2.9mm), Band 6 (1.3mm), and Band 7 (0.87mm), the most recent Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA)
observations at 7mm were included in the analysis. A simulated annealing algorithm was invoked
to search for the optimum model. The radiative transfer analysis demonstrates that most radial
components (i.e., >6AU) of the disk become optically thin at a wavelength of 7mm, which allows us
to constrain, for the first time, the dust density distribution in the inner region of the disk. We
found that a homogeneous grain size distribution is not sufficient to explain the observed images
at different wavelengths simultaneously, while models with a shallower grain size distribution
in the inner disk work well. We found clear evidence that larger grains are trapped in the first bright
ring. Our results imply that dust evolution has already taken place in the disk at a relatively young
(i.e., ~1Myr) age. We compared the midplane temperature distribution, optical depth, and properties
of various dust rings with those reported previously. Using the Toomre parameter, we briefly discussed
the gravitational instability as a potential mechanism for the origin of the dust clump detected
in the first bright ring via the VLA observations.
