We employ differential astrometric methods to establish a small field reference frame stable at
the micro-arcsecond ($\mu$as) level on short timescales using high-cadence simulated observations
taken by Gaia in February 2017 of a bright star close to the limb of Jupiter, as part of the relativistic
experiment on Jupiter's quadrupole. We achieve sub$\mu$as-level precision along scan through
a suitable transformation of the field angles into a small-field tangent plane and a least-squares
fit over several overlapping frames for estimating the plate and geometric calibration parameters
with tens of reference stars that lie within $\sim$0.5 degs from the target star, assuming perfect
knowledge of stellar proper motions and parallaxes. Furthermore, we study the effects of unmodeled
astrometric parameters on the residuals and find that proper motions have a stronger effect than
unmodeled parallaxes. For e.g., unmodeled Gaia DR2 proper motions introduce extra residuals of
$\sim$23$\mu$as (AL) and 69$\mu$as (AC) versus the $\sim$5$\mu$as (AL) and 17$\mu$as (AC) due
to unmodeled parallaxes. On the other hand, assuming catalog errors in the proper motions such as
those from Gaia DR2 has a minimal impact on the stability introducing sub$\mu$as and $\mu$as level
residuals in the along and across scanning direction, respectively. Finally, the effect of a coarse
knowledge in the satellite velocity components (with time dependent errors of 10$\mu$as) is capable
of enlarging the size of the residuals to roughly 0.2 mas.
