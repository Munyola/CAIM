The distribution of stars around a massive black hole (MBH) has been addressed in stellar dynamics
for the last four decades by a number of authors. Due to its proximity, the centre of the Milky Way is
the only observational test case where the stellar distribution can be accurately tested. Past
observational work indicated that the brightest giants in the Galactic Centre (GC) may show a density
deficit around the central black hole, not a cusp-like distribution, while we theoretically expect
the presence of a stellar cusp. In this work we present a solution to this long-standing problem.
We perform direct-summation $N-$body simulations of star clusters around massive black holes
and compare the results of our simulations with new observational data of the GC's nuclear cluster.
We find that after a Hubble time, the distribution of bright stars as well as the diffuse light follow
power-law distributions in projection with slopes of $\Gamma \approx 0.3$ in our simulations.
This is in excellent agreement with what is seen in star counts and in the distribution of the diffuse
stellar light extracted from adaptive optics (AO) assisted near infrared observations of the GC.
Our simulations also confirm that there exists a missing giant star population within a projected
radius of a few arcsec around Sgr A*. Such a depletion of giant stars in the innermost 0.1 pc could be
explained by a previously present gaseous disc and collisions, which means that a stellar cusp would
also be present at the innermost radii, but in the form of degenerate compact cores.
