Observations show that winds can be driven from the innermost region (inside a 50 Schwarschild radius)
of a thin disk. It is interesting to study the winds launched from the innermost region. A hot corona
above the black hole (BH) thin disk is irradiated by the disk. We perform two-dimensional hydrodynamical
simulations to study the winds driven by radiation force from the corona in the innermost regions.
The hard X-ray spectrum from active galactic nuclei (AGNs) suggests that the corona temperature
is about $10^9$ K, so that we mainly analyze the properties of winds (or outflows) from the $10^9$
K corona. The disk luminosity plays an important role in driving the outflows. The more luminous
the disk, the stronger the outflows. Mass outflow rate ($\dot{M}_{\rm out}$) at a 90 Schwarschild
radius depends on disk luminosity, which can be described as $\dot{M}_{\rm out}\propto 10^{3.3
\Gamma}$ ($\Gamma$ is the ratio of the disk luminosity to the Eddington luminosity). In the case
of high luminosity (e.g. $\Gamma=0.75$), the supersonic outflows with maximum speed $1.0 \times
10^4$ Km s$^{-1}$ are launched at $\sim17^{o}$ --$30^{o}$ and $\sim50^{o}$ --$80^{o}$ away from
the pole axis. The Bernoulli parameter keeps increasing with the outward propagation of outflows.
The radiation force keeps accelerating the outflows when outflows move outward. Therefore, we
can expect the outflows to escape from the BH gravity and go to the galactic scale. The interaction
between outflows and interstellar medium may be an important AGN feedback process.
