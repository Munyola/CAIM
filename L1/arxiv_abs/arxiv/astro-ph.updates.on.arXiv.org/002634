We establish the three-dimensional architecture of the KOI-1474 system to be eccentric yet with
a low mutual inclination. KOI-1474b is a warm Jupiter at semi-major axis a = 0.370 +0.007/-0.006
AU with a large eccentricity (e=0.85 +0.08/-0.07) measured via the "photoeccentric effect." It
exhibits transit timing variations induced by the non-transiting KOI-1474c, which we uniquely
constrain to be a moderately eccentric (e=0.184 +/- 0.002), hierarchically-separated (a=1.68
+/- 0.03 AU) giant planet (7.3 +/- 0.4 MJup). We combine sixteen quarters of Kepler photometry, radial-velocity
(RV) measurements from the HIgh Resolution Echelle Spectrometer (HIRES) on Keck, and improved
stellar parameters that we derive from spectroscopy and asteroseismology. From the RVs, we measure
the mass of inner planet to be 2.6 +/- 0.3 MJup and confirm its photometrically-measured eccentricity,
refining the value to e=0.83 +/- 0.01. The RV acceleration is consistent with the properties of the
outer planet derived from TTVs. We find that, despite their sizable eccentricities, the planets
are coplanar to within 10 +8/-6 degrees, and therefore the inner planet's large eccentricity and
close-in orbit are unlikely to be the result of Kozai migration. Moreover, even over many secular
cycles, the inner planet's periapse is most likely never small enough for tidal circularization.
Finally, we present and measure a transit time and impact parameter from four simultaneous ground-based
light curves from 1m-class telescopes, demonstrating the feasibility of ground-based follow-up
of Kepler giant planets exhibiting large TTVs.
