We present a novel pilot search for gravitational lenses in the mJIVE-20 survey, which observed
$24\,903$ radio sources selected from FIRST with the VLBA at an angular resolution of 5 mas. We have
taken the visibility data for an initial $3\,640$ sources that were detected by the mJIVE-20 observations
and re-mapped them to make wide-field images, selecting fourteen sources that had multiple components
separated by $\geq100$ mas, with a flux-ratio of $\leq15$:$1$ and a surface brightness consistent
with gravitational lensing. Two of these candidates are re-discoveries of gravitational lenses
found as part of CLASS. The remaining twelve candidates were then re-observed at 1.4 GHz and then
simultaneously at 4.1 and 7.1 GHz with the VLBA to measure the spectral index and surface brightness
of the individual components as a function of frequency. Ten were rejected as core-jet or core-hotspot(s)
systems, with surface brightness distributions and/or spectral indices inconsistent with gravitational
lensing, and one was rejected after lens modelling demonstrated that the candidate lensed images
failed the parity test. The final lens candidate has an image configuration that is consistent with
a simple lens mass model, although further observations are required to confirm the lensing nature.
Given the two confirmed gravitational lenses in the mJIVE-20 sample, we find a robust lensing-rate
of $1$:($318\pm225$) for a statistical sample of 635 radio sources detected on mas-scales, which
is consistent with that found for CLASS.
