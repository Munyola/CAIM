We performed a photometric and spectroscopic analysis of two RV Tauri stars GK Car and GZ Nor. Both
objects are surrounded by hot circumstellar dust. Their pulsation periods, derived from ASAS photometric
time series, have been used to derive their luminosities and distances via the PLC relation. In addition,
for both objects, GAIA distances are available. The Gaia distances and luminosities are consistent
with the values obtained from the PLC relationship. GK Car is at distance of 4.5$\pm{1.3}$ kpc and
has a luminosity of 1520$\pm{840}$ L$_{\odot}$, while GZ Nor is at distance of 8.4$\pm{2.3}$ kpc
and has a luminosity of 1240 $\pm{690}$ L$_{\odot}$. Our abundance analysis reveals that both stars
show depletion of refractory elements with [Fe/H]=$-$1.3 and [Zn/Ti]=$+$1.2 for GK Car and [Fe/H]=$-$2.0
and [Zn/Ti]=$+$0.8 for GZ Nor. In the WISE colour-colour diagram, GK Car is located in the RV Tauri
box as originally defined by \cite{evans85} and updated by \cite{gezer15}, while GZ Nor is not.
Despite this, we argue that both objects are surrounded by a gravitationally bound disc. As depletion
is observed in binaries, we postulate that both stars are binaries as well. RV Tauri stars are generally
acknowledged to be post$-$AGB stars. Recent studies show that they might be either indeed post$-$AGB
or post$-$RGB objects depending on their luminosity. For both objects, the derived luminosities
are relatively low for post-AGB objects, however, the uncertainties are quite large. We conclude
that they could be either post-RGB or post-AGB objects.
