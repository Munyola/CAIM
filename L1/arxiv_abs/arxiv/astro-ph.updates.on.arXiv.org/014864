We present results from the first radiation non-ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) simulations
of low-mass star cluster formation that resolve the fragmentation process down to the opacity limit.
We model 50~M$_\odot$ turbulent clouds initially threaded by a uniform magnetic field with strengths
of 3, 5 10 and 20 times the critical mass-to-magnetic flux ratio, and at each strength, we model both
an ideal and non-ideal (including Ohmic resistivity, ambipolar diffusion and the Hall effect)
MHD cloud. Turbulence and magnetic fields shape the large-scale structure of the cloud, and similar
structures form regardless of whether ideal or non-ideal MHD is employed. At high densities ($10^6
\lesssim n_{\rm H} \lesssim 10^{11}$~cm$^{-3}$), all models have a similar magnetic field strength
versus density relation, suggesting that the field strength in dense cores is independent of the
large-scale environment. Albeit with limited statistics, we find no evidence for the dependence
of the initial mass function on the initial magnetic field strength, however, the star formation
rate decreases for models with increasing initial field strengths; the exception is the strongest
field case where collapse occurs primarily along field lines. Protostellar discs with radii $\gtrsim
20$~au form in all models, suggesting that disc formation is dependent on the gas turbulence rather
than on magnetic field strength. We find no evidence for the magnetic braking catastrophe, and find
that magnetic fields do not hinder the formation of protostellar discs.
