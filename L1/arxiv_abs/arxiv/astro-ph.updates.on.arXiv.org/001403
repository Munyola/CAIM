We describe models of single-field inflation with small and sharp step features in the potential
(and sound speed) of the inflaton field, in the context of the Effective Field Theory of Inflation.
This approach allows us to study the effects of features in the power-spectrum and in the bispectrum
of curvature perturbations, from a model-independent point of view, by parametrizing the features
directly with modified "slow-roll" parameters. We can obtain a self-consistent power-spectrum,
together with enhanced non-Gaussianity, which grows with a quantity $\beta$ that parametrizes
the sharpness of the step. With this treatment it is straightforward to generalize and include features
in other coefficients of the effective action of the inflaton field fluctuations. Our conclusion
in this case is that, excluding extrinsic curvature terms, the only interesting effects at the level
of the bispectrum could arise from features in the first slow-roll parameter $\epsilon$ or in the
speed of sound $c_s$. Finally, we derive an upper bound on the parameter $\beta$ from the consistency
of the perturbative expansion of the action for inflaton perturbations. This constraint can be
used for an estimation of the signal-to-noise ratio, to show that the observable which is most sensitive
to features is the power-spectrum. This conclusion would change if we consider the contemporary
presence of a feature and a speed of sound $c_s < 1$, as, in such a case, contributions from an oscillating
folded configuration can potentially make the bispectrum the leading observable for feature models.
