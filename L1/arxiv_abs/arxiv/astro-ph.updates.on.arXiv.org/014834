The current goals of the astrobiology community are focused on developing a framework for the detection
of biosignatures, or evidence thereof, on objects inside and outside of our solar system. A fundamental
aspect of understanding the limits of habitable environments (surface liquid water) and detectable
signatures thereof is the study of where the boundaries of such environments can occur. Such studies
provide the basis for understanding how a once inhabitable planet might come to be uninhabitable.
The archetype of such a planet is arguably Earth's sibling planet, Venus. Given the need to define
the conditions that can rule out biorelated signatures of exoplanets, Venus provides a unique opportunity
to explore the processes that led to a completely uninhabitable environment by our current definition
of the term. Here we review the current state of knowledge regarding Venus, particularly in the context
of remote sensing techniques that are being or will be employed in the search for and characterization
of exoplanets. We discuss candidate Venus analogs identified by the Kepler and TESS exoplanet missions
and provide an update to exoplanet demographics that can be placed in the potential runaway greenhouse
regime where Venus analogs are thought to reside. We list several major outstanding questions regarding
the Venus environment and the relevance of those questions to understanding the atmospheres and
interior structure of exoplanets. Finally, we outline the path towards a deeper analysis of our
sibling planet and the synergy to exoplanetary science.
