The variation in atmospheric pressure is due to changes in mass of the air column above, which in turn
resembles the density variation of atmosphere and will affect the decay of secondary particles
of cosmic rays. The ground based cosmic ray detectors observe pressure dependent variation in their
flux. The High Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) gamma ray observatory is a great detector of secondary
particles because of its high altitude, high uptime, and large area (including total photo-cathode
area), which makes the HAWC scaler system an ideal instrument for solar modulation studies. Although,
in order to perform these studies it is necessary to isolate and remove the atmospheric modulations.
The observed rate in each PMT has signatures of both the solar and atmospheric modulations, which
makes it difficult to measure the pressure coefficient ($\beta_P$ ). The pressure at the HAWC site
shows a periodic behavior ($\sim$ 12 hours), which also reflects in the scalar rates. This periodic
property was used to isolate the pressure modulation and $\beta_P$ were estimated with accuracy.
Since the pressure dependence is a physical phenomenon, the estimated coefficients for PMTs should
be identical, any deviation from this can be due to malfunction of the PMT. This make this method a
useful tool to identify the malfunctioning PMTs and help us to isolate them from the analysis. In
this analysis we are presenting the method of estimation of the pressure coefficients and its usage
to correct the HAWC scalar data to make it suitable for the solar modulations studies.
