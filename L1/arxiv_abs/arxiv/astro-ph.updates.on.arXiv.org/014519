The connections among galaxies, the dark matter halos where they form and the properties of the large-scale
Cosmic Web still need to be completely disentangled. We use the cosmological hydrodynamical simulation
TNG100 of the IllustrisTNG suite to quantify the effects played by the large-scale density field
and the Cosmic Web morphology on the relation between halo mass and galaxy stellar mass. We select
objects with total dynamical mass in the range $\geq 6.3\times 10^{10} h ^{-1}\, M_{\odot}$ up to
a few $10^{14} h^{-1} \, M_{\odot}$ between redshift $z=4$ and redshift $z=0$. A Cosmic Web class
(knot, filament, sheet, void) is assigned to each region of the volume using a density field deformation
tensor-based method. We find that galaxy stellar mass strongly correlates with total dynamical
mass and formation time, and more weakly with large-scale overdensity and Cosmic Web class. The
latter two quantities correlate with each other, but are not entirely degenerate. Furthermore,
we find that at fixed halo mass, galaxies with stellar mass lower than the median value are more likely
to be found in voids and sheets, whereas galaxies with stellar mass higher than the median are more
likely to be found in filaments and knots. The effect is stronger at redshift $z\leq 1$, but it decreases
at higher redshift. We predict that this effect should already be measurable from available galaxy
surveys. Finally, we find that the dependence on environment is stronger for satellites than for
centrals, and discuss the physical implications of these results.
