We analyze the IllustrisTNG simulations to study the mass, volume fraction and phase distribution
of gaseous baryons embedded in the knots, filaments, sheets and voids of the Cosmic Web from redshift
$z=8$ to redshift $z=0$. We find that filaments host more star-forming gas than knots, and that filaments
also have a higher relative mass fraction of gas in this phase than knots. We also show that the cool,
diffuse Intergalactic Medium (IGM; $T<10^5 \, {\rm K}$, $ n_{\rm H}<10^{-4}(1+z) \, {\rm cm^{-3}}$)
and the Warm-Hot Intergalactic Medium (WHIM; $ 10^5 \, {\rm K} <T<10^7 \, {\rm K}$, $ n_{\rm H} <10^{-4}(1+z)\,
{\rm cm^{-3}}$) constitute $\sim 39\%$ and $\sim 46\%$ of the baryons at redshift $z=0$, respectively.
Our results indicate that the WHIM may constitute the largest reservoir of {\it missing} baryons
at redshift $z=0$. Using our Cosmic Web classification, we predict the WHIM to be the dominant baryon
mass contribution in filaments and knots at redshift $z=0$, but not in sheets and voids where the
cool, diffuse IGM dominates. We also characterise the evolution of WHIM and IGM from redshift $z=4$
to redshift $z=0$, and find that the mass fraction of WHIM in filaments and knots evolves only by a
factor $\sim 2$ from redshift $z=0$ to $z=1$, but declines faster at higher redshift. The WHIM only
occupies $4-11\%$ of the volume at redshift $0\leq z \leq 1$. We predict the existence of a significant
number of currently undetected OVII and NeIX absorption systems in cosmic filaments which could
be detected by future X-ray telescopes like Athena.
