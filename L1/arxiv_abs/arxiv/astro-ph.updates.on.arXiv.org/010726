The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) is a European Space Agency mission that aims to measure
gravitational waves in the millihertz range. Laser frequency noise is the dominant source of noise
that enters the measurement signals. It is greater than the expected gravitational signal level
by many orders of magnitude. Time-delay interferometry (TDI) is a pre-processing technique that
reduces this laser frequency noise by synthesizing virtual equal-arm interferometric measurements.
Laboratory experiments and numerical simulations, in proof-of-concept setups, have shown that
this reduction is sufficient to meet the scientific goals of the mission. In this paper, we propose
a theoretical model of the instrument, which includes laser frequency noise, the inter-spacecraft
arm length time evolution, as well as the effect of the on-board anti-aliasing filters used to down-sample
the data. We also use two independent simulators to produce realistic measurement signals and compute
the corresponding TDI Michelson variables. We show that our theoretical model agrees with the simulated
data with exquisite precision. Using these two complementary approaches we confirm TDI's ability
to greatly reduce laser frequency noise in a more realistic mission setup. The theoretical model
also provides insight into the role played by the instrumental configuration and by the anti-aliasing
filters. We find that the filters play an important role for the TDI 2.0 Michelson variables; this
was neglected in previous studies.
