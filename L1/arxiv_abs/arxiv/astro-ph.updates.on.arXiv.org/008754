We use deep Hubble Space Telescope imaging in the outskirts of the nearby spiral M101 to study stellar
populations in the galaxy's outer disk and halo. Our ACS field lies 17.6 arcmin (36 kpc) from the center
of M101 and targets the blue "NE Plume" of M101's outer disk, while the parallel WFC3 field lies at
a distance of 23.3 arcmin (47 kpc) to sample the galaxy's stellar halo. The WFC3 halo field shows a
well-defined red giant branch characterized by low metallicity ([M/H]=-1.7 $\pm$ 0.2), with no
evidence of young stellar populations. In contrast, the ACS disk field shows multiple stellar populations,
including a young main sequence, blue and red helium burning stars, and old RGB and AGB populations.
The mean metallicity of these disk stars is quite low: [M/H]=-1.3 $\pm$ 0.2 for the RGB population,
and -1.15 $\pm$ 0.2 for the younger helium burning sequences. Of particular interest is a bunching
of stars along the BHeB sequence, indicative of an evolving cohort of massive young stars. We show
that the young stellar populations in this field are well-described by a decaying burst of star formation
that peaked ~ 300-400 Myr ago, along with a more extended star formation history to produce the older
RGB and AGB populations. These results confirm and extend the results from our previous deep surface
photometry of M101's outer disk, providing an important cross-check on stellar population studies
using resolved stellar populations versus integrated light photometry. We discuss our results
in the context of halo formation models and the interaction history of M101 and its companions.
