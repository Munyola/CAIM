We introduce the first synthetic light-curve model set of Type IIP supernovae exploded within circumstellar
media in which the acceleration of the red supergiant winds is taken into account. Because wind acceleration
makes the wind velocities near the progenitors low, the density of the immediate vicinity of the
red supergiant supernova progenitors can be higher than that extrapolated by using a constant terminal
wind velocity. Therefore, even if the mass-loss rate of the progenitor is relatively low, it can
have a dense circumstellar medium at the immediate stellar vicinity and the early light curves of
Type IIP supernovae are significantly affected by it. We adopt a simple beta velocity law to formulate
the wind acceleration. We provide bolometric and multicolor light curves of Type IIP supernovae
exploding within such accelerated winds from the combinations of three progenitors, 12 - 16 Msun;
five beta, 1-5; seven mass-loss rates, 1e-5 - 1e-2 Msun/yr; and four explosion energies, 0.5e51
- 2e51 erg. All the light curve models are available at https://goo.gl/o5phYb. When the circumstellar
density is sufficiently high, our models do not show a classical shock breakout as a consequence
of the interaction with the dense and optically-thick circumstellar media. Instead, they show
a delayed 'wind breakout', substantially affecting early light curves of Type IIP supernovae.
We find that the mass-loss rates of the progenitors need to be 1e-3 - 1e-2 Msun/yr to explain typical
rise times of 5 - 10 days in Type IIP supernovae assuming a dense circumstellar radius of 1e15 cm.
