We present the public release of MrMoose, a fitting procedure that is able to perform multi-wavelength
and multi-object spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting in a Bayesian framework. This procedure
is able to handle a large variety of cases, from an isolated source to blended multi-component sources
from an heterogeneous dataset (i.e. a range of observation sensitivities and spectral/spatial
resolutions). Furthermore, MrMoose handles upper-limits during the fitting process in a continuous
way allowing models to be gradually less probable as upper limits are approached. The aim is to propose
a simple-to-use, yet highly-versatile fitting tool fro handling increasing source complexity
when combining multi-wavelength datasets with fully customisable filter/model databases. The
complete control of the user is one advantage, which avoids the traditional problems related to
the "black box" effect, where parameter or model tunings are impossible and can lead to overfitting
and/or over-interpretation of the results. Also, while a basic knowledge of Python and statistics
is required, the code aims to be sufficiently user-friendly for non-experts. We demonstrate the
procedure on three cases: two artificially-generated datasets and a previous result from the literature.
In particular, the most complex case (inspired by a real source, combining Herschel, ALMA and VLA
data) in the context of extragalactic SED fitting, makes MrMoose a particularly-attractive SED
fitting tool when dealing with partially blended sources, without the need for data deconvolution.
