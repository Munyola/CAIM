In this paper we report a new estimate of the absolute proper motion (PM) of the globular cluster NGC
5139 ($\omega$ Cen) as part of the HST large program GO-14118+14662. We analyzed a field 17 arcmin
South-West of the center of $\omega$ Cen and computed PMs with an epoch span of $\sim$15.1 years.
We employed 45 background galaxies to link our relative PMs to an absolute reference-frame system.
The absolute PM of the cluster in our field is: $(\mu_\alpha \cos\delta , \mu_\delta) = (-3.341 \pm
0.028 , -6.557 \pm 0.043)$ mas yr$^{-1}$. Upon correction for the effects of viewing perspective
and the known cluster rotation, this implies that for the cluster center of mass $(\mu_\alpha \cos\delta
, \mu_\delta) = (-3.238 \pm 0.028, -6.716 \pm 0.043)$ mas yr$^{-1}$. This measurement is direct
and independent, has the highest random and systematic accuracy to date, and will provide an external
verification for the upcoming Gaia Data Release 2. It also differs from most reported PMs for $\omega$
Cen in the literature by more than 5$\sigma$, but consistency checks compared to other recent catalogs
yield excellent agreement. We computed the corresponding Galactocentric velocity, calculated
the implied orbit of $\omega$ Cen in two different Galactic potentials, and compared these orbits
to the orbits implied by one of the PM measurements available in the literature. We find a larger (by
about 500 pc) perigalactic distance for $\omega$ Cen with our new PM measurement, suggesting a larger
survival expectancy for the cluster in the Galaxy.
