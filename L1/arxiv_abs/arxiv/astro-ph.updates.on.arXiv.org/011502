Galactic gas outflows are driven by stellar feedback with dominant contribution from supernovae
(SN) explosions. The question of whether the energy deposited by SNe initiates a large scale outflow
or gas circulation on smaller scales -- between discs and intermediate haloes, depends on SN rate
and their distribution in space and time. We consider here gas circulation by disc-wide unclustered
SNe with galactic star formation rate in the range from {$\simeq 6\times 10^{-4}$ to $\simeq 6\times
10^{-2}~M_\odot$~yr$^{-1}$~kpc$^{-2}$, corresponding to mid-to-high star formation observed
in galaxies. We show that such disc-wide SN explosion regime can form circulation of warm ($T\sim
10^4$ K) and cold ($T<10^3$ K) phases within a few gas scale heights, and elevation of hot {($T>10^5$
K)} gas at higher ($z>1$ kpc) heights. We found that the threshold energy input rate for hot gas outflows
with disc-wide supernovae explosions is estimated to be of the order $\sim 4\times 10^{-4}$~erg~s$^{-1}$~cm$^{-2}$.
We discuss the observational manifestations of such phenomena in optical and X-ray bands. In particular,
we found that for face-on galaxies with SF ($\Sigma_{_{\rm SF}}>0.02~M_\odot$~yr$^{-1}$~kpc$^{-2}$),
the line profiles of ions typical for warm gas show a double-peak shape, corresponding to out-of-plane
outflows. In the X-ray bands, galaxies with high SF rates ($\Sigma_{_{\rm SF}}>0.006~M_\odot$~yr$^{-1}$~kpc$^{-2}$)
can be bright, with a smooth surface brightness in low-energy bands ($0.1\hbox{--}0.3$~keV) and
patchy at higher energies ($1.6\hbox{--}8.3$~keV).}
