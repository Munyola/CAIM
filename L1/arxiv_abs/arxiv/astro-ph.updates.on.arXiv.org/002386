The measurement of cosmic shear using weak gravitational lensing is a challenging task that involves
a number of complicated procedures. We study in detail the systematic errors in the measurement
of weak lensing Minkowski Functionals (MFs). Specifically, we focus on systematics associated
with galaxy shape measurements, photometric redshift errors, and shear calibration correction.
We first generate mock weak-lensing catalogs that directly incorporate the actual observational
characteristics of the Canada-France-Hawaii Lensing Survey (CFHTLenS). We then perform a Fisher
analysis using the large set of mock catalogs for various cosmological models. We find that the statistical
error associated with the observational effects degrades the cosmological parameter constraints
by a factor of a few. The Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) survey with a sky coverage of ~1400 deg2 will
constrain the dark energy equation of the state parameter with an error of Delta w_0 ~ 0.25 by the lensing
MFs alone, but biases induced by the systematics can be comparable to the 1-sigma error. We conclude
that the lensing MFs are powerful statistics beyond the two-point statistics, only if well-calibrated
measurement of both the redshifts and the shapes of source galaxies is performed. Finally, we analyze
the CFHTLenS data to explore the ability of the MFs to break degeneracies between a few cosmological
parameters. Using a combined analysis of the MFs and the shear correlation function, we derive the
matter density Omega_m0= 0.256+0.054-0.046.
