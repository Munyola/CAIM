Bursty star formation in dwarf galaxies can slowly transform a steep dark matter cusp into a constant
density core. We explore the possibility that globular clusters (GCs) retain a dynamical memory
of this transformation. To test this, we use the nbody6df code to simulate the dynamical evolution
of GCs, including stellar evolution, orbiting in static and time-varying potentials for a Hubble
time. We find that GCs orbiting within a cored dark matter halo, or within a halo that has undergone
a cusp-core transformation, grow to a size that is substantially larger ($R_{\rm eff} > 10$ pc) than
those in a static cusped dark matter halo. They also produce much less tidal debris. We find that the
cleanest signal of an historic cusp-core transformation is the presence of large GCs with tidal
debris. However, the effect is small and will be challenging to observe in real galaxies. Finally,
we qualitatively compare our simulated GCs with the observed GC populations in the Fornax, NGC 6822,
IKN and Sagittarius dwarf galaxies. We find that the GCs in these dwarf galaxies are systematically
larger ($\langle R_{\rm eff}\rangle \simeq 7.8$ pc), and have substantially more scatter in their
sizes, than in-situ metal rich GCs in the Milky Way and young massive star clusters forming in M83
($\langle R_{\rm eff} \rangle \simeq 2.5$ pc). We show that the size, scatter and survival of GCs
in dwarf galaxies are all consistent with them having evolved in a constant density core, or a potential
that has undergone a cusp-core transformation, but not in a dark matter cusp.
