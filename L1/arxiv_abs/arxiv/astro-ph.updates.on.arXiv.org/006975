We perform a set of cosmological simulations of early structure formation with incorporating baryonic
streaming motions. We present a case where a significantly elongated gas cloud with $\sim\!10^4\,$solar
masses (${\rm M_\odot}$) is formed in a pre-galactic ($\sim\!10^7\,{\rm M_\odot}$) dark halo.
The gas streaming into the halo compresses and heats the massive filamentary cloud to a temperature
of $\sim\!10,000\,$Kelvin. The gas cloud cools rapidly by atomic hydrogen cooling, and then by
molecular hydrogen cooling down to $\sim\!400\,$Kelvin. The rapid decrease of the temperature
and hence of the Jeans mass triggers fragmentation of the filament to yield multiple gas clumps with
a few hundred solar masses. We estimate the mass of the primordial star formed in each fragment by
adopting an analytic model based on a large set of radiation hydrodynamics simulations of protostellar
evolution. The resulting stellar masses are in the range of $\sim\!50$-$120\,{\rm M_\odot}$.
The massive stars gravitationally attract each other and form a compact star cluster. We follow
the dynamics of the star cluster using a hybrid $N$-body simulation. We show that massive star binaries
are formed in a few million years through multi-body interactions at the cluster center. The eventual
formation of the remnant black holes will leave a massive black hole binary, which can be a progenitor
of strong gravitational wave sources similar to those recently detected by the Advanced Laser Interferometer
Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO).
