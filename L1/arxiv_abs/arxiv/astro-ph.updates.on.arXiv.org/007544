We examine the internal properties of the most massive ultracompact dwarf galaxy (UCD), M59-UCD3,
by combining adaptive optics assisted near-IR integral field spectroscopy from Gemini/NIFS,
and Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging. We use the multi-band HST imaging to create a mass model
that suggests and accounts for the presence of multiple stellar populations and structural components.
We combine these mass models with kinematics measurements from Gemini/NIFS to find a best-fit stellar
mass-to-light ratio ($M/L$) and black hole (BH) mass using Jeans Anisotropic Models (JAM), axisymmetric
Schwarzschild models, and triaxial Schwarzschild models. The best fit parameters in the JAM and
axisymmetric Schwarzschild models have black holes between 2.5 and 5.9 million solar masses. The
triaxial Schwarzschild models point toward a similar BH mass, but show a minimum $\chi^2$ at a BH
mass of $\sim 0$. Models with a BH in all three techniques provide better fits to the central $V_{rms}$
profiles, and thus we estimate the BH mass to be $4.2^{+2.1}_{-1.7} \times 10^{6}$ M$_\odot$ (estimated
1$\sigma$ uncertainties). We also present deep radio imaging of M59-UCD3 and two other UCDs in Virgo
with dynamical BH mass measurements, and compare these to X-ray measurements to check for consistency
with the fundamental plane of BH accretion. We detect faint radio emission in M59cO, but find only
upper limits for M60-UCD1 and M59-UCD3 despite X-ray detections in both these sources. The BH mass
and nuclear light profile of M59-UCD3 suggests it is the tidally stripped remnant of a $\sim$10$^{9-10}$
M$_\odot$ galaxy.
