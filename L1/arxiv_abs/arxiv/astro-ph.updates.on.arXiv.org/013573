We present an analysis of the spectral shape and pulse profile of the accretion-powered pulsar 4U
1626-67 observed with Suzaku and NuSTAR during a spin-up state. The pulsar, which experienced a
torque reversal to spin-up in 2008, has a spin period of 7.7 s. Comparing the phase-averaged spectra
obtained with Suzaku in 2010 and with NuSTAR in 2015, we find that the spectral shape changed between
the two observations: the 3-10 keV flux increased by 5% while the 30-60 keV flux decreased significantly
by 35%. Phase-averaged and phase-resolved spectral analysis shows that the continuum spectrum
observed by NuSTAR is well described by an empirical NPEX continuum with an added broad Gaussian
emission component around the spectral peak at 20 keV. Taken together with the observed Pdot value
obtained from Fermi/GBM, we conclude that the spectral change between the Suzaku and NuSTAR observations
was likely caused by an increase of the accretion rate. We also report the possible detection of asymmetry
in the profile of the fundamental cyclotron line. Furthermore, we present a study of the energy-resolved
pulse profiles using a new relativistic ray tracing code, where we perform a simultaneous fit to
the pulse profiles assuming a two-column geometry with a mixed pencil- and fan-beam emission pattern.
The resulting pulse profile decompositions enable us to obtain geometrical parameters of accretion
columns (inclination, azimuthal and polar angles) and a fiducial set of beam patterns. This information
is important to validate the theoretical predictions from radiation transfer in a strong magnetic
field.
