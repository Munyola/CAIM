Partial measurements of relative position are a relatively common event during the observation
of visual binary stars. However, these observations are typically discarded when estimating the
orbit of a visual pair. In this article we present a novel framework to characterize the orbits from
a Bayesian standpoint, including partial observations of relative position as an input for the
estimation of orbital parameters. Our aim is to formally incorporate the information contained
in those partial measurements in a systematic way into the final inference. In the statistical literature,
an imputation is defined as the replacement of a missing quantity with a plausible value. To compute
posterior distributions of orbital parameters with partial observations, we propose a technique
based on Markov chain Monte Carlo with multiple imputation. We present the methodology and test
the algorithm with both synthetic and real observations, studying the effect of incorporating
partial measurements in the parameter estimation. Our results suggest that the inclusion of partial
measurements into the characterization of visual binaries may lead to a reduction in the uncertainty
associated to each orbital element, in terms of a decrease in dispersion measures (such as the interquartile
range) of the posterior distribution of relevant orbital parameters. The extent to which the uncertainty
decreases after the incorporation of new data (either complete or partial) depends on how informative
those newly-incorporated measurements are. Quantifying the information contained in each measurement
remains an open issue.
