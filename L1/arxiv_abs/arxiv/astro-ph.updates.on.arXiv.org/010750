It has recently been discovered that a fraction of ultra-luminous X-ray sources (ULXs) exhibit
X-ray pulsations, and are therefore powered by super-Eddington accretion onto magnetized neutron
stars (NSs). For typical ULX mass accretion rates ($\gtrsim 10^{19}\,{\rm g\,s^{-1}}$), the inner
parts of the accretion disc are expected to be in the supercritical regime, meaning that some material
is lost in a wind launched from the disc surface, while the rest forms an optically thick envelope
around the NS as it follows magnetic field lines from the inner disc radius to the magnetic poles of
the star. The envelope hides the central object from a distant observer and defines key observational
properties of ULX pulsars: their energy spectrum, polarization, and timing features. The optical
thickness of the envelope is affected by the mass losses from the disc. We calculate the mass loss
rate due to the wind in ULX pulsars, accounting for the NS magnetic field strength and advection processes
in the disc. We argue that the detection of strong outflows from ULX pulsars can be considered evidence
of a relatively weak dipole component of the NS magnetic field. We estimate the influence of mass
losses on the optical thickness of the envelope and analyze how the envelope affects broadband aperiodic
variability in ULXs. We show that brightness fluctuations at high Fourier frequencies can be strongly
suppressed by multiple scatterings in the envelope and that the strength of suppression is determined
by the mass accretion rate and geometrical size of the magnetosphere.
