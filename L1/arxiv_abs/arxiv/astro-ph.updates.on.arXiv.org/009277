We present the detection at 89 $\mu$m (observed frame) of the {\it Herschel}-selected gravitationally
lensed starburst galaxy HATLASJ1429-0028 (also known as G15v2.19) in 15 minutes with the High-resolution
Airborne Wideband Camera-plus (HAWC+) onboard the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy
(SOFIA). The spectacular lensing system consists of an edge-on foreground disk galaxy at $z$ = 0.22
and a nearly complete Einstein ring of an intrinsic ultra-luminous infrared galaxy at $z$ = 1.03.
Is this high IR luminosity powered by pure star formation (SF) or also an active galactic nucleus
(AGN)? Previous nebular line diagnostics indicate that it is star-formation dominated. We perform
a 27-band multi-wavelength spectral energy distribution modeling (SED) including the new SOFIA/HAWC+
data to constrain the fractional AGN contribution to the total IR luminosity. The AGN fraction in
the IR turns out to be negligible. In addition, J1429-0028 serves as a testbed for comparing SED results
from different models/templates and SED codes (MAGPHYS, SED3FIT, and CIGALE). We stress that star
formation history is the dominant source of uncertainty in the derived stellar mass (as high as a
factor of $\sim$ 10) even in the case of extensive photometric coverage. Furthermore, the detection
of a source at $z$ $\sim$ 1 with SOFIA/HAWC+ demonstrates the potential of utilizing this facility
for distant galaxy studies including the decomposition of SF/AGN components, which cannot be accomplished
with other current facilities.
