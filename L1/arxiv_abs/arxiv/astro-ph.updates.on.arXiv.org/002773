A summary is presented for 130 galaxies observed with the Herschel PACS instrument to measure fluxes
for the [CII] 158 um emission line. Sources cover a wide range of active galactic nucleus to starburst
classifications, as derived from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) strength measured with
the Spitzer Infrared Spectrograph. Redshifts from [CII] and line to continuum strengths (equivalent
width of [CII]) are given for the full sample, which includes 18 new [CII] flux measures. Calibration
of L([CII)]) as a star formation rate (SFR) indicator is determined by comparing [CII] luminosities
with mid-infrared [NeII] and [NeIII] emission line luminosities; this gives the same result as
determining SFR using bolometric luminosities of reradiating dust from starbursts: log SFR = log
L([CII)]) - 7.0, for SFR in solar masses per year and L([CII]) in solar luminosities. We conclude
that L([CII]) can be used to measure SFR in any source to a precision of ~ 50%, even if total source luminosities
are dominated by an AGN component. The line to continuum ratio at 158 um, EW([CII]), is not significantly
greater for starbursts (median EW([CII]) = 1.0 um) compared to composites and AGN (median EW([CII])
= 0.7 um), showing that the far infrared continuum at 158 um scales with [CII] regardless of classification.
This indicates that the continuum at 158 um also arises primarily from the starburst component within
any source, giving log SFR = log vLv(158 um) - 42.8 for SFR in solar masses per year and vLv(158 um) in
erg per sec.
