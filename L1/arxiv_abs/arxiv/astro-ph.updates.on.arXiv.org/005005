We present inferences on the geometry and kinematics of the broad-Hbeta line-emitting region in
four active galactic nuclei monitored as a part of the fall 2010 reverberation mapping campaign
at MDM Observatory led by the Ohio State University. From modeling the continuum variability and
response in emission-line profile changes as a function of time, we infer the geometry of the Hbeta-
emitting broad line regions to be thick disks that are close to face-on to the observer with kinematics
that are well-described by either elliptical orbits or inflowing gas. We measure the black hole
mass to be log (MBH) = 7.25 (+/-0.10) for Mrk 335, 7.86 (+0.20, -0.17) for Mrk 1501, 7.84 (+0.14, -0.19)
for 3C 120, and 6.92 (+0.24, -0.23) for PG 2130+099. These black hole mass measurements are not based
on a particular assumed value of the virial scale factor f, allowing us to compute individual f factors
for each target. Our results nearly double the number of targets that have been modeled in this manner,
and investigate the properties of a more diverse sample by including previously modeled objects.
We measure an average scale factor f in the entire sample to be log10(f) = 0.54 +/- 0.17 when the line
dispersion is used to characterize the line width, which is consistent with values derived using
the normalization of the MBH-sigma relation. We find that the scale factor f for individual targets
is likely correlated with the black hole mass, inclination angle, and opening angle of the broad
line region but we do not find any correlation with the luminosity.
