In this paper, the cosmographic approach is used to determine the spatial curvature (i.e., $\Omega_K$)
combining the latest released cosmic chronometers data (CC), the Pantheon sample of type Ia supernovae
observations, and the baryon acoustic oscillation measurements (BAO). We use the expanded comoving
angular diameter distance $D_M(z)$ as a basic function for deriving $H(z)$ and the other cosmic
distances. In this scenario, $\Omega_K$ can be constrained by CC data alone. To overcome convergence
issues at the high-redshift domains, we apply two methods: the Pad\'{e} approximants and the Taylor
expansion in terms of the new redshift $y=z/(1+z)$. However, our analysis finds that $D_M(z)$ expanded
in $y$ is inconsistent with the $\Lambda$CDM + $\Omega_K$ model with non-zero $\Omega_K$. Adopting
the Bayesian evidence, we find that the present data combination prefers the Pad\'{e} approximant
of $D_M(z)$ up to the order ($2,2$). Our constraint on the Hubble constant $H_0$ under different
approximants and with different data combinations are consistent with the \textit{Planck} 2018
results and have less than $3\sigma$ tension with the local distance ladder determination of $H_0$
from Ref. (Riess et al. (2018)). Our most favored cosmography model prefers $\Omega_K = 0.21\pm
0.22$ under the CC+Pantheon+BAO dataset, but $\Omega_K = -0.03_{-0.18}^{+0.16}$ when taking
the local distance ladder determination of $H_0$ as prior. We also find that $H_0$ is anti-correlated
with $\Omega_K$, which indicates that the $H_0$ tension problem can be slightly relaxed by introducing
$\Omega_K$.
