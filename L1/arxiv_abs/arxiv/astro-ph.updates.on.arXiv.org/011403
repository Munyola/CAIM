Two kinds of processes could occur during the flare decay phase: processes of energy release or processes
of energy relaxation. Quasi-periodic pulsations (QPPs) of the broadband emission are a good tool
for the verification of mechanisms. We aim to study the processes during the decay phase of the X-class
solar flare SOL2014-03-29T17:48. The observations in X-ray, microwave, and extreme ultraviolet
(EUV) bands are exploited to study the fine temporal, spatial, and spectral structures of the flare.
The periods, amplitudes, and phases of both the fluxes and physical parameters (emission measure,
temperature) are studied using standard methods of correlation, Fourier, and wavelet analyses.
It is found that the source of the QPPs is associated with the uniform post-flare loop. The X-ray source
is located at the top of the arcade. QPPs with the similar characteristic time scales of $P\approx$
74--80 s are found in the X-ray (3--25 keV) and microwave (15.7 GHz) emissions. Besides, QPPs with
the same period are found in the time profiles of both the temperature ($T_e$) and emission measure
($EM$). The QPPs in temperature and the QPPs in emission measure demonstrate anti-phase behavior.
The analysis reveals the quasi-periodic process of energy relaxation, without any additional
source of energy during the decay phase. The periods of the QPPs are in a good agreement with second
harmonic of standing slow magneto-acoustic wave in the arcade which could be triggered by a Moreton
wave initiated by the flare in the direct vicinity of the arcade.
