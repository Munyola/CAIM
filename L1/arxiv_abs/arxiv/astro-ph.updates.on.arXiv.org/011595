We analyze 2-5 micrometre spectroscopic observations of the dust coma of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko
obtained with the VIRTIS-H instrument onboard Rosetta from 3 June to 29 October 2015 at heliocentric
distances r_h = 1.24-1.55 AU. The 2-2.5 micrometre color, bolometric albedo, and color temperature
are measured using spectral fitting. Data obtained at alpha = 90{\deg} solar phase angle show an
increase of the bolometric albedo (0.05 to 0.14) with increasing altitude (0.5 to 8 km), accompanied
by a possible marginal decrease of the color and color temperature. Possible explanations include
the presence in the inner coma of dark particles on ballistic trajectories, and radial changes in
particle composition. In the phase angle range 50-120{\deg}, phase reddening is significant (0.031
%/100 nm/{\deg}), for a mean color of 2 %/100 nm at alpha = 90{\deg}, that can be related to the roughness
of the dust particles. Moreover, a decrease of the color temperature with decreasing phase angle
is also observed at a rate of ~ 0.3 K/{\deg}, consistent with the presence of large porous particles,
with low thermal inertia, and showing a significant day-to-night temperature contrast. Comparing
data acquired at fixed phase angle (alpha = 90{\deg}), a 20% increase of the bolometric albedo is
observed near perihelion. Heliocentric variations of the dust color are not significant in the
analyzed time period. Measured color temperatures are varying from 260 to 320 K, and follow a r^0.6
variation in the r_h = 1.24-1.5 AU range, close to the expected r_h^0.5 value.
