The discovery of the `Lorimer Burst', a little over a decade ago, ignited renewed interest in searching
for short-duration radio transients. This event is now considered to be the first established Fast
Radio Burst (FRB), which is a class of millisecond-duration radio transients. The large dispersive
delays observed in FRBs distinguish them from the individual bright pulses from Galactic pulsars,
and suggests that they originate deep in extragalactic space. Amazingly, FRBs are not rare: the
implied event rate ranges up to many thousands of events per sky, per day. The fact that only two dozen
FRBs have been discovered to date is a consequence of the limited sensitivity and field of view of
current radio telescopes. The precise localization of FRB 121102, the first and currently only
FRB observed to repeat, has led to the unambiguous identification of its host galaxy and thus proven
its extragalactic origin and large energy scale. It remains unclear, however, whether all FRBs
are capable of repeating (many appear far less active) or whether FRB 121102 implies that there are
multiple sub-classes. Regardless, the repetitive nature of FRB 121102 and its localization to
within a star-forming region in the host galaxy imply that the bursts might originate from an exceptionally
powerful neutron star - one necessarily quite unlike any we have observed in the Milky Way. In these
proceedings, I give a very brief introduction to the FRB phenomenon and focus primarily on the insights
that FRB 121102 has provided thus far.
