The observed variability of X-ray binaries over a wide range of time-scales can be understood in
the framework of a stochastic propagation model, where viscous fluctuations at different radii
induce accretion rate variability that propagate inwards to the X-ray producing region. The scenario
successfully explains the power spectra, the linear rms-flux relation as well as the time-lag between
different energy photons. The predictions of this model have been obtained using approximate analytical
solutions or empirically motivated models which take into account the effect of these propagating
variability on the radiative process of complex accretion flows. Here, we study the variation of
the accretion rate due to such viscous fluctuations using a hydro-dynamical code for the standard
geometrically thin, gas pressure dominated $\alpha$-disc with a zero torque boundary condition.
Our results confirm earlier findings that the time-lag between a perturbation and the resultant
inner accretion rate variation depends on the frequency (or time-period) of the perturbation.
Here we have quantified that the time-lag $t_{lag} \propto f^{-0.54}$, for time-periods less than
the viscous time-scale of the perturbation radius and is nearly constant otherwise. This, coupled
with radiative process would produce the observed frequency dependent time-lag between different
energy bands. We also confirm that if there are random Gaussian fluctuations of the $\alpha$-parameter
at different radii, the resultant inner accretion rate has a power spectrum which is a power-law.
