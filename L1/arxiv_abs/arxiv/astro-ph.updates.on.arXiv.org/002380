Among Type Ia supernovae (SNe~Ia) exist a class of overluminous objects whose ejecta mass is inferred
to be larger than the canonical Chandrasekhar mass. We present and discuss the UV/optical photometric
light curves, colors, absolute magnitudes, and spectra of three candidate Super-Chandrasekhar
mass SNe--2009dc, 2011aa, and 2012dn--observed with the Swift Ultraviolet/Optical Telescope.
The light curves are at the broad end for SNe Ia, with the light curves of SN~2011aa being amongst the
broadest ever observed. We find all three to have very blue colors which may provide a means of excluding
these overluminous SNe from cosmological analysis, though there is some overlap with the bluest
of "normal" SNe Ia. All three are overluminous in their UV absolute magnitudes compared to normal
and broad SNe Ia, but SNe 2011aa and 2012dn are not optically overluminous compared to normal SNe
Ia. The integrated luminosity curves of SNe 2011aa and 2012dn in the UVOT range (1600-6000 Angstroms)
are only half as bright as SN~2009dc, implying a smaller 56Ni yield. While not enough to strongly
affect the bolometric flux, the early time mid-UV flux makes a significant contribution at early
times. The strong spectral features in the mid-UV spectra of SNe 2009dc and 2012dn suggest a higher
temperature and lower opacity to be the cause of the UV excess rather than a hot, smooth blackbody
from shock interaction. Further work is needed to determine the ejecta and 56Ni masses of SNe 2011aa
and 2012dn and fully explain their high UV luminosities.
