We consider misaligned accretion discs formed after tidal disruption events occurring when a star
encounters a supermassive rotating black hole. We use the linear theory of warped accretion discs
to find the disc shape when the stream produced by the disrupted star provides a source of mass and
angular momentum that is misaligned with the black hole. The evolution of the surface density and
aspect ratio is found from a one dimensional vertically averaged model. We extend previous work
which assumed a quasi-stationary disc to allow unrestricted dynamical propagation of disc tilt
and twist through time dependent backgrounds. We consider a smaller value of the viscosity parameter,
$\alpha =0.01,$ finding the dynamics varies significantly. At early times the disc inclination
is found to be nearly uniform at small radii where the aspect ratio is large. However, since torques
arise from the Lense-Thirring effect and the stream there is non uniform precession. We propose
a simple model for this requiring only the background surface density and aspect ratio. At these
times the $\alpha \sim 0.01$ disc exhibits a new feature. An inclined hot inner region joins an outer
low inclination cool region via a thin transition front propagating outwards with a speed exceeding
that of bending waves in the cool region. These waves accumulate where the propagation speeds match
producing an inclination spike separating inner and outer discs. At late times a sequence of quasi-stationary
configurations approximates disc shapes at small radii. We discuss observational implications
of our results.
