We present numerical simulations of giant planet migration in our solar system and examine how the
speed of planetary migration affects inclinations in the resulting population of small bodies
(test particles) scattered outward and subsequently captured into Neptune's 3:2 mean motion resonance
(the Plutinos) as well as the hot classical Kuiper belt population. We do not find a consistent relationship
between the degree of test particle inclination excitation and e-folding planet migration timescales
in the range 5-50 Myr. Our results present a counter-example to Nesvorny 2015's finding that the
Plutino and hot classical inclinations showed a marked increase with increasing e-folding timescales
for Neptune's migration. We argue that these differing results are likely due to differing secular
architectures of the giant planets during and after migration. Small changes in the planets' initial
conditions and differences in the numerical implementation of planet migration can result in different
amplitudes of the planets' inclination secular modes, and this can lead to different final inclination
distributions for test particles in the simulations. We conclude that the observed large inclination
dispersion of Kuiper belt objects does not require Neptune's migration to be slow; planetary migration
with e-folding timescales of 5, 10, 30, and 50 Myr can all yield inclination dispersions similar
to the observed Plutino and hot classical populations, with no correlation between the degree of
inclination excitation and migration speed.
