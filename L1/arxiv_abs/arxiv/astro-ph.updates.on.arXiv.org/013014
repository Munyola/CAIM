Fossat et al. (2017) recently reported detecting rotational splitting of g modes indirectly via
the interaction with p modes observed directly by the GOLF instrument on SOHO. They concluded that
the core of the Sun is rotating 3:8 ? 0:1 times faster than the surrounding radiative envelope. This
is startling, partly because such rapid rotation almost contradicts direct inferences from the
p-mode rotational splitting inferred from the same data. Moreover, the inferred amplitudes of
the g modes appear to exceed the upper bound reported by Appourchaux et al. (2010). It is also suspect
because the theory of the procedure implies that the principal modes claimed to have been measured
should be undetectable. We point out that there are other interpretations: one leads to a core rotation
about twice faster than the surrounding envelope; another, to a core rotating more slowly than the
envelope. Here we also report on an independent assessment of the Fossat et al. analysis by applying
their procedure to different representations of the GOLF data, expanding on Schunker et al. (2018).
We also analyze seismic data obtained from LOI and MDI (both also on SOHO), from HMI (on SDO) and from
the ground-based BiSON and GONG, and found the evidence reported by Fossat et al. not to be robust.
We also illustrate that merely fitting model spectra to observations, which Fossat et al. do to support
their g-mode detections and as Fossat & Schmider (2018) do for extracting additional g-mode splittings,
is not necessarily reliable. We are therefore led to doubt the claim.
