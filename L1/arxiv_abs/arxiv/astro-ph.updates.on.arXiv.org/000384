We have constructed the first all-sky map of the thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich (tSZ) effect by applying
specifically tailored component separation algorithms to the 100 to 857 GHz frequency channel
maps from the Planck survey. These maps show an obvious galaxy cluster tSZ signal that is well matched
with blindly detected clusters in the Planck SZ catalogue. To characterize the signal in the tSZ
map we have computed its angular power spectrum. At large angular scales ($\ell < 60$), the major
foreground contaminant is the diffuse thermal dust emission. At small angular scales ($\ell >
500$) the clustered Cosmic Infrared Background (CIB) and residual point sources are the major contaminants.
These foregrounds are carefully modelled and subtracted. We measure the tSZ power spectrum in angular
scales, $0.17^{\circ} \lesssim \theta \lesssim 3.0^{\circ}$, that were previously unexplored.
The measured tSZ power spectrum is consistent with that expected from the Planck catalogue of SZ
sources, with additional clear evidence of signal from unresolved clusters and, potentially,
diffuse warm baryons. We use the tSZ power spectrum to obtain the following cosmological constraints:
$\sigma_8(\Omega_{\mathrm{m}}/0.28)^{3.2/8.1}=0.784 \pm 0.016 (68% C.L.). Marginalized
band-powers of the Planck tSZ power spectrum and the best-fit model are given. The non-Gaussianity
of the Compton parameter map is further characterized by computing its 1D probability distribution
function and its bispectrum. These are used to place additional independent constraints on $\sigma_{8}$.
