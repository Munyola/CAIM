We consider models of scalar dark matter with a generic interaction potential and non-canonical
kinetic terms of the K-essence type that are subleading with respect to the canonical term. We analyze
the low-energy regime and derive, in the nonrelativistic limit, the effective equations of motions.
In the fluid approximation they reduce to the conservation of matter and to the Euler equation for
the velocity field. We focus on the case where the scalar field mass $10^{-21} \ll m \lesssim 10^{-4}
\, {\rm eV}$ is much larger than for fuzzy dark matter, so that the quantum pressure is negligible
on cosmological and galactic scales, while the self-interaction potential and non-canonical
kinetic terms generate a significant repulsive pressure. At the level of cosmological perturbations,
this provides a dark-matter density-dependent speed of sound. At the nonlinear level, the hydrostatic
equilibrium obtained by balancing the gravitational and scalar interactions imply that virialized
structures have a solitonic core of finite size depending on the speed of sound of the dark matter
fluid. For the most relevant potential in $\lambda_4 \phi^4/4$ or K-essence with a $(\partial \phi)^4$
interaction, the size of such stable cores cannot exceed 60 kpc. Structures with a density contrast
larger than $10^6$ can be accommodated with a speed of sound $c_s\lesssim 10^{-6}$. We also consider
the case of a cosine self-interaction, as an example of bounded nonpolynomial self-interaction.
This gives similar results in low-mass and low-density halos whereas solitonic cores are shown
to be absent in massive halos.
