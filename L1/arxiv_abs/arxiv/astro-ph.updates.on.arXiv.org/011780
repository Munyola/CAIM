This is the first paper of a series exploring the multi-frequency properties of a sample of eleven
nearby low excitation radio galaxies (LERGs) in the southern sky. We are conducting an extensive
study of different galaxy components (stars, warm and cold gas, radio jets) with the aim of improving
our understanding of the AGN fuelling/feedback cycle in LERGs. We present ALMA Band 6 $^{12}$CO(2-1)
and continuum observations of nine sources. Continuum emission from the radio cores was detected
in all objects. Six sources also show mm emission from jets on kpc/sub-kpc scales. The jet structures
are very similar at mm and cm wavelengths. We conclude that synchrotron emission associated with
the radio jets dominates the continuum spectra up to 230 GHz. The $^{12}$CO(2-1) line was detected
in emission in six out of nine objects, with molecular gas masses ranging from $2 \times 10^{7}$ to
$2 \times 10^{10}$ M$_{\rm \odot}$. The CO detections show disc-like structures on scales from
$\approx$0.2 to $\approx$10 kpc. In one case (NGC 3100) the CO disc presents some asymmetries and
is disrupted in the direction of the northern radio jet, indicating a possible jet/disc interaction.
In IC 4296, CO is detected in absorption against the radio core, as well as in emission. In four of the
six galaxies with CO detections, the gas rotation axes are roughly parallel to the radio jets in projection;
the remaining two cases show large misalignments. In those objects where optical imaging is available,
dust and CO appear to be co-spatial.
