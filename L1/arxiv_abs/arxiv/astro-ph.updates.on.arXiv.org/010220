We study cosmic voids in the normal-branch Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati (nDGP) braneworld models,
which are representative of a class of modified gravity theories where deviations from General
Relativity are usually hidden by the Vainshtein screening in high-density environments. This
screening is less efficient away from these environments, which makes voids ideally suited for
testing this class of models. We use N-body simulations of $\Lambda$-cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM)
and nGDP universes, where dark matter haloes are populated with mock galaxies that mimic the clustering
and number densities of the BOSS CMASS galaxy sample. We measure the force, density and weak lensing
profiles around voids identified with six different algorithms. Compared to $\Lambda$CDM, voids
in nDGP are more under-dense due to the action of the fifth force that arises in these models, which
leads to a faster evacuation of matter from voids. This leaves an imprint on the weak lensing tangential
shear profile around nDGP voids, an effect that is particularly strong for 2D underdensities that
are identified in the plane-of-the-sky. We make predictions for the feasibility of distinguishing
between nDGP and $\Lambda$CDM using void lensing in upcoming large-scale surveys such as LSST and
Euclid. We compare with the analysis of voids in chameleon gravity theories and find that the weak
lensing signal for 3D voids is similar to nDGP, whereas for 2D voids the differences with $\Lambda$CDM
are much stronger for the chameleon gravity case, a direct consequence of the different screening
mechanisms operating in these theories.
