Recent improvements in stellar models for intermediate-mass and massive stars are recalled, together
with their expectations for the synthesis of radioactive nuclei of lifetime $\tau \lesssim 25$
Myr, in order to re-examine the origins of now extinct radioactivities, which were alive in the solar
nebula. The Galactic inheritance broadly explains most of them, especially if $r$-process nuclei
are produced by neutron star merging according to recent models. Instead, $^{26}$Al, $^{41}$Ca,
$^{135}$Cs and possibly $^{60}$Fe require nucleosynthesis events close to the solar formation.
We outline the persisting difficulties to account for these nuclei by Intermediate Mass Stars (2
$\lesssim $ M/M$_\odot \lesssim 7 - 8$). Models of their final stages now predict the ubiquitous
formation of a $^{13}$C reservoir as a neutron capture source; hence, even in presence of $^{26}$Al
production from Deep Mixing or Hot Bottom Burning, the ratio $^{26}$Al/$^{107}$Pd remains incompatible
with measured data, with a large excess in $^{107}$Pd. This is shown for two recent approaches to
Deep Mixing. Even a late contamination by a Massive Star meets problems. In fact, inhomogeneous
addition of Supernova debris predicts non-measured excesses on stable isotopes. Revisions invoking
specific low-mass supernovae and/or the sequential contamination of the pre-solar molecular
cloud might be affected by similar problems, although our conclusions here are weakened by our schematic
approach to the addition of SN ejecta. The limited parameter space remaining to be explored for solving
this puzzle is discussed.
