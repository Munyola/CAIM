Star formation often occurs within or nearby stellar clusters. Irradiation by nearby massive stars
can photoevaporate protoplanetary disks around young stars (so-called proplyds) which raises
questions regarding the ability of planet formation to take place in these environments. We investigate
the two-dimensional physical and chemical structure of a protoplanetary disk surrounding a low-mass
(T Tauri) star which is irradiated by a nearby massive O-type star to determine the survivability
and observability of molecules in proplyds. Compared with an isolated star-disk system, the gas
temperature ranges from a factor of a few (in the disk midplane) to around two orders of magnitude
(in the disk surface) higher in the irradiated disk. Although the UV flux in the outer disk, in particular,
is several orders of magnitude higher, the surface density of the disk is sufficient for effective
shielding of the disk midplane so that the disk remains predominantly molecular in nature. We also
find that non-volatile molecules, such as HCN and H2O, are able to freeze out onto dust grains in the
disk midplane so that the formation of icy planetesimals, e.g., comets, may also be possible in proplyds.
We have calculated the molecular line emission from the disk assuming LTE and determined that multiple
transitions of atomic carbon, CO (and isotopologues, 13CO and C18O), HCO+, CN, and HCN may be observable
with ALMA, allowing characterization of the gas column density, temperature, and optical depth
in proplyds at the distance of Orion (~400 pc).
