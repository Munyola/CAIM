We investigate the evolution of axis ratios of triaxial haloes using the phase space description
of triaxial collapse. In this formulation, the evolution of the triaxial ellipsoid is described
in terms of the dynamics of eigenvalues of three important tensors: the Hessian of the gravitational
potential, the tensor of velocity derivatives and the deformation tensor. The eigenvalues of the
deformation tensor are directly related to the parameters that describe triaxiality, namely,
the minor to major and intermediate to major axes ratios ($s$ and $q$) and the triaxiality parameter
$T$. Using the phase space equations, we evolve the eigenvalues and examine the evolution of the
PDF (probability distribution function) of the axes ratios as a function of mass scale and redshift
for Gaussian initial conditions. We find that the ellipticity and prolateness increase with decreasing
mass scale and decreasing redshift. These trends agree with previous analytic studies but differ
from numerical simulations. However, the PDF of the scaled parameter ${\tilde q} = (q-s)/(1-s)$
follows a universal distribution over two decades in mass range and redshifts which is in qualitative
agreement with the universality for conditional PDF reported in simulations. We further show using
the phase space dynamics that, in fact, ${\tilde q}$ is a phase space invariant and is conserved individually
for each halo. These results, demonstrate that the phase space analysis is a useful tool that provides
a different perspective on the evolution of perturbations and can be applied to more sophisticated
models in the future.
