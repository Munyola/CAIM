We observed twelve nearby HI -detected early-type galaxies (ETGs) of stellar mass $\sim 10^{10}M\odot
\leq M_* \leq \sim 10^{11}M\odot$ with the Mitchell Integral-Field Spectrograph, reaching approximately
three half-light radii in most cases. We extracted line-of-sight velocity distributions for the
stellar and gaseous components. We find little evidence of transitions in the stellar kinematics
of the galaxies in our sample beyond the central effective radius, with centrally fast-rotating
galaxies remaining fast-rotating and centrally slow-rotating galaxies likewise remaining slow-rotating.
This is consistent with these galaxies having not experienced late dry major mergers; however,
several of our objects have ionised gas that is misaligned with respect to their stars, suggesting
some kind of past interaction. We extract Lick index measurements of the commonly-used H$\beta$,
Fe5015, Mg\, b, Fe5270 and Fe5335 absorption features, and we find most galaxies to have flat H$\beta$
gradients and negative Mg, b gradients. We measure gradients of age, metallicity and abundance
ratio for our galaxies using spectral fitting, and for the majority of our galaxies find negative
age and metallicity gradients. We also find the stellar mass-to-light ratios to decrease with radius
for most of the galaxies in our sample. Our results are consistent with a view in which intermediate-mass
ETGs experience mostly quiet evolutionary histories, but in which many have experienced some kind
of gaseous interaction in recent times.
