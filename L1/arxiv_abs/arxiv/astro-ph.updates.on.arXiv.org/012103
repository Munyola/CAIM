The third Fermi-LAT catalog (3FGL) presented the data of the first four years of observations from
the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope mission. There are 3034 sources, 1010 of which still remain
unidentified. Identifying and classifying gamma-ray emitters is of high significance with regard
to studying high-energy astrophysics. We demonstrate that optical polarimetry can be an advantageous
and practical tool in the hunt for counterparts of the unidentified gamma-ray sources (UGSs). Using
data from the RoboPol project, we validated that a significant fraction of active galactic nuclei
(AGN) associated with 3FGL sources can be identified due to their high optical polarization exceeding
that of the field stars. We performed an optical polarimetric survey within $3\sigma$ uncertainties
of four unidentified 3FGL sources. We discovered a previously unknown extragalactic object within
the positional uncertainty of 3FGL J0221.2+2518. We obtained its spectrum and measured a redshift
of $z=0.0609\pm0.0004$. Using these measurements and archival data we demonstrate that this source
is a candidate counterpart for 3FGL J0221.2+2518 and most probably is a composite object: a star-forming
galaxy accompanied by AGN. We conclude that polarimetry can be a powerful asset in the search for
AGN candidate counterparts for unidentified Fermi sources. Future extensive polarimetric surveys
at high galactic latitudes (e.g., PASIPHAE) will allow the association of a significant fraction
of currently unidentified gamma-ray sources.
