Tucana-II (Tuc-II), a recently discovered and confirmed Ultra Faint Dwarf Spheroidal galaxy,
has a high mass to light ratio as well as a large line-of-sight stellar velocity dispersion, thus
making it an ideal candidate for an indirect dark matter search. In this paper, we have analyzed nine
years of $\gamma$-ray data obtained from the \textit{Fermi}-LAT instrument in the direction of
Tuc-II. The fact that no statistically significant $\gamma$-ray excess over the background of
Tuc-II have been detected from the location of this galaxy. It called for an estimation of the $95\%$
confidence level upper limit of the possible velocity weighted self-annihilation cross-section
of the dark matter particles (WIMPs) within Tuc-II by fitting the observed $\gamma$-ray flux with
the DMFit function. The estimated upper limits of the cross-sections are then compared with similar
upper limits of the cross-sections determined by us in three other dwarf galaxies that are considered
earlier to be the good dark matter candidates in the literature. We have also compared our results
with the cross-sections obtained in various popular theoretical models of the WIMPs to find that
our results impose reasonable constraints on the parameter spaces of those models. In the concluding
section, we compared our results with the similar results obtained from a combined dSph analysis
by the \textit{Fermi}-LAT collaboration as well as the results obtained from the studies of dark
matter in the dwarf galaxies by the major ground-based Cherenkov experiments.
