Damped Lyman-{\alpha} Absorbers (DLAs) as a class of QSO absorption-line systems are currently
our most important source of detailed information on the cosmic chemical evolution of galaxies.
However, the degree to which this information is biased by dust remains to be understood. One strategy
is to specifically search for QSOs reddened by metal-rich and dusty foreground absorbers. In this
Letter we present the discovery of a z=2.60 QSO strongly reddened by dust in an intervening extremely-strong
DLA at z=2.226. This QSO was identified through a novel selection combining the astrometric measurements
from ESA's Gaia satellite with extent optical and near/mid-infrared photometry. We infer a total
neutral atomic-hydrogen column density of log N(HI)=21.95{\pm}0.15 and a lower limit on the gas-phase
metallicity of [Zn/H]>-0.96. This DLA is also remarkable in exhibiting shielded neutral gas witnessed
in CI and tentative detections of CO molecular bands. The Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) of
the QSO is well-accounted for by a normal QSO-SED reddened by dust from a DLA with a 10%-of-Solar metallicity,
dust extinction of A_V=0.82{\pm}0.02mag, and LMC-like extinction curve including the characteristic
2175{\AA} extinction feature. Such QSO absorption-line systems have shown to be very rare in previous
surveys, which have mostly revealed sight-lines with low extinction. The present case therefore
suggests that previous samples have under-represented the fraction of dusty absorbers. Building
a complete sample of such systems is needed to assess the significance of this effect.
