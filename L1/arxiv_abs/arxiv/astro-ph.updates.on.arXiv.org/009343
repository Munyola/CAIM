We report on the radio-brightening of the blazar TXS 0506+056 in temporal coincidence with the IC-170922A
high-energy neutrino detection by the IceCube Neutrino Observatory. Very long baseline interferometry
(VLBI) data at 15 GHz spanning 16 epochs between January 2009 and May 2018 were analysed in order to
reveal the radio structure of the blazar TXS 0506+056 (z=0.3365). This flaring $\gamma$-ray blazar
has been recently identified as the source of the high-energy neutrino event IC-170922A, also supported
by the excess of cosmic neutrinos between September 2014 and March 2015 reported by the IceCube Collaboration.
Our investigations indicate that the radio flux density of the TXS 0506+056 VLBI core has been abruptly
brightening since January 2016, producing an accumulated fourfold increase until the most recent
observation. Further, the radio jet-components maintain peculiar quasi-stationary core separations
and the structure of the jet ridge line, as well as the flux density variation along it is indicative
of a jet curve at the region $0.5-2$ mas from the VLBI core. These features support a helical jet structure
and a small inclination angle, which is less than $7^\circ$ based on the average brightness temperature
of the core. The radio jet pointing towards the Earth is the key property of the blazar TXS 0506+056
enabling multimessenger observations. The radio-brightening coincident with the high-energy
neutrino detection is similar to the one reported for the blazar PKS 0723-008 and IceCube event ID5.
