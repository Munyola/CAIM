We compared the results from the JSOC pipeline for horizontal flow components and the perturbations
of the speed of sound at set of depths with equivalent results from an independently implemented
pipeline using a different time-distance inversion scheme. Our inversion pipeline allows inversion
for all quantities at once while allowing minimisation of the crosstalk between them. This gives
us an opportunity to discuss the possible biases present in the JSOC data products. For the tests
we used the subtractive optimally localised averaging (SOLA) method with a minimisation of the
cross-talk. We compared three test inversions for each quantity at each target depth. At first,
we used the JSOC setup to reproduce the JSOC results. Subsequently, we used the extended pipeline
to improve these results by incorporating more independent travel-time measurements but keeping
the JSOC-indicated localisation in the Sun. Finally, we inverted for flow components and sound-speed
perturbations using a localisation kernel with properties advertised in the JSOC metadata. We
successfully reproduced the horizontal flow components. The sound-speed perturbations are strongly
affected by the high level of the cross-talk in JSOC products. This leads to larger amplitudes in
the inversions for the sound-speed perturbations. Different results were obtained when a target
function localised around the target depth was used. This is a consequence of non-localised JSOC
averaging kernels. We add that our methodology also allows inversion for the vertical flow.
