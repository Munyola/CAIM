We investigate the nature of the double color-magnitude sequence observed in the Gaia DR2 HR diagram
of stars with high transverse velocities. The stars in the reddest-color sequence are likely dominated
by the dynamically-hot tail of the thick disk population. Information from Nissen & Schuster (2010)
and from the APOGEE survey suggests that stars in the blue-color sequence have elemental abundance
patterns that can be explained by this population having a relatively low star-formation efficiency
during its formation. In dynamical and orbital spaces, such as the ``Toomre diagram', the two sequences
show a significant overlap, but with a tendency for stars on the blue-color sequence to dominate
regions with no or retrograde rotation and high total orbital energy. In the plane defined by the
maximal vertical excursion of the orbits versus their apocenters, stars of both sequences redistribute
into discrete wedges. We conclude that stars which are typically assigned to the halo in the solar
vicinity, are actually both accreted stars lying along the blue sequence in the HR diagram, and the
low velocity tail of the old Galactic disk, possibly dynamically heated by past accretion events.
Our results imply that a halo population formed in situ and responsible for the early chemical enrichment
prior to the formation of the thick disk is yet to be robustly identified, and that what has been defined
as the stars of the in situ stellar halo of the Galaxy may be in fact fossil records of its last significant
merger.
