We study the population of ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs) in a set of eight nearby ($z <$ 0.035) galaxy
clusters, from the Kapteyn IAC WEAVE INT Clusters Survey ($\texttt{KIWICS}$). We report the discovery
of 442 UDG candidates in our eight field of views, with 247 of these galaxies lying at projected distances
< 1 R$_{200}$ from their host cluster. With the aim of testing theories about their formation, we
study the scaling relations of UDGs comparing with different types of galaxies, finding that in
the full parameter space they behave as dwarf galaxies and their colors do not seem to correlate with
their effective radii. To investigate the influence of the environment on the evolution of UDGs
we analyze their structural properties as functions of the projected clustercentric distance
and the mass of their host cluster. We find no systematic trends for the stellar mass nor effective
radius as function of the projected distance. However, the fraction of blue UDGs seems to be lower
towards the center of clusters, and UDGs in the inner and outer regions of clusters have different
S\'ersic index and axis ratio distributions. Specifically, the axis ratio distributions of the
outer and inner UDGs resemble the axis ratio distributions of, respectively, late-type dwarfs
and dwarf ellipticals in the Fornax Cluster suggesting an environmentally-driven evolution and
another link between UDGs and dwarf galaxies. In general our results suggest strong similarities
between UDGs and smaller dwarf galaxies in their structural parameters and their transformation
within clusters.
