The narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxy (NLS1) Mrk 335 has been continuously monitored with Swift since
May 2007 when it fell into a long-lasting, X-ray low-flux interval. Results from the nearly 11 years
of monitoring are presented here. Structure functions are used to measure the UV-optical and X-ray
power spectra. The X-ray structure function measured between 10-100 days is consistent with the
flat, low-frequency part of the power spectrum measured previously in Mrk 335. The UV-optical structure
functions of Mrk 335 are comparable with those of other Seyfert 1 galaxies and of Mrk 335 itself when
it was in a normal bright state. There is no indication that the current X-ray low-flux state is attributed
to changes in the accretion disc structure of Mrk 335. The characteristic timescales measured in
the structure functions can be attributed to thermal (for the UV) and dynamic (for the optical) timescales
in a standard accretion disc. The high-quality UVW2 (~1800 A in the source frame) structure function
appears to have two breaks and two different slopes between 10-160 days. Correlations between the
X-ray and other bands are not highly significant when considering the entire 11-year light curves,
but more significant behaviour is present when considering segments of the light curves. A correlation
between the X-ray and UVW2 in 2014 (Year-8) may be predominately caused by an giant X-ray flare that
was interpreted as jet-like emission. In 2008 (Year-2), possible lags between the UVW2 emission
and other UV-optical waveband may be consistent with reprocessing of X-ray or UV emission in the
accretion disc.
