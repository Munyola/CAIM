We present fully three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic jet launching simulations of a jet source
orbiting in a binary system. We consider a time-dependent binary gravitational potential, thus
all tidal forces that are experienced in the non-inertial frame of the jet-launching primary. We
investigate systems with different binary separation, different mass ratio, and different inclination
between the disk plane and the orbital plane. The simulations run over a substantial fraction of
the binary orbital period. All simulations show similar local and global non-axisymmetric effects
such as local instabilities in the disk and the jet, or global features such as disk spiral arms and
warps, or a global re-alignment of the inflow-outflow structure. The disk accretion rate is higher
than for axisymmetric simulations, most probably due to the enhanced angular momentum transport
by spiral waves. The disk outflow leaves the Roche lobe of the primary and becomes disturbed by tidal
effects. While a disk-orbit inclination of $10\degr$ still allows for a persistent outflow, an
inclination of $30\degr$ does not, suggesting a critical angle in between. For moderate inclination
we find indication for jet precession such that the jet axis starts to follow a circular pattern with
an opening cone of $\simeq 8\degr$. Simulations with different mass ratio indicate a change of time
scales for the tidal forces to affect the disk-jet system. A large mass ratio (a massive secondary)
leads to stronger spiral arms, a higher (average) accretion and a more pronounced jet-counter jet
asymmetry.
