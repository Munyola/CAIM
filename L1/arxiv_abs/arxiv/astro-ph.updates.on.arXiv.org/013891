The most metal-poor, high redshift damped Lyman-alpha systems (DLAs) provide a window to study
some of the first few generations of stars. In this paper, we present a novel model to investigate
the chemical enrichment of the near-pristine DLA population. This model accounts for the mass distribution
of the enriching stellar population, the typical explosion energy of their supernovae, and the
average number of stars that contribute to the enrichment of these DLAs. We conduct a maximum likelihood
analysis of these model parameters using the observed relative element abundances ([C/O], [Si/O],
and [Fe/O]) of the 11 most metal-poor DLAs currently known. We find that the mass distribution of
the stars that have enriched this sample of metal-poor DLAs can be well-described by a Salpeter-like
IMF slope at M > 10 M_sun and that a typical metal-poor DLA has been enriched by < 72 massive stars (95%
confidence), with masses < 40 M_sun. The inferred typical explosion energy (E_exp = 1.8^{+0.3}_{-0.2}x10^51
erg) is somewhat lower than that found by recent works that model the enrichment of metal-poor halo
stars. These constraints suggest that some of the metal-poor DLAs in our sample may have been enriched
by Population II stars. Using our enrichment model, we also infer some of the typical physical properties
of the most metal-poor DLAs. We estimate that the total stellar mass content is log10(M_*/M_sun)
= 3.5^{+0.3}_{-0.4} and the total gas mass is log10(M_gas/M_sun) = 7.0^{+0.3}_{-0.4} for systems
with a relative oxygen abundance [O/H] ~ -3.0.
