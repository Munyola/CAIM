Context. SS 433 is historically a well-known microquasar in the Galaxy that has been deeply studied
during the four decades elapsed since its discovery. However, observations at very high radio frequencies
with good angular resolution are still very scarce in the literature. The present paper tries to
partially fill this gap using archival data of the source obtained with the Atacama Large Millimeter
Array (ALMA). Aims. We aim to study the SS 433 jet properties at radio frequencies corresponding
to millimetre wavelengths where the synchrotron emitting particles are expected to lose their
energy much faster than at lower frequencies of centimetre wavelengths. Results. A resolved view
of the SS 433 radio core and jets is presented. In addition to spectral index and magnetic field measurements,
we are able to estimate the age of the oldest visible ejecta still radiating significantly at millimetre
wavelengths. By combining our findings with those of previous authors at lower frequencies, we
confirm that the energy loss of the radiating electrons is dominated by adiabatic expansion instead
of synchrotron radiative losses. In addition, we find suggestive evidence for the previously proposed
period of slowed expansion within the first months of the ejecta flow, needed to simultaneously
match the radiative lifetime observed in the centimetre domain. Our results argue for the need for
future coordinated millimetre and centimetre interferometric observations with good time sampling
throughout the SS 433 precessional cycle to better understand energetic processes in stellar relativistic
jets.
