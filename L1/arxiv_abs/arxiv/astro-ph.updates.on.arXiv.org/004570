Short duration GRBs (SGRBs) are widely believed to originate from neutron star mergers and the merger
rate can be estimated via the observed GRB rate with the correction of the outflow half-opening angles.
The jet breaks in the afterglow lightcurves of SGRBs, rarely detected so far, are crucial for such
an approach. In this work we report the detection of jet decline behaviors in the late optical afterglows
of GRB 150424A and GRB 160821B and find $\theta_{\rm j}\sim 0.1$ rad. Together with the four events
(GRB 051221A, GRB 090426A, GRB 111020A and GRB 130603B) reported before 2015 and the other three
"identified" recently (GRB 050709, GRB 060614 and GRB 140903A), we thus have a sample consisting
of nine SGRBs (including one long-short event) with a reasonably estimated $\theta_{\rm j}$. In
particular, three events in the sample are local (i.e., their redshifts are $\leq 0.2$), with which
we can conservatively estimate the local neutron star merger rate density to be $\sim 130~{\rm Gpc^{-3}~yr^{-1}}$,
and the real value may be $\sim 10$ times higher, suggesting a very promising detection prospect
of advanced LIGO/Virgo in their full sensitivity runs. Inspired by the typical $\theta_{\rm j}\sim
0.1$ rad found in the current sample, we further investigate whether the off-beam GRBs (in the uniform
jet model) or the off-axis events (in the structured jet model) can significantly enhance the GRB/GW
association or not. For the former the enhancement is at most moderate, while for the latter the enhancement
can be much greater and a high association probability of $\sim 10\%$ is possible.
