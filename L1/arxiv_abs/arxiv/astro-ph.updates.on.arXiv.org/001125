The HeII (1640 A) line and the resonance doublet of NV (UV1) provide a good diagnostic tool to constrain
the excitation mechanism of hot (Te>40,000K) atmospheric/magnetospheric plasmas in T Tauri
stars (TTSs). Making use of the data available in the Hubble Space Telescope Archive, this work shows
that there are, at least, two distinct physical components contributing to the radiation in these
tracers: the accretion flow sliding on the magnetosphere and the atmosphere. The NV profiles are
symmetric and at rest with respect to the star in most sources. The velocity dispersion of the profile
increases from non-accreting (40 km/s) to accreting (120 km/s) TTSs suggesting that the macroturbulence
in the line formation region decreases as the stars approach the main sequence. Evidence of the NV
line being formed in a hot solar-like wind has been found in RW Aur, HN Tau and AA Tau. The HeII profile
has a strong narrow component that dominates the line flux; the dispersion of this component ranges
from 20 to 60 km/s. The sources of this radiation is uncertain. Current data suggest that both accretion
shocks and atmospheric emission might contribute to the line flux. In some sources de HeII line shows
a broad and rewards shifted emission component often accompanied by semiforbidden OIII emission
that has a critical density of about 3.4e10 cm-3. In spite of the different origins (inferred from
the kinematics of the line formation region), NV and HeII fluxes are strongly correlated, with the
possible exception of the heaviest accretors.
