It has been proposed that some meteorites, CB and CH chondrites, contain material formed as a result
of a protoplanetary collision during accretion. Their melt droplets (chondrules) and FeNi metal
are proposed to have formed by evaporation and condensation in the resulting impact plume. We observe
that the SO (skeletal olivine) chondrules in CBb chondrites have a blebby texture and an enrichment
in refractory elements not found in normal chondrules. Since the texture requires complete melting,
their maximum liquidus temperature 1928 K represents a minimum temperature for the putative plume.
Dynamic crystallization experiments show that the SO texture can be created only by brief reheating
episodes during crystallization giving partial dissolution of olivine. The ejecta plume formed
in a smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) simulation (Asphaug et al., 2011) served as the basis
for 3D modeling with the adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) code FLASH4.3. Tracer particles that move
with the fluid cells are used to measure the in situ cooling rates. Their cooling rates are ~10,000K/hr
briefly at peak temperature and, in the densest regions of the plume, ~100 K/hr for 1400-1600 K. A
small fraction of cells is seen to be heating at any one time, with heating spikes explained by compression
of parcels of gas in a heterogeneous patchy plume. These temperature fluctuations are comparable
to those required in crystallization experiments. For the first time, we find agreement between
experiment and models that supports the plume model specifically for the formation of CBb chondrules.
