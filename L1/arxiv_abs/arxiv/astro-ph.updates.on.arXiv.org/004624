Period-luminosity (PL) sequences of long period variables (LPVs) are commonly interpreted as
different pulsation modes, but there is disagreement on the modal assignment. Here, we re-examine
the observed PL sequences in the Large Magellanic Cloud, including the sequence of long secondary
periods (LSPs), and their associated pulsation modes. Firstly, we theoretically model the sequences
using linear, radial, non-adiabatic pulsation models and a population synthesis model of the LMC
red giants. Then, we use a semi-empirical approach to assign modes to the pulsation sequences by
exploiting observed multi-mode pulsators. As a result of the combined approaches, we consistently
find that sequences B and C$^{\prime}$ both correspond to first overtone pulsation, although there
are some fundamental mode pulsators at low luminosities on both sequences. The masses of these fundamental
mode pulsators are larger at a given luminosity than the mass of the first overtone pulsators. These
two sequences B and C$^{\prime}$ are separated by a small period interval in which large amplitude
pulsation in a long secondary period (sequence D variability) occurs, meaning that the first overtone
pulsation is not seen as the primary mode of pulsation. Observationally, this leads to the splitting
of the first overtone pulsation sequence into the two observed sequences B and C$^{\prime}$. Our
two independent examinations also show that sequences A$^{\prime}$, A and C correspond to third
overtone, second overtone and fundamental mode pulsation, respectively.
