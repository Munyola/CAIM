We report on a plan to construct a 50-m-class single-dish telescope, the Large Submillimeter Telescope
(LST). The conceptual design and key science behind the LST are presented, together with its tentative
specifications. This telescope is optimized for wide-area imaging and spectroscopic surveys
in the 70--420 GHz frequency range, which spans the main atmospheric windows at millimeter and submillimeter
wavelengths for good observation sites such as the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array
(ALMA) site in Chile. We also target observations at higher frequencies of up to 1 THz, using an inner
high-precision surface. Active surface control is required in order to correct gravitational
and thermal deformations of the surface, and will be useful for correction of the wind-load deformation.
The LST will facilitate new discovery spaces such as wide-field imaging with both continuum and
spectral lines, along with new developments for time-domain science. Through exploitation of
its synergy with ALMA and other telescopes, the LST will contribute to research on a wide range of
topics in the fields of astronomy and astrophysics, e.g., astrochemistry, star formation in our
Galaxy and galaxies, the evolution of galaxy clusters via the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect, the search
for transients such as $\gamma$-ray burst reverse shocks produced during the epoch of re-ionization,
electromagnetic follow up of detected gravitational wave sources, and examination of general
relativity in the vicinity of super massive black holes via submillimeter very-long-baseline
interferometry.
