The detections of gravitational waves produced in mergers of binary black holes (BH) and neutron
stars (NS) by LIGO/Virgo have stimulated interest in the origin of the progenitor binaries. Dense
stellar systems - globular and nuclear star clusters - are natural sites of compact object binary
formation and evolution towards merger. Here we explore a new channel for the production of binary
mergers in clusters, in which the tidal field of the cluster secularly drives the binary to high eccentricity
(even in the absence of a central massive black hole) until gravitational wave emission becomes
important. We employ the recently developed secular theory of cluster tide-driven binary evolution
to compute present day merger rates for BH-BH, NS-BH and NS-NS binaries, varying cluster potential
and central concentration of the binary population (but ignoring cluster evolution and stellar
flybys for now). Unlike other mechanisms, this new dynamical channel can produce a significant
number of mergers out to cluster-centric distances of several pc. For NS-NS binaries we find merger
rates in the range $0.01-0.07$ Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$ from globular clusters and $0.1-0.2$ Gpc$^{-3}$
yr$^{-1}$ from cusped nuclear clusters. For NS-BH and BH-BH binaries we find small merger rates
from globular clusters, but a rate of $0.1 - 0.2$ Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$ from cusped nuclear clusters,
contributing to the observed LIGO/Virgo rate at the level of several per cent. Therefore, cluster
tide-driven mergers constitute a new channel that can be further explored with current and future
gravitational wave detectors.
