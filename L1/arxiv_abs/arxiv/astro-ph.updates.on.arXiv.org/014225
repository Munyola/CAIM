In the innermost regions of protoplanerary discs, the solid-to-gas ratio can be increased considerably
by a number of processes, including photoevaporative and particle drift. MHD disc models also suggest
the existence of a dead-zone at $R\lesssim 10$ AU, where the regions close to the midplane remain
laminar. In this context, we use two-fluid hydrodynamical simulations to study the interaction
between a low-mass planet ($\sim 1.7 \;{\rm M_\oplus}$) on a fixed orbit and an inviscid pebble-rich
disc with solid-to-gas ratio $\epsilon\ge 0.5$. For pebbles with Stokes numbers St=0.1, 0.5, multiple
dusty vortices are formed through the Rossby Wave Instability at the planet separatrix. Effects
due to gas drag then lead to a strong enhancement in the solid-to-gas ratio, which can increase by
a factor of $\sim 10^3$ for marginally coupled particles with St=0.5. As in streaming instabilities,
pebble clumps reorganize into filaments that may plausibly collapse to form planetesimals. When
the planet is allowed to migrate in a MMSN disc, the vortex instability is delayed due to migration
but sets in once inward migration stops due a strong positive pebble torque. Again, particle filaments
evolving in a gap are formed in the disc while the planet undergoes an episode of outward migration.
Our results suggest that vortex instabilities triggered by low-mass planets could play an important
role in forming planetesimals in pebble-rich, inviscid discs, and may significantly modify the
migration of low-mass planets. They also imply that planetary dust gaps may not necessarily contain
planets if these migrated away.
