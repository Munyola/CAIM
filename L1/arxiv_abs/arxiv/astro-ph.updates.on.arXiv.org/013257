Since the Archean, N2 has been a major atmospheric constituent in Earth's atmosphere. Nitrogen
is an essential element in the building blocks of life, therefore the geobiological nitrogen cycle
is a fundamental factor in the long term evolution of both Earth and Earth-like exoplanets. We discuss
the development of the Earth's N2 atmosphere since the planet's formation and its relation with
the geobiological cycle. Then we suggest atmospheric evolution scenarios and their possible interaction
with life forms: firstly, for a stagnant-lid anoxic world, secondly for a tectonically active anoxic
world, and thirdly for an oxidized tectonically active world. Furthermore, we discuss a possible
demise of present Earth's biosphere and its effects on the atmosphere. Since life forms are the most
efficient means for recycling deposited nitrogen back into the atmosphere nowadays, they sustain
its surface partial pressure at high levels. Also, the simultaneous presence of significant N2
and O2 is chemically incompatible in an atmosphere over geological timescales. Thus, we argue that
an N2-dominated atmosphere in combination with O2 on Earth-like planets within circumstellar
habitable zones can be considered as a geo-biosignature. Terrestrial planets with such atmospheres
will have an operating tectonic regime connected with an aerobe biosphere, whereas other scenarios
in most cases end up with a CO2-dominated atmosphere. We conclude with implications for the search
for life on Earth-like exoplanets inside the habitable zones of M to K-stars.
