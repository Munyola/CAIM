In a recent paper, we determined the measurement accuracy of physical parameters for eccentric,
precessing, non-spinning, inspiraling, stellar-mass black hole - black hole (BH-BH) binaries
for the upcoming second-generation LIGO/VIRGO/KAGRA detector network at design sensitivity
using the Fisher matrix method. Here we extend that study to a wide range of binary masses including
neutron star - neutron star (NS-NS), NS-BH, and BH-BH binaries with BH masses up to $110 \, M_{\odot}$.
The measurement error of eccentricity $e_{10 \,\rm Hz}$ at a gravitational-wave (GW) frequency
of $10 \, {\rm Hz}$ is in the range $(10^{-4}-10^{-3}) \times (D_L/ 100\,\rm Mpc)$ for NS-NS, NS-BH,
and BH-BH binaries at a luminosity distance of $D_L$ if $e_{10 \,\rm Hz} \gtrsim 0.1 $. For events
with masses and distances similar to the detected 10 GW transients, we show that nonzero orbital
eccentricities may be detected if $0.081 \lesssim e_{10 \,\rm Hz}$. Consequently, the LIGO/VIRGO/KAGRA
detector network at design sensitivity will have the capability to distinguish between eccentric
waveforms and circular waveforms. In comparison to circular inspirals, we find that the chirp mass
measurement precision can improve by up to a factor of $\sim 20$ and $\sim 50-100$ for NS-NS and NS-BH
binaries with BH companion masses $\lesssim 40 \, M_{\odot}$, respectively. The identification
of eccentric sources may give information on their astrophysical origin; it would indicate merging
binaries in triple or higher multiplicity systems or dynamically formed binaries in dense stellar
systems such as globular clusters or galactic nuclei.
