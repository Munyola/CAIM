We revisit the galaxy cluster RXC J1504-0248, a remarkable example of a structure with a strong cool
core in a near redshift ($z = 0.216$). We performed a combined analysis using photometric and spectroscopic
data obtained at Gemini South Telescope. We estimated the cluster mass through gravitational lensing,
obtaining $M_{200} = 5.3\pm0.4 \times 10^{14}$ $h_{70}^{-1}$ M$_\odot$ within $R_{200} = 1.56
\pm 0.04$ $h^{-1}_{70}$ Mpc, in agreement with a virial mass estimate. This cluster presents a prominent
filamentary structure associated to its BCG, located mainly along its major axis and aligned with
the X-ray emission. A combined study of three emission line diagnostic diagrams has shown that the
filament emission falls in the so-called transition region of these diagrams. Consequently, several
ionizing sources should be playing an meaningful role. We have argued that old stars, often invoked
to explain LINER emission, should not be the major source of ionization. We have noticed that most
of the filamentary emission has line ratios consistent with the shock excitation limits obtained
from shock models. We also found that line fluxes are related to gas velocities (here estimated from
line widths) by power-laws with slopes in the range expected from shock models. These models also
show, however, that only ~10% of H$\alpha$ luminosity can be explained by shocks. We conclude that
shocks probably associated to the cooling of the intracluster gas in a filamentary structure may
indeed be contributing to the filament nebular emission, but can not be the major source of ionizing
photons.
