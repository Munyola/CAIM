The Star Watch extreme-precision astrometry mission (0.1 - 1.0 uas) builds on technology developed,
and validated, during the SIM (Space Interferometry Mission) project. The sole science instrument
is an optical interferometer with 50-cm collecting apertures, separated by a 6-meter baseline.
The heart of this detector is the Astrometric Beam Combiner (ABC). This is flight-quality hardware
that underwent testing at high levels of integration, retiring most technical risk (achieving
TRL-6) after 10 years and $600 million of investment. The ABC is in storage at JPL, ready to complete
testing, followed by integration with the mission support structure. Star Watch incorporates
advances in technology since the end of the SIM project. These include smaller, lighter beam launchers
and corner cubes for laser metrology; attitude-control micro-thrusters, allowing deletion of
reaction wheels; and advanced fringe detectors. The technology pioneered by Star Watch, the first
long-baseline Michelson interferometer in space, represents an important investment in the future
of space astronomy. NASA's proposed Vision Missions (Exo-Earth, Black Hole and Cosmic Dawn Mappers)
require the use of precision interferometers. No other Astrophysics Probe concept comes close
to this level of technical readiness. There are no analogs to Star Watch. It will provide access,
for the first time, to the realm of temperate Terrestrial worlds circling nearby sun-like stars,
measuring true masses and orbits. This can be achieved by the close of the 2020s.
