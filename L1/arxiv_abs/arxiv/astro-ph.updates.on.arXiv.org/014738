Using APEX-1 and APEX-2 observations, we have detected and studied the rotational lines of the HC$_3$N
molecule (cyanoacetylene) in the powerful outflow/hot molecular core G331.512-0.103. We identified
thirty-one rotational lines at $J$ levels between 24 and 39; seventeen of them in the ground vibrational
state $v$=0 (9 lines corresponding to the main C isotopologue and 8 lines corresponding to the $^{13}$C
isotopologues), and fourteen in the lowest vibrationally excited state $v_7$=1. Using LTE-based
population diagrams for the beam-diluted $v$=0 transitions, we determined $T_{\rm exc}$=85$\pm$4
K and $N$(HC$_3$N)=(6.9$\pm$0.8)$\times$10$^{14}$ cm$^{-2}$, while for the beam-diluted $v_7$=1
transitions we obtained $T_{\rm exc}$=89$\pm$10 K and $N$(HC$_3$N)=2$\pm$1$\times$10$^{15}$
cm$^{-2}$. Non-LTE calculations using H$_2$ collision rates indicate that the HC$_3$N emission
is in good agreement with LTE-based results. From the non-LTE method we estimated $T_{\rm kin}$
$\simeq$90~K, $n$(H$_2$)$\simeq$2$\times$10$^7$~cm$^{-3}$ for a central core of 6 arcsec in
size. A vibrational temperature in the range from 130~K to 145~K was also determined, values which
are very likely lower limits. Our results suggest that rotational transitions are thermalized,
while IR radiative pumping processes are probably more efficient than collisions in exciting the
molecule to the vibrationally excited state $v_7$=1. Abundance ratios derived under LTE conditions
for the $^{13}$C isotopologues suggest that the main formation pathway of HC$_3$N is ${\rm C}_2{\rm
H}_2 + {\rm CN} \rightarrow {\rm HC}_3{\rm N} + {\rm H}$.
