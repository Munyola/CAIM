Einstein's gravity has undergone extensive tests in the weak field gravitational limit, with results
in agreement with theoretical predictions. There exist theories beyond general relativity (GR)
which modify gravity in the strong field regime but agree with GR in the weak field. Astrophysical
black holes are believed to be described by the Kerr metric and serve as suitable candidates to test
strong gravity with electromagnetic radiation. We perform such a test by fitting one Suzaku dataset
of the narrow-line Seyfert 1 (NLS1) galaxy Mrk 335 with X-ray reflection spectroscopy, using the
Johannsen metric to model the black hole spacetime and test for deviations from Kerr. We find the
data is best modeled with a hybrid model that includes both partial covering absorption and a reflection
component. This is the first time such a model has been proposed for a high-flux (low reflection)
Mrk 335 dataset. We constrain the Johannsen deformation parameter $\alpha_{13}$ to $-1.5<\alpha_{13}<0.6$
with spin parameter $a_{*}>0.8$, and the $\alpha_{22}$ parameter to $-0.4<\alpha_{22}<2.1$
with $a_{*}>0.7$, both at the 99% confidence level. Although additional solutions at large deviations
from the Kerr metric show statistical similarity with the ones above, further analysis suggests
these solutions may be manifestations of uncertainties beyond our control and do not represent
the data. Hence, our results are in agreement with the idea that the supermassive compact object
at the center of Mrk 335 is described by the Kerr metric.
