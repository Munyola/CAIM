AM CVn-type systems are ultra-compact, hydrogen-deficient accreting binaries with degenerate
or semi-degenerate donors. The evolutionary history of these systems can be explored by constraining
the properties of their donor stars. We present high-speed photometry of Gaia14aae, an AM CVn with
a binary period of 49.7 minutes and the first AM CVn in which the central white dwarf is fully eclipsed
by the donor star. Modelling of the lightcurves of this system allows for the most precise measurement
to date of the donor mass of an AM CVn, and relies only on geometric and well-tested physical assumptions.
We find a mass ratio $q = M_2/M_1 = 0.0287 \pm 0.0020$ and masses $M_1 = 0.87 \pm 0.02 M_\odot$ and $M_2
= 0.0250 \pm 0.0013 M_\odot$. We compare these properties to the three proposed channels for AM CVn
formation. Our measured donor mass and radius do not fit with the contraction that is predicted for
AM CVn donors descended from white dwarfs or helium stars at long orbital periods. The donor properties
we measure fall in a region of parameter space in which systems evolved from hydrogen-dominated
cataclysmic variables are expected, but such systems should show spectroscopic hydrogen, which
is not seen in Gaia14aae. The evolutionary history of this system is therefore not clear. We consider
a helium-burning star or an evolved cataclysmic variable to be the most likely progenitors, but
both models require additional processes and/or fine-tuning to fit the data. Additionally, we
calculate an updated ephemeris which corrects for an anomalous time measurement in the previously
published ephemeris.
