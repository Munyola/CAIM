Neutral gas is commonly believed to dominate over stars in the outskirts of galaxies, and investigations
of the disk-halo interface are generally considered to be in the domain of radio astronomy. This
may simply be a consequence of the fact that deep HI observations typically probe to a lower mass surface
density than visible wavelength data. This paper presents low surface brightness optimized visible
wavelength observations of the extreme outskirts of the nearby spiral galaxy NGC 2841. We report
the discovery of an enormous low-surface brightness stellar disk in this object. When azimuthally
averaged, the stellar disk can be traced out to a radius of $\sim$70 kpc (5 $R_{25}$ or 23 inner disk
scale lengths). The structure in the stellar disk traces the morphology of HI emission and extended
UV emission. Contrary to expectations, the stellar mass surface density does not fall below that
of the gas mass surface density at any radius. In fact, at all radii greater than $\sim$20 kpc, the
ratio of the stellar to gas mass surface density is a constant 3:1. Beyond $\sim$30 kpc, the low surface
brightness stellar disk begins to warp, which may be an indication of a physical connection between
the outskirts of the galaxy and infall from the circumgalactic medium. A combination of stellar
migration, accretion and in-situ star formation might be responsible for building up the outer
stellar disk, but whatever mechanisms formed the outer disk must also explain the constant ratio
between stellar and gas mass in the outskirts of this galaxy.
