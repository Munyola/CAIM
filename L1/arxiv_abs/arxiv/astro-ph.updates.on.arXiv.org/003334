We forecast dark energy constraints that could be obtained from a new large sample of Type Ia supernovae
where those at high redshift are acquired with the Euclid space mission. We simulate a three-prong
SN survey: a z<0.35 nearby sample (8000 SNe), a 0.2<z<0.95 intermediate sample (8800
SNe), and a 0.75<z<1.55 high-z sample (1700 SNe). The nearby and intermediate surveys are
assumed to be conducted from the ground, while the high-z is a joint ground- and space-based survey.
This latter survey, the "Dark Energy Supernova Infra-Red Experiment" (DESIRE), is designed to
fit within 6 months of Euclid observing time, with a dedicated observing program. We simulate the
SN events as they would be observed in rolling-search mode by the various instruments, and derive
the quality of expected cosmological constraints. We account for known systematic uncertainties,
in particular calibration uncertainties including their contribution through the training of
the supernova model used to fit the supernovae light curves. Using conservative assumptions and
a 1-D geometric Planck prior, we find that the ensemble of surveys would yield competitive constraints:
a constant equation of state parameter can be constrained to sigma(w)=0.022, and a Dark Energy Task
Force figure of merit of 203 is found for a two-parameter equation of state. Our simulations thus
indicate that Euclid can bring a significant contribution to a purely geometrical cosmology constraint
by extending a high-quality SN Hubble diagram to z~1.5. We also present other science topics enabled
by the DESIRE Euclid observations
