We present a methodology for the determination of empirical masses of single stars through the combination
of three direct observables with Gaia and TESS: (i) the surface gravity via granulation-driven
variations in the TESS light curve, (ii) the bolometric flux at Earth via the broadband spectral
energy distribution, and (iii) the distance via the Gaia parallax. We demonstrate the method using
675 Kepler stars for which these measures are available in the literature, and show that the stellar
masses can be measured with this method to a precision of $\sim$25%, limited by the surface-gravity
precision of the granulation "flicker" method ($\sim$0.1 dex) and by the parallax uncertainties
($\sim$10% for the Kepler sample). We explore the impact of expected improvements in the surface
gravity determinations---through the application of granulation background fitting and the
use of recently published granulation-metallicity relations---and improvements in the parallaxes
with the arrival of the Gaia second data release. We show that the application of this methodology
to stars that will be observed by TESS should yield radii good to a few percent and masses good to $\approx$10%.
Importantly, the method does not require the presence of an orbiting, eclipsing, or transiting
body, nor does it require spatial resolution of the stellar surface. Thus we can anticipate the determination
of fundamental, accurate stellar radii and masses for millions of bright single stars---across
the entire sky and spanning the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram---including those that will ultimately
be found to host planets.
