We report a possibility that the high-mass star located in the HII region RCW 34 was formed by a triggering
induced by a collision of molecular clouds. Molecular gas distributions of the $^{12}$CO and $^{13}$CO
$J=$2-1, and $^{12}$CO $J=$3-2 lines toward RCW 34 were measured by using the NANTEN2 and ASTE telescopes.
We found two clouds with the velocity ranges of 0-10 km s$^{-1}$ and 10-14 km s$^{-1}$. Whereas the
former cloud as massive as ~2.7 x 10$^{4}$ Msun has a morphology similar to the ring-like structure
observed in the infrared wavelengths, the latter cloud with the mass of ~10$^{3}$ Msun, which has
not been recognized by previous observations, distributes just likely to cover the bubble enclosed
by the other cloud. The high-mass star with the spectral types of O8.5V is located near the boundary
of the two clouds. The line intensity ratio of $^{12}$CO $J=$3-2 / $J=$2-1 yields high values (~1.5)
in the neighborhood of the high-mass star, suggesting that these clouds are associated with the
massive star. We also confirmed that the obtained position-velocity diagram shows a similar distribution
with that derived by a numerical simulation of the supersonic collision of two clouds. Using the
relative velocity between the two clouds (~5 km s$^{-1}$), the collisional time scale is estimated
to be $\sim$0.2 Myr with the assumption of the distance of 2.5 kpc. These results suggest that the
high-mass star in RCW 34 was formed rapidly within a time scale of ~0.2 Myr via a triggering of cloud-cloud
collision.
