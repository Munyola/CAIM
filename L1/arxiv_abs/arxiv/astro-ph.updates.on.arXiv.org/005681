There is a large change in surface rotation rates of sun-like stars on the pre-main sequence and early
main sequence. Since these stars have dynamo driven magnetic fields, this implies a strong evolution
of their magnetic properties over this time period. The spin-down of these stars is controlled by
interactions between stellar winds and magnetic fields, thus magnetic evolution in turn plays
an important role in rotational evolution. We present here the second part of a study investigating
the evolution of large-scale surface magnetic fields in this critical time period. We observed
stars in open clusters and stellar associations with known ages between 120 and 650 Myr, and used
spectropolarimetry and Zeeman Doppler Imaging to characterize their large-scale magnetic field
strength and geometry. We report 15 stars with magnetic detections here. These stars have masses
from 0.8 to 0.95 Msun, rotation periods from 0.326 to 10.6 days, and we find large-scale magnetic
field strengths from 8.5 to 195 G with a wide range of geometries. We find a clear trend towards decreasing
magnetic field strength with age, and a power-law decrease in magnetic field strength with Rossby
number. There is some tentative evidence for saturation of the large-scale magnetic field strength
at Rossby numbers below 0.1, although the saturation point is not yet well defined. Comparing to
younger classical T Tauri stars, we support the hypothesis that differences in internal structure
produce large differences in observed magnetic fields, however for weak lined T Tauri stars this
is less clear.
