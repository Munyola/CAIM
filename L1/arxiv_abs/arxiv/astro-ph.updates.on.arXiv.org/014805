Asteroid impacts pose a major threat to humanity. The age of the dinosaur was abruptly ended by a 10-km-diameter
asteroid. Currently, a nuclear device is the only means of deflecting large potentially hazardous
asteroids (PHAs) away from an Earth-impacting trajectory. The enhanced kinetic impactor (EKI)
scheme is proposed to deflect large-scale PHAs via maneuvering space rocks. First, an unmanned
spacecraft is launched to rendezvous with a near-Earth asteroid (NEA) that passes close to the target
PHA. Then, hundreds of tons of rocks are collected from the NEA as an enhanced impactor. The NEA can
also be captured as an enhanced impactor if the NEA is very small. Finally, the enhanced impactor
is maneuvered to impact the PHA at a high speed, resulting in a significant deflection of the PHA.
For example, to deflect Apophis, as much as 200 t of rocks could be collected from an NEA as an enhanced
impactor based on existing engineering capabilities. The EKI could produce a delta-v of 39.3 mm/s
in Apophis, thereby increasing the minimum geocentric distance during the close encounter in 2029
by 1,795.2 km. This mission could be completed in 3.9 years, with a fuel cost of 3.8 t. The momentum
transferred to the PHA by the EKI is two orders of magnitude higher than that of the classic kinetic
impact strategy, and the defense time could be significantly shortened at the same time. With the
existing engineering capabilities, the EKI concept can be used to effectively deflect large-scale
PHAs. We anticipate that our research will be a starting point for efficient planetary defense against
large-scale PHAs.
