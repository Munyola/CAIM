High-contrast imaging and spectroscopy provide unique constraints for exoplanet formation models
as well as for planetary atmosphere models. Instrumentation techniques in this field have greatly
improved over the last two decades, with the development of stellar coronagraphy, in parallel with
specific methods of wavefront sensing and control. Next generation space- and ground-based telescopes
will allow the characterization cold solar-system like planets for the first time and maybe even
in situ detection of bio-markers. However, the growth of primary mirror diameters, necessary for
these detection, comes with an increase of their complexity (segmentation, secondary mirror features).
These discontinuities in the aperture can greatly limit the performance of coronagraphic instruments.
In this context, we introduced a new technique, Active Correction of Aperture Discontinuities
- Optimized Stroke Minimization (ACAD-OSM), to correct for the diffractive effects of aperture
discontinuities in the final image plane of a coronagraph, using deformable mirrors. In this paper,
we present several tools that can be used to optimize the performance of this technique for its application
to future large missions. In particular, we analyze the influence of the deformable setup (size
and separating distance) and found that there is an optimal point for this setup, optimizing the
performance of the instrument in contrast and throughput while minimizing the strokes applied
to the deformable mirrors. These results will help us design future coronagraphic instruments
to obtain the best performance.
