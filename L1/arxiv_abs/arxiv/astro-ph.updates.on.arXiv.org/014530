With the aim of understanding the physical mechanisms of confined flares, we selected 18 confined
flares during 2011-2017, and classified the confined flares into two types based on their different
dynamic properties and magnetic configurations. "Type I" of confined flares are characterized
by slipping reconnection, strong shear, and stable filament. "Type II" flares have nearly no slipping
reconnection, and have a configuration in potential state after the flare. Filament erupts but
is confined by strong strapping field. "Type II" flares could be explained by 2D MHD models while
"type I" flares need 3D MHD models. 7 flares of 18 ($\sim$39 \%) belong to "type I" and 11 ($\sim$61
\%) are "type II" confined flares. The post-flare loops (PFLs) of "type I" flares have a stronger
non-potentiality, however, the PFLs in "type II" flares are weakly sheared. All the "type I" flares
exhibit the ribbon elongations parallel to the polarity inversion line (PIL) at speeds of several
tens of km s$^{-1}$. For "type II" flares, only a small proportion shows the ribbon elongations along
the PIL. We suggest that different magnetic topologies and reconnection scenarios dictate the
distinct properties for the two types of flares. Slipping agnetic reconnections between multiple
magnetic systems result in "type I" flares. For "type II" flares, magnetic reconnections occur
in anti-parallel magnetic fields underlying the erupting filament. Our study shows that "type
I" flares account for more than one third of the overall large confined flares, which should not be
neglected in further studies.
