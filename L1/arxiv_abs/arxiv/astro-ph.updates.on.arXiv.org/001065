We present the results of differential proper-motion analyses of the Egg Nebula (RAFGL 2688, V1610
Cyg) based on the archived two-epoch optical data taken with the Hubble Space Telescope. First,
we determined that the polarization characteristics of the Egg Nebula is influenced by the higher
optical depth of the central regions of the nebula (i.e., the "dustsphere" of about 1000 AU radius),
causing the nebula illuminated in two steps -- the direct starlight is first channeled into bipolar
cavities and then scattered off to the rest of the nebula. We then measured the amount of motion of
local structures and the signature concentric arcs by determining their relative shifts over the
7.25 yr interval. Based on our analysis, which does not rely on the single-scattering assumption,
we concluded that the lobes have been excavated by a linear expansion along the bipolar axis for the
past 400 yr, while the concentric arcs have been generated continuously and moving out radially
at about 10 km/s for the past 5,500 yr, and there appears to be a colatitudinally-increasing trend
in the radial expansion velocity field of the concentric arcs. There exist numerical investigations
into the mass-loss modulation by the central binary system, which predict such a colatitudinally-increasing
expansion velocity field in the spiral-shock trails of the mass-loss ejecta. Therefore, the Egg
Nebula may represent a rare edge-on case of the binary-modulated circumstellar environs, corroborating
the previous theoretical predictions.
