Future CMB experiments will require exquisite control of systematics in order to constrain the
$B$-mode polarisation power spectrum. One class of systematics that requires careful study is
instrumental systematics. The potential impact of such systematics is most readily understood
by considering analysis pipelines based on pair differencing. In this case, any differential gain,
pointing or beam ellipticity between the two detectors in a pair can result in intensity leakage
into the $B$-mode spectrum, which needs to be controlled to a high precision due to the much greater
magnitude of the total intensity signal as compared to the $B$-mode signal. One well known way to
suppress such systematics is through careful design of the scan-strategy, in particular making
use of any capability to rotate the instrument about its pointing (boresight) direction. Here,
we show that the combination of specific choices of such partial boresight rotation angles with
redundancies present in the scan strategy is a powerful approach for suppressing systematic effects.
This mitigation can be performed in analysis in advance of map-making and, in contrast to other approaches
(e.g. deprojection or filtering), results in no signal loss. We demonstrate our approach explicitly
with time ordered data simulations relevant to next-generation ground-based CMB experiments,
using deep and wide scan strategies appropriate for experiments based in Chile. These simulations
show a reduction of multiple orders of magnitude in the spurious $B$-mode signal arising from differential
gain and differential pointing systematics.
