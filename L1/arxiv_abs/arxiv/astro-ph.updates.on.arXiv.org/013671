Energetic feedback from star clusters plays a pivotal role in shaping the dynamical evolution of
giant molecular clouds (GMCs). To study the effects of stellar feedback on the star formation efficiency
of the clouds and the dynamical response of embedded star clusters, we perform a suite of isolated
GMC simulations with star formation and momentum feedback subgrid models using the moving-mesh
hydrodynamics code \textsc{Arepo}. The properties of our simulated GMCs span a wide range of initial
mass, radius, and velocity configurations. We find that the ratio of the final stellar mass to the
total cloud mass, $\epsilon_{\rm int}$, scales strongly with the initial cloud surface density
and momentum feedback strength. This correlation is explained by an analytic model that considers
force balancing between gravity and momentum feedback. For all simulated GMCs, the stellar density
profiles are systematically steeper than that of the gas at the epochs of the peaks of star formation,
suggesting a centrally concentrated stellar distribution. We also find that star clusters are
always in a sub-virial state with a virial parameter $\sim0.6$ prior to gas expulsion. Both the sub-virial
dynamical state and steeper stellar density profiles prevent clusters from dispersal during the
gas removal phase of their evolution. The final cluster bound fraction is a continuously increasing
function of $\epsilon_{\rm int}$. GMCs with star formation efficiency smaller than 0.5 are still
able to form clusters with large bound fractions.
