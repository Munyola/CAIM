We model the projected angular two-point correlation function (2PCF) of obscured and unobscured
quasars selected using the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE), at a median redshift of
$z \sim 1$ using a five-parameter Halo Occupation Distribution (HOD) parameterization, derived
from a cosmological hydrodynamic simulation by Chatterjee et al. The HOD parameterization was
previously used to model the 2PCF of optically selected quasars and X-ray bright active galactic
nuclei (AGN) at $z \sim 1$. The current work shows that a single HOD parameterization can be used to
model the population of different kinds of AGN in dark matter halos suggesting the universality
of the relationship between AGN and their host dark matter halos. Our results show that the median
halo mass of central quasar hosts increases from optically selected ($4.1^{+0.3}_{-0.4} \times
10^{12} \; h^{-1} \; {M_{sun}}$) and infra-red (IR) bright unobscured populations ($6.3^{+6.2}_{-2.3}
\times 10^{12} \; h^{-1} \; {M_{sun}}$) to obscured quasars ($10.0^{+2.6}_{-3.7} \times 10^{12}
\; h^{-1} \; {M_{sun}}$), signifying an increase in the degree of clustering. The projected satellite
fractions also increase from optically bright to obscured quasars and tend to disfavor a simple
`orientation only' theory of active galactic nuclei unification. Our results also show that future
measurements of the small-scale clustering of obscured quasars can constrain current theories
of galaxy evolution where quasars evolve from an IR- bright obscured phase to the optically bright
unobscured phase.
