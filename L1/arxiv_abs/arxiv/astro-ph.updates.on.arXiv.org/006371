We study the topology of the matter density field in two dimensional slices, and consider how we can
use the amplitude $A$ of the genus for cosmological parameter estimation. Using the latest Horizon
Run 4 simulation data, we calculate the genus of the smoothed density field constructed from lightcone
mock galaxy catalogs. Information can be extracted from the amplitude of the genus by considering
both its redshift evolution and magnitude. The constancy of the genus amplitude with redshift can
be used as a standard population, from which we derive constraints on the equation of state of dark
energy $w_{\rm de}$ - by measuring $A$ at $z \sim 0.1$ and $z \sim 1$, we can place an order $\Delta w_{\rm
de} \sim {\cal O}(15\%)$ constraint on $w_{\rm de}$. By comparing $A$ to its Gaussian expectation
value we can potentially derive an additional stringent constraint on the matter density $\Delta
\Omega_{\rm mat} \sim 0.01$. We discuss the primary sources of contamination associated with the
two measurements - redshift space distortion and shot noise. With accurate knowledge of galaxy
bias, we can successfully remove the effect of redshift space distortion, and the combined effect
of shot noise and non-linear gravitational evolution is suppressed by smoothing over suitably
large scales $R_{\rm G} \ge 15 {\rm Mpc}/h$. Without knowledge of the bias, we discuss how joint measurements
of the two and three dimensional genus can be used to constrain the growth factor $\beta = f/b$. The
method can be applied optimally to redshift slices of a galaxy distribution generated using the
drop-off technique.
