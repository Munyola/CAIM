The Be X-ray pulsar (BeXRP) SXP 59 underwent a giant outburst in 2017 with a peak X-ray luminosity
of $1.1\times10^{38}$ erg/s. We report on the X-ray behaviour of SXP 59 with the XMM-Newton and NuSTAR
observations collected at the outburst peak, decay, and the low luminosity states. The pulse profiles
are energy dependent, the pulse fraction increases with the photon energy and saturates at $\sim$
65% above 10 keV. It is difficult to constrain the change in the geometry of emitting region with the
limited data. Nevertheless, because the pulse shape generally has a double-peaked profile at high
luminosity and a single peak profile at low luminosity, we prefer the scenario that the source transited
from the super-critical state to the sub-critical regime. This result would further imply that
the neutron star (NS) in SXP~59 has a typical magnetic field. We confirm that the soft excess revealed
below 2 keV is dominated by a cool thermal component. On the other hand, the NuSTAR spectra can be described
as a combination of the non-thermal component from the accretion column, a hot black-body emission,
and a iron emission line. The temperature of the hot thermal component decreases with time, while
its size remains constant ($R \sim 0.6$ km). The existence of the hot black-body at high luminosity
can not be explained with the present accretion theories for BeXRPs. It means that either more sophisticated
spectral models are required to describe the X-ray spectra of luminous BeXRPs, or there is non-dipole
magnetic field close to the NS surface.
