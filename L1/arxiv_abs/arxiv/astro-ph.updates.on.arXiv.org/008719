We investigate the large-scale structure of Lyman-alpha emission intensity in the Universe at
redshifts z=2-3.5 using cross-correlation techniques. Our Lya emission samples are spectra of
BOSS Luminous Red Galaxies from Data Release 12 with the best fit model galaxies subtracted. We cross-correlate
the residual flux in these spectra with BOSS quasars, and detect a positive signal on scales 1-15
Mpc/h. We identify and remove a source of contamination not previously accounted for, due to the
effects of quasar clustering on cross-fibre light. Corrected, our quasar-Lya emission cross-correlation
is 50 % lower than that seen by Croft et al. for DR10, but still significant. Because only 3% of space
is within 15 Mpc/h of a quasar, the result does not fully explore the global large-scale structure
of Lya emission. To do this, we cross-correlate with the Lya forest. We find no signal in this case.
The 95% upper limit on the global Lya mean surface brightness from Lya emission-Lya forest cross-correlation
is mu < 1.2x10^-22 erg/s/cm^2/A/arcsec^2 This null result rules out the scenario where the observed
quasar-Lya emission cross-correlation is primarily due to the large scale structure of star forming
galaxies, Taken in combination, our results suggest that Lya emitting galaxies contribute, but
quasars dominate within 15 Mpc/h. A simple model for Lya emission from quasars based on hydrodynamic
simulations reproduces both the observed forest-Lya emission and quasar-Lya emission signals.
The latter is also consistent with extrapolation of observations of fluorescent emission from
smaller scales r < 1 Mpc.
