We analyze $Chandra$ observations of the hot atmospheres of 40 early spiral and elliptical galaxies.
Using new temperature, density, cooling time, and mass profiles, we explore relationships between
their hot atmospheres and cold molecular gas. Molecular gas mass correlates with atmospheric gas
mass and density over four decades from central galaxies in clusters to normal giant ellipticals
and early spirals. The mass and density relations follow power laws: $M_{\rm mol} \propto M_{\rm
X}^{1.4\pm0.1}$ and $M_{\rm mol} \propto n_{\rm e}^{1.8\pm0.3}$, respectively, at 10 kpc. The
ratio of molecular gas to atmospheric gas within a 10 kpc radius lies between $3\%$ and $10\%$ for
early-type galaxies and between $3\%$ and $50\%$ for central galaxies in clusters. Molecular gas
mass is correlated with AGN radio mechanical power, with the scaling $M_{\rm mol} \propto P_{\rm
jet}^{0.8\pm0.1}$. Early-type galaxies have detectable levels of molecular gas when their atmospheric
cooling times falls below $\sim Gyr$ at a radius of 10 kpc. A similar trend is found in central cluster
galaxies. We find no relationship between the ratio of the cooling time to free fall time, $t_{\rm
c}/t_{\rm ff}$, and the presence or absence of molecular clouds in early-type galaxies. Molecular
gas related to the hot atmosphere is thus formed internally, from stellar mass loss or cooling from
the atmosphere. The correlation between AGN jet power and molecular gas mass is consistent with
AGN having been fueled by accretion of molecular gas.
