We have analyzed the emission line properties of 6019 Type II AGN at redshifts between 0.4-0.8 with
[OIII] luminosities greater than 3x10^8 Lsun, characteristic of the Type II quasars first identified
in population studies by Zakamska et al (2003). The AGN are drawn from the CMASS sample of galaxies
with stellar masses greater than 10^11 Msun that were studied as part of the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic
Survey (BOSS) and comprise 0.5% of the total population of these galaxies. Individual spectra have
low S/N, so the analysis is carried out on stacked spectra in bins of [OIII] luminosity and estimated
stellar age. The emission line ratios of the stacks are well fit with simple uniform-density photoionization
models with metallicities between solar and twice solar. In the stacks, a number of emission lines
are found to have distinct broad components requiring a double Gaussian rather than a single Gaussian
fit, indicative of outflowing ionized gas. These are: [OIII]4959, [OIII]5007, [OII]3727,3729
and Halpha$. Higher ionization lines such as [NeIII]3869 and [NeV]3345 are detected in the stacks,
but are well fit by single Gaussians. The broad components typically contain a third of the total
line flux and have widths of 600 km/s for the oxygen lines and 900 km/s for Halpha. The fraction of the
flux in the broad component and its width are independent of [OIII] luminosity, stellar age, radio
and mid-IR luminosity. The stellar mass of the galaxy is the only parameter we could identify that
influences the width of the broad line component.
