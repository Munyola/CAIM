In our previous work we confirmed the reliability of the spherically symmetric Schwarzschild orbit-superposition
method to recover the mass and velocity anisotropy profiles of spherical dwarf galaxies. Here we
investigate the effect of its application to intrinsically non-spherical objects. For this purpose
we use a model of a dwarf spheroidal galaxy formed in a numerical simulation of a major merger of two
disky dwarfs. The shape of the stellar component of the merger remnant is axisymmetric and prolate
which allows us to identify and measure the bias caused by observing the spheroidal galaxy along
different directions, especially the longest and shortest principal axis. The modelling is based
on mock data generated from the remnant that are observationally available for dwarfs: projected
positions and line-of-sight velocities of the stars. In order to obtain a reliable tool while keeping
the number of parameters low we parametrize the total mass distribution as a radius-dependent mass-to-light
ratio with just two free parameters we aim to constrain. Our study shows that if the total density
profile is known, the true, radially increasing anisotropy profile can be well recovered for the
observations along the longest axis whereas the data along the shortest axis lead to the inference
an incorrect, isotropic model. On the other hand, if the density profile is derived from the method
as well, the anisotropy is always underestimated but the total mass profile is well recovered for
the data along the shortest axis whereas for the longest axis the mass content is overestimated.
