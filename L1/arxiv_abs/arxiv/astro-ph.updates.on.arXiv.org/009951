We search for the fastest stars in the subset of stars with radial velocity measurements of the second
data release (DR2) of the European Space Agency mission Gaia. Starting from the observed positions,
parallaxes, proper motions, and radial velocities, we construct the distance and total velocity
distribution of more than $7$ million stars in our Milky Way, deriving the full 6D phase space information
in Galactocentric coordinates. These information are shared in a catalogue, publicly available
at this http URL To search for unbound stars, we then focus on stars with a probability greater than
$50 \%$ of being unbound from the Milky Way. This cut results in a clean sample of $125$ sources with
reliable astrometric parameters and radial velocities. Of these, $20$ stars have probabilities
greater than 80 $\%$ of being unbound from the Galaxy. On this latter sub-sample, we perform orbit
integration to characterize the stars' orbital parameter distributions. As expected given the
relatively small sample size of bright stars, we find no hypervelocity star candidates, stars that
are moving on orbits consistent with coming from the Galactic Centre. Instead, we find $7$ hyper-runaway
star candidates, coming from the Galactic disk. Surprisingly, the remaining $13$ unbound stars
cannot be traced back to the Galaxy, including two of the fastest stars (around $700$ km/s). If conformed,
these may constitute the tip of the iceberg of a large extragalactic population or the extreme velocity
tail of stellar streams.
