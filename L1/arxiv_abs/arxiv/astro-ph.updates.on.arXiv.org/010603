Source imaging of solar radio bursts can be used to track energetic electrons and associated magnetic
structures. Here we present a combined analysis of data at different wavelengths for an eruption
associated with a moving type-IV (t-IVm) radio burst. In the inner corona, the sources are correlated
with a hot and twisted eruptive EUV structure, while in the outer corona the sources are associated
with the top front of the bright core of a white light coronal mass ejection (CME). This reveals the
potential of using t-IVm imaging data to continuously track the CME by lighting up the specific component
containing radio-emitting electrons. It is found that the t-IVm burst presents a clear spatial
dispersion with observing frequencies. The burst manifests broken power-law like spectra in brightness
temperature, which is as high as $10^7$-$10^9$ K while the polarization level is in-general weak.
In addition, the t-IVm burst starts during the declining phase of the flare with a duration as long
as 2.5 hours. From the differential emission measure analysis of AIA data, the density of the T-IVm
source is found to be at the level of a few to several 10$^8$ cm$^{-3}$ at the start of the burst, and
the temperature reaches up to 5-8 MK. These observations do not favor gyro-synchrotron to be the
radiation mechanism, yet in line with a coherent plasma emission excited by energetic electrons
trapped within the source. Further studies are demanded to elucidate the emission mechanism and
explore the full diagnostic potential of t-IVm bursts.
