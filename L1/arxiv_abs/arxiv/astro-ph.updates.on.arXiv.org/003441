Using Voigt-profile-fitting procedures on Keck HIRES spectra of nine QSOs we identify 1099 CIV
absorber components clumped in 201 systems outside the Lyman forest over 1.6 < z < 4.4. With
associated SiIV, CII, SiII and NV where available we investigate bulk statistical and ionization
properties of the components and systems and find no significant change in redshift for CIV and SiIV
while CII, SiII and NV change substantially. The CIV components exhibit strong clustering but no
clustering is detected for systems on scales from 150 km/s out to 50000 km/s. We conclude the clustering
is due entirely to the peculiar velocities of gas present in the circumgalactic media of galaxies.
Using specific combinations of ionic ratios we compare our observations with model ionization
predictions for absorbers exposed to the metagalactic ionizing radiation background augmented
by proximity radiation from their associated galaxies and find the generally accepted means of
radiative escape by transparent channels from the internal star-forming sites is spectrally not
viable for our stronger absorbers. We develop an active scenario based on runaway stars with resulting
changes in the efflux of radiation that naturally enable the needed spectral convergence and in
turn provide empirical indicators of morphological evolution in the associated galaxies. Together
with a coexisting population of relatively compact galaxies indicated by the weaker absorbers
in our sample the collective escape of radiation is sufficient to maintain the IGM ionized over the
full range 1.9 < z < 4.4.
