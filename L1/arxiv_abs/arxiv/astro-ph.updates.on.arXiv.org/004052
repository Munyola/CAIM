Over the past decade the discovery of three unique stellar populations and a large number of confirmed
pulsars within the globular cluster Terzan 5 has raised questions over its classification. Using
the long-term radio pulsar timing of 36 millisecond pulsars in the cluster core, we provide new measurements
of key physical properties of the system. As Terzan 5 is located within the galactic bulge, stellar
crowding and reddening make optical and near infrared observations difficult. Pulsar accelerations,
however, allow us to study the intrinsic characteristics of the cluster independent of reddening
and stellar crowding and probe the mass density profile without needing to quantify the mass to light
ratio. Relating the spin and orbital periods of each pulsar to the acceleration predicted by a King
model, we find a core density of $1.58\times$10$^6$ M$_\odot$ pc$^{-3}$, a core radius of 0.16 pc,
a pulsar density profile $n\propto r^{-3.14}$, and a total mass of M$_{\rm T}$($R_\perp<$1.0 pc)$\simeq3.0\times$10$^5$
M$_\odot$ assuming a cluster distance of 5.9 kpc. Using this information we argue against Terzan
5 being a disrupted dwarf galaxy and discuss the possibility of Terzan 5 being a fragment of the Milky
Way's proto-bulge. We also discuss whether low-mass pulsars were formed via electron capture supernovae
or exist in a core full of heavy white dwarfs and hard binaries. Finally we provide an upper limit for
the mass of a possible black hole at the core of the cluster of 3.0$\times$10$^4$ M$_\odot$.
