Study of primary stars lying in Sirius-like systems with various masses of WD companions and orbital
separations is one of the key aspects to understand the origin and nature of Barium (Ba) stars. In
this paper, based on high resolution and high S/N spectra, we present systematic analysis of photospheric
abundances for 18 FGK primary stars of Sirius-like systems including six giants and 12 dwarfs. Atmospheric
parameters, stellar masses, and abundances of 24 elements (C, Na, Mg, Al, Si, S, K, Ca, Sc, Ti, V, Cr,
Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Sr, Y, Zr, Ba, La, Ce and Nd) are determined homogeneously. The abundance patterns
in these sample stars show that most of the elements in our sample follow the behavior of field stars
with similar metallicity. As expected, s-process elements in four known Ba giants show overabundance.
A weak correlation was found between anomalies of s-process elemental abundance and orbital separation,
suggesting the orbital separation of the binaries could not be the main constraint to differentiate
strong Ba stars from mild Ba stars. Our study shows that the large mass (>0.51 M ) of a WD companion in
a binary system is not a sufficient condition to form a Ba star, even if the separation between the
two components is small. Although not sufficient it seems to be a necessary condition since Ba stars
with lower mass WDs in the observed sample were not found. Our results support that [s/Fe] and [hs/ls]
ratios of Ba stars are anti-correlated with the metallicity. However, the different levels of s-process
overabundance among Ba stars may not to be dominated mainly by the metallicity.
