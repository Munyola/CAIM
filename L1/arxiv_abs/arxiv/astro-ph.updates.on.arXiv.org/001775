The local character of self-gravity along with the number of spatial dimensions are critical issues
when computing the potential and forces inside massive systems like stars and disks. This appears
from the discretisation scale where each cell of the numerical grid is a self-interacting body in
itself. There is apparently no closed-form expression yet giving the potential of a three-dimensional
homogeneous cylindrical or spherical cell, in contrast with the Cartesian case. By using Green's
theorem, we show that the potential integral for such polar-type 3D sectors -- initially, a volume
integral with singular kernel -- can be converted into a regular line-integral running over the
lateral contour, thereby generalising a formula already known under axial symmetry. It therefore
is a step towards the obtention of another potential/density pair. The new kernel is a finite function
of the cell's shape (with the simplest form in cylindrical geometry), and mixes incomplete elliptic
integrals, inverse trigonometric and hyperbolic functions. The contour integral is easy to compute;
it is valid in the whole physical space, exterior and interior to the sector itself and works in fact
for a wide variety of shapes of astrophysical interest (e.g. sectors of tori or flared discs). This
result is suited to easily providing reference solutions, and to reconstructing potential and
forces in inhomogeneous systems by superposition. The contour integrals for the 3 components of
the acceleration vector are explicitely given.
