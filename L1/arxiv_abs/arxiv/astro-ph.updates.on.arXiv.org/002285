High precision astrometry, space missions and certain tests of General Relativity, require the
knowledge of the metric tensor of the solar system, or more generally, of a gravitational N-body
system. This paper deals with the post-Minkowskian approximation of such a metric tensor in some
asymptotically flat space-time, where the full multipole structure, i.e., mass- and spin-multipole
moments, of the N bodies will be taken into account. The metric of arbitrarily shaped, rotating,
oscillating and arbitrarily moving bodies of finite extension is presently only known for the case
of slowly moving bodies in the post-Newtonian approximation. Presently, the post-Minkowskian
metric for arbitrarily moving celestial objects is known only for pointlike bodies with mass-monopoles
and spin-dipoles. This paper deals with two central issues: (1) We first consider a single body with
full multipole structure in uniform motion in some suitably chosen global reference system. For
this problem a co-moving inertial system of coordinates can be introduced where the metric, outside
the body, admits an expansion in terms of Damour-Iyer moments. A Poincare transformation then yields
the corresponding metric tensor in the global system. For the gravitational N body system the metric
is obtained by a sum over all bodies of the system. (2) It will be argued why the global metric, exact
to post-Minkowskian order, can be obtained by means of an instantaneous Poincare transformation
for the case of pointlike mass-monopoles and spin-dipoles in arbitrary motion.
