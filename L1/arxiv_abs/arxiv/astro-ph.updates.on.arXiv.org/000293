A generalized Newtonian potential is derived from the geodesic motion of test particles in Schwarzschild
spacetime. This potential reproduces several relativistic features with higher accuracy than
other commonly used pseudo-Newtonian approaches. The new potential reproduces the exact location
of the marginally stable, marginally bound, and photon circular orbits, as well as the exact radial
dependence of the binding energy and the angular momentum of these orbits. Moreover, it reproduces
the orbital and epicyclic angular frequencies to better than 6%. In addition, the spatial projection
of general trajectories coincide with their relativistic counterparts, while the time evolution
of parabolic-like trajectories and the pericentre advance of elliptical-like trajectories are
both reproduced exactly. We apply this approach to a standard thin accretion disc and find that the
efficiency of energy extraction agrees within 3% with the exact relativistic value, while the energy
flux per unit area as a function of radius is reproduced everywhere to better than 7%. As a further
astrophysical application we implement the new approach into a smoothed particle hydrodynamics
code and study the tidal disruption of a main sequence star by a supermassive black hole. The obtained
results are in very good agreement with previous relativistic simulations of tidal disruptions
in Schwarzschild spacetime. The equations of motion derived from this potential can be easily implemented
into existing Newtonian hydrodynamics codes at virtually zero additional computational effort.
