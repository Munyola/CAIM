The joint detection of gravitational waves (GWs) and $\gamma$-rays from a binary neutron-star
(NS) merger provided a unique view of off-axis GRBs and an independent measurement of the NS merger
rate. Comparing the observations of GRB170817 with those of the regular population of short GRBs
(sGRBs), we show that an order unity fraction of NS mergers result in sGRB jets that breakout of the
surrounding ejecta. We argue that the luminosity function of sGRBs, peaking at $\approx 2\times
10^{52}\, \mbox{erg s}^{-1}$, is likely an intrinsic property of the sGRB central engine and that
sGRB jets are typically narrow with opening angles $\theta_0 \approx 0.1$. We perform Monte Carlo
simulations to examine models for the structure and efficiency of the prompt emission in off axis
sGRBs. We find that only a small fraction ($\sim 0.01-0.1$) of NS mergers detectable by LIGO/VIRGO
in GWs is expected to be also detected in prompt $\gamma$-rays and that GW170817-like events are
very rare. For a NS merger rate of $\sim 1500$ Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$, as inferred from GW170817, we
expect within the next decade up to $\sim 12$ joint detections with off-axis GRBs for structured
jet models and just $\sim 1$ for quasi-spherical cocoon models where $\gamma$-rays are the result
of shock breakout. Given several joint detections and the rates of their discoveries, the different
structure models can be distinguished. In addition the existence of a cocoon with a reservoir of
thermal energy may be observed directly in the UV, given a sufficiently rapid localisation of the
GW source.
