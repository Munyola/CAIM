We present radiation-magnetohydrodynamic simulations aimed at studying evolutionary properties
of H\,{\normalsize II} regions in turbulent, magnetised, and collapsing molecular clouds formed
by converging flows in the warm neutral medium. We focus on the structure, dynamics and expansion
laws of these regions. Once a massive star forms in our highly structured clouds, its ionising radiation
eventually stops the accretion (through filaments) toward the massive star-forming regions.
The new over-pressured H\,{\normalsize II} regions push away the dense gas, thus disrupting the
more massive collapse centres. Also, because of the complex density structure in the cloud, the
H\,{\normalsize II} regions expand in a hybrid manner: they virtually do not expand toward the densest
regions (cores), while they expand according to the classical analytical result towards the rest
of the cloud, and in an accelerated way, as a blister region, towards the diffuse medium. Thus, the
ionised regions grow anisotropically, and the ionising stars generally appear off-centre of the
regions. Finally, we find that the hypotheses assumed in standard H\,{\normalsize II}-region
expansion models (fully embedded region, blister-type, or expansion in a density gradient) apply
simultaneously in different parts of our simulated H\,{\normalsize II} regions, producing a net
expansion law ($R \propto t^\alpha$, with $\alpha$ in the range of 0.93-1.47 and a mean value of $1.2
\pm 0.17$) that differs from any of those of the standard models.
