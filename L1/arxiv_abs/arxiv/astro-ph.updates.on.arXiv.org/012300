We analyse N-body simulations of star-forming regions to investigate the effects of external far
and extreme ultra-violet photoevaporation from massive stars on protoplanetary discs. By varying
the initial conditions of simulated star-forming regions, such as the spatial distribution, net
bulk motion (virial ratio), and density, we investigate which parameters most affect the rate at
which discs are dispersed due to external photoevaporation. We find that disc dispersal due to external
photoevaporation is faster in highly substructured star-forming regions than in smooth and centrally
concentrated regions. Sub-virial star-forming regions undergoing collapse also show higher
rates of disc dispersal than regions that are in virial equilibrium or are expanding. In moderately
dense ($\sim$100 M$_{\odot}$ pc$^{-3}$) regions, half of all protoplanetary discs with radii
$\geq$ 100 AU are photoevaporated within 1 Myr, three times faster than is currently suggested by
observational studies. Discs in lower-density star-forming regions ($\sim$10 M$_{\odot}$ pc$^{-3}$)
survive for longer, but half are still dispersed on short timescales ($\sim$2 Myr). This demonstrates
that the initial conditions of the star forming regions will greatly impact the evolution and lifetime
of protoplanetary discs. These results also imply that either gas giant planet formation is extremely
rapid and occurs before the gas component of discs is evaporated, or gas giants only form in low-density
star-forming regions where no massive stars are present to photoevaporate gas from protoplanetary
discs.
