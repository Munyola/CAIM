Given the forthcoming launch of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) which will allow observ- ing
exoplanet atmospheres with unprecedented signal-over-noise ratio, spectral coverage and spatial
resolution, the uncertainties in the atmosphere modelling used to interpret the data need to be
as- sessed. As the first step, we compare three independent 1D radiative-convective models: ATMO,
Exo-REM and petitCODE. We identify differences in physical and chemical processes taken into ac-
count thanks to a benchmark protocol we developed. We study the impact of these differences on the
analysis of observable spectra. We show the importance of selecting carefully relevant molecular
linelists to compute the atmospheric opacity. Indeed, differences between spectra calculated
with Hitran and ExoMol exceed the expected uncertainties of future JWST observations. We also show
the limitation in the precision of the models due to uncertainties on alkali and molecule lineshape,
which induce spectral effects also larger than the expected JWST uncertainties. We compare two
chemical models, Exo-REM and Venot Chemical Code, which do not lead to significant differences
in the emission or transmission spectra. We discuss the observational consequences of using equilibrium
or out-of- equilibrium chemistry and the major impact of phosphine, detectable with the JWST.Each
of the models has benefited from the benchmarking activity and has been updated. The protocol developed
in this paper and the online results can constitute a test case for other models.
