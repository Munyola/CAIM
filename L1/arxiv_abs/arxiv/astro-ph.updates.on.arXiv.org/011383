PSR B0943+10 is a mode-switching radio pulsar characterized by two emission modes with different
radio and X-ray properties. Previous studies, based on simple combinations of blackbody and power
law models, showed that its X-ray flux can be decomposed in a pulsed thermal plus an unpulsed non-thermal
components. However, if PSR B0943+10 is a nearly aligned rotator seen pole-on, as suggested by the
radio data, it is difficult to reproduce the high observed pulsed fraction unless magnetic beaming
is included. In this work we reanalyze all the available X-ray observations of PSR B0943+10 with
simultaneous radio coverage, modeling its thermal emission with polar caps covered by a magnetized
hydrogen atmosphere or with a condensed iron surface. The condensed surface model provides good
fits to the spectra of both pulsar modes, but, similarly to the blackbody, it can not reproduce the
observed pulse profiles, unless an additional power law with an ad hoc modulation is added. Instead,
the pulse profiles and phase-resolved spectra are well described using the hydrogen atmosphere
model to describe the polar cap emission, plus an unpulsed power law. For the X-ray brighter state
(Q-mode) we obtain a best fit with a temperature kT~0.09 keV, an emitting radius R~260 m, a magnetic
field consistent with the value of the dipole field of 4x10^12 G inferred from the timing parameters,
and a small angle between the magnetic and spin axis, $\xi$=5. The corresponding parameters for
the X-ray fainter state (B-mode) are kT~0.08 keV and R~170 m.
