We analyse the Kormendy relations (KRs) of the two Frontier Fields clusters, Abell S1063, at z = 0.348,
and MACS J1149.5+2223, at z = 0.542, exploiting very deep Hubble Space Telescope photometry and
VLT/MUSE integral field spectroscopy. With this novel dataset, we are able to investigate how the
KR parameters depend on the cluster galaxy sample selection and how this affects studies of galaxy
evolution based on the KR. We define and compare four different galaxy samples according to: (a)
S\'ersic indices: early-type ('ETG'), (b) visual inspection: 'ellipticals', (c) colours: 'red',
(d) spectral properties: 'passive'. The classification is performed for a complete sample of galaxies
with m$_{\textit{F814W}} \le$ 22.5 ABmag (M$_{*}$ $\gtrsim 10^{10.0}$ M$_{\odot}$). To derive
robust galaxy structural parameters, we use two methods: (1) an iterative estimate of structural
parameters using images of increasing size, in order to deal with closely separated galaxies and
(2) different background estimations, to deal with the Intracluster light contamination. The
comparison between the KRs obtained from the different samples suggests that the sample selection
could affect the estimate of the best-fitting KR parameters. The KR built with ETGs is fully consistent
with the one obtained for ellipticals and passive. On the other hand, the KR slope built on the red
sample is only marginally consistent with those obtained with the other samples. We also release
the photometric catalogue with structural parameters for the galaxies included in the present
analysis.
