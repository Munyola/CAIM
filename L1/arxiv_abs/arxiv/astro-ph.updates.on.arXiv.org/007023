The VST Optical Imaging of the CDFS and ES1 Fields (VOICE) Survey is proposed to obtain deep optical
$ugri$ imaging of the CDFS and ES1 fields using the VLT Survey Telescope (VST). At present, the observations
for the CDFS field have been completed, and comprise in total about 4.9 deg$^2$ down to $r_\mathrm{AB}$$\sim$26mag.
Weak lensing shear is measured in a companion paper for $r$-band images with seeing $\leq$ 0.9 arcsec.
In this work, we perform image simulations to calibrate possible biases of the measured shear signals.
Statistically, the properties of the simulated point spread function (PSF) and galaxies show good
agreement with those of observations. The multiplicative bias is calibrated to reach an accuracy
of 3.0%. We study the bias sensitivities to undetected faint galaxies and to the existence of neighboring
galaxies. We find that undetected galaxies contribute to 0.3% multiplicative bias. Further analysis
shows that galaxies with lower signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) suffer from more significant impact
due to the skewed background noise caused by undetected galaxies. Meanwhile, we find that although
most of the neighbors have been rejected in the shape measurement procedure, about one third of them
still remain in the final shear sample. They show larger ellipticity dispersion and contribute
to 0.2% multiplicative bias. Simply rejecting these galaxies can reduce the effective number density
of galaxies for deep surveys, such as VOICE. Therefore efficient methods should be developed for
future weak lensing surveys in order to decompose their overlapped surface brightness distributions.
