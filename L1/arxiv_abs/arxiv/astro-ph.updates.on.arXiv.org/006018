We analyze the long-term lightcurve of 3C 454.3 observed with Fermi/LAT and investigate its relation
to the flux in the radio, optical, and X-ray bands. By fitting the 1-day binned GeV lightcurve with
multiple Gaussian function (MGF), we propose that the typical variability timescale in the GeV
band is 1--10 days. The GeV flux variation is accompanied by the spectral variation characterized
as flux-tracking, i.e., "harder when brighter". The GeV flux is correlated with the optical and
X-ray fluxes, and a weak correlation between gamma-ray flux and radio flux is also observed. The
gamma-ray flux is not correlated with the optical linear polarization degree for the global lightcurves,
but they show a correlation for the lightcurves before MJD 56000. The power density spectrum of the
global lightcurve shows an obvious turnover at ~7.7 days, which may indicate a typical variability
timescale of 3C 454.3 in the gamma-ray band. This is also consistent with the derived timescales
by fitting the global lightcurve with MGF. The spectral evolution and an increase of the optical
linear polarization degree along with the increase of the gamma-ray flux may indicate that the radiation
particles are accelerated and the magnetic field is ordered by the shock processes during the outbursts.
In addition, the nature of 3C 454.3 may be consistent with the self-organized criticality system,
similar to Sagittarius A, and thus the outbursts are from plasmoid ejections driven by magnetic
reconnection. This may further support the idea that the jet radiation regions are magnetized.
