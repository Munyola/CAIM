We report the discoveries of three transiting exoplanets. WASP-91b is a warm Jupiter (1.34 $M_{\rm
Jup}$, 1.03 $R_{\rm Jup}$) in a 2.8-day orbit around a metal-rich K3 star. WASP-105b is a warm Jupiter
(1.8 $M_{\rm Jup}$, 0.96 $R_{\rm Jup}$) in a 7.9-day orbit around a metal-rich K2 star. WASP-107b
is a warm super-Neptune/sub-Saturn (0.12 $M_{\rm Jup}$, 0.94 $R_{\rm Jup}$) in a 5.7-day orbit
around a solar-metallicity K6 star. Considering that giant planets seem to be more common around
stars of higher metallicity and stars of higher mass, it is notable that the hosts are all metal-rich,
late-type stars. With orbital separations that place both WASP-105b and WASP-107b in the weak-tide
regime, measurements of the alignment between the planets' orbital axes and their stars' spin axes
may help us to understand the inward migration of short-period, giant planets. The mass of WASP-107b
(2.2 $M_{\rm Nep}$, 0.40 $M_{\rm Sat}$) places it in the transition region between the ice giants
and gas giants of the Solar System. Its radius of 0.94 $R_{\rm Jup}$ suggests that it is a low-mass
gas giant with a H/He-dominated composition. The planet thus sets a lower limit of 2.2 $M_{\rm Nep}$
on the planetary mass above which large gaseous envelopes can be accreted and retained by proto-planets
on their way to becoming gas giants. We may discover whether WASP-107b more closely resembles an
ice giant or a gas giant by measuring its atmospheric metallicity via transmission spectroscopy,
for which WASP-107b is a very good target.
