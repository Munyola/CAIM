We determine the relationship between the star formation rates (SFRs) of galaxies and the incidence
of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). We combine large galaxy samples with deep Chandra X-ray imaging
to measure the probability distribution of specific black hole accretion rates (L_X relative to
stellar mass) to z~4. We derive robust AGN fractions and average specific accretion rates that account
for variations in X-ray sensitivity and stellar-mass-dependent selection biases. First, we consider
galaxies along the main sequence of star formation. We find a linear correlation between the average
SFR and both the AGN fraction and average specific accretion rate that accounts for much of the complex
stellar-mass and redshift dependence of the incidence of AGN in star-forming galaxies. We also
compare with quiescent galaxy samples and find significantly higher AGN fractions than would be
predicted, given their low SFRs. Next, we bin galaxies according to their SFRs relative to the main
sequence. We find that the AGN fraction is significantly elevated for galaxies that are still star-forming
but with SFRs below the main sequence, indicating an enhanced AGN triggering rate. We also find that
the incidence of high-accretion-rate AGN is enhanced in starburst galaxies and evolves more mildly
with redshift than within the rest of the galaxy population, suggesting mergers play a role in driving
AGN activity in such high-SFR galaxies. These results reveal the important connections between
cold gas, the growth of black holes, the assembly of central stellar bulges and the overall growth
of galaxies.
