Polar Crown Filaments (PCFs) form above the magnetic polarity inversion line, which separates
the unipolar polar fields and the nearest dispersed fields from trailing part of active regions
with opposite polarity. The statistical properties of PCFs are correlated with the solar cycle.
Therefore, study of PCFs plays an important role in understanding the variation of solar cycle,
especially the prolonged cycle 23 and the current "abnormal" solar cycle 24. In this study, we investigate
PCFs using full disk H{\alpha} data from 1973 to early 2018, recorded by Kanzelhohe Solar Observatory
(KSO) and Big Bear Solar Observatory (BBSO), in digital form from 1997 to 2018 and in 35 mm film (digitized)
from 1973 to 1996. PCFs are identified manually because their segmented shape and close-to-limb
location were not handled well by automatical detections in several previous studies. Our results
show that the PCFs start to move poleward at the beginning of each solar cycle. When the PCFs approach
to the maximum latitude, the polar field strength reduces to zero followed by a reversal. The migration
rates are about 0.4 to 0.7 degree per Carrington rotation, with clear N-S asymmetric pattern. In
cycles 21 and 23, the PCFs in the northern hemisphere migrate faster than those in the southern hemisphere.
However, in the "abnormal" cycle 24, the southern PCFs migrate faster, which is consistent with
other observations of magnetic fields and radio emission. In addition, there are more days in cycle
23 and 24 without PCFs than in the previous cycles.
