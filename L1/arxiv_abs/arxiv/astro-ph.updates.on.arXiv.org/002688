Systematic uncertainties that have been subdominant in past large-scale structure (LSS) surveys
are likely to exceed statistical uncertainties of current and future LSS data sets, potentially
limiting the extraction of cosmological information. Here we present a general framework (PCA
marginalization) to consistently incorporate systematic effects into a likelihood analysis.
This technique naturally accounts for degeneracies between nuisance parameters and can substantially
reduce the dimension of the parameter space that needs to be sampled. As a practical application,
we apply PCA marginalization to account for baryonic physics as an uncertainty in cosmic shear tomography.
Specifically, we use CosmoLike to run simulated likelihood analyses on three independent sets
of numerical simulations, each covering a wide range of baryonic scenarios differing in cooling,
star formation, and feedback mechanisms. We simulate a Stage III (Dark Energy Survey) and Stage
IV (Large Synoptic Survey Telescope/Euclid) survey and find a substantial bias in cosmological
constraints if baryonic physics is not accounted for. We then show that PCA marginalization (employing
at most 3 to 4 nuisance parameters) removes this bias. Our study demonstrates that it is possible
to obtain robust, precise constraints on the dark energy equation of state even in the presence of
large levels of systematic uncertainty in astrophysical processes. We conclude that the PCA marginalization
technique is a powerful, general tool for addressing many of the challenges facing the precision
cosmology program.
