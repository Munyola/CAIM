The early star-forming Universe is still poorly constrained, with the properties of high-redshift
stars, the first heating sources, and reionization highly uncertain. This leaves observers planning
21-cm experiments with little theoretical guidance. In this work we explore the possible range
of high-redshift parameters including the star formation efficiency and the minimal mass of star-forming
halos; the efficiency, spectral energy distribution, and redshift evolution of the first X-ray
sources; and the history of reionization. These parameters are only weakly constrained by available
observations, mainly the optical depth to the cosmic microwave background. We use realistic semi-numerical
simulations to produce the global 21-cm signal over the redshift range $z = 6-40$ for each of 193 different
combinations of the astrophysical parameters spanning the allowed range. We show that the expected
signal fills a large parameter space, but with a fixed general shape for the global 21-cm curve. Even
with our wide selection of models we still find clear correlations between the key features of the
global 21-cm signal and underlying astrophysical properties of the high redshift Universe, namely
the Ly$\alpha$ intensity, the X-ray heating rate, and the production rate of ionizing photons.
These correlations can be used to directly link future measurements of the global 21-cm signal to
astrophysical quantities in a mostly model-independent way. We identify additional correlations
that can be used as consistency checks.
