We present new observations of the faint "Sirius-like" companion discovered to orbit HD 114174.
Previous attempts to image HD 114174 B at mid-infrared wavelengths using NIRC2 at Keck have resulted
in a non-detection. Our new L'-band observations taken with the Large Binocular Telescope and LMIRCam
recover the companion ($\Delta L$ = 10.15 $\pm$ 0.15 mag, $\rho$ = 0.675'' $\pm$ 0.016'') with a high
signal-to-noise ratio (10 $\sigma$). This measurement represents the deepest L' high-contrast
imaging detection at sub-arcsecond separations to date, including extrasolar planets. We confirm
that HD 114174 B has near-infrared colors consistent with the interpretation of a cool white dwarf
($J-L'$ = 0.76 $\pm$ 0.19 mag, $K-L'$ = 0.64 $\pm$ 0.20). New model fits to the object's spectral energy
distribution indicate a temperature $T_{\rm eff}$ = 4260 $\pm$ 360 K, surface gravity log g = 7.94
$\pm$ 0.03, a cooling age t$_{c} \approx$ 7.8 Gyr, and mass $M$ = 0.54 $\pm$ 0.01 $M_{\odot}$. We find
that the cooling age given by theoretical atmospheric models do not agree with the age of HD 114174
A derived from both isochronological and gyrochronological analyses. We speculate on possible
scenarios to explain the apparent age discrepancy between the primary and secondary. HD 114174
B is a nearby benchmark white dwarf that will ultimately enable a dynamical mass estimate through
continued Doppler and astrometric monitoring. Efforts to characterize its physical properties
in detail will test theoretical atmospheric models and improve our understanding of white dwarf
evolution, cooling, and progenitor masses.
