We present the umbrella sampling (US) technique and show that it can be used to sample extremely low
probability areas of the posterior distribution that may be required in statistical analyses of
data. In this approach sampling of the target likelihood is split into sampling of multiple biased
likelihoods confined within individual umbrella windows. We show that the US algorithm is efficient
and highly parallel and that it can be easily used with other existing MCMC samplers. The method allows
the user to capitalize on their intuition and define umbrella windows and increase sampling accuracy
along specific directions in the parameter space. Alternatively, one can define umbrella windows
using an approach similar to parallel tempering. We provide a public code that implements umbrella
sampling as a standalone python package. We present a number of tests illustrating the power of the
US method in sampling low probability areas of the posterior and show that this ability allows a considerably
more robust sampling of multi-modal distributions compared to the standard sampling methods.
We also present an application of the method in a real world example of deriving cosmological constraints
using the supernova type Ia data. We show that umbrella sampling can sample the posterior accurately
down to the $\approx 15\sigma$ credible region in the $\Omega_{\rm m}-\Omega_\Lambda$ plane,
while for the same computational work the affine-invariant MCMC sampling implemented in the {\tt
emcee} code samples the posterior reliably only to $\approx 3\sigma$.
