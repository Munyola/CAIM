Context. We present an estimation of cosmological parameters with clusters of galaxies. Aims.
We constrain the $\Omega_m$, $\sigma_8$, and $w$ parameters from a stand-alone sample of X-ray
clusters detected in the 50 deg$^2$ XMM-XXL survey with a well-defined selection function. Methods.
We analyse the redshift distribution of a sample comprising 178 high S/N clusters out to a redshift
of unity. The cluster sample scaling relations are determined in a self-consistent manner. Results.
In a lambda cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model, the cosmology favoured by the XXL clusters compares
well with results derived from the Planck S-Z clusters for a totally different sample (mass/redshift
range, selection biases, and scaling relations). However, with this preliminary sample and current
mass calibration uncertainty, we find no inconsistency with the Planck CMB cosmology. If we relax
the $w$ parameter, the Planck CMB uncertainties increase by a factor of $\sim$10 and become comparable
with those from XXL clusters. Combining the two probes allows us to put constraints on $\Omega_m$=0.316$\pm$0.060,
$\sigma_8$=0.814$\pm$0.054, and $w$=-1.02$\pm$0.20. Conclusions. This first self-consistent
cosmological analysis of a sample of serendipitous XMM clusters already provides interesting
insights into the constraining power of the XXL survey. Subsequent analysis will use a larger sample
extending to lower confidence detections and include additional observable information, potentially
improving posterior uncertainties by roughly a factor of 3.
