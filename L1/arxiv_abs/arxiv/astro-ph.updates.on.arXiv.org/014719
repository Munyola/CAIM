One of the major challenges for pulsar timing array (PTA) experiments is the mitigation of the effects
of the turbulent interstellar medium (ISM) from timing data. These can potentially lead to measurable
delays and/or distortions in the pulse profiles and scale strongly with the inverse of the radio
frequency. Low-frequency observations are therefore highly appealing for characterizing them.
However, in order to achieve the necessary time resolution to resolve profile features of short-period
millisecond pulsars, phase-coherent de-dispersion is essential, especially at frequencies
below $300$ MHz. We present the lowest-frequency ($80$-$220$ MHz), coherently de-dispersed detections
of one of the most promising pulsars for current and future PTAs, PSR J2241$-$5236, using our new
beam-former software for the MWA's voltage capture system (VCS), which reconstructs the time series
at a much higher time resolution of $\sim 1 \mu$s by re-synthesizing the recorded voltage data at
$10$-kHz/$100$-$\mu$s native resolutions. Our data reveal a dual-precursor type feature in the
pulse profile that is either faint or absent in high-frequency observations from Parkes. The resultant
high-fidelity detections have enabled dispersion measure (DM) determinations with very high
precision, of the order of $(2$-$6)\times10^{-6}$ $\rm pc\,cm^{-3}$, owing to the microsecond
level timing achievable for this pulsar at the MWA's low frequencies. This underscores the usefulness
of low-frequency observations for probing the ISM toward PTA pulsars and informing optimal observing
strategies for PTA experiments.
