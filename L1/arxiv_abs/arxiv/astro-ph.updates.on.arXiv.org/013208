"TRAO FUNS" is a project to survey Gould Belt's clouds in molecular lines. This paper presents its
first results on the central region of the California molecular cloud, L1478. We performed On-The-Fly
mapping observations using the Taedeok Radio Astronomy Observatory (TRAO) 14m single dish telescope
equipped with a 16 multi-beam array covering $\sim$1.0 square degree area of this region using C$^{18}$O
(1-0) mainly tracing low density cloud and about 460 square arcminute area using N$_{2}$H$^{+}$
(1-0) mainly tracing dense cores. CS (2-1) and SO $(3_{2}-2_{1})$ were also used simultaneously
to map $\sim$440 square arcminute area of this region. We identified 10 filaments by applying the
dendrogram technique to the C$^{18}$O data-cube and 8 dense N$_{2}$H$^{+}$ cores by using {\sc
FellWalker}. Basic physical properties of filaments such as mass, length, width, velocity field,
and velocity dispersion are derived. It is found that L1478 consists of several filaments with slightly
different velocities. Especially the filaments which are supercritical are found to contain dense
cores detected in N$_{2}$H$^{+}$. Comparison of non-thermal velocity dispersions derived from
C$^{18}$O and N$_{2}$H$^{+}$ for the filaments and dense cores indicates that some of dense cores
share similar kinematics with those of the surrounding filaments while several dense cores have
different kinematics with those of their filaments. This suggests that the formation mechanism
of dense cores and filaments can be different in individual filaments depending on their morphologies
and environments.
