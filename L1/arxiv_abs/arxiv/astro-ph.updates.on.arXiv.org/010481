The X8.2 event of 10 September 2017 provides unique observations to study the genesis, magnetic
morphology and impulsive dynamics of a very fast CME. Combining GOES-16/SUVI and SDO/AIA EUV imagery,
we identify a hot ($T\approx 10-15$ MK) bright rim around a quickly expanding cavity, embedded inside
a much larger CME shell ($T\approx 1-2$ MK). The CME shell develops from a dense set of large AR loops
($\gtrsim$0.5 $R_s$), and seamlessly evolves into the CME front observed in LASCO C2. The strong
lateral overexpansion of the CME shell acts as a piston initiating the fast EUV wave. The hot cavity
rim is demonstrated to be a manifestation of the dominantly poloidal flux and frozen-in plasma added
to the rising flux rope by magnetic reconnection in the current sheet beneath. The same structure
is later observed as the core of the white light CME, challenging the traditional interpretation
of the CME three-part morphology. The large amount of added magnetic flux suggested by these observations
explains the extreme accelerations of the radial and lateral expansion of the CME shell and cavity,
all reaching values of $5 - 10$ km s$^{-2}$. The acceleration peaks occur simultaneously with the
first RHESSI $100-300$ keV hard X-ray burst of the associated flare, further underlining the importance
of the reconnection process for the impulsive CME evolution. Finally, the much higher radial propagation
speed of the flux rope in relation to the CME shell causes a distinct deformation of the white light
CME front and shock.
