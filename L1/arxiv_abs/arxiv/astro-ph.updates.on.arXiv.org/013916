We present our results from training and evaluating a convolutional neural network (CNN) to predict
galaxy shapes from wide-field survey images of the first data release of the Dark Energy Survey (DES
DR1). We use conventional shape measurements as ground truth from an overlapping, deeper survey
with less sky coverage, the Canada-France Hawaii Telescope Lensing Survey (CFHTLenS). We demonstrate
that CNN predictions from single band DES images reproduce the results of CFHTLenS at bright magnitudes
and show higher correlation with CFHTLenS at fainter magnitudes than maximum likelihood model
fitting estimates in the DES Y1 im3shape catalogue. Prediction of shape parameters with a CNN is
also extremely fast, it takes only 0.2 milliseconds per galaxy, improving more than 4 orders of magnitudes
over forward model fitting. The CNN can also accurately predict shapes when using multiple images
of the same galaxy, even in different color bands, with no additional computational overhead. The
CNN is again more precise for faint objects, and the advantage of the CNN is more pronounced for blue
galaxies than red ones when compared to the DES Y1 metacalibration catalogue, which fits a single
Gaussian profile using riz band images. We demonstrate that CNN shape predictions within the metacalibration
self-calibrating framework yield shear estimates with negligible multiplicative bias, $ m < 10^{-3}$,
and no significant PSF leakage. Our proposed setup is applicable to current and next generation
weak lensing surveys where higher quality ground truth shapes can be measured in dedicated deep
fields.
