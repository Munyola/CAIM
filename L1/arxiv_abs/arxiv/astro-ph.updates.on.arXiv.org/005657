We aim to investigate mass loss and luminosity in a large sample of evolved stars in several Local
Group galaxies with a variety of metalliticies and star-formation histories: the Small and Large
Magellanic Cloud, and the Fornax, Carina, and Sculptor dwarf spheroidal galaxies. Dust radiative
transfer models are presented for 225 carbon stars and 171 oxygen-rich evolved stars for which spectra
from the Infrared Spectrograph on Spitzer are available. The spectra are complemented with available
optical and infrared photometry to construct spectral energy distributions. A minimization procedure
was used to determine luminosity and mass-loss rate (MLR). Pulsation periods were derived for a
large fraction of the sample based on a re-analysis of existing data. New deep K-band photometry
from the VMC survey and multi-epoch data from IRAC and AllWISE/NEOWISE have allowed us to derive
pulsation periods longer than 1000 days for some of the most heavily obscured and reddened objects.
We derive (dust) MLRs and luminosities for the entire sample. The estimated MLRs can differ significantly
from estimates for the same objects in the literature due to differences in adopted optical constants
(up to factors of several) and details in the radiative transfer modelling. Updated parameters
for the super-AGB candidate MSX SMC 055 (IRAS 00483-7347) are presented. Its current mass is estimated
to be 8.5 +- 1.6 \msol, suggesting an initial mass well above 8~\msol. Using synthetic photometry,
we present and discuss colour-colour and colour-magnitude diagrams which can be expected from
the James Webb Space Telescope.
