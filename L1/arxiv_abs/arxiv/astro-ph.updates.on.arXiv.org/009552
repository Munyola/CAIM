The strong enhancement of the ultraviolet emission during solar flares is usually taken as an indication
of plasma heating in the low solar atmosphere caused by the deposition of the energy released during
these events. Images taken with broadband ultraviolet filters by the Transition Region and Coronal
Explorer (TRACE) and Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA 1600 and 1700 \AA) have revealed the morphology
and evolution of flare ribbons in great detail. However, the spectral content of these images is
still largely unknown. Without the knowledge of the spectral contribution to these UV filters,
the use of these rich imaging datasets is severely limited. Aiming to solve this issue, we estimate
the spectral contributions of the AIA UV flare and plage images using high-resolution spectra in
the range 1300 to 1900 \AA\ from the Skylab NRL SO82B spectrograph. We find that the flare excess emission
in AIA 1600 \AA\ is composed of the C IV 1550 \AA\ doublet (26\%), Si I continua (20\%), with smaller
contributions from many other chromospheric lines such as C I 1561 and 1656 \AA\ multiplets, He II
1640 \AA, Si ii 1526 and 1533 \AA. For the AIA 1700 \AA\ band, C I 1656 \AA\ multiplet is the main contributor
(38\%), followed by He II 1640 (17\%), and accompanied by a multitude of other chromospheric lines,
with minimal contribution from the continuum. Our results can be generalized to state that the AIA
UV flare excess emission is of chromospheric origin, while plage emission is dominated by photospheric
continuum emission in both channels.
