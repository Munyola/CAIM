The complexity of the cosmological scenario regarding cosmic strings (CSs) stands still in the
way of a complete understanding. We describe here a promising strategy for the possible detection
of these elusive physical entities. It is based on the search of strong gravitational lensing events
in the location area of the CS candidate (CSc-1), which was declared in a previous work by CMB analysis.
Using photometric and geometric criteria, we identified pairs of candidates of lensed galaxies
(LGCs) in the "string field" (SF), which were then compared with the average density of background
galaxy pairs in a set of "control fields" (CFs). We found an excess of $22\%$ (per sq. deg.) of the LGCs
in SF, which exceeds the estimated cosmic dispersion. We also found that the number of LGCs is in excess
of $29.2\%$ in the angular separation bin $[8'', 9'']$. Finally, we analysed the possibility of
a preferred orientation of the line connecting the centres of the LGCs. The orientation is statistically
significant for an angular separation bin $[4'',6'']$. Therefore, we found two "windows" for the
preferred angular separation for LGCs along the possible CS. However, the confirmation of the gravitational
lensing origin of our LGCs requires spectroscopic observations which seem to be justified by the
present results. We plan to acquire their spectra as well as to continue the study of the spectral
and morphological features of the LGCs in the CSc-1 field and to analyse the other CS-candidates
using the same strategy.
