Using images from Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 8, we have re-examined the morphology of
719 galaxies from the Analysis of the interstellar Medium in Isolated GAlaxies (AMIGA) project,
a sample consisting of the most isolated galaxies that have yet been identified. The goal is to further
improve the classifications of these galaxies by examining them in the context of the Comprehensive
de Vaucouleurs revised Hubble-Sandage (CVRHS) system, which includes recognition of features
that go beyond the original de Vaucouleurs point of view. Our results confirm previous findings
that isolated galaxies are found across the complete revised Hubble sequence, with intermediate
to late-type (Sb-Sc) spirals being relatively more common. Elmegreen Arm Classifications are
also presented, and show that more than 50% of the 514 spirals in the sample for which an arm class could
be judged are grand design (AC 8,9,12). The visual bar fraction for the sample is ~50%, but only 16%
are classified as strongly-barred (SB). The dominant family classification is SA (nonbarred),
the dominant inner variety classification is (s) (pure spiral), and the dominant outer variety
classification is no outer ring, pseudoring, or lens. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test is used to check
for potential biases in the morphological interpretations, and for any possible relation between
rings, bars, and arm classes with local environment and far-infrared excess. The connection between
morphology and stellar mass is also examined for a subset of the sample.
