(X/peanut)-shaped features observed in a significant fraction of disk galaxies are thought to
have formed from vertically buckled bars. Despite being three dimensional structures, they are
preferentially detected in near edge-on projection. Only a few galaxies are found to have displayed
such structures when their disks are relatively face-on - suggesting that either they are generally
weak in face-on projection or many may be hidden by the light of their galaxy's face-on disk. Here
we report on three (collisionless) simulated galaxies displaying peanut-shaped structures when
their disks are seen both face-on and edge-on - resembling a three-dimensional peanut or dumbbell.
Furthermore, these structures are accompanied by ansae and an outer ring at the end of the bar ---
as seen in real galaxies such as IC~5240. The same set of quantitative parameters used to measure
peanut structures in real galaxies have been determined for the simulated galaxies, and a broad
agreement is found. In addition, the peanut length grows in tandem with the bar, and is a maximum at
half the length of the bar. Beyond the cutoff of these peanut structures, towards the end of the bar,
we discover a new positive/negative feature in the $B_6$ radial profile associated with the isophotes
of the ansae/ring. Our simulated, self-gravitating, three-dimensional peanut structures display
cylindrical rotation even in the near-face-on disk projection. In addition, we report on a kinematic
pinch in the velocity map along the bar minor-axis, matching that seen in the surface density map.
