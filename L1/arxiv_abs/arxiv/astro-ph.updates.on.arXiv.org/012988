Of the solar system's four terrestrial planets, the origin of Mercury is perhaps the most mysterious.
Modern numerical simulations designed to model the dynamics of terrestrial planet formation systematically
fail to replicate Mercury; which possesses just 5% the mass of Earth and the highest orbital eccentricity
and inclination among the planets. However, Mercury's large iron-rich core and low volatile inventory
stand out among the inner planets, and seem to imply a violent collisional origin. Because most algorithms
used for simulating terrestrial accretion do not consider the effects of collisional fragmentation,
it has been difficult to test these collisional hypotheses within the larger context of planet formation.
Here, we analyze a large suite of terrestrial accretion models that account for the fragmentation
of colliding bodies. We find that planets with core mass fractions boosted as a result of repeated
hit-and-run collisions are produced in 90% of our simulations. While many of these planets are similar
to Mercury in mass, they rarely lie on Mercury-like orbits. Furthermore, we perform an additional
batch of simulations designed to specifically test the single giant impact origin scenario. We
find less than a 1% probability of simultaneously replicating the Mercury-Venus dynamical spacing
and the terrestrial system's degree of orbital excitation after such an event. While dynamical
models have made great strides in understanding Mars' low mass, their inability to form accurate
Mercury analogs remains a glaring problem.
