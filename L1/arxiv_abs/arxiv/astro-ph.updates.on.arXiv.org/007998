After two years of operation, the High-Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) Observatory has analyzed
the TeV cosmic-ray sky over an energy range between $2.0$ and $72.8$ TeV. The HAWC detector is a ground-based
air-shower array located at high altitude in the state of Puebla, Mexico. Using 300 light-tight
water tanks, it collects the Cherenkov light from the particles of extensive air showers from primary
gamma rays and cosmic rays. This detection method allows for uninterrupted observation of the entire
overhead sky (2~sr instantaneous, 8.5~sr integrated) in the energy range from a few TeV to hundreds
of TeV. Like other detectors in the northern and southern hemisphere, HAWC observes an energy-dependent
anisotropy in the arrival direction distribution of cosmic rays. The observed cosmic-ray anisotropy
is dominated by a dipole moment with phase $\alpha\approx40^{\circ}$ and amplitude that slowly
rises in relative intensity from $8\times10^{-4}$ at 2 TeV to $14\times10^{-4}$ around 30.3 TeV,
above which the dipole decreases in strength. A significant large-scale ($>60^{\circ}$ in angular
extent) signal is also observed in the quadrupole and octupole moments, and significant small-scale
features are also present, with locations and shapes consistent with previous observations. Compared
to previous measurements in this energy range, the HAWC cosmic-ray sky maps improve on the energy
resolution and fit precision of the anisotropy. These data can be used in an effort to better constrain
local cosmic-ray accelerators and the intervening magnetic fields.
