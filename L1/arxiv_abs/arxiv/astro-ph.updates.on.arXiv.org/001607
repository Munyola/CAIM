In order to find a fast and reliable method for selecting metal poor galaxies (MPGs), especially
in large surveys and huge database, an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) method is applied to a sample
of star-forming galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) data release 9 (DR9) provided
by the Max Planck Institute and the Johns Hopkins University (MPA/JHU). A two-step approach is adopted:(i)
The ANN network must be trained with a subset of objects that are known to be either MPGs or MRGs(Metal
Rich galaxies), treating the strong emission line flux measurements as input feature vectors in
an n-dimensional space, where n is the number of strong emission line flux ratios. (ii) After the
network is trained on a sample of star-forming galaxies, remaining galaxies are classified in the
automatic test analysis as either MPGs or MRGs. We consider several random divisions of the data
into training and testing sets: for instance, for our sample, a total of 70 percent of the data are
involved in training the algorithm, 15 percent are involved in validating the algorithm and the
remaining 15 percent are used for blind testing of the resulting classifier. For target selection,
we have achieved an acquisition rate for MPGs of 96 percent and 92 percent for an MPGs threshold of
12+log(O/H)=8.00 and 12+log(O/H)=8.39, respectively. Running the code takes minutes in most
cases under the Matlab 2013a software environment. The ANN method can easily be extended to any MPGs
target selection task when the physical property of the target can be expressed as a quantitative
variable.
