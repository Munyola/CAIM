The discovery of many giant planets in close-in orbits and the effect of planetary and stellar tides
in their subsequent orbital decay have been extensively studied in the context of planetary formation
and evolution theories. Planets orbiting close to their host stars undergo close encounters, atmospheric
photoevaporation, orbital evolution, and tidal interactions. In many of these theoretical studies,
it is assumed that the interior properties of gas giants remain static during orbital evolution.
Here we present a model that allows for changes in the planetary radius as well as variations in the
planetary and stellar dissipation parameters, caused by the planet's contraction and change of
rotational rates from the strong tidal fields. In this semi-analytical model, giant planets experience
a much slower tidal-induced circularization compared to models that do not consider these instantaneous
changes. We predict that the eccentricity damping time-scale increases about an order of magnitude
in the most extreme case for too inflated planets, large eccentricities, and when the planet's tidal
properties are calculated according to its interior structural composition. This finding potentially
has significant implications on interpreting the period-eccentricity distribution of known
giant planets as it may naturally explain the large number of non-circularized, close period currently
known. Additionally, this work may help to constrain some models of planetary interiors, and contribute
to a better insight about how tides affect the orbital evolution of extrasolar systems.
