We present a first systematic comparison of superluminous Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) at late epochs,
including previously unpublished photometric and spectroscopic observations of SN 2007if, SN
2009dc and SNF20080723-012. Photometrically, the objects of our sample show a diverse late-time
behaviour, some of them fading quite rapidly after a light-curve break at ~150-200d. The latter
is likely the result of flux redistribution into the infrared, possibly caused by dust formation,
rather than a true bolometric effect. Nebular spectra of superluminous SNe Ia are characterised
by weak or absent [Fe III] emission, pointing at a low ejecta ionisation state as a result of high densities.
To constrain the ejecta and 56Ni masses of superluminous SNe Ia, we compare the observed bolometric
light curve of SN 2009dc with synthetic model light curves, focusing on the radioactive tail after
~60d. Models with enough 56Ni to explain the light-curve peak by radioactive decay, and at the same
time sufficient mass to keep the ejecta velocities low, fail to reproduce the observed light-curve
tail of SN 2009dc because of too much gamma-ray trapping. We instead propose a model with ~1 solar
mass of 56Ni and ~2 solar masses of ejecta, which may be interpreted as the explosion of a Chandrasekhar-mass
white dwarf (WD) enshrouded by 0.6-0.7 solar masses of C/O-rich material, as it could result from
a merger of two massive C/O WDs. This model reproduces the late light curve of SN 2009dc well. A flux
deficit at peak may be compensated by light from the interaction of the ejecta with the surrounding
material.
