Kepler-96 is an active solar-type star harbouring a Super-Earth planet in close orbit. Its age of
2.3 Gyr is the same as the Sun when there was a considerable increase of oxygen in Earth's atmosphere
due to micro-organisms living under the sea. We present the analysis of superflares seen on the transit
lightcurves of Kepler-96b. The model used here simulates the planetary transit in a flaring star.
By fitting the observational data with this model, it is possible to infer the physical properties
of the flares, such as their duration and the energy released. We found 3 flares within the energy
range of superflares, where the biggest superflare observed was found to have an energy of 1.81$\times$10$^{35}$
ergs. The goal is to analyse the biological impact of these superflares on a hypothetical Earth in
the habitable zone of Kepler-96 assuming this planet has protection via different scenarios: an
Archean and Present-day atmospheres. Also, we verify the attenuation of the flare UV radiation
through an Archean ocean. The conclusion is that considering the increase in the UV flux by the strongest
superflare emission, {\it E. Coli} and {\it D. Radiodurans} could survive on the surface of the planet
only if there was an ozone layer present on the planet atmosphere. However, they could escape from
the hazardous UV effects at a depth of 28m and 12m below the ocean surface, respectively. For smaller
superflares contribution, {\it D. Radiodurans} could survive in the surface even in an Archean
atmosphere with no ozone.
