Successive releases of Planck data have demonstrated the strength of the Sunyaev--Zeldovich (SZ)
effect in detecting hot baryons out to the galaxy cluster peripheries. To infer the hot gas pressure
structure from nearby galaxy clusters to more distant objects, we developed a parametric method
that models the spectral energy distribution and spatial anisotropies of both the Galactic thermal
dust and the Cosmic Microwave Background, that are mixed-up with the cluster SZ and dust signals.
Taking advantage of the best angular resolution of the High Frequency Instrument channels (5 arcmin)
and using X-ray priors in the innermost cluster regions that are not resolved with Planck, this modelling
allowed us to analyze a sample of 61 nearby members of the Planck catalog of SZ sources ($0 < z < 0.5$,
$\tilde{z} = 0.15$) using the full mission data, as well as to examine a distant sample of 23 clusters
($0.5 < z < 1$, $\tilde{z} = 0.56$) that have been recently followed-up with XMM-Newton and Chandra
observations. We find that (i) the average shape of the mass-scaled pressure profiles agrees with
results obtained by the Planck collaboration in the nearby cluster sample, and that (ii) no sign
of evolution is discernible between averaged pressure profiles of the low- and high-redshift cluster
samples. In line with theoretical predictions for these halo masses and redshift ranges, the dispersion
of individual profiles relative to a self-similar shape stays well below 10 % inside $r_{500}$ but
increases in the cluster outskirts.
