We present measurements of the mean and scatter of the IGM Lyman-{\alpha} opacity at 4.9 < z < 6.1 along
the lines of sight of 62 quasars at z > 5.7, the largest sample assembled at these redshifts to date
by a factor of two. The sample size enables us to sample cosmic variance at these redshifts more robustly
than ever before. The spectra used here were obtained by the SDSS, DES-VHS and SHELLQs collaborations,
drawn from the ESI and X-Shooter archives, reused from previous studies or observed specifically
for this work. We measure the effective optical depth of Lyman-{\alpha} in bins of 10, 30, 50 and 70
cMpc h-1, construct cumulative distribution functions under two treatments of upper limits on
flux and explore an empirical analytic fit to residual Lyman-{\alpha} transmission. We verify
the consistency of our results with those of previous studies via bootstrap re-sampling and confirm
the existence of tails towards high values in the opacity distributions, which may persist down
to z = 5.2. Comparing our results with predictions from cosmological simulations, we find further
strong evidence against models that include a spatially uniform ionizing background and temperature-density
relation. We also compare to IGM models that include either a fluctuating UVB dominated by rare quasars
or temperature fluctuations due to patchy reionization. Although both models produce better agreement
with the observations, neither fully captures the observed scatter in IGM opacity. Our sample of
62 z > 5.7 quasar spectra opens many avenues for future study of the reionisation epoch.
