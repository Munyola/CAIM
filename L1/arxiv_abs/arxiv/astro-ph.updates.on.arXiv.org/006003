In contemporary sub-stellar model atmospheres, dust growth occurs through neutral gas-phase
surface chemistry. Recently, there has been a growing body of theoretical and observational evidence
suggesting that ionisation processes can also occur. As a result, atmospheres are populated by
regions composed of plasma, gas and dust, and the consequent influence of plasma processes on dust
evolution is enhanced. This paper aims to introduce a new model of dust growth and destruction in
sub-stellar atmospheres via plasma deposition and plasma sputtering. Using example sub-stellar
atmospheres from Drift-Phoenix, we have compared plasma deposition and sputtering timescales
to those from neutral gas-phase surface chemistry to ascertain their regimes of influence. We calculated
the plasma sputtering yield and discuss the circumstances where plasma sputtering dominates over
deposition. Within the highest dust density cloud regions, plasma deposition and sputtering dominates
over neutral gas-phase surface chemistry if the degree of ionisation is $\gtrsim10^{-4}$. Loosely
bound grains with surface binding energies of the order of $0.1-1$ eV are susceptible to destruction
through plasma sputtering for feasible degrees of ionisation and electron temperatures; whereas,
strong crystalline grains with binding energies of the order $10$ eV are resistant to sputtering.
The mathematical framework outlined sets the foundation for the inclusion of plasma deposition
and plasma sputtering in global dust cloud formation models of sub-stellar atmospheres.
