Unipolar, axisymmetric sunspots are figuratively called "theoretician's sunspots" because
their simplicity supposedly makes them more suitable for theoretical descriptions or numerical
models. On 2013 November 18, a very large specimen (active region NOAA 11899) crossed the central
meridian of the Sun. The moat flow associated with this very large spot is quantitatively compared
to that of a medium and a small sunspot to determine the extend of the moat flow in different environments.
We employ continuum images and magnetograms of the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) as well
as extreme ultraviolet (EUV) images at $\lambda$160 nm of the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA),
both on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), to measure horizontal proper motions with Local
Correlation Tracking (LCT) and flux transport velocities with the Differential Affine Velocity
Estimator (DAVE). We compute time-averaged flow maps ($\pm$6 hours around meridian passage) and
radial averages of photometric, magnetic and flow properties. Flow fields of a small- and a medium-sized
axisymmetric sunspot provide the context for interpreting the results. All sunspots show the outward
moat flow and the advection of moving magnetic features (MMFs). However, the extent of the moat flow
varies from spot to spot but a correlation of flow properties with size is tenuous, if at all present.
The moat flow is asymmetric and predominantly in the east-west direction, whereby deviations are
related to the tilt angle of the sunspot group as well as to the topology and activity level of the trailing
plage.
