In this paper, we report the development of a java application for the Superposition T-matrix code,
JaSTA (Java Superposition T-matrix App), to study the light scattering properties of aggregate
structures. It has been developed using Netbeans 7.1.2, which is a java integrated development
environment (IDE). The JaSTA uses double precession superposition codes for multi-sphere clusters
in random orientation developed by Mackowski and Mischenko (1996). It consists of a graphical user
interface (GUI) in the front hand and a database of related data in the back hand. Both the interactive
GUI and database package directly enable a user to model by self-monitoring respective input parameters
(namely, wavelength, complex refractive indices, grain size, etc.) to study the related optical
properties of cosmic dust (namely, extinction, polarization, etc.) instantly, i.e., with zero
computational time. This increases the efficiency of the user. The database of JaSTA is now created
for a few sets of input parameters with a plan to create a large database in future. This application
also has an option where users can compile and run the scattering code directly for aggregates in
GUI environment. The JaSTA aims to provide convenient and quicker data analysis of the optical properties
which can be used in different fields like planetary science, atmospheric science, nano science,
etc. The current version of this software is developed for the Linux and Windows platform to study
the light scattering properties of small aggregates which will be extended for larger aggregates
using parallel codes in future.
