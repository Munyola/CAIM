Orbital evolution of binary systems in dense stellar clusters is important in a variety of contexts:
origin of blue stragglers, progenitors of compact object mergers, millisecond pulsars, and so
on. Here we consider the general problem of secular evolution of the orbital elements of a binary
system driven by the smooth tidal field of an axisymmetric stellar cluster (globular, nuclear,
etc.) in which the binary orbits. We derive a secular Hamiltonian (averaged over both the inner Keplerian
orbit of the binary and its outer orbit within the cluster) valid to quadrupole order for an arbitrary
cluster potential and explore its characteristics. This doubly-averaged 'tidal' Hamiltonian
depends on just two parameters, which fully absorb the information about the background cluster
potential and the binary's orbit within it: a dimensional parameter $A$ setting the secular timescale,
and a dimensionless parameter $\Gamma$ which determines the phase portrait of the binary's inner
orbital evolution. We examine the dependence of $A$ and $\Gamma$ on cluster potential (both spherical
and axisymmetric) and on the binary orbit within the cluster. Our theory reproduces known secular
results - such as Lidov-Kozai evolution and the effect of the Galactic tide on Oort Cloud comets -
in appropriate limits, but is more general. It provides a universal framework for understanding
dynamical evolution of various types of binaries driven by the smooth tidal field of any axisymmetric
potential. In a companion paper (Hamilton & Rafikov 2019b) we provide a detailed exploration of
the resulting orbital dynamics.
