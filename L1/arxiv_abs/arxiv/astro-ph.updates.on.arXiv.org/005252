This is the first of a series of papers presenting the results from our survey of 25 Galactic globular
clusters with the MUSE integral-field spectrograph. In combination with our dedicated algorithm
for source deblending, MUSE provides unique multiplex capabilities in crowded stellar fields
and allows us to acquire samples of up to 20 000 stars within the half-light radius of each cluster.
The present paper focuses on the analysis of the internal dynamics of 22 out of the 25 clusters, using
about 500 000 spectra of 200 000 individual stars. Thanks to the large stellar samples per cluster,
we are able to perform a detailed analysis of the central rotation and dispersion fields using both
radial profiles and two-dimensional maps. The velocity dispersion profiles we derive show a good
general agreement with existing radial velocity studies but typically reach closer to the cluster
centres. By comparison with proper motion data we derive or update the dynamical distance estimates
to 14 clusters. Compared to previous dynamical distance estimates for 47 Tuc, our value is in much
better agreement with other methods. We further find significant (>3sigma) rotation in the majority
(13/22) of our clusters. Our analysis seems to confirm earlier findings of a link between rotation
and the ellipticities of globular clusters. In addition, we find a correlation between the strengths
of internal rotation and the relaxation times of the clusters, suggesting that the central rotation
fields are relics of the cluster formation that are gradually dissipated via two-body relaxation.
