Opacity enhancements for stellar interior conditions have been explored to explain observed pulsation
frequencies and to extend the pulsation instability region for B-type main-sequence variable
stars. For these stars, the pulsations are driven in the region of the opacity bump of Fe-group elements
at $\sim$200,000 K in the stellar envelope. Here we explore effects of opacity enhancements for
the somewhat cooler main-sequence A-type stars, in which $p$-mode pulsations are driven instead
in the second helium ionization region at $\sim$50,000 K. We compare models using the new LANL OPLIB
vs. LLNL OPAL opacities for the AGSS09 solar mixture. For models of 2 solar masses and effective temperature
7600 K, opacity enhancements have only a mild effect on pulsations, shifting mode frequencies and/or
slightly changing kinetic-energy growth rates. Increased opacity near the bump at 200,000 K can
induce convection that may alter composition gradients created by diffusive settling and radiative
levitation. Opacity increases around the hydrogen and 1st He ionization region (13,000 K) can cause
additional higher-frequency $p$ modes to be excited, raising the possibility that improved treatment
of these layers may result in prediction of new modes that could be tested by observations. New or
wider convective zones and higher convective velocities produced by opacity increases could also
affect angular momentum transport during evolution. More work needs to be done to quantify the effects
of opacity on the boundaries of the pulsation instability regions for A-type stars.
