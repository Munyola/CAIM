We analyze and model an M1.2 non-eruptive solar flare on 2011 September 9. The flare exhibits a strong
late-phase peak of the warm coronal emissions ($\sim$3~MK) in extreme-ultraviolet (EUV), with
peak emission over 1.3 times that of the main flare peak. Multiple flare ribbons are observed, whose
evolution indicates a two-stage energy release process. A non-linear force-free field (NLFFF)
extrapolation reveals the existence of a magnetic null point, a fan-spine structure, and two flux
ropes embedded in the fan dome. Magnetic reconnections involved in the flare are driven by the destabilization
and rise of one of the flux ropes. In the first stage, the fast ascending flux rope drives reconnections
at the null point and the surrounding quasi-separatrix layer (QSL), while in the second stage, reconnection
mainly occurs between the two legs of the field lines stretched by the eventually stopped flux rope.
The late-phase loops are mainly produced by the first-stage QSL reconnection, while the second-stage
reconnection is responsible for the heating of main flaring loops. The first-stage reconnection
is believed to be more powerful, leading to an extremely strong EUV late phase. We find that the delayed
occurrence of the late-phase peak is mainly due to the long cooling process of the long late-phase
loops. Using the model enthalpy-based thermal evolution of loops (EBTEL), we model the EUV emissions
from a late-phase loop. The modeling reveals a peak heating rate of 1.1~erg~cm$^{-3}$~s$^{-1}$
for the late-phase loop, which is obviously higher than previous values.
