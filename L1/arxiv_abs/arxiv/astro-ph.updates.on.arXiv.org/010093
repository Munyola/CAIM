The observed present-day stellar mass function (PDMF) of the solar neighborhood is a mixture of
stellar populations born in star-forming events that occurred over the life-time of the thin disk
of the Galaxy. Assuming stars form in embedded clusters which have stellar initial mass functions
(IMFs) which depend on the metallicity and density of the star-forming gas clumps, the integrated
galaxy-wide IMF (IGIMF) can be calculated. The shape of the IGIMF thus depends on the SFR and metallicity.
Here, the shape of the PDMF for stars more massive than $1\,M_\odot$ in combination with the mass
density in low-mass stars is used to constrain the current star-formation rate (SFR), the star formation
history (SFH) and the current stellar plus remnant mass ($M_*$) in the Galactic thin disk. This yields
the current SFR, $\dot{M}_*= 4.1^{+3.1}_{-2.8}~M_\odot$yr$^{-1}$, a declining SFH and $M_*=2.1^{+3.0}_{-1.5}\times
10^{11}M_\odot$, respectively, with a V-band stellar mass-to-light ratio of $M_*/L_V=2.79^{+0.48}_{-0.38}$.These
values are consistent with independent measurements. We also quantify the surface density of black
holes and neutron stars in the Galactic thin disk. The invariant canonical IMF can reproduce the
PDMF of the Galaxy as well as the IGIMF, but in the universal IMF framework it is not possible to constrain
any of the above Galactic properties. Assuming the IGMF theory is the correct framework and in combination
with the vertical velocity dispersion data of stars, it follows that the Milky Way would have appeared
as a chain galaxy at high redshift.
