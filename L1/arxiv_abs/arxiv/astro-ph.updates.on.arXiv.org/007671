The study of extrasolar planets and of the Solar System provides complementary pieces of the mosaic
represented by the process of planetary formation. Exoplanets are essential to fully grasp the
huge diversity of outcomes that planetary formation and the subsequent evolution of the planetary
systems can produce. The orbital and basic physical data we currently possess for the bulk of the
exoplanetary population, however, do not provide enough information to break the intrinsic degeneracy
of their histories, as different evolutionary tracks can result in the same final configurations.
The lessons learned from the Solar System indicate us that the solution to this problem lies in the
information contained in the composition of planets. The goal of the Atmospheric Remote-Sensing
Infrared Exoplanet Large-survey (ARIEL), one of the three candidates as ESA M4 space mission, is
to observe a large and diversified population of transiting planets around a range of host star types
to collect information on their atmospheric composition. ARIEL will focus on warm and hot planets
to take advantage of their well-mixed atmospheres, which should show minimal condensation and
sequestration of high-Z materials and thus reveal their bulk composition across all main cosmochemical
elements. In this work we will review the most outstanding open questions concerning the way planets
form and the mechanisms that contribute to create habitable environments that the compositional
information gathered by ARIEL will allow to tackle
