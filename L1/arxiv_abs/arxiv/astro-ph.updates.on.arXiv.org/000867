[Abridged] We present an integrated photometric spectral energy distribution (SED) of the Magellanic-type
galaxy NGC 4449 from the far-ultraviolet (UV) to the submillimetre, including new observations
acquired by the Herschel Space Observatory. We include integrated UV photometry from the Swift
Ultraviolet and Optical Telescope using a measurement technique which is appropriate for extended
sources with coincidence loss. In this paper, we examine the available multiwavelength data to
infer a range of ages, metallicities and star formation rates for the underlying stellar populations,
as well as the composition and the total mass of dust in NGC 4449. We present an iterative scheme, which
allows us to build an in-depth and multicomponent representation of NGC 4449 `bottom-up', taking
advantage of the broad capabilities of the photoionization and radiative transfer code MOCASSIN
(MOnte CArlo SimulationS of Ionized Nebulae). We fit the observed SED, the global ionization structure
and the emission line intensities, and infer a recent SFR of 0.4 Msolar/yr and a total stellar mass
of approximately 1e9 Msolar emitting with a bolometric luminosity of 5.7e9 Lsolar. Our fits yield
a total dust mass of 2.9e6 Msolar including 2 per cent attributed to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.
We deduce a dust to gas mass ratio of 1/190 within the modelled region. While we do not consider possible
additional contributions from even colder dust, we note that including the extended HI envelope
and the molecular gas is likely to bring the ratio down to as low as ~ 1/800.
