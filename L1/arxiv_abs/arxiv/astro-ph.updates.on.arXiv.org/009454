We derive NUV luminosity functions for 6471 NUV detected galaxies in 28 $0.02 < z < 0.08$ clusters
and consider their dependence on cluster properties. We consider optically red and blue galaxies
and explore how their NUV LFs vary in several cluster subsamples, selected to best show the influence
of environment. Our composite LF is well fit by the Schechter form with $M^*_{NUV}=-18.98 \pm 0.07$
and $\alpha=-1.87 \pm 0.03$ in good agreement with values for the Coma centre and the Shapley supercluster,
but with a steeper slope and brighter $L^*$ than in Virgo. The steep slope is due to the contribution
of massive quiescent galaxies that are faint in the NUV. There are significant differences in the
NUV LFs for clusters having low and high X-ray luminosities and for sparse and dense clusters, though
none are particularly well fitted by the Schechter form, making a physical interpretation of the
parameters difficult. When splitting clusters into two subsamples by X-ray luminosity, the ratio
of low to high NUV luminosity galaxies is higher in the high X-ray luminosity subsample (i.e the luminosity
function is steeper across the sampled luminosity range). In subsamples split by surface density,
when characterised by Schechter functions the dense clusters have an $M^*$ about a magnitude fainter
than that of the sparse clusters and $\alpha$ is steeper ($-1.9$ vs. $-1.6$ respectively). The differences
in the data appear to be driven by changes in the LF of blue (star-forming) galaxies. This appears
to be related to interactions with the cluster gas [abridged]
