Intrinsic alignments of galaxies are a significant astrophysical systematic affecting cosmological
constraints from weak gravitational lensing. Obtaining numerical predictions from hydrodynamical
simulations of expected survey volumes is expensive, and a cheaper alternative relies on populating
large dark matter-only simulations with accurate models of alignments calibrated on smaller hydrodynamical
runs. This requires connecting the shapes and orientations of galaxies to those of dark matter haloes
and to the large-scale structure. In this paper, we characterise galaxy-halo alignments in the
Horizon-AGN cosmological hydrodynamical simulation. We compare the shapes and orientations
of galaxies in the redshift range $0<z<3$ to those of their embedding dark matter haloes, and to the
matching haloes of a twin dark-matter only run with identical initial conditions. We find that galaxy
ellipticities in general cannot be predicted directly from halo ellipticities. The mean misalignment
angle between the minor axis of a galaxy and its embedding halo is a function of halo mass, with residuals
arising from the dependence of alignment on galaxy type, but not on environment. Haloes are much
more strongly aligned among themselves than galaxies, and they decrease their alignment towards
low redshift. Galaxy alignments compete with this effect, as galaxies tend to increase their alignment
with haloes towards low redshift. We discuss the implications of these results for current halo
models of intrinsic alignments and suggest several avenues for improvement.
