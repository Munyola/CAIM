The morphology of galaxy clusters is for the first time approached on synthetic maps of thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich
effect applying several morphological parameters. Five parameters have been already largely
applied on X-ray maps of clusters, while two are introduced in this work to be used specifically for
cluster observations in the microwave region. We also introduce a general parameter, which properly
combines the single ones, segregating more efficiently relaxed and disturbed clusters, as defined
by common theoretical 3D indicators. Our analysis is applied on a sample of 258 massive clusters
(M$>5\times10^{14}h^{-1}$M$_\odot$ at $z=0$) extracted from the MUSIC hydrodynamical simulations
at four redshifts from 0.43 to 0.82, including radiative processes of cooling and star formation
(CSF), as well as non-radiative physics (NR). The stability of each parameter is tested on maps obtained
from different lines of sight for a couple of clusters classified as relaxed and disturbed. A correlation
between the parameters estimated on a subsample of our catalogue on X-ray maps and SZ maps is evaluated
and found to be strong only for the concentration parameter. Furthermore, we investigate the correlation
between the general morphological parameter and the hydrostatic mass bias, finding it to be low.
Finally we compute the 2D projected shift between the SZ centroid and the centre of mass of the cluster
finding it to be strongly correlated with the morphology of the cluster and possibly resulting as
good observational dynamical state indicator, assuming the latter to represent the position of
the BCG.
