We present the discovery of two galaxy overdensities in the HST UDF: a proto-cluster, HUDFJ0332.4-2746.6
at $z = 1.84 \pm 0.01$, and a group, HUDFJ0332.5-2747.3 at $z =1.90 \pm 0.01$. The velocity dispersion
of HUDFJ0332.4-2746.6 implies a mass of $M_{200}= (2.2 \pm 1.8) \times 10^{14} M_{\odot}$, consistent
with the lack of extended X-ray emission. Neither overdensity shows evidence of a red sequence.
About $50\%$ of their members show interactions and/or disturbed morphologies, which are a signature
of merger remnants. Most of their morphologically classified ETGs have blue colors and show recent
star-formation. These observations reveal for the first time large fractions of spectroscopically
confirmed star-forming blue ETGs in proto-clusters at $z\approx 2$. These star-forming ETGs are
most likely among the progenitors of the quiescent population in clusters at more recent epochs.
Their mass-size relation is consistent with that of passive ETGs in clusters at $z\sim0.7-1.5$.
If these galaxies are the progenitors of cluster ETGs at these lower redshifts, their size would
evolve according to a similar mass-size relation. It is noteworthy that quiescent ETGs in clusters
at $z=1.8-2$ also do not show any significant size evolution over this redshift range, contrary
to field ETGs. The ETG fraction of our sample is $\lesssim 40\%$, compared to the typical quiescent
ETG fraction of $\approx 80\%$ in cluster cores at $z< 1$. The fraction, masses and colors of the
newly discovered ETGs imply that other cluster ETGs will be formed/accreted at later time.
