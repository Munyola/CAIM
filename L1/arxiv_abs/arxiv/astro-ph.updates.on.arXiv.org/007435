It has long been shown that the extreme ultraviolet spectrum of the ionizing stars of H II regions
can be estimated by comparing the observed line emission to detailed models. In the Galactic Center
(GC), however, previous observations have shown that the ionizing spectral energy distribution
(SED) of the local photon field is strange, producing both very low excitation ionized gas (indicative
of ionization by late O stars) and also widespread diffuse emission from atoms too highly ionized
to be found in normal H II regions. This paper describes the analysis of all the GC spectra taken by
Spitzer's Infrared Spectrograph and downloaded from the Spitzer Heritage Archive. In it, H II region
densities and abundances are described, and serendipitously discovered candidate planetary
nebulae, compact shocks, and candidate young stellar objects are tabulated. Models were computed
with Cloudy, using SEDs from Starburst99 plus additional X-rays, and compared to the observed mid-infrared
forbidden and recombination lines. The ages inferred from the model fits do not agree with recent
proposed star formation sequences (star formation in the GC occurring along streams of gas with
density enhancements caused by close encounters with the black hole, Sgr A*), with Sgr~B1, Sgr~C,
and the Arches Cluster being all about the same age, around 4.5 Myr old, with similar X-ray requirements.
The fits for the Quintuplet Cluster appear to give a younger age, but that could be caused by higher-energy
photons from shocks from stellar winds or from a supernova.
