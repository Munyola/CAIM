Despite the recent rapid progress in numerical relativity, a convergence order less than the second
has so far plagued codes solving the Einstein-Euler system of equations. We report simulations
of the inspiral of binary neutron stars in quasi-circular orbits computed with a new code employing
high-order, high-resolution shock-capturing, finite-differencing schemes that, for the first
time, go beyond the second-order barrier. In particular, without any tuning or alignment, we measure
a convergence order above three both in the phase and in the amplitude of the gravitational waves.
Because the new code is able to calculate waveforms with very small phase errors already at modest
resolutions, we are able to obtain accurate estimates of tidal effects in the inspiral that are essentially
free from the large numerical viscosity typical of lower-order methods, and even for the challenging
large compactness and small-deformability binary considered here. We find a remarkable agreement
between our Richardson-extrapolated waveform and the one from the tidally corrected post-Newtonian
(PN) Taylor-T4 model, with a de-phasing smaller than 0.2 radians during the seven orbits of the inspiral
and up to the contact point. Because our results can be used reliably to assess the validity of the
PN or other approximations at frequencies significantly larger than those considered so far in
the literature, they seem to exclude at these compactnesses significant tidal amplifications
from next-to-next-to-leading--order terms in the PN expansion.
