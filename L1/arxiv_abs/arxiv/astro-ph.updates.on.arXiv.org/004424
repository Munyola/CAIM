We use the Aurora radiation-hydrodynamical simulations to study the mean free path (MFP) for hydrogen
ionizing photons during the epoch of reionization. We directly measure the MFP by averaging the
distance 1 Ry photons travel before reaching an optical depth of unity along random lines-of-sight.
During reionization the free paths tend to end in neutral gas with densities near the cosmic mean,
while after reionizaton the end points tend to be overdense but highly ionized. Despite the increasing
importance of discrete, over-dense systems, the cumulative contribution of systems with $N_{\rm{HI}}
\lesssim 10^{16.5}~{\rm cm^{-2}}$ suffices to drive the MFP at $z \approx 6$, while at earlier times
higher column densities are more important. After reionization the typical size of HI systems is
close to the local Jeans length, but during reionization it is much larger. The mean free path for
photons originating close to galaxies, $\rm{MFP_{gal}}$, is much smaller than the cosmic MFP.
After reionization this enhancement can remain significant up to starting distances of $\sim 1$
comoving Mpc. During reionization, however, $\rm{MFP_{gal}}$ for distances $\sim 10^2 - 10^3$
comoving kpc typically exceeds the cosmic MFP. These findings have important consequences for
models that interpret the intergalactic MFP as the distance escaped ionizing photons can travel
from galaxies before being absorbed and may cause them to under-estimate the required escape fraction
from galaxies, and/or the required emissivity of ionizing photons after reionization.
