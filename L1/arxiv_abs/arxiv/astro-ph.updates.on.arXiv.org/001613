We study the secular, hierarchical three-body problem to first-order in a post-Newtonian expansion
of General Relativity. We expand the first-order post-Newtonian Hamiltonian to leading-order
in the ratio of the semi-major axis of the two orbits. In addition to the well-known terms that correspond
to the GR precession of the inner and outer orbits, we find a new secular post-Newtonian interaction
term that can affect the long-term evolution of the triple. We explore the parameter space for highly
inclined and eccentric systems, where the Kozai-Lidov mechanism can produce large-amplitude
oscillations in the eccentricities. The standard lore, i.e., that General Relativity effects
suppress eccentricity, is only consistent with the parts of phase space where the General Relativity
timescales are several orders of magnitude shorter than the secular Newtonian one. In other parts
of phase space, however, post-Newtonian corrections combined with the three body ones, can excite
eccentricities. In particular, for systems where the General Relativity timescale is comparable
to the secular Newtonian timescales, the three-body interactions give rise to a resonant-like
eccentricity excitation. Furthermore, for triples with a comparable-mass inner binary, where
the eccentric Kozai-Lidov mechanism is suppressed, post-Newtonian corrections can further increase
the eccentricity and lead to orbital flips even when the timescale of the former is much longer than
the timescale of the secular Kozai-Lidov quadrupole perturbations.
