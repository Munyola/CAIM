The metallicity and its relationship with other galactic properties is a fundamental probe of the
evolution of galaxies. In this work, we select about 750,000 star-forming spatial pixels from 1122
blue galaxies in the MaNGA survey to investigate the global stellar mass - local stellar mass surface
density - gas-phase metallicity ($M_*$ - $\Sigma_*$ - $Z$ ) relation. At a fixed $M_*$, the metallicity
increases steeply with increasing $\Sigma_*$. Similarly, at a fixed $\Sigma_*$, the metallicity
increases strongly with increasing $M_*$ at low mass end, while this trend becomes less obvious
at high mass end. We find the metallicity to be more strongly correlated to $\Sigma_*$ than to $M_*$.
Furthermore, we construct a tight (0.07 dex scatter) $M_*$ - $\Sigma_*$ - $Z$ relation, which reduces
the scatter in the $\Sigma_*$ - $Z$ relation by about 30$\%$ for galaxies with $7.8 < {\rm log}(M_*/M_\odot)
< 11.0$, while the reduction of scatter is much weaker for high-mass galaxies. This result suggests
that, especially for low-mass galaxies, the $M_*$ - $\Sigma_*$ - $Z$ relation is largely more fundamental
than the $M_*$ - $Z$ and $\Sigma_*$ - $Z$ relations, meaning that both $M_*$ and $\Sigma_*$ play important
roles in shaping the local metallicity. We also find that the local metallicity is probably independent
on the local star formation rate surface density at a fixed $M_*$ and $\Sigma_*$. Our results are
consistent with the scenario that the local metallicities in galaxies are shaped by the combination
of the local stars formed in the history and the metal loss caused by galactic winds.
