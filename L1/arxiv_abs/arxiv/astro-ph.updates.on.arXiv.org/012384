One of the most robust observations of the stellar initial mass function (IMF) is its near-universality
in the Milky Way and neighboring galaxies. But recent observations of early-type galaxies can be
interpreted to imply a bottom-heavy IMF, while others of ultra-faint dwarfs could imply a top-heavy
IMF. This would impose powerful constraints on star formation models. We explore what sort of cloud-scale
IMF models could possibly satisfy these constraints. We utilize simulated galaxies which reproduce
(broadly) the observed galaxy properties, while they also provide the detailed star formation
history and properties of each progenitor star-forming cloud. We then consider generic models
where the characteristic mass of the IMF is some arbitrary power-law function of progenitor cloud
properties, along with well-known literature IMF models, which scale with Jeans mass, turbulent
Bonnor-Ebert mass, temperature, the opacity limit, metallicity, or the protostellar heating
mass. We show that no IMF models currently in the literature - nor any model where the turnover mass
is an arbitrary power-law function of a combination of cloud temperature/density/size/metallicity/velocity
dispersion/magnetic field - can reproduce the claimed IMF variation in ellipticals or dwarfs without
severely violating observational constraints in the Milky Way. Specifically, they predict too
much variation in the extreme environments of the Galaxy, compared to that observed. Either the
IMF varies in a more complicated manner, or alternative interpretations of the extragalactic observations
must be explored.
