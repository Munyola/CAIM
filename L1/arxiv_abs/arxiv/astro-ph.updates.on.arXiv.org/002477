Two-dimensional simulations of hot Jupiter upper atmospheres including the planet's magnetic
field are presented. The goal is to explore magnetic effects on the layer of the atmosphere that is
ionized and heated by stellar EUV radiation, and the imprint of these effects on the Ly$\alpha$ transmission
spectrum. The simulations are axisymmetric, isothermal, and include both rotation and azimuth-averaged
stellar tides. Mass density is converted to atomic hydrogen density through the assumption of ionization
equilibrium. The three-zone structure -- polar dead zone, mid-latitude wind zone, and equatorial
dead zone -- found in previous analytic calculations is confirmed. For a magnetic field comparable
to that of Jupiter, the equatorial dead zone, which is confined by the magnetic field and corotates
with the planet, contributes at least half of the transit signal. For even stronger fields, the gas
escaping in the mid-latitude wind zone is found to have a smaller contribution to the transit depth
than the equatorial dead zone. Transmission spectra computed from the simulations are compared
to HST STIS and ACS data for HD 209458b and HD 189733b, and the range of model parameters consistent
with the data is found. The central result of this paper is that the transit depth increases strongly
with magnetic field strength when the hydrogen ionization layer is magnetically dominated, for
dipole magnetic field $B_0 > 10\ {\rm G}$. Hence transit depth is sensitive to magnetic field
strength, in addition to standard quantities such as the ratio of thermal to gravitational binding
energies.
