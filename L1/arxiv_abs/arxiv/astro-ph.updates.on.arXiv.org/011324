We present deep CCS and HC$_7$N observations of the L1495-B218 filaments in the Taurus molecular
cloud obtained using the K-band focal plane array on the 100m Green Bank Telescope. We observed the
L1495-B218 filaments in CCS $J_N$ = 2$_1$$-$1$_0$ and HC$_7$N $J$ = 21$-$20 with a spectral resolution
of 0.038 km s$^{-1}$ and an angular resolution of 31$''$. We observed strong CCS emission in both
evolved and young regions and weak emission in two evolved regions. HC$_7$N emission is observed
only in L1495A-N and L1521D. We find that CCS and HC$_7$N intensity peaks do not coincide with NH$_3$
or dust continuum intensity peaks. We also find that the fractional abundance of CCS does not show
a clear correlation with the dynamical evolutionary stage of dense cores. Our findings and chemical
modeling indicate that the fractional abundances of CCS and HC$_7$N are sensitive to the initial
gas-phase C/O ratio, and they are good tracers of young condensed gas only when the initial C/O is
close to solar value. Kinematic analysis using multiple lines including NH$_3$, HC$_7$N, CCS,
CO, HCN, \& HCO$^+$ suggests that there may be three different star formation modes in the L1495-B218
filaments. At the hub of the filaments, L1495A/B7N has formed a stellar cluster with large-scale
inward flows (fast mode), while L1521D, a core embedded in a filament, is slowly contracting due
to its self-gravity (slow mode). There is also one isolated core that appears to be marginally stable
and may undergo quasi-static evolution (isolated mode).
