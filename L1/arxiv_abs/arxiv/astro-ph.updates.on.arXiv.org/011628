The velocity dispersion of the ultra diffuse galaxy NGC1052-DF2 was found to be $\sigma_{\rm gc}=7.8^{+5.2}_{-2.2}
\ \mathrm{kms^{-1}}$, much lower than expected from the stellar mass -- halo mass relation and nearly
identical to the expected value from the stellar mass alone. This result was based on the radial velocities
of ten luminous globular clusters that were assumed to be associated with the galaxy. A more precise
measurement is possible from high resolution spectroscopy of the diffuse stellar light. Here we
present an integrated spectrum of the diffuse light of NGC1052-DF2 obtained with the Keck Cosmic
Web Imager, with an instrumental resolution of $\sigma_{\rm instr}\approx 12 \ \mathrm{kms^{-1}}$.
The systemic velocity of the galaxy is $v_{\rm sys}=1805\pm 1.1 \ \mathrm{kms^{-1}}$, in very good
agreement with the average velocity of the globular clusters ($\langle v_{\rm gc}\rangle = 1803\pm
2 \ \mathrm{kms^{-1}}$). There is no evidence for rotation within the KCWI field of view. We find
a stellar velocity dispersion of $\sigma_{\rm stars}=8.4 \pm 2.1 \ \mathrm{kms^{-1}}$, consistent
with the dispersion that was derived from the globular clusters. The implied dynamical mass within
the half-light radius $r_{1/2}=2.7 \ \mathrm{kpc}$ is $M_{\rm dyn}= (1.3 \pm 0.8) \times 10^8 $
M$_{\odot}$, similar to the stellar mass within that radius ($M_{\rm stars}=(1.0 \pm 0.2) \times
10^8 \ \mathrm{M}_{\odot}$). With this confirmation of the low velocity dispersion of NGC1052-DF2,
the most urgent question is whether this "missing dark matter problem" is unique to this galaxy or
applies more widely.
