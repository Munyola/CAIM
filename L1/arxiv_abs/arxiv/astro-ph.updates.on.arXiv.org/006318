The main objective of the Cosmic-Ray Extremely Distributed Observatory (CREDO) is the detection
and analysis of extended cosmic ray phenomena, so-called super-preshowers (SPS), using existing
as well as new infrastructure (cosmic-ray observatories, educational detectors, single detectors
etc.). The search for ensembles of cosmic ray events initiated by SPS is yet an untouched ground,
in contrast to the current state-of-the-art analysis, which is focused on the detection of single
cosmic ray events. Theoretical explanation of SPS could be given either within classical (e.g.,
photon-photon interaction) or exotic (e.g., Super Heavy Dark Matter decay or annihilation) scenarios,
thus detection of SPS would provide a better understanding of particle physics, high energy astrophysics
and cosmology. The ensembles of cosmic rays can be classified based on the spatial and temporal extent
of particles constituting the ensemble. Some classes of SPS are predicted to have huge spatial distribution,
a unique signature detectable only with a facility of the global size. Since development and commissioning
of a completely new facility with such requirements is economically unwarranted and time-consuming,
the global analysis goals are achievable when all types of existing detectors are merged into a worldwide
network. The idea to use the instruments in operation is based on a novel trigger algorithm: in parallel
to looking for neighbour surface detectors receiving the signal simultaneously, one should also
look for spatially isolated stations clustered in a small time window.
