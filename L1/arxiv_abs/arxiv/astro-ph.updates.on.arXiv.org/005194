Historical Ca II K spectroheliograms (SHG) are unique in representing long-term variations of
the solar chromospheric magnetic field. They usually suffer from numerous problems and lack photometric
calibration. Thus accurate processing of these data is required to get meaningful results from
their analysis. In this paper we aim at developing an automatic processing and photometric calibration
method that provides precise and consistent results when applied to historical SHG. The proposed
method is based on the assumption that the centre-to-limb variation of the intensity in quiet Sun
regions does not vary with time. We tested the accuracy of the proposed method on various sets of synthetic
images that mimic problems encountered in historical observations. We also tested our approach
on a large sample of images randomly extracted from seven different SHG archives. The tests carried
out on the synthetic data show that the maximum relative errors of the method are generally <6.5%,
while the average error is <1%, even if rather poor quality observations are considered. In the absence
of strong artefacts the method returns images that differ from the ideal ones by <2% in any pixel.
The method gives consistent values for both plage and network areas. We also show that our method
returns consistent results for images from different SHG archives. Our tests show that the proposed
method is more accurate than other methods presented in the literature. Our method can also be applied
to process images from photographic archives of solar observations at other wavelengths than Ca
II K.
