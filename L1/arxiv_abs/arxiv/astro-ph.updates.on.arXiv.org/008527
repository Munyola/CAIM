Comets are a remarkable feature in our night sky, visible on their passage through the inner Solar
system as the Sun's energy sublimates ices and liberates surface material, generating beautiful
comae, dust, and ion tails. Comets are also thought to orbit other stars, and are the most promising
interpretation of sporadic absorption features (i.e. transits) seen in spectra of stars such as
$\beta$ Pictoris and 49 Ceti. These `exocomets' are thought to form and evolve in the same way as in
the Solar system, and as in the Solar system we may gain insight into their origins by deriving their
orbits. In the case of $\beta$ Pictoris, orbits have been estimated indirectly, using the radial
velocity of the absorption features coupled with a physical evaporation model to estimate the stellocentric
distance at transit $d_{\rm tr}$. Here, we note that the inferred $d_{\rm tr}$ imply that some absorption
signatures should accelerate over several hours, and show that this acceleration is indeed seen
in HARPS spectra. This new constraint means that orbital characteristics can be obtained directly,
and the pericentre distance and longitude constrained when parabolic orbits are assumed. The results
from fitting orbits to 12 accelerating features, and a handful of non-accelerating ones, are in
broad agreement with previous estimates based on an evaporation model, thereby providing some
validation of the exocomet hypothesis. A prediction of the evaporation model, that coma absorption
is deeper for more distant transits, is also seen here.
