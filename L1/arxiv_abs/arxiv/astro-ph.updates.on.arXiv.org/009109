We present infrared (IR) and submillimeter observations of the Crab-like supernova remnant (SNR)
G54.1+0.3 including 350 micron (SHARC-II), 870 micron (LABOCA), 70, 100, 160, 250, 350, 500 micron
(Herschel) and 3-40 micron (Spitzer). We detect dust features at 9, 11 and 21 micron and a long wavelength
continuum dust component. The 21 micron dust coincides with [Ar II] ejecta emission, and the feature
is remarkably similar to that in Cas A. The IRAC 8 micron image including Ar ejecta is distributed
in a shell-like morphology which is coincident with dust features, suggesting that dust has formed
in the ejecta. We create a cold dust map that shows excess emission in the northwestern shell. We fit
the spectral energy distribution of the SNR using the continuous distributions of ellipsoidal
(CDE) grain model of pre-solar grain SiO2 that reproduces the 21 and 9 micron dust features and discuss
grains of SiC and PAH that may be responsible for the 10-13 micron dust features. To reproduce the
long-wavelength continuum, we explore models consisting of different grains including Mg2SiO4,
MgSiO3, Al2O3, FeS, carbon, and Fe3O4. We tested a model with a temperature-dependent silicate
absorption coefficient. We detect cold dust (27-44 K) in the remnant, making this the fourth such
SNR with freshly-formed dust. The total dust mass in the SNR ranges from 0.08-0.9 Msun depending
on the grain composition, which is comparable to predicted masses from theoretical models. Our
estimated dust masses are consistent with the idea that SNe are a significant source of dust in the
early Universe.
