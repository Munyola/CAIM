With our neutron star crust cooling code {\tt NSCool} we track the thermal evolution of the neutron
star in Aql X-1 over the full accretion outburst history from 1996 until 2015. For the first time,
we model many outbursts (23 outbursts were detected) collectively and in great detail. This allows
us to investigate the influence of previous outbursts on the internal temperature evolution and
to test different neutron star crust cooling scenarios. Aql X-1 is an ideal test source for this purpose,
because it shows frequent, short outbursts and thermally dominated quiescence spectra. The source
goes into outburst roughly once a year for a few months. Assuming that the quiescent {\it Swift}/XRT
observations of Aql X-1 can be explained within the crust cooling scenario (Waterhouse et al. 2016),
we find three main conclusions. Firstly, the data are well reproduced by our model if the envelope
composition and shallow heating parameters are allowed to change between outbursts. This is not
the case if both shallow heating parameters (strength and depth) are tied throughout all accretion
episodes, supporting earlier results that the properties of the shallow heating mechanism are
not constant between outbursts. Second, from our models shallow heating could not be connected
to one specific spectral state during outburst. Third, and most importantly, we find that the neutron
star in Aql X-1 does not have enough time between outbursts to cool down to crust-core equilibrium
and that heating during one outburst influences the cooling curves of the next.
