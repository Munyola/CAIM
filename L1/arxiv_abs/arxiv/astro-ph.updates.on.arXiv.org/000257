We perform a definitive analysis of Bianchi VII_h cosmologies with WMAP observations of the cosmic
microwave background (CMB) temperature anisotropies. Bayesian analysis techniques are developed
to study anisotropic cosmologies using full-sky and partial-sky, masked CMB temperature data.
We apply these techniques to analyse the full-sky internal linear combination (ILC) map and a partial-sky,
masked W-band map of WMAP 9-year observations. In addition to the physically motivated Bianchi
VII_h model, we examine phenomenological models considered in previous studies, in which the Bianchi
VII_h parameters are decoupled from the standard cosmological parameters. In the two phenomenological
models considered, Bayes factors of 1.7 and 1.1 units of log-evidence favouring a Bianchi component
are found in full-sky ILC data. The corresponding best-fit Bianchi maps recovered are similar for
both phenomenological models and are very close to those found in previous studies using earlier
WMAP data releases. However, no evidence for a phenomenological Bianchi component is found in the
partial-sky W-band data. In the physical Bianchi VII_h model we find no evidence for a Bianchi component:
WMAP data thus do not favour Bianchi VII_h cosmologies over the standard Lambda Cold Dark Matter
(LCDM) cosmology. It is not possible to discount Bianchi VII_h cosmologies in favour of LCDM completely,
but we are able to constrain the vorticity of physical Bianchi VII_h cosmologies at $(\omega/H)_0
< 8.6 \times 10^{-10}$ with 95% confidence.
