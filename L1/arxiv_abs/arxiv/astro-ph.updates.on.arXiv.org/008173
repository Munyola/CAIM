Observations have revealed that the star formation rate (SFR) and stellar mass (M$_{\rm star}$)
of star-forming galaxies follow a tight relation known as the galaxy main sequence. However, what
physical information is encoded in this relation is under debate. Here, we use the EAGLE cosmological
hydrodynamical simulation to study the mass dependence, evolution and origin of scatter in the
SFR-M$_{\rm star}$ relation. At $z=0$, we find that the scatter decreases slightly with stellar
mass from 0.35 dex at M$_{\rm star} \approx 10^9$ M$_{\odot}$ to 0.30 dex at M$_{\rm star} \gtrsim
10^{10.5}$ M$_{\odot}$, in excellent agreement with observations. The scatter decreases from
$z=0$ to $z=5$ by 0.05 dex at M$_{\rm star} \gtrsim 10^{10}$ M$_{\odot}$ and by 0.15 dex for lower
masses. We show that the scatter at $z=0.1$ originates from a combination of (slightly dominant)
fluctuations on short time-scales ($\lesssim 1$ Gyr) that are presumably associated with self-regulation
from cooling, star formation and outflows, and long time-scale ($\sim 10$ Gyr) variations related
to differences in halo formation times. At high masses, differences in black hole formation efficiency
cause additional scatter, but also diminish the scatter caused by different halo formation times.
While individual galaxies cross the main sequence multiple times during their evolution, they
fluctuate around tracks associated with their halo properties, i.e. galaxies above/below the
main sequence at $z = 0.1$ tend to have been above/below the main sequence for $\gg1$ Gyr.
