The Advanced Telescope for High Energy Astrophysics (Athena) is the X-ray observatory large mission
selected by the European Space Agency (ESA), within its Cosmic Vision 2015-2025 programme, to address
the "Hot and Energetic Universe" scientific theme (Nandra et al. 2013), and it is provisionally
due for launch in the early 2030s. The Square Kilometer Array (SKA) is the next generation radio observatory
and consists of two telescopes, one comprised of dishes operating at mid frequencies (SKA1-MID)
and located in South Africa, and the other comprised of Log-Periodic antennas operating at low radio
frequencies (SKA1-LOW), which will be located in Australia (Braun et al. 2017). The scientific
commissioning of the radio telescope is planned to begin in 2021-2022. The SKA-Athena Synergy Team
(SAST) has been tasked to single out the potential scientific synergies between Athena and SKA.
The astrophysical community was involved in this exercise primarily through a dedicated SKA-Athena
Synergy Workshop, which took place on April 24-25, 2017 at SKAO, Jodrell Bank, Manchester. The final
result of the synergy exercise, this White Paper, describes in detail a number of scientific opportunities
that will be opened up by the combination of Athena and SKA, these include: 1. the Cosmic Dawn; 2. the
Evolution of black holes and galaxies; 3. Active galaxy feedback in galaxy clusters; 4. Non-thermal
phenomena in galaxy clusters; 5. Detecting the cosmic web; 6. Black-hole accretion physics and
astrophysical transients; 7. Galactic astronomy: stars, planets, pulsars and supernovae.
