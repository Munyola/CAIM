At the low temperatures ($\sim$10 K) and high densities ($\sim$100,000 H$_2$ molecules per cc)
of molecular cloud cores and protostellar envelopes, a large amount of molecular species (in particular
those containing C and O) freeze-out onto dust grain surfaces. It is in these regions that the deuteration
of H$_3^+$ becomes very efficient, with a sharp abundance increase of H$_2$D$^+$ and D$_2$H$^+$.
The multi-deuterated forms of H$_3^+$ participate in an active chemistry: (i) their collision
with neutral species produces deuterated molecules such as the commonly observed N$_2$D$^+$,
DCO$^+$ and multi-deuterated NH$_3$; (ii) their dissociative electronic recombination increases
the D/H atomic ratio by several orders of magnitude above the D cosmic abundance, thus allowing deuteration
of molecules (e.g. CH$_3$OH and H$_2$O) on the surface of dust grains. Deuterated molecules are
the main diagnostic tools of dense and cold interstellar clouds, where the first steps toward star
and protoplanetary disk formation take place. Recent observations of deuterated molecules are
reviewed and discussed in view of astrochemical models inclusive of spin-state chemistry. We present
a new comparison between models based on complete scrambling (to calculate branching ratio tables
for reactions between chemical species that include protons and/or deuterons) and models based
on non-scrambling (proton hop) methods, showing that the latter best agree with observations of
NH$_3$ deuterated isotopologues and their different nuclear spin symmetry states.
