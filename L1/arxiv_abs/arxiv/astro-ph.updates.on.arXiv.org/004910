Polarized Galactic foregrounds are one of the primary sources of systematic error in measurements
of the B-mode polarization of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). Experiments are becoming
increasingly sensitive to complexities in the foreground frequency spectra that are not captured
by standard parametric models, potentially affecting our ability to efficiently separate out
these components. Employing a suite of dust models encompassing a variety of physical effects,
we simulate observations of a future seven-band CMB experiment to assess the impact of these complexities
on parametric component separation. We identify configurations of frequency bands that minimize
the `model errors' caused by fitting simple parametric models to more complex `true' foreground
spectra, which bias the inferred CMB signal. We find that: (a) fits employing a simple two parameter
modified blackbody (MBB) dust model tend to produce significant bias in the recovered polarized
CMB signal in the presence of physically realistic dust foregrounds; (b) generalized MBB models
with three additional parameters reduce this bias in most cases, but non-negligible biases can
remain, and can be hard to detect; and (c) line of sight effects, which give rise to frequency decorrelation,
and the presence of iron grains are the most problematic complexities in the dust emission for recovering
the true CMB signal. More sophisticated simulations will be needed to demonstrate that future CMB
experiments can successfully mitigate these more physically realistic dust foregrounds.
