This paper investigates the growth of the most massive cosmological objects. We utilize the Simsilun
simulation, which is based on the approximation of the silent universe. In the limit of spatial homogeneity
and isotropy the silent universes reduce to the standard FLRW models. We show that within the approximation
of the silent universe the formation of the most massive cosmological objects differs from the standard
background-dependent approaches. For objects with masses above $10^{15} M_\odot$ the effect
of spatial curvature (overdense regions are characterized by positive spatial curvature) leads
to measurable effects. The effect is analogous to the effect that the background cosmological model
has on the formation of these objects (i.e. the higher matter density and spatial curvature the faster
the growth of cosmic structures). We measure this by the means of the mass function and show that the
mass function obtained from the Simsilun simulation has a higher amplitude at the high-mass end
compared to standard mass function such as the Press-Schechter or the Tinker mass function. For
comparison, we find that the expected mass of most massive objects using the Tinker mass function
is $4.4^{+0.8}_{-0.6} \, \times 10^{15} M_\odot$, whereas for the Simsilun simulation is $6.3^{+1.0}_{-0.8}
\, \times 10^{15} M_\odot$. We conclude that the nonlinear relativistic effects could affect the
formation of the most massive cosmological objects, leading to a relativistic environment-dependence
of the growth rate of the most massive clusters.
