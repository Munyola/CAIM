The Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) yields an inference on the matter sound horizon, within the
Standard Model. Independent, direct measurements of the sound horizon are then a probe of possible
deviations from the Standard Model. We aim at measuring the sound horizon $r_s$ from low-redshift
indicators, completely independent from CMB inference. We use the measured product $H(z)r_s$
from Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO), plus Supernovae~\textsc{I}a to constrain $H(z)/H_{0}$
and time-delay lenses analysed by the H0LiCOW collaboration to anchor cosmological distances
($\propto H_{0}^{-1}$). Additionally, we investigate the influence of adding a sample of higher-redshift
quasars with standardisable UV-Xray luminosity distances. We adopt polynomial expansions in
$H(z)$ or in comoving distances, so that our inference is completely independent of any underlying
cosmological model. Our measurements are independent of Cepheids and systematics from peculiar
motions, to within percent-level accuracy. The inferred sound horizon $r_s$ varies between $(133
\pm 8)$~Mpc and $(138 \pm 5)$~Mpc across different models. The discrepancy with CMB measurements
is robust against model choice. Statistical uncertainties are comparable to systematics. The
combination of time-delay lenses, supernovae and BAO yields a cosmology-independent (and Cepheid-calibration-independent)
distance ladder, and a CMB-independent measurement of $r_s.$ These cosmographic measurements
are then a competitive test of the Standard Model, regardless of hypotheses on the underlying cosmology.
