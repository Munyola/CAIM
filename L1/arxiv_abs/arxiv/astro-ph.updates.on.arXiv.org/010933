Despite being $>10$Myr, there are $\sim$10 debris discs with as much CO gas as in protoplanetary
discs. Such discs have been assumed to be "hybrid", i.e., with secondary dust but primordial gas.
Here we show that both the dust and gas in such systems could instead be secondary, with the high CO
content caused by accumulation of neutral carbon (C$^0$) that shields CO from photodissociating;
i.e., these could be "shielded secondary discs". New ALMA observations are presented of HD131835
that detect $\sim 3 \times 10^{-3}$ M$_\oplus$ of C$^0$, the majority 40-200au from the star, in
sufficient quantity to shield the previously detected CO. A simple semi-analytic model for the
evolution of CO, C and O originating in a volatile-rich planetesimal belt shows how CO shielding
becomes important when the viscous evolution is slow (low $\alpha$ parameter) and/or the CO production
rate is high. Shielding by C$^0$ may also cause the CO content to reach levels at which CO self-shields,
and the gas disc may become massive enough to affect the dust evolution. Application to the HD 131835
observations shows these can be explained if $\alpha \sim 10^{-3}$; an inner cavity in C$^0$ and
CO may also mean the system has yet to reach steady state. Application to other debris discs with high
CO content finds general agreement for $\alpha=10^{-3}$ to $0.1$. The shielded secondary nature
of these gas discs can be tested by searching for C$^0$, as well as CN, N$_2$ and CH$^{+}$, which are
also expected to be shielded by C$^0$.
