We develop a new method of extracting simultaneous measurements of weak lensing shear and a local
rotation of the plane of polarization using observations of resolved radio sources. We show that
the direction of polarization is statistically linked with that of the gradient of the total intensity
field, and this provides the basis of our method. Using a number of sources spread over the sky, this
method allows constraints to be placed on cosmic shear and birefringence, and it can be applied to
any resolved radio sources for which such a correlation exists. Assuming that the rotation and shear
are constant across the source, we use this relationship to construct a quadratic estimator and
investigate its properties using simulated observations. We develop a calibration scheme using
simulations based on the observed images to mitigate a bias which occurs in the presence of measurement
errors and an astrophysical scatter on the polarization. The method is applied directly to archival
data of radio galaxies where we measure a mean rotation signal of $\left<\omega\right>=-2.03^{\circ}\pm0.75^{\circ}$
and an average shear compatible with zero using 30 reliable sources. This level of constraint on
an overall rotation is comparable with current leading constraints from CMB experiments and is
expected to increase by at least an order of magnitude with future high precision radio surveys,
such as those performed by the SKA. We also measure the shear and rotation two-point correlation
functions and estimate the number of sources required to detect shear and rotation correlations
in future surveys.
