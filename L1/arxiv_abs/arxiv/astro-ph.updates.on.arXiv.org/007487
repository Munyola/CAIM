We present The Payne, a general method for the precise and simultaneous determination of numerous
stellar labels from observed spectra, based on fitting physical spectral models. The Payne combines
a number of important methodological aspects: it exploits the information from much of the available
spectral range; it fits all labels (stellar parameters and element abundances) simultaneously;
it uses spectral models, where the atmosphere structure and the radiative transport are consistently
calculated to reflect the stellar labels. At its core The Payne has an approach to accurate and precise
interpolation and prediction of the spectrum in high-dimensional label-space, which is flexible
and robust, yet based on only a moderate number of ab initio models (O(1000) for 25 labels). With a
simple neural-net-like functional form and a suitable choice of training labels, this interpolation
yields a spectral flux prediction good to $10^{-3}$ rms across a wide range of $T_{\rm eff}$ and log
g (including dwarfs and giants). We illustrate the power of this approach by applying it to the APOGEE
DR14 data set, drawing on Kurucz models with recently improved line lists (Cargile et al., in prep.):
without recalibration, we obtain physically sensible stellar parameters as well as 15 element
abundances that appear to be more precise than the published APOGEE DR14 values. This illustrates
that The Payne, brings us significantly closer to extracting the full information content of stellar
spectra with ab initio spectral models.
