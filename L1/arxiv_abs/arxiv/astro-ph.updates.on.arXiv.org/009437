We have monitored the return to quiescence of novae previously observed in outburst as supersoft
X-ray sources, with optical photometry of the intermediate polar (IP) V4743 Sgr and candidate IP
V2491 Cyg, and optical spectroscopy of these two and seven other systems. Our sample includes classical
and recurrent novae, short period (few hours), intermediate period (1-2 days) and long period (symbiotic)
binaries. The light curves of V4743 Sgr and V2491 Cyg present clear periodic modulations. For V4743
Sgr, the modulation occurs with the beat of the rotational and orbital periods. If the period measured
for V2491 Cyg is also the beat of these two periods, the orbital one should be almost 17 hours. The recurrent
nova T Pyx already shows fragmentation of the nebular shell less than 3 years after the outburst.
While this nova still had strong [OIII] at this post-outburst epoch, these lines had already faded
after 3 to 7 years in all the others. We did not find any difference in the ratio of equivalent widths
of high ionization/excitation lines to that of the Hbeta line in novae with short and long orbital
period, indicating that irradiation does not trigger high mass transfer rate from secondaries
with small orbital separation. An important difference between the spectra of RS Oph and V3890 Sgr
and those of many symbiotic persistent supersoft sources is the absence of forbidden coronal lines.
With the X-rays turn-off, we interpret this as an indication that mass transfer in symbiotics recurrent
novae is intermittent.
