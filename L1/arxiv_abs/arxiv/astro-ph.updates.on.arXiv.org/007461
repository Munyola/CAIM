The HOSTS (Hunt for Observable Signatures of Terrestrial Systems) survey searches for dust near
the habitable zones (HZs) around nearby, bright main sequence stars. We use nulling interferometry
in N band to suppress the bright stellar light and to probe for low levels of HZ dust around the 30 stars
observed so far. Our overall detection rate is 18%, including four new detections, among which are
the first three around Sun-like stars and the first two around stars without any previously known
circumstellar dust. The inferred occurrence rates are comparable for early type and Sun-like stars,
but decrease from 60 (+16/-21)% for stars with previously detected cold dust to 8 (+10/-3)% for stars
without such excess, confirming earlier results at higher sensitivity. For completed observations
on individual stars, our sensitivity is five to ten times better than previous results. Assuming
a lognormal excess luminosity function, we put upper limits on the median HZ dust level of 13 zodis
(95% confidence) for a sample of stars without cold dust and of 26 zodis when focussing on Sun-like
stars without cold dust. However, our data suggest that a more complex luminosity function may be
more appropriate. For stars without detectable LBTI excess, our upper limits are almost reduced
by a factor of two, demonstrating the strength of LBTI target vetting for future exo-Earth imaging
missions. Our statistics are so far limited and extending the survey is critical to inform the design
of future exo-Earth imaging surveys.
