Gas giants' early ($\lesssim 5$ Myr) orbital evolution occurs in a disc losing mass in part to photoevaporation
driven by high energy irradiance from the host star. This process may ultimately overcome viscous
accretion to disperse the disc and halt migrating giants by starving their orbits of gas, imprinting
on giant planet separations in evolved systems. Inversion of this distribution could then give
insight into whether stellar FUV, EUV or X-ray flux dominates photoevaporation, constraining
planet formation and disc evolution models. We use a 1D hydrodynamic code in population syntheses
for gas giants undergoing Type II migration in a viscously evolving disc subject to either a primarily
FUV, EUV or X-ray flux from a pre-solar T Tauri star. The photoevaporative mass loss profile's unique
peak location and width in each energetic regime produces characteristic features in the distribution
of giant separations: a severe dearth of $\lesssim$ 2 M$_{\rm J}$ planets interior to 5 AU in the FUV
scenario, a sharp concentration of $\lesssim$ 3 M$_{\rm J}$ planets between $\approx 1.5 - 2$ AU
in the EUV case, and a relative abundance of $\approx 2 - 3.5$ M$_{\rm J}$ giants interior to 0.5 AU
in the X-ray model. These features do not resemble the observational sample of gas giants with mass
constraints, though our results do show some weaker qualitative similarities. We thus assess how
the differing photoevaporative profiles interact with migrating giants and address the effects
of large model uncertainties as a step to better connect disc models with trends in the exoplanet
population.
