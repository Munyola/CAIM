$N$-body simulations of non-resonant tightly-packed planetary systems have found that their
survival time (i.e. time to first close encounter) grows exponentially with their interplanetary
spacing and planetary masses. Although this result has important consequences for the assembly
of planetary systems by giants collisions and their long-term evolution, this underlying exponential
dependence is not understood from first principles, and previous attempts based on orbital diffusion
have only yielded power-law scalings. We propose a different picture, where the deviations of the
system from its initial conditions is not limited by orbital diffusion, but by the lifetime of a series
of confining barriers in phase-space---invariant KAM tori---that are slowly destroyed with time.
Thus, we show that survival time of the system $T$ can be estimated using the Nekhoroshev's stability
limit and obtain a heuristic formula for systems away from overlapping two-body mean-motion resonances
as: $T/P=c_1 \frac{a}{\Delta a} \exp \left(c_2 \frac{\Delta a}{a} /\mu^{1/4}\right)$, where
$P$ is the average Keplerian period, $a$ is the average semi major axis, $\Delta a\ll a$ is the difference
between the semi major axes of neighbouring planets, $\mu$ is the planet to star mass ratio, and $c_1$
and $c_2$ are dimensionless constants. We show that this formula is in good agreement with numerical
N-body experiments for $c_1=5 \cdot 10^{-4}$ and $c_2=8$, supporting our proposal that the lifetime
of non-resonant planetary is primarily determined by the lifetime of KAM tori, which are likely
destroyed by three-body resonances.
