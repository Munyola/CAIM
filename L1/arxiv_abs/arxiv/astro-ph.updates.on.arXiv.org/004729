We propose a modified theory of gravitation constructed by the addition of the term $f(T_{\mu\nu}T^{\mu\nu})$
to the Einstein-Hilbert action of the general theory of relativity, and elaborate a particular
case $f(T_{\mu\nu}T^{\mu\nu})=\alpha(T_{\mu\nu}T^{\mu\nu})^{\eta}$, where $\alpha$ and
$\eta$ are real constants, dubbed as Energy Momentum Powered Gravity (EMPG). We search for viable
cosmologies arising from the EMPG especially in the context of late time accelerated expansion
of the Universe. We investigate the ranges of the EMPG parameters $(\alpha,\eta)$ on theoretical
as well as observational grounds leading to the late time acceleration of the Universe with pressure-less
matter only, while keeping the successes of the standard general relativity at early times. We find
that $\eta=0$ corresponds to $\Lambda$CDM model whereas $\eta\neq 0$ leads to a $w$CDM type model.
However, the underlying physics of the EMPG model is entirely different in the sense that the energy
in the EMPG Universe is sourced by pressure-less dust only. Moreover, the energy of the pressure-less
matter is not conserved, namely, in general it does not dilute as $\rho\propto a^{-3}$ with the expansion
of the Universe. Finally, we constrain parameters of an EMPG based cosmology with a recent compilation
of 28 Hubble parameter measurements, and find that this model describes the evolution of the Universe
similar to the $\Lambda$CDM model. We briefly discussed also that unifying the EMPG with Starobinsky
gravity is straightforward and is able to describe the complete history of the Universe including
the inflationary epoch.
