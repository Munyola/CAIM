We study the theoretical systematics and optimize the methodology in Baryon Acoustic Oscillations
(BAO) detections using the angular correlation function with tomographic bins. We calibrate and
optimize the pipeline for the Dark Energy Survey Year 1 dataset using 1800 mocks. We compare the BAO
fitting results obtained with three estimators: the Maximum Likelihood Estimator (MLE), Profile
Likelihood, and Markov Chain Monte Carlo. The MLE method yields the least bias in the fit results
(bias/spread $\sim 0.02$) and the error bar derived is the closest to the Gaussian results (1% from
68% Gaussian expectation). When there is mismatch between the template and the data either due to
incorrect fiducial cosmology or photo-$z$ error, the MLE again gives the least-biased results.
The BAO angular shift that is estimated based on the sound horizon and the angular diameter distance
agree with the numerical fit. Various analysis choices are further tested: the number of redshift
bins, cross-correlations, and angular binning. We propose two methods to correct the mock covariance
when the final sample properties are slightly different from those used to create the mock. We show
that the sample changes can be accommodated with the help of the Gaussian covariance matrix or more
effectively using the eigenmode expansion of the mock covariance. The eigenmode expansion is significantly
less susceptible to statistical fluctuations relative to the direct measurements of the covariance
matrix because the number of free parameters is substantially reduced [$p$ parameters versus $p(p+1)/2$
from direct measurement].
