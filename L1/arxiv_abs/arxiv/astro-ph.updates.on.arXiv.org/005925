NASA's Kepler Space Telescope was designed to determine the frequency of Earth-sized planets orbiting
Sun-like stars, but these planets are on the very edge of the mission's detection sensitivity. Accurately
determining the occurrence rate of these planets will require automatically and accurately assessing
the likelihood that individual candidates are indeed planets, even at low signal-to-noise ratios.
We present a method for classifying potential planet signals using deep learning, a class of machine
learning algorithms that have recently become state-of-the-art in a wide variety of tasks. We train
a deep convolutional neural network to predict whether a given signal is a transiting exoplanet
or a false positive caused by astrophysical or instrumental phenomena. Our model is highly effective
at ranking individual candidates by the likelihood that they are indeed planets: 98.8% of the time
it ranks plausible planet signals higher than false positive signals in our test set. We apply our
model to a new set of candidate signals that we identified in a search of known Kepler multi-planet
systems. We statistically validate two new planets that are identified with high confidence by
our model. One of these planets is part of a five-planet resonant chain around Kepler-80, with an
orbital period closely matching the prediction by three-body Laplace relations. The other planet
orbits Kepler-90, a star which was previously known to host seven transiting planets. Our discovery
of an eighth planet brings Kepler-90 into a tie with our Sun as the star known to host the most planets.
