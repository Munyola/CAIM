We propose the use of robust, Bayesian methods for estimating extragalactic distance errors in
multi-measurement catalogs. We seek to improve upon the more commonly used frequentist propagation-of-error
methods, as they fail to explain both the scatter between different measurements and the effects
of skewness in the metric distance probability distribution. For individual galaxies, the most
transparent way to assess the variance of redshift independent distances is to directly sample
the posterior probability distribution obtained from the mixture of reported measurements. However,
sampling the posterior can be cumbersome for catalog-wide precision cosmology applications.
We compare the performance of frequentist methods versus our proposed measures for estimating
the true variance of the metric distance probability distribution. We provide pre-computed distance
error data tables for galaxies in 3 catalogs: NED-D, HyperLEDA, and Cosmicflows-3. Additionally,
we develop a Bayesian model that considers systematic and random effects in the estimation of errors
for Tully-Fisher relation (TF) derived distances in NED-D. We validate this model with a Bayesian
$p$-value computed using the Freeman-Tukey discrepancy measure as a posterior predictive check.
We are then able to predict distance errors for 884 galaxies in the NED-D catalog and 203 galaxies
in the HyperLEDA catalog which do not report TF distance modulus errors. Our goal is that our estimated
and predicted errors are used in catalog-wide applications that require acknowledging the true
variance of extragalactic distance measurements.
