Umbral dots (UDs) are transient, bright features observed in the umbral region of a sunspot. We study
the physical properties of UDs observed in sunspots of different sizes. The aim of our study is to
relate the physical properties of umbral dots with the large-scale properties of sunspots. For
this purpose, we analyze high-resolution G-band images of 42 sunspots observed by {\em Hinode}/SOT,
located close to disk center. The images were corrected for instrumental stray-light and restored
with the modeled PSF. An automated multi-level tracking algorithm was employed to identify the
UDs located in selected G-band images. Furthermore, we employed HMI/SDO, limb-darkening corrected,
full disk continuum images to estimate the sunspot phase and epoch for the selected sunspots. The
number of UDs identified in different umbrae exhibits a linear relation with the umbral size. The
observed filling factor ranges from 3\% to 7\% and increases with the mean umbral intensity. Moreover,
the filling factor shows a decreasing trend with the umbral size. We also found that the observed
mean and maximum intensities of UDs are correlated with the mean umbral intensity. However, we do
not find any significant relationship between the mean (and maximum) intensity and effective diameter
of umbral dots with the sunspot area, epoch, and decay rate. We suggest that this lack of relation
could either be due to the distinct transition of spatial scales associated with overturning convection
in the umbra or the shallow depth associated with umbral dots, or both the above.
