We aim at assessing what are the most dominant dust species or types, including silicate and iron
oxide grains present in the ISM, by using recent observations of dust depletion of galaxies at various
evolutionary stages. We use the observed elemental abundances in dust of several metals (O, S, Si,
Mg, and Fe) in different environments, considering systems with different metallicities and dust
content, namely damped Lyman-{\alpha} absorbers (DLAs) towards quasars and the Galaxy. We derive
a possible dust composition by computationally finding the statistically expected elemental
abundances in dust assuming a set of key dust species with the iron content as a free parameter. Carbonaceous
dust is not considered in the present study. Metallic iron (likely in the form of inclusions in silicate
grains) and iron oxides is an important component of the mass composition of carbon-free dust. Iron
oxides make up a significant mass fraction (~1/4 in some cases) of the oxygen-bearing dust and there
are good reasons to believe that metallic iron constitutes a similar mass fraction of dust. W\"ustite
(FeO) could be a simple explanation for the depletion of iron and oxygen because it is easily formed.
There appears to be no silicate species clearly dominating the silicate mass, but rather a mix of
iron-poor as well as iron-rich olivine and pyroxene. To what extent sulphur depletion is due to sulfides
remains unclear. In general, there seems to be little evolution of the dust composition (not considering
carbonaceous dust) from low-metallicity systems to the Galaxy.
