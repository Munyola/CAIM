We present a new method to constrain the dark matter halo density profiles of disk galaxies. Our algorithm
employs a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach to explore the parameter space of a general family
of dark matter profiles. We improve upon previous analyses by considering a wider range of halo profiles
and by explicitly identifying cases in which the data are insufficient to break the degeneracies
between the model parameters. We demonstrate the robustness of our algorithm using artificial
data sets and show that reliable estimates of the halo density profile can be obtained from data of
comparable quality to those currently available for low surface brightness (LSB) galaxies. We
present our results in terms of physical quantities which are constrained by the data, and find that
the logarithmic slope of the halo density profile at the radius of the innermost data point of a measured
rotation curve can be strongly constrained in LSB galaxies. High surface brightness galaxies require
additional information on the mass-to-light ratio of the stellar population - our approach naturally
identifies those galaxies for which this is necessary. We apply our method to observed data for the
dwarf irregular galaxy DDO 154 and recover a logarithmic halo slope of -0.39 +/- 0.15 at a radius of
0.14 kpc. Our analysis validates earlier estimates which were based on the fitting of a limited set
of individual halo models, but constitutes a more robust constraint than was possible using other
techniques since it marginalises over a wide range of halo profiles.
