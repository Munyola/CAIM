High signal-to-noise spectra toward background quasars are crucial for uncovering weak absorption
that traces warm gas, such as N V or broad Ly-$\alpha$ lines, in the circumgalactic medium (CGM) of
intervening galaxies. We present a new, high signal-to-noise spectrum from the Hubble Space Telescope
toward the quasar SDSS J1009+0713 and analyze absorption systems in the CGM of two galaxies close
to the line of sight. We identify additional absorption in the CGM of these galaxies that was not reported
by the previous low signal-to-noise spectrum, as well as additional Milky Way absorbers and quasar
outflows from J1009+0713. We measure $\log (N_\mathrm{N V}/N_\mathrm{OVI})\sim-1$ for two CGM
absorbers, inconsistent with collisional ionization equilibrium and consistent with a radiatively
cooling bulk flow of $\sim30-80$ km s$^{-1}$, which could be produced by post-shock galactic winds.
These column density ratios are also consistent with those found for other galaxies in the COS-Halos
sample and for gas in the Milky Way's halo. We place upper limits of $\log (N_\mathrm{NV}/N_\mathrm{OVI})<-1$
for other O VI absorbers in the same halos, which suggests that O VI is ionized by different ionization
processes within the same galactic halo. Together with the kinematically different structure
of high- and low-ionization lines, these results indicate there are many components to a single
galaxy's gaseous halo. We also find the redshift number density of Ly-$\alpha$ forest absorbers
and broad Ly-$\alpha$ absorbers in the full spectrum are consistent with expectations at this redshift.
