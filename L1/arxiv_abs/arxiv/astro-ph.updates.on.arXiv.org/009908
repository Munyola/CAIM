We present an analysis of the final data release of the Carnegie Supernova Project I, focusing on
the absolute calibration of the luminosity-decline-rate relation for Type Ia supernovae (SNeIa)
using new intrinsic color relations with respect to the color-stretch parameter, $s_{BV}$, enabling
improved dust extinction corrections. We investigate to what degree the so-called fast-declining
SNeIa can be used to determine accurate extragalactic distances. We estimate the intrinsic scatter
in the luminosity-decline-rate relation, and find it ranges from $\pm 0.13$ mag to $\pm 0.18$ mag
with no obvious dependence on wavelength. Using the Cepheid variable star data from the SH0ES project
(Riess et al., 2016), the SNIa distance scale is calibrated and the Hubble constant is estimated
using our optical and near-infrared sample, and these results are compared to those determined
exclusively from a near-infrared sub-sample. The systematic effect of the supernova's host galaxy
mass is investigated as a function of wavelength and is found to decrease toward redder wavelengths,
suggesting this effect may be due to dust properties of the host. Using estimates of the dust extinction
derived from optical and NIR wavelengths, and applying these to H band, we derive a Hubble constant
$H_0 = 73.2 \pm 2.3$ km/s/Mpc, whereas using a simple $B-V$ color-correction applied to B band yields
$H_0 = 72.7 \pm 2.1$ km/s/Mpc. Photometry of two calibrating SNeIa from the CSP-II sample, SN2012ht
and SN2015F, is presented and used to improve the calibration of the SNIa distance ladder.
