We present simulations of multi-year RV follow up campaigns of the {\it TESS} small exoplanet yield
on the Automated Planet Finder telescope, using four different schemes to sample the transiting
planets' RV phase curves. For planets below roughly 10 M$_\oplus$ we see a systematic bias of measured
masses that are higher than the true planet mass, regardless of the observing scheme used. This produces
a statistically significant difference in the mass-radius relation we recover, where planet masses
are predicted to be too high and too similar across the entire super-Earth to Neptune radius range.
This bias is due in part to only reporting masses that are measured with high statistical significance.
Incorporating all mass measurements, even those that are essentially only upper limits, significantly
mitigates this bias. We also find statistically significant differences between the mean number
of planets measured at the 1-, 3-, and 5$\sigma_{\rm K}$ level by the different prioritization schemes.
Our results show that prioritization schemes that more evenly sample the RV phase curves produce
a larger number of significant mass detections. The scheme that aims to most uniformly sample the
phase curve performs best, followed closely by the scheme which randomly samples, and then an in
quadrature sampling approach. The fourth scheme, out of quadrature, performs noticeably worse.
These results have important implications for determining accurate planet compositions and for
designing effective RV follow up campaigns in the era of large planet detection surveys such as $K2$,
$TESS$, and $PLATO$.
