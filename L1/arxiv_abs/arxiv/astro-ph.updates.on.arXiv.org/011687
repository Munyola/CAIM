The standard model of galaxy cluster formation predicts that the X-ray luminosity-temperature
($L_X$-$T_X$) relation of galaxy clusters should have been $L_X\propto T_X^2$ in absence of the
baryonic physics, such as radiative cooing and feedback from stars and black holes. However, this
baseline relation is predicted without considering the fact that the halo concentration and the
characteristic density of clusters increases as their mass decreases, which is a consequence of
hierarchical structure formation of the universe. Here, we show that the actual baseline relation
should be $L_X\propto T_X^\alpha$, where $\alpha\sim 1.7$, instead of $\alpha=2$, given the mass-dependence
of the concentration and the fundamental plane relation of galaxy clusters. Numerical simulations
show that $\alpha\sim 1.6$, which is consistent with the prediction. We also show that the baseline
luminosity-mass ($L_X$-$M_\Delta$) relation should have been $L_X\propto M_\Delta^\beta$,
where $\beta\sim 1.1$-1.2, in contrast with the conventional prediction ($\beta=4/3$). In addition,
some of the scatter in the $L_X$-$M_\Delta$ relation can be attributed to the scatter in the concentration-mass
($c$-$M$) relation. The confirmation of the shallow slope could be a proof of hierarchical clustering.
As an example, we show that the new baseline relations could be checked by studying the temperature
or mass-dependence of gas mass fraction of clusters. Moreover, highest-temperature clusters
would follow the shallow baseline relations if the influences of cool cores and cluster mergers
are properly removed.
