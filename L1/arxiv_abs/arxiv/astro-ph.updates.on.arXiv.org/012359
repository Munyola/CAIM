We present observations of the eruption and then reformation of a filament caused by its nearby emerging
magnetic flux. Driven by the emerging magnetic flux, the emerged positive fluxes moved toward and
cancelled with its nearby negative fluxes, where the negative ends of a filament channel beneath
the filament and a bundle of left-skewed coronal loops overlying the filament were anchored. Complemented
by the nonlinear force-free field extrapolation, we find that the coronal magnetic field lines
associated with the filament channel and the emerging magnetic fields consist of sheared field
lines. Prior to the filament eruption, unambiguous observational evidence indicates that multiple
interactions occurred between the emerging magnetic fields and the left-skewed coronal loops,
implying a tether-weakening reconnection. Specifically, during the final episode of the tether-weakening
reconnection, a remarkable sigmoid structure was formed and lifted up together with the filament.
Accordingly, we speculate that the tether-weakening reconnection probably destabilized the
filament system and triggered its rise. Subsequently, the filament and the sigmoid structure erupted
together and produced a CME. After the eruption, the emerging magnetic fields continued to reconnect
with the remaining filament channel, leading to the reformation of the filament. This observation
strongly supports the idea that emerging magnetic flux plays an important role in triggering the
filament to erupt, and the filament is reformed by magnetic reconnection between the emerging magnetic
fields and its nearby filament channel.
