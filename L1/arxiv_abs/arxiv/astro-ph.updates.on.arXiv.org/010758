We study the origin of bulge stars and their angular momentum (AM) evolution in 10 spiral galaxies
with baryonic masses above $10^{10}$M$_\odot$ in the NIHAO galaxy formation simulations. The
simulated galaxies are in good agreement with observations of the relation between specific AM
and mass of the baryonic component and the stellar bulge-to-total ratio ($B/T$). We divide the star
particles at $z=0$ into disc and bulge components using a hybrid photometric/kinematic decomposition
method that identifies all central mass above an exponential disc profile as the `bulge'. By tracking
the bulge star particles back in time, we find that on average 95\% of the bulge stars formed {\it in
situ}, 3\% formed {\it ex situ} in satellites of the same halo, and only 2\% formed {\it ex situ} in
external galaxies. The evolution of the AM distribution of the bulge stars paints an interesting
picture: the higher the final $B/T$ ratio, the more the specific AM remains preserved during the
bulge formation. In all cases, bulge stars migrate significantly towards the central region, reducing
their average galactocentric radius by roughly a factor 2, independently of the final $B/T$ value.
However, in the higher $B/T$ ($\gtrsim0.2$) objects, the velocity of the bulge stars increases
and the AM of the bulge is almost conserved, whereas at lower $B/T$ values, the velocity of the bulge
stars decreases and the AM of bulge reduces. The correlation between the evolution of the AM and $B/T$
suggests that bulge and disc formation are closely linked and cannot be treated as independent processes.
