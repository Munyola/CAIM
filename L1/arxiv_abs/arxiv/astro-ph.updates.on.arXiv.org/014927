Galactic astrophysics is now in the process of building a multi-dimensional map of the Galaxy. For
such a map, stellar ages are the essential ingredient. Ages are however measured only indirectly
by comparing observational data with models. It is often difficult to provide a single age value
for a given star, as several non-overlapping solutions are possible. We aim at recovering the underlying
log(age) distribution from the measured log(age) probability density function for an arbitrary
set of stars. We build an age inversion method, namely, we represent the measured log(age) probability
density function as a weighted sum of probability density functions of mono-age populations. Weights
in that sum give the underlying log(age) distribution. Mono-age populations are simulated so that
the distribution of stars on the log g-[Fe/H] plane is close to that of the observed sample. We tested
the age inversion method on simulated data, demonstrating that it is capable of properly recovering
the true log(age) distribution for a large (N > 103) sample of stars. The method was further applied
to large public spectroscopic surveys. For RAVE-on, LAMOST and APOGEE we also applied age inversion
to mono-metallicity samples, successfully recovering age-metallicity trends present in higher-precision
APOGEE data and chemical evolution models. We conclude that applying an age inversion method as
presented in this work is necessary to recover the underlying age distribution of a large (N > 103
) set of stars. These age distributions can be used to explore for instance age-metallicity relations.
