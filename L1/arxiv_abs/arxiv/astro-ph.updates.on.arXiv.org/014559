We present high-resolution and high-quality UVES spectroscopic data of the metal-poor double-lined
spectroscopic binary CS 22876--032 ([Fe/H] $\sim -3.7$ dex), with the goal to derive the $^6$Li/$^7$Li
isotopic ratio by analysing the \ion{Li}{i} $\lambda$~670.8~nm doublet. We coadd all 28 useful
spectra normalised and corrected for radial velocity to the rest frame of the primary star. We fit
the Li profile with a grid of the 3D-NLTE synthetic spectra, to take into account the line profile
asymmetries induced by stellar convection, and perform Monte Carlo simulations to evaluate the
uncertainty of the fit of the Li line profile. We check that the veiling factor does not affect the
derived isotopic ratio, $^6$Li/$^7$Li, and only modifies the Li abundance, A(Li), by about 0.15~dex.
The best fit of the Li profile of the primary star provides A(Li)~$ = 2.17 \pm 0.01$~dex and $^6$Li/$^7$Li~$=8^{+2}_{-5}$\%
at 68\% confidence level. In addition, we improve the Li abundance of the secondary star at A(Li)~$=
1.55 \pm 0.04$~dex, which is about 0.6~dex lower than that of the primary star. The analysis of the
Li profile of the primary star is consistent with no detection of $^6$Li and provides an upper-limit
to the isotopic ratio of $^6$Li/$^7$Li~$< 10$\% at this very low metallicity, about 0.5~dex lower
in metallicity than previous attempts for detection of $^6$Li in extremely metal poor stars. These
results do not solve or worsen the cosmological $^7$Li problem, nor support the need for non standard
$^6$Li production in the early Universe.
