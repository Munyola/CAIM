We present mock observations of forming planets with ALMA. The possible detections of circumplanetary
disks (CPDs) were investigated around planets of Saturn, 1, 3, 5, and 10 Jupiter-masses that are
placed at 5.2 AU from their star. The radiative, three dimensional hydrodynamic simulations were
then post-processed with RADMC3D and the ALMA Observation Simulator. We found that even though
the CPDs are too small to be resolved, they are hot due to the accreting planet in the optically thick
limit, therefore the best chance to detect them with continuum observations in this case is at the
shortest ALMA wavelengths, such as Band 9 (440 microns). Similar fluxes were found in the case of
Saturn and Jupiter-mass planets, as for the 10 $\mathrm{M_{Jup}}$ gas-giant, due to temperature
weighted optical depth effects: when no deep gap is carved, the planet region is blanketed by the
optically thick circumstellar disk leading to a less efficient cooling there. A test was made for
a 52 AU orbital separation, showed that optically thin CPDs are also detectable in band 7 but they
need longer integration times ($>$5hrs). Comparing the gap profiles of the same simulation at various
ALMA bands and the hydro simulation confirmed that they change significantly, first because the
gap is wider at longer wavelengths due to decreasing optical depth; second, the beam convolution
makes the gap shallower and at least 25% narrower. Therefore, caution has to be made when estimating
planet masses based on ALMA continuum observations of gaps.
