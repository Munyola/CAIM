We report observations of $\eta$ Carinae obtained with ALMA in the continuum of 100, 230, 280 and
660 GHz in 2012 November, with a resolution that varied from 2.88" to 0.45" for the lower and higher
frequencies respectively. The source is not resolved, even at the highest frequency; its spectrum
is characteristic of thermal bremsstrahlung of a compact source, but different from the spectrum
of optically thin wind. The recombination lines H42$\alpha$, He42$\alpha$, H40$\alpha$, He40$\alpha$,
H50$\beta$, H28$\alpha$, He28$\alpha$, H21$\alpha$ and He21$\alpha$ were also detected and
their intensities reveal non local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) effects. We found that the
line profiles could only be fit by an expanding shell of dense and ionized gas, which produces a slow
shock in the surroundings of $\eta$ Carinae. Combined with fittings to the continuum, we were able
to constrain the shell size, radius, density, temperature and velocity. The detection of the He
recombination lines is compatible with the high temperature gas and requires a high energy ionizing
photon flux, which must be provided by the companion star. The mass loss rate and wind velocity, necessary
to explain the formation of the shell, are compatible with a LBV eruption. The position, velocity
and physical parameters of the shell coincide with those of the Weigelt blobs. The dynamics found
for the expanding shell corresponds to matter ejected by $\eta$ Carinae in 1941, in an event similar
to that which formed the Little Homunculus ; for that reason we called the new ejecta the "Baby Homunculus".
