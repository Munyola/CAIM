We present a Bayesian hierarchical inference formalism to study the relation between the properties
of dark matter halos and those of their central galaxies using weak gravitational lensing. Unlike
traditional methods, this technique does not resort to stacking the weak lensing signal in bins,
and thus allows for a more efficient use of the information content in the data. Our method is particularly
useful for constraining scaling relations between two or more galaxy properties and dark matter
halo mass, and can also be used to constrain the intrinsic scatter in these scaling relations. We
show that, if observational scatter is not properly accounted for, the traditional stacking method
can produce biased results when exploring correlations between multiple galaxy properties and
halo mass. For example, this bias can affect studies of the joint correlation between galaxy mass,
halo mass, and galaxy size, or galaxy color. In contrast, our method easily and efficiently handles
the intrinsic and observational scatter in multiple galaxy properties and halo mass. We test our
method on mocks with varying degrees of complexity. We find that we can recover the mean halo mass
and concentration, each with a $0.1$ dex accuracy, and the intrinsic scatter in halo mass with a $0.05$
dex accuracy. In its current version, our method will be most useful for studying the weak lensing
signal around central galaxies in groups and clusters, as well as massive galaxies samples with
$\log{M_*} > 11$, which have low satellite fractions.
