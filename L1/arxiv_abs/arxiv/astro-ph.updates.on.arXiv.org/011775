In the interstellar medium, carbon (nano-)grains are a major component of interstellar dust. This
solid phase is more vulnerable to processing and destruction than its silicate counterpart. It
exhibits a complex, size-dependent evolution due to interactions within different radiative
and dynamical environments. Infrared signatures of these nanocarbon grains are seen in a large
number of disks around Herbig HAeBe stars. We probe the composition and evolution of carbon nano-grains
at the surface of (pre-)transitional protoplanetary disks around Herbig stars. We present spatially
resolved infrared emission spectra obtained with NAOS CONICA at the VLT in the 3-4 $\mu$m range with
a spatial resolution of 0.1", which allow us to trace aromatic, olefinic and aliphatic bands which
are attributed to sub-nanometer hydrocarbon grains. We apply a gaussian fitting to analyse the
observed spectral signatures. Finally, we propose an interpretation in the framework of the The
Heterogeneous dust Evolution Model of Interstellar Solids (THEMIS). We show the presence of several
spatially extended spectral features, related to aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbon material
in disks around Herbig stars, from ~ 10 to 50-100 au, and even in inner gaps devoided of large grains.
The correlation and constant intensity ratios between aliphatic and aromatic CH stretching bands
suggest a common nature of the carriers. Given their expected high destruction rates due to UV photons,
our observations suggest that they are continuously replenished at the disk surfaces.
