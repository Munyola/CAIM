We investigate the potential of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) and the
Next Generation Very Large Array (ngVLA) to observe substructures in nearby young disks which are
due to the gravitational interaction between disk material and planets close to the central star.
We simulate the gas and dust dynamics in the disk using the LA-COMPASS hydrodynamical code. We generate
synthetic images for the dust continuum emission at sub-millimeter to centimeter wavelengths
and simulate ALMA and ngVLA observations. We explore the parameter space of some of the main disk
and planet properties that would produce substructures that can be visible with ALMA and the ngVLA.
We find that ngVLA observations with an angular resolution of 5 milliarcsec at 3 mm can reveal and
characterize gaps and azimuthal asymmetries in disks hosting planets with masses down to $\approx~5
M_{\oplus}$ $\approx 1 - 5$ au from a Solar-like star in the closest star forming regions, whereas
ALMA can detect gaps down to planetary masses of $\approx 20~M_{\oplus}$ at 5 au. Gaps opened by super-Earth
planets with masses $\approx 5 - 10 M_{\oplus}$ are detectable by the ngVLA in the case of disks with
low viscosity ($\alpha \sim 10^{-5}$) and low pressure scale height ($h \approx 0.025$ au at 5 au).
The ngVLA can measure the proper motion of azimuthal asymmetric structures associated with the
disk-planet interaction, as well as possible circumplanetary disks on timescales as short as one
to a few weeks for planets at $1 - 5$ au from the star.
