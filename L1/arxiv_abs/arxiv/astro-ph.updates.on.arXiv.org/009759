Massive black-hole (MBH) binaries, which are expected to form following the merger of their parent
galaxies, produce gravitational waves which will be detectable by Pulsar Timing Arrays at nanohertz
frequencies (year periods). While no confirmed, compact MBH binary systems have been seen in electromagnetic
observations, a large number of candidates have recently been identified in optical surveys of
AGN variability. Using a combination of cosmological, hydrodynamic simulations; comprehensive,
semi-analytic binary merger models; and analytic AGN spectra and variability prescriptions;
we calculate the expected electromagnetic detection rates of MBH binaries as periodically variable
AGN. In particular, we consider two independent variability models: (i) Doppler boosting due to
large orbital velocities, and (ii) hydrodynamic variability in which the fueling of MBH accretion
disks is periodically modulated by the companion. Our models predict that numerous MBH binaries
should be present and distinguishable in the existing data. In particular, our fiducial models
produce an expectation value of $0.2$ (Doppler) and $5$ (hydrodynamic) binaries to be identifiable
in CRTS, while $20$ and $100$ are expected after five years of LSST observations. The brightness
variations in most systems are too small to be distinguishable, but almost $1\%$ of AGN at redshifts
$z \lesssim 0.6$ could be in massive binaries. We analyze the predicted binary parameters of observable
systems and their selection biases, and include an extensive discussion of our model parameters
and uncertainties.
