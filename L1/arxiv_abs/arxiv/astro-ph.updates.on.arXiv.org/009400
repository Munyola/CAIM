We investigate the effects of gradual heating on the evolution of turbulent molecular clouds of
mass $2\times 10^6$ M$_\odot$ and virial parameters ranging between $0.7-1.2$. This gradual heating
represents the energy output from processes such as winds from massive stars or feedback from High
Mass X-ray binaries (HMXBs), contrasting the impulsive energy injection from supernovae (SNe).
For stars with a mass high enough that their lifetime is shorter than the life of the cloud, we include
a SN feedback prescription. Including both effects, we investigate the interplay between slow
and fast forms of feedback and their effectiveness at triggering/suppressing star formation.
We find that SN feedback can carve low density chimneys in the gas, offering a path of least resistance
for the energy to escape. Once this occurs the more stable, but less energetic, gradual feedback
is able to keep the chimneys open. By funneling the hot destructive gas away from the centre of the
cloud, chimneys can have a positive effect on both the efficiency and duration of star formation.
Moreover, the critical factor is the number of high mass stars and SNe (and any subsequent HMXBs)
active within the free-fall time of each cloud. This can vary from cloud to cloud due to the stochasticity
of SN delay times and in HMXB formation. However, the defining factor in our simulations is the efficiency
of the cooling, which can alter the Jeans mass required for sink particle formation, along with the
number of massive stars in the cloud.
