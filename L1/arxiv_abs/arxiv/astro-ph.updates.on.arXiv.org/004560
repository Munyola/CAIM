Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) play a crucial role in studying cosmology and galactic chemical evolution.
They are thought to be thermonuclear explosions of carbon-oxygen white dwarfs (CO WDs) when their
masses reach the Chandrasekar mass limit in binaries. Previous studies have suggested that He novae
may be progenitor candidates of SNe Ia. However, the mass retention efficiencies during He nova
outbursts are still uncertain. In this article, we aim to study the mass retention efficiencies
of He nova outbursts and to investigate whether SNe Ia can be produced through He nova outbursts.
Using the stellar evolution code Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics, we simulated
a series of multicycle He-layer flashes, in which the initial WD masses range from 0.7 to 1.35 Msun
with various accretion rates. We obtained the mass retention efficiencies of He nova outbursts
for various initial WD masses, which can be used in the binary population synthesis studies. In our
simulations, He nova outbursts can increase the mass of the WD to the Chandrasekar mass limit and
the explosive carbon burning can be triggered in the center of the WD; this suggests that He nova outbursts
can produce SNe Ia. Meanwhile, the mass retention efficiencies in the present work are lower than
those of previous studies, which leads to a lower birthrates of SNe Ia through the WD + He star channel.
Furthermore, we obtained the elemental abundances distribution at the moment of explosive carbon
burning, which can be used as the initial input parameters in studying explosion models of SNe Ia.
