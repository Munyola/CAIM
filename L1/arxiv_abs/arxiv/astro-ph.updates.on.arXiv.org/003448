The formation of galaxies and their various components can be stringent tests of dark matter models
and of gravity theories. In the standard cold dark matter (CDM) model, spheroids are formed through
mergers in a strongly hierarchical scenario, and also in the early universe through dynamical friction
in clumpy galaxies. More secularly, pseudo-bulges are formed by the inner vertical resonance with
bars. The high efficiency of bulge formation is in tension with observations in the local universe
of a large amount of bulge-less spiral galaxies. In the present work, the formation of bulges in very
gas-rich galaxies, as those in the early universe, is studied in the Milgrom's MOdified Newtonian
Dynamics (MOND), through multi-grid simulations of the non-linear gravity, including the gas
dissipation, star formation and feedback. Clumpy disks are rapidly formed, as in their Newtonian
equivalent systems. However, the dynamical friction is not as efficient, in the absence of dark
matter halos, and the clumps have no time to coalesce into the center to form bulges, before they are
eroded by stellar feedback and shear forces. Previous work has established that mergers are less
frequent in MOND, and classical bulges are expected less massive. It is now shown that gas-rich clumpy
galaxies in the early universe do not form bulges. Since pseudo-bulges are formed with a similar
rate as in the Newtonian equivalent systems, it can be expected that the contribution of pseudo-bulges
is significantly higher in MOND.
