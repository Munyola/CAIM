Variations in scaling behavior in the flux and emissions of distant astronomical sources with respect
to their cosmic time are important l phenomena that can provide valuable information about the dynamics
within the sources and their cosmological evolution with time. Different studies have been applying
linear analysis to understand and model quasars' light curves. Here, we study the multifractal
behavior of selected quasars' radio emissions in their observed frame (at 22 and 37 GHz bands) and
and their rest frame. To this end, we apply the wavelet transform-based multifractal analysis formalism
called wavelet transform modulus maxima. In addition, we verify whether the autoregressive integrated
moving average (ARIMA) models fit our data or not. In our work, we observe strong multifractal behavior
for all the sources. Additionally, we find that the degree of multifractality is strongly similar
for each source and significantly different between sources at 22 and 37 GHz. This similarity implies
that the two frequencies have the same radiation region and mechanism, whereas the difference indicates
that the sources have intrinsically different dynamics. Furthermore, we show that the degree of
multifractality is the same in the observed and rest frames of the quasars, i.e., multifractality
is an intrinsic property of radio quasars. Finally, we show that the ARIMA models fit the 3C 345 quasar
at 22 GHz and partially fit most of the time series with the exception of the 3C 273 and 3C 279 quasars
at 37 GHz, for which the models are found to be inadequate.
