Using Galactic Plane surveys, we have selected a massive (1200 M$_\odot$), cold (14 K) 3.6-70 $\mu$m
dark IRDC G331.372-00.116. This IRDC has the potential to form high-mass stars and, given the absence
of current star formation signatures, it seems to represent the earliest stages of high-mass star
formation. We have mapped the whole IRDC with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array
(ALMA) at 1.1 and 1.3 mm in dust continuum and line emission. The dust continuum reveals 22 cores distributed
across the IRDC. In this work, we analyze the physical properties of the most massive core, ALMA1,
which has no molecular outflows detected in the CO (2-1), SiO (5-4), and H$_2$CO (3-2) lines. This
core is relatively massive ($M$ = 17.6 M$_\odot$), subvirialized (virial parameter $\alpha_{vir}=M_{vir}/M=0.14$),
and is barely affected by turbulence (transonic Mach number of 1.2). Using the HCO$^+$ (3-2) line,
we find the first detection of infall signatures in a relatively massive, prestellar core (ALMA1)
with the potential to form a high-mass star. We estimate an infall speed of 1.54 km s$^{-1}$ and a high
accretion rate of 1.96 $\times$ 10$^{-3}$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$. ALMA1 is rapidly collapsing, out
of virial equilibrium, more consistent with competitive accretion scenarios rather than the turbulent
core accretion model. On the other hand, ALMA1 has a mass $\sim$6 times larger than the clumps Jeans
mass, being in an intermediate mass regime ($M_{J}=2.7<M\lesssim$ 30 M$_\odot$), contrary to
what both the competitive accretion and turbulent core accretion theories predict.
