Using the \texttt{lalinference} Markov-chain Monte Carlo parameter estimation code, we examine
two distinct nonprecessing black hole-neutron star (BH-NS) binaries with and without higher-order
harmonics. Our simulations suggest that higher harmonics provide a minimal amount of additional
information, principally about source geometry. Higher harmonics do provide disproportionately
more information than expected from the signal power. Our results compare favorably to the "effective
Fisher matrix" approach. Extrapolating using analytic scalings, we expect higher harmonics will
provide little new information about nonprecessing BH-NS binaries at the signal amplitudes expected
for the first few detections. Any study of subdominant degrees of freedom in gravitational wave
astronomy can adopt the tools presented here ($V/V_{\rm prior}$ and $D_{KL}$) to assess whether
new physics is accessible (e.g., modifications of gravity; spin-orbit misalignment) and if so
precisely what information those new parameters provide. For astrophysicists, we provide a concrete
illustration of how well parameters of a BH-NS binary can be measured, relevant to the astrophysical
interpretation of coincident EM and GW events (e.g., short GRBs). For our fiducial initial-detector
example, the individual masses can be determined to lie between $7.11-11.48 M_\odot$ and $1.77-1.276M_\odot$
at greater than 99% confidence, accounting for unknown BH spin. Assuming comparable control over
waveform systematics, future measurements of BH-NS binaries can constrain the BH and perhaps NS
mass distributions.
