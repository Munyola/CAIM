With a projected size of about 450 kpc at z~2.3, the Slug Ly-alpha nebula is a rare laboratory to study,
in emission, the properties of the intergalactic gas in the Cosmic Web. Since its discovery, the
Slug has been the subject of several spectroscopic follow-ups to constrain the properties of the
emitting gas. Here we report the results of a deep MUSE integral-field spectroscopic search for
non-resonant, extended HeII1640 and metal emission. Extended HeII radiation is detected on scales
of about 100 kpc, but only in some regions associated with the bright Ly-alpha emission and a continuum-detected
source, implying large and abrupt variations in the line ratios across adjacent regions in projected
space. The recent detection of associated H-alpha emission and similar abrupt variations in the
Ly-alpha kinematics, strongly suggest that the HeII/Ly-alpha gradient is due to large variations
in the physical distances between the associated quasar and these regions. This implies that the
overall length of the emitting structure could extend to physical Mpc scales and be mostly oriented
along our line of sight. At the same time, the relatively low HeII/Ly-alpha values suggest that the
emitting gas has a broad density distribution that - if expressed in terms of a lognormal - implies
dispersions as high as those expected in the interstellar medium of galaxies. These results strengthen
the possibility that the density distribution of intergalactic gas at high-redshift is extremely
clumpy and multiphase on scales below our current observational spatial resolution of a few physical
kpc.
