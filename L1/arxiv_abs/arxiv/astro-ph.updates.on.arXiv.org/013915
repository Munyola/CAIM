We observe the abrupt end of solar activity cycles at the Sun's equator by combining almost 140 years
of observations from ground and space. These "terminator" events appear to be very closely related
to the onset of magnetic activity belonging to the next sunspot cycle at mid-latitudes and the polar-reversal
process at high-latitudes. Using multi-scale tracers of solar activity we examine the timing of
these events in relation to the excitation of new activity and find that the time taken for the solar
plasma to communicate this transition is of the order of one solar rotation, but could be shorter.
Utilizing uniquely comprehensive solar observations from the Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory
(STEREO), and Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) we see that this transitional event is strongly
longitudinal in nature. Combined, these characteristics imply that magnetic information is communicated
through the solar interior rapidly. A range of possibilities exist to explain such behavior: the
presence of magnetic reconnection in the deep interior, internal gravity waves on the solar tachocline,
or that the magnetic fields present in the Sun's convection zone could be very large, with a poloidal
field strengths reaching 50k - considerably larger than conventional explorations of solar and
stellar dynamos estimate. Regardless of mechanism responsible, the rapid timescales demonstrated
by the Sun's global magnetic field reconfiguration present strong constraints on first-principles
numerical simulations of the solar interior and, by extension, other stars.
