The Magellanic Clouds (MCs) are the most massive gas-bearing systems falling into the Galaxy at
the present epoch. They show clear signs of interaction, manifested in particular by the Magellanic
Stream, a spectacular gaseous wake that trails from the MCs extending more than 150 degree across
the sky. Ahead of the MCs is the "Leading Arm" usually interpreted as the gaseous counterpart of the
Magellanic Stream, an assumption we now call into question. We revisit the formation of these tidal
features in a first-infall scenario, including for the first time a Galactic model with a weakly
magnetised, spinning hot corona. In agreement with previous studies, we broadly recover the location
and the extension of the Stream on the sky. In contrast, we find that the formation of the Leading Arm
-- that is otherwise present in models without a corona -- is inhibited by the hydrodynamic interaction
with the hot component. These results hold with or without coronal rotation or a weak, ambient magnetic
field. Since the existence of the hot corona is well established, we are led to two possible interpretations:
(i) the Leading Arm survives because the coronal density beyond 20 kpc is a factor of 10 lower than
required by conventional spheroidal coronal x-ray models, consistent with recent claims of rapid
coronal rotation; or (ii) the `Leading Arm' is cool gas trailing from a frontrunner, a satellite
moving ahead of the MCs, consistent with its higher metallicity compared to the trailing stream.
Both scenarios raise issues that we discuss.
