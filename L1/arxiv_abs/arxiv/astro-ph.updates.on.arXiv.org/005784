About 766 $\delta$ Scuti stars were observed by LAMOST by June 16, 2017. Stellar atmospheric parameters
of 525 variables were determined, while spectral types were obtained for all samples. In the paper,
those spectroscopic data are catalogued. We detect a group of 131 unusual and cool variable stars
(UCVs) that are distinguished from the normal $\delta$ Scuti stars (NDSTs). On the H-R diagram and
the $\log g-T$ diagram, the UCVs are far beyond the red edge of pulsational instability trip. Their
effective temperatures are lower than 6700\,K with periods in the range from 0.09 to 0.22\,days.
NDSTs have metallicity close to that of the Sun as expected, while UCVs are slightly metal poor than
NDSTs. The two peaks on the distributions of the period and stellar atmospheric parameters are all
caused by the existence of UCVs. When those UCVs are excluded, it is discovered that the effective
temperature, the gravitational acceleration and the metallicity all are correlated with the pulsating
period for NDSTs and their physical properties and evolutionary states are discussed. The detecting
of those UCVs indicates that about 25\% of the known $\delta$ Scuti stars may be misclassified. However,
if some of them are confirmed to be pulsating stars, they will be a new-type pulsator and their investigations
will shed light on theoretical instability domains and on the theories of interacting between the
pulsation and the convection of solar-type stars. Meanwhile, 88 $\delta$ Scuti stars are detected
to be the candidates of binary or multiple systems.
