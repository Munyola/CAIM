A large fraction of stars are in binary systems, yet the evolution of proto-planetary discs in binaries
has been little explored from the theoretical side. In this paper we investigate the evolution of
the discs surrounding the primary and secondary components of binary systems on the assumption
that this is driven by photoevaporation induced by X-rays from the respective star. We show how for
close enough separations (20-30 AU for average X-ray luminosities) the tidal torque of the companion
changes the qualitative behaviour of disc dispersal from inside out to outside in. Fewer transition
discs created by photoevaporation are thus expected in binaries. We also demonstrate that in close
binaries the reduction in viscous time leads to accelerated disc clearing around both components,
consistent with $\textit{unresolved}$ observations. When looking at the $\textit{differential}$
disc evolution around the two components, in close binaries discs around the secondary clear first
due to the shorter viscous timescale associated with the smaller outer radius. In wide binaries
instead the difference in photo-evaporation rate makes the secondaries longer lived, though this
is somewhat dependent on the assumed scaling of viscosity with stellar mass. We find that our models
are broadly compatible with the growing sample of $\textit{resolved}$ observations of discs in
binaries. We also predict that binaries have higher accretion rates than single stars for the same
disc mass. Thus binaries probably contribute to the observed scatter in the relationship between
disc mass and accretion rate in young stars.
