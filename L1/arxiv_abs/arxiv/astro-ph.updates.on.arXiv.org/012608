Here we assess the spectral and imaging properties of Fabry P\'erot etalons when located in solar
magnetographs. We discuss the chosen configuration (collimated or telecentric) for both ideal
and real cases. For the real cases, we focus on the effects caused by the polychromatic illumination
of the filter by the irregularities in the optical thickness of the etalon and by deviations from
the ideal illumination in both setups. We first review the general properties of Fabry P\'erots
and we then address the different sources of degradation of the spectral transmission profile.
We review and extend the general treatment of defects followed by different authors. We discuss
the differences between the point spread functions (PSFs) of the collimated and telecentric configurations
for both monochromatic and (real) quasi-monochromatic illumination of the etalon. The PSF corresponding
to collimated mounts is shown to have a better performance, although it varies from point to point
due to an apodization of the image inherent to this configuration. This is in contrast to the (perfect)
telecentric case, where the PSF remains constant but produces artificial velocities and magnetic
field signals because of its strong spectral dependence. We find that the unavoidable presence
of imperfections in the telecentrism produces a decrease of flux of photons and a shift, a broadening
and a loss of symmetrization of both the spectral and PSF profiles over the field of view, thus compromising
their advantages over the collimated configuration. We evaluate these effects for different apertures
of the incident beam.
