We analyze recent high resolution photospheric small-scale dynamo simulations that were computed
with the MURaM radiative MHD code. We focus the analysis on newly forming downflow lanes in exploding
granules since they show how weakly magnetized regions in the photosphere (center of granules)
evolve into strongly magnetized regions (downflow lanes). We find that newly formed downflow lanes
exhibit initially mostly a laminar converging flow that amplifies the vertical magnetic field
embedded in the granule from a few 10 G to field strengths exceeding 800 G. This results in extended
magnetic sheets that have a length comparable to granular scales. Field amplification by turbulent
shear happens first a few 100 km beneath the visible layers of the photosphere. Shallow recirculation
transports the resulting turbulent field into the photosphere within minutes, after which the
newly formed downflow lane shows a mix of strong magnetic sheets and turbulent field components.
We stress in particular the role of shallow and deep recirculation for the organization and strength
of magnetic field in the photosphere and discuss the photospheric and sub-photospheric energy
conversion associated with the small-scale dynamo process. While the energy conversion through
the Lorentz force depends only weakly on the saturation field strength (and therefore deep or shallow
recirculation), it is strongly dependent on the magnetic Prandtl number. We discuss the potential
of these findings for further constraining small-scale dynamo models through high resolution
observations.
