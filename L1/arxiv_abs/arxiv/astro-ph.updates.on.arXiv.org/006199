To investigate the effects the cluster environment has on Late-Type Galaxies (LTGs) we studied
HI perturbation signatures for all Abell 1367 LTGs with HI detections. We used new VLA HI observations
combined with AGES single dish blind survey data. Our study indicates that the asymmetry between
the high-and low-velocity wings of the characteristic double-horn integrated HI spectrum as measured
by the asymmetry parameter, Aflux, can be a useful diagnostic for ongoing and/or recent HI stripping.
26% of A1367 LTGs have an Aflux ratio, more asymmetrical than 3 times the 1{\sigma} spread in the Aflux
ratio distribution of an undisturbed sample of isolated galaxies (2%) and samples from other denser
environments (10% to 20%). Over half of the A 1367 LTGs, which are members of groups or pairs, have
an Aflux ratio larger than twice the 1 {\sigma} spread found in the isolated sample. This suggests
inter-group/pair interactions could be making a significant contribution to the LTGs displaying
such Aflux ratios. The study also demonstrates that the definition of the HI offset from the optical
centre of LTGs is resolution dependent, suggesting that unresolved AGES HI offsets that are significantly
larger than the pointing uncertainties (> 2 {\sigma}) reflect interactions which have asymmetrically
displaced significant masses of lower density HI, while having minimal impact on the location of
the highest density HI in resolved maps. The distribution of Aflux from a comparable sample of Virgo
galaxies provides a clear indication that the frequency of HI profile perturbations is lower than
in A 1367.
