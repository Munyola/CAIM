Magnetar flares excite strong Alfv\'{e}n waves in the magnetosphere of the neutron star. The wave
energy can (1) dissipate in the magnetosphere, (2) convert to "fast modes" and possibly escape,
and (3) penetrate the neutron star crust and dissipate there. We examine and compare the three options.
Particularly challenging are nonlinear interactions between strong waves, which develop a cascade
to small dissipative scales. This process can be studied in the framework of force-free electrodynamics
(FFE). We perform three-dimensional FFE simulations to investigate Alfv\'{e}n wave dissipation,
how long it takes, and how it depends on the initial wave amplitude on the driving scale. In the simulations,
we launch two large Alfv\'{e}n wave packets that keep bouncing on closed magnetic field lines and
collide repeatedly until the full turbulence spectrum develops. Besides dissipation due to the
turbulent cascade, we find that in some simulations spurious energy losses occur immediately in
the first collisions. This effect occurs in special cases where the FFE description breaks. It is
explained with a simple one-dimensional model, which we examine in both FFE and full magnetohydrodynamic
settings. We find that magnetospheric dissipation through nonlinear wave interactions is relatively
slow and more energy is drained into the neutron star. The wave energy deposited into the star is promptly
dissipated through plastic crustal flows induced at the bottom of the liquid ocean, and a fraction
of the generated heat is radiated from the stellar surface.
