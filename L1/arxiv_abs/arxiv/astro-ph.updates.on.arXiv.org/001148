Adaptive-Optics assisted SINFONI observations of the central regions of ten early-type galaxies
are presented. Based primarily on the SINFONI kinematics, ten black hole masses occupying the high-mass
regime of the M_BH-sigma relation are derived using three-integral Schwarzschild models. The
effect of dark matter inclusion on the black hole mass is explored. The omission of a dark matter halo
in the model results in a higher stellar mass-to-light ratio, especially when extensive kinematic
data are used in the model. However, when the diameter of the sphere of influence -- computed using
the black hole mass derived without a dark halo -- is at least 10 times the PSF FWHM during the observations,
it is safe to exclude a dark matter component in the dynamical modeling, i.e. the change in black hole
mass is negligible. When the spatial resolution is marginal, restricting the mass-to-light ratio
to the right value returns the correct M_BH although dark halo is not present in the model. Compared
to the M_BH-sigma and M_BH-L relations of McConnell et al. (2011), the ten black holes are all more
massive than expected from the luminosities and seven black hole masses are higher than expected
from the stellar velocity dispersions of the host bulges. Using new fitted relations which include
the ten galaxies, we find that the space density of the most massive black holes (M_BH >~ 10^9 Msun)
estimated from the M_BH-L relation is higher than the estimate based on the M_BH-sigma relation
and the latter is higher than model predictions based on quasar counts, each by about an order of magnitude.
