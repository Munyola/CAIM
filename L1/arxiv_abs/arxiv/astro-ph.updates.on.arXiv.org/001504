The theoretical concept that braided magnetic field lines in the solar corona may dissipate a sufficient
amount of energy to account for the brightening observed in the active-region corona, has been substantiated
by high-resolution observations only recently. From the analysis of coronal images obtained with
the High Resolution Coronal Imager, first observational evidence of the braiding of magnetic field
lines was reported by Cirtain et al. 2013 (hereafter CG13). We present nonlinear force-free reconstructions
of the associated coronal magnetic field based on vector SDO/HMI magnetograms. We deliver estimates
of the free magnetic energy associated to a braided coronal structure. Our model results suggest
(~100 times) more free energy at the braiding site than analytically estimated by CG13, strengthening
the possibility of the active-region corona being heated by field line braiding. We were able to
assess the coronal free energy appropriately by using vector field measurements and attribute
the lower energy estimate of CG13 to the underestimated (by a factor of 10) azimuthal field strength.
We also quantify the increase of the overall twist of a flare-related flux rope which had been claimed
by CG13. From our models we find that the overall twist of the flux rope increased by about half a turn
within twelve minutes. Unlike another method, to which we compare our results to, we evaluate the
winding of the flux rope's constituent field lines around each other purely based on their modeled
coronal 3D field line geometry -- to our knowledge for the first time.
