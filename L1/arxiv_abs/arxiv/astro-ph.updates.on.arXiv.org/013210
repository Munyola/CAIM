Most recent numerical simulations suggest that bipolar HII regions, powered by O-type stars, can
be formed at the interface of two colliding clouds. To observationally understand the birth of O-type
stars, we present a detailed multi-wavelength analysis of an area of 1 deg x 1 deg hosting G8.14+0.23
HII region associated with an infrared bipolar nebula (BPN). Based on the radio continuum map, the
HII region is excited by at least an O-type star, which is located toward the waist of the BPN. The NANTEN2
13CO line data reveal the existence of two extended clouds at [9, 14.3] and [15.3, 23.3] km/s toward
the site G8.14+0.23, which are connected in the position-velocity space through a broad-bridge
feature at the intermediate velocity range. A "cavity/intensity-depression" feature is evident
in the blueshifted cloud, and is spatially matched by the "elongated redshifted cloud". The spatial
and velocity connections of the clouds suggest their interaction in the site G8.14+0.23. The analysis
of deep near-infrared photometric data reveals the presence of clusters of infrared-excess sources,
illustrating ongoing star formation activities in both the clouds. The O-type star is part of the
embedded cluster seen in the waist of the BPN, which is observed toward the spatial matching zone
of the cavity and the redshifted cloud. The observational results appear to be in reasonable agreement
with the numerical simulations of cloud-cloud collision (CCC), suggesting that the CCC process
seems to be responsible for the birth of the O-type star in G8.14+0.23.
