We aim to perform a theoretical evaluation of the impact of the mass loss indetermination on asteroseismic
grid based estimates of masses, radii, and ages of stars in the red giant branch phase (RGB). We adopted
the SCEPtER pipeline on a grid spanning the mass range [0.8; 1.8] Msun. As observational constraints,
we adopted the star effective temperatures, the metallicity [Fe/H], the average large frequency
spacing $\Delta \nu,$ and the frequency of maximum oscillation power $\nu_{\rm max}$. The mass
loss was modelled following a Reimers parametrization with the two different efficiencies $\eta
= 0.4$ and $\eta = 0.8$. In the RGB phase, the average error owing only to observational uncertainty
on mass and age estimates is about 8% and 30% respectively. The bias in mass and age estimates caused
by the adoption of a wrong mass loss parameter in the recovery is minor for the vast majority of the
RGB evolution. The biases get larger only after the RGB bump. In the last 2.5% of the RGB lifetime the
error on the mass determination reaches 6.5% becoming larger than the random error component in
this evolutionary phase. The error on the age estimate amounts to 9%, that is, equal to the random
error uncertainty. These results are independent of the stellar metallicity [Fe/H] in the explored
range. Asteroseismic-based estimates of stellar mass, radius, and age in the RGB phase can be considered
mass loss independent within the range ($\eta \in [0.0, 0.8]$) as long as the target is in an evolutionary
phase preceding the RGB bump.
