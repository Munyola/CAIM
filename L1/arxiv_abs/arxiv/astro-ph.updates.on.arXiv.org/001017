The HII region luminosity function (LF) is an important tool for deriving the birthrates and mass
distribution of OB associations, and is an excellent tracer of the newly formed massive stars and
associations. To date, extensive work (predominantly in H{\alpha}) has been done from the ground,
which is hindered by dust extinction and the severe blending of adjacent (spatially or in projection)
HII regions. Reliably measuring the properties of HII regions requires a linear resolution <40
pc, but analyses satisfying this requirement have been done only in a handful of galaxies, so far.
As the first space-based work using a galaxy sample, we have selected 12 galaxies from our HST NICMOS
Pa{\alpha} survey and studied the luminosity function and size distribution of HII regions both
in individual galaxies and cumulatively, using a virtually extinction-free tracer of the ionizing
photon rate. The high angular resolution and low sensitivity to diffuse emission of NICMOS also
offer an advantage over ground-based imaging by enabling a higher degree of de-blending of the HII
regions. We do not confirm the broken power-law LFs found in ground-based studies. Instead, we find
that the LFs, both individual and co-added, follow a single power law dN(L)/dlnL ~ L^-1, consistent
with the mass function of star clusters in nearby galaxies, and in agreement with the results of the
existing analyses with HST data. The individual and co-added size distribution of HII regions are
both roughly consistent with dN(D)/dlnD ~ D^-3, but the power-law scaling is probably contaminated
by blended regions or complexes.
