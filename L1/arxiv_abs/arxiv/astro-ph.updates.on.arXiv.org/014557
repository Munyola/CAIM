Utilizing the SDSS-DR13 spectroscopic dataset, we create a new publicly-available catalog of
1,870 galaxy clusters (GalWeight cluster catalog, $\mathtt{GalWCat19}$) and a corresponding
catalog of 38,536 identified member galaxies. The clusters are identified from overdensities
in redshift-phase space. The GalWeight technique introduced in Abdullah, Wilson and Klypin (AWK18)
is then applied to identify cluster members. The completeness of the cluster catalog ($\mathtt{GalWCat19}$)
and the procedure followed to determine cluster mass are tested on the Bolshoi N-body simulations.
The 1,870 $\mathtt{GalWCat19}$ clusters range in redshift between $0.01 - 0.2$ and in mass between
$(0.4 - 14) \times 10^{14}h^{-1}M_{\odot}$. The cluster catalog provides a large number of cluster
parameters including sky position, redshift, membership, velocity dispersion, and mass at overdensities
$\Delta = 500, 200, 100, 5.5$. The 38,536 member galaxies are identified within the radius at which
the density is 200 times the critical density of the Universe. The galaxy catalog provides the coordinates
of each galaxy and the ID of the cluster that the galaxy belongs to. The cluster velocity dispersion
scales with mass as $\log(\sigma_{200})=\log(933\pm29~ \mbox{km} ~ \mbox{s}^{-1}) +(0.35\pm0.04)\log\left[h(z)
~ M_{200}/10^{15}M_\odot\right]$ with scatter of $\delta = 0.06$. The fundamental dynamical
parameters of the cluster sample do not show evolution in the redshift interval $0.0 < z < 0.2$. The
catalogs are publicly available at the following website\footnote{\url{https://mohamed-elhashash-94.webself.net/}}.
