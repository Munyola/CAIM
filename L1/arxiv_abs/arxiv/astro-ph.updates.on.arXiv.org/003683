We present new Plateau de Bure Interferometer observations of a region in the filamentary infrared-dark
cloud (IRDC) G011.11-0.12 containing young, star-forming cores. In addition to the 3.2mm continuum
emission from cold dust, we map this region in the N$_2$H$^+$(1-0) line to trace the core kinematics
with an angular resolution of 2" and velocity resolution of 0.2km s$^{-1}$. These data are presented
in concert with recent {\em Herschel} results, single-dish N$_2$H$^+$(1-0) data, SABOCA 350$\mu$m
continuum data, and maps of the C$^{18}$O (2-1) transition obtained with the IRAM 30m telescope.
We recover the star-forming cores at 3.2mm continuum, while in N$_2$H$^+$ they appear at the peaks
of extended structures. The mean projected spacing between N$_2$H$^+$ emission peaks is 0.18pc,
consistent with simple isothermal Jeans fragmentation. The 0.1pc-sized cores have low virial
parameters on the criticality borderline, while on the scale of the whole region, we infer that it
is undergoing large-scale collapse. The N$_2$H$^+$ linewidth increases with evolutionary stage,
while CO isotopologues show no linewidth variation with core evolution. Centroid velocities of
all tracers are in excellent agreement, except in the starless region where two N$_2$H$^+$ velocity
components are detected, one of which has no counterpart in C$^{18}$O. We suggest that gas along
this line of sight may be falling into the quiescent core, giving rise to the second velocity component,
possibly connected to the global collapse of the region.
