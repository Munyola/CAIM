The famous Rosette Nebula has an evacuated central cavity formed from the stellar winds ejected
from the 2-6 million-year-old co-distant and co-moving central star cluster NGC 2244. However,
with upper age estimates of less than 110,000 years, the central cavity is too young compared to NGC
2244 and existing models do not reproduce its properties. A new proper motion study herein using
Gaia data reveals the ejection of the most massive star in the Rosette, HD46223, from NGC 2244 occurred
1.73 (+0.34,-0.25)Myr (1$\sigma$ uncertainty) in the past. Assuming this ejection was at the birth
of the most massive stars in NGC 2244, including the dominant centrally positioned HD46150, the
age is set for the famous ionised region at more than ten times that derived for the cavity. Here, we
are able to reproduce the structure of the Rosette Nebula, through simulation of mechanical stellar
feedback from a 40M$_{\odot}$ star in a thin sheet-like molecular cloud. We form the 135,000M$_{\odot}$
cloud from thermally-unstable diffuse interstellar medium under the influence of a realistic
background magnetic field with thermal/magnetic pressure equilibrium. Properties derived from
a snapshot of the simulation at 1.5Myr, including cavity size, stellar age, magnetic field and resulting
inclination to the line of sight, match those derived from observations. An elegant explanation
is thus provided for the stark contrast in age estimates based on realistic diffuse ISM properties,
molecular cloud formation and stellar wind feedback.
