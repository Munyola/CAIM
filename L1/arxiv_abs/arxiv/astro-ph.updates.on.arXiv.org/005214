GRB 170817A is the first short gamma-ray burst (GRB) with direct detection of the gravitational
wave radiation and also the spectroscopically identified macronova emission (i.e., AT2017gfo).
The prompt emission of this burst however is under-luminous in comparison with the other short GRBs
with known redshift. In this work we examine whether GRB 170817A is indeed unique. We firstly show
that GRB 130603B/macronova may be the on-beam "counterparts" of GRB 170817A/AT2017gfo, and the
extremely dim afterglow emission of GRB 170817A may suggest a low number density ($\sim 10^{-4}~{\rm
cm^{-3}}$) of its circum-burst medium. We then discuss whether GRB 070923, GRB 080121, GRB 090417A,
GRB 111005A and GRB 170817A form a new group of very-nearby under-luminous GRBs originated from
neutron star mergers. If the short events GRB 070923, GRB 080121 and GRB 090417A are indeed at a redshift
of $\sim 0.076,0.046,0.088$, respectively, their isotropic energies of the prompt emission are
$\sim 10^{47}$ erg and thus comparable to the rest two events. The non-detection of optical counterparts
of GRB 070923, GRB 080121, GRB 090417A and GRB 111005A, however, strongly suggests that the macronovae
from neutron star mergers are significantly diverse in luminosities or alternatively there is
the other origin channel (for instance, the white dwarf and black hole mergers). We finally suggest
that GW170817/GRB 170817A are likely not alone and similar events will be detected by the upgrading/upcoming
gravitational wave detectors and the electromagnetic monitors.
