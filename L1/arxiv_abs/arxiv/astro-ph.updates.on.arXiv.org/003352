47 Tucanae is one of the most interesting and well observed and theoretically studied globular clusters.
This allows us to study the reliability of our understanding of white dwarf cooling sequences, to
confront different methods to determine its age, and to assess other important characteristics,
like its star formation history. Here we present a population synthesis study of the cooling sequence
of the globular cluster 47 Tucanae. In particular, we study the distribution of effective temperatures,
the shape of the color-magnitude diagram, and the corresponding magnitude and color distributions.
We do so using an up-to-date population synthesis code based on Monte Carlo techniques, that incorporates
the most recent and reliable cooling sequences and an accurate modeling of the observational biases.
We find a good agreement between our theoretical models and the observed data. Thus, our study, rules
out previous claims that there are still missing physics in the white dwarf cooling models at moderately
high effective temperatures. We also derive the age of the cluster using the termination of the cooling
sequence, obtaining a good agreement with the age determinations using the main-sequence turn-off.
Finally, we find that the star formation history of the cluster is compatible with that btained using
main sequence stars, which predict the existence of two distinct populations. We conclude that
a correct modeling of the white dwarf population of globular clusters, used in combination with
the number counts of main sequence stars provides an unique tool to model the properties of globular
clusters.
