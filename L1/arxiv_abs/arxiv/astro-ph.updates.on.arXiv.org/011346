We have imaged the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect signals at 140 and 270 GHz towards ten galaxy clusters
with Bolocam and AzTEC/ASTE. We also used Planck data to constrain the signal at large angular scales,
Herschel-SPIRE images to subtract the brightest galaxies that comprise the cosmic infrared background
(CIB), Chandra imaging to map the electron temperature $T_e$ of the intra-cluster medium (ICM),
and HST imaging to derive models of each galaxy cluster's mass density. The galaxy clusters gravitationally
lens the background CIB, which produced an on-average reduction in brightness towards the galaxy
clusters' centers after the brightest galaxies were subtracted. We corrected for this deficit,
which was between 5-25% of the 270 GHz SZ effect signal within $R_{2500}$. Using the SZ effect measurements,
along with the X-ray constraint on $T_e$, we measured each galaxy cluster's average line of sight
(LOS) velocity $v_z$ within $R_{2500}$, with a median per-cluster uncertainty of +-700 km/s. We
found an ensemble-mean <$v_z$> of 430+-210 km/s, and an intrinsic cluster-to-cluster scatter
$\sigma_{int}$ of 470+-340 km/s. We also obtained maps of $v_z$ over each galaxy cluster's face
with an angular resolution of 70". All four galaxy clusters previously identified as having a merger
oriented along the LOS showed an excess variance in these maps, at a significance of $\gtrsim$4$\sigma$
in two of the galaxy clusters, indicating an internal $v_z$ rms of $\gtrsim$1000 km/s. None of the
six galaxy clusters previously identified as relaxed or plane of sky mergers showed any such excess
variance.
