We present a novel absorption line survey using 54 blue horizontal branch stars (BHBs) in the Milky
Way halo as background sources for detecting gas flows at the disk-halo interface. Distance measurements
to high-latitude ($b$ > 60{\deg}) background stars at 3.1-13.4 kpc, combined with unprecedented
spatial sampling and spectral resolution, allow us to examine the 3-dimensional spatial distribution
and kinematics of gas flows near the disk. We detect absorption signatures of extraplanar CaII and
NaI in Keck HIRES spectra and find that their column densities exhibit no trend with distance to the
background sources, indicating that these clouds lie within 3.1 kpc of the disk. We calculate covering
fractions of $f_{CaII}$ = 63%, $f_{NaI}$ = 26%, and $f_{HI}$ = 52%, consistent with a picture of the
CGM that includes multi-phase clouds containing small clumps of cool gas within hotter, more diffuse
gas. Our measurements constrain the scale of any substructure within these cool clouds to <0.5 kpc.
CaII and NaI absorption features exhibit an intermediate-velocity (IV) component inflowing at
velocities of -75 km/s < v < -25 km/s relative to the local standard of rest, consistent with previously-studied
HI structures in this region. We report the new detection of an inflow velocity gradient ${\Delta}v_z$
~ 6-9 km/s/kpc across the Galactic plane. These findings place constraints on the physical and kinematic
properties of CGM gas flows through the disk-halo interface, and support a galactic fountain model
in which cold gas rains back onto the disk.
