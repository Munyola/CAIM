We present analytic expressions for the cosmic string unequal time correlator (UETC) in the context
of the Unconnected Segment Model (USM). This eliminates the need to simulate the many thousands
of network realisations needed to estimate the UETC numerically. With our approach we can compute
the UETC very accurately, over all scales of interest, in the order of ~20-30 seconds on a single CPU.
Our formalism facilitates an efficient approach to computing Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)
anisotropies for cosmic strings. Discretising the UETC and performing an eigen-decomposition
to act as sources in the CAMB CMB code, the power spectrum can be calculated by summing over a finite
number of eigenmodes. A much smaller number of eigenmodes are required compared to the conventional
approach of averaging power spectra over a finite number of realisations of the string network.
With the additional efficiency and performance improvements offered by the OpenMP CAMB code, the
time required to compute string power spectra is significantly reduced compared to the standard
serial CMBACT code. The latter takes ~30 hours on a modern single threaded CPU for 2000 network realisations.
Similar percent level accuracy can be achieved with our approach on a moderately threaded CPU (8
threads) in only ~15 minutes. If accuracy is only required at the 10 percent level and the CPU is more
highly threaded, cosmic string power spectra are now possible in ~2-3 minutes. This makes exploration
of the string parameter space now possible for Markov-Chain-Monte-Carlo (MCMC) analysis.
