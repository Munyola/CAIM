Observational evidence of star-planet magnetic interactions (SPMI) in compact exo-systems have
been looked for in the past decades. Indeed planets in close-in orbit can be magnetically connected
to their host star, and channel Alfv\'en waves carrying large amounts of energy towards the central
star. The strength and temporal modulation of SPMIs are primarily set by the magnetic topology of
the host star and the orbital characteristics of the planet. As a result, SPMI signals can be modulated
over the rotational period of the star, the orbital period of the planet, or a complex combination
of the two. The detection of SPMI thus have to rely on multiple-epochs and multiple-wavelengths
observational campaigns. We present a new method to characterize SPMIs and apply it to Kepler-78,
a late G star with a super-Earth on an 8.5 hours orbit. We model the corona of Kepler-78 using the large-scale
magnetic topology of the star observed with Zeeman-Doppler-Imaging. We show that the closeness
of Kepler-78b allows the interaction to channel energy flux densities up to a few kW m$^{-2}$ towards
the central star. We show that this flux is large enough to be detectable in classical activity tracers
such as H$\alpha$. It is nonetheless too weak to explain the modulation observed by \citet{Moutou2016}.
We furthermore demonstrate how to predict the temporal modulation of SPMI signals in observed systems
such as Kepler-78. The methodology presented here thus paves the road towards denser, specific
observational campaigns that would allow a proper identification of SPMIs in compact star-planet
systems.
