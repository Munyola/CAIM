We have observed the relativistic binary pulsar PSR J1141$-$6545 over a period of $\sim$6 years
using the Parkes 64 m radio telescope, with a focus on modelling the diffractive intensity scintillations
to improve the accuracy of the astrometric timing model. The long-term scintillation, which shows
orbital and annual variations, allows us to measure parameters that are difficult to measure with
pulsar timing alone. These include: the orbital inclination $i$; the longitude of the ascending
node $\Omega$; and the pulsar system transverse velocity. We use the annual variations to resolve
the previous ambiguity in the sense of the inclination angle. Using the correct sense, and a prior
probability distribution given by a constraint from pulsar timing ($i=73\pm3^\circ$), we find
$\Omega=24.8\pm1.8^\circ$ and we estimate the pulsar distance to be $D=10^{+4}_{-3}$ kpc. This
then gives us an estimate of this pulsar's proper motion of $\mu_{\alpha}\cos{\delta}=2.9\pm1.0$
mas yr$^{-1}$ in right ascension and $\mu_{\delta}=1.8\pm0.6$ mas yr$^{-1}$ in declination.
Finally, we obtain measurements of the spatial structure of the interstellar electron density
fluctuations, including: the spatial scale and anisotropy of the diffraction pattern; the distribution
of scattering material along the line of sight; and spatial variation in the strength of turbulence
from epoch to epoch. We find that the scattering is dominated by a thin screen at a distance of $(0.724\pm0.008)D$,
with an anisotropy axial ratio $A_{\rm r} = 2.14\pm0.11$.
