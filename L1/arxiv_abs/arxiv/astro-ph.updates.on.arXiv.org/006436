We present an investigation of the rotation and non-radial motion of a coronal mass ejection (CME)
from AR 12468 on 2015 December 16 using observations from SDO, SOHO, STEREO A and Wind. The EUV and
HMI observations of the source region show that the associated magnetic flux rope (MFR) axis pointed
to the east before the eruption. We use a nonlinear fore-free field (NLFFF) extrapolation to determine
the configuration of the coronal magnetic field and calculate the magnetic energy density distributions
at different heights. The distribution of the magnetic energy density shows a strong gradient toward
the northeast. The propagation direction of the CME from a Graduated Cylindrical Shell (GCS) modeling
deviates from the radial direction of the source region by about 45 degr in longitude and about 30
degr in latitude, which is consistent with the gradient of the magnetic energy distribution around
the AR.The MFR axis determined by the GCS modeling points southward, which has rotated counterclockwise
by about 95 degr compared with the orientation of the MFR in the low corona.The MFR reconstructed
by a Grad-Shafranov (GS) method at 1 AU has almost the same orientation as the MFR from the GCS modeling,
which indicates that the MFR rotation occurred in the low corona. It is the rotation of the MFR that
caused the intense geomagnetic storm with the minimum Dst of -155 nT. These results suggest that
the coronal magnetic field surrounding the MFR plays a crucial role in the MFR rotation and propagation
direction.
