We report on magnetic field measurements of 157 chemically peculiar A/B stars (Ap/Bp) based on resolved,
magnetically split absorption lines present in $H$-band spectra provided by the Sloan Digital
Sky Survey (SDSS)/Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE) survey. These
stars represent the extreme magnetic end of a still-growing sample of >900 Ap/Bp stars selected
among the APOGEE telluric standard stars as those with Ce III absorption lines and/or literature
Ap/Bp classifications. The lines most frequently resolved into their split components for these
stars in the $H$-band pertain primarily pertain to Ce III, Cr II, Fe I, Mn II, Si I, and Ca II, in addition
to one or more unidentified ions. Using mean magnetic field modulus (<B>) estimates for transitions
with known Land\'e factors, we estimate effective Land\'e factors for 5 Ce III lines and 15 unknown
lines and proceed to measure <B> of 157 stars, only 3 of which have previous literature estimates
of <B>. This 183% increase in the number of Ap/Bp stars for which <B> has been measured is a result of
the large number of stars observed by SDSS/APOGEE, extension of high-resolution Ap/Bp star observations
to fainter magnitudes, and the advantages of long wavelengths for resolving magnetically split
lines. With <B>=25 kG, the star 2MASS J02563098+4534239 is currently the most magnetic star of the
SDSS/APOGEE sample. Effective Land\'e factors, representative line profiles, and magnetic field
moduli are presented. The validity of the results is supported using optical, high-resolution,
follow-up spectra for 29 of the stars.
