Early and late multiwavelength observations play an important role in determining the nature of
the progenitor, circumburst medium, physical processes and emitting regions associated to the
spectral and temporal features of bursts. GRB 180720B is a long and powerful burst detected by a large
number of observatories in multiwavelenths that range from radio bands to GeV gamma-rays. The simultaneous
multiwavelength observations were presented over multiple periods of time beginning just after
the trigger time and extending for more than 30 days. The temporal and spectral analysis of Fermi
LAT observations suggest that it presents similar characteristics to other bursts detected by
this instrument. Coupled with X-ray and optical observations, the standard external-shock model
in a homogeneous medium is favored by this analysis. The X-ray flare is consistent with the synchrotron
self-Compton (SSC) model from the reverse-shock region evolving in a thin shell and long-lived
LAT, X-ray and optical data with the standard synchrotron forward-shock model. The best-fit parameters
derived with the Markov chain Monte Carlo simulations indicate that the outflow is endowed with
magnetic fields, the radio observations are in the self-absorption regime and the LAT photons beyond
the synchrotron limit have to be explained with a different radiative process. We propose that the
most natural process to interpret these photons is through the SSC forward-shock model and then
predict the very-high-energy flux to be detected by GeV - TeV observatories.
