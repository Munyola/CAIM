We investigate the relation between disk mass and mass accretion rate to constrain the mechanism
of angular momentum transport in protoplanetary disks. Dust mass and mass accretion rate in Chamaeleon
I are correlated with a slope close to linear, similar to the one recently identified in Lupus. We
investigate the effect of stellar mass and find that the intrinsic scatter around the best-fit Mdust-Mstar
and Macc-Mstar relations is uncorrelated. Disks with a constant alpha viscosity can fit the observed
relations between dust mass, mass accretion rate, and stellar mass, but over-predict the strength
of the correlation between disk mass and mass accretion rate when using standard initial conditions.
We find two possible solutions. 1) The observed scatter in Mdust and Macc is not primoridal, but arises
from additional physical processes or uncertainties in estimating the disk gas mass. Most likely
grain growth and radial drift affect the observable dust mass, while variability on large time scales
affects the mass accretion rates. 2) The observed scatter is primordial, but disks have not evolved
substantially at the age of Lupus and Chamaeleon I due to a low viscosity or a large initial disk radius.
More accurate estimates of the disk mass and gas disk sizes in a large sample of protoplanetary disks,
either through direct observations of the gas or spatially resolved multi-wavelength observations
of the dust with ALMA, are needed to discriminate between both scenarios or to constrain alternative
angular momentum transport mechanisms such as MHD disk winds.
