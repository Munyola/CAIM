Spiral galaxies comprise three major structural components; thin discs, thick discs, and central
bulges. Relative dominance of these components is known to correlate with the total mass of the galaxy,
and produces a remarkable morphological variety of spiral galaxies. Although there are many formation
scenarios regarding individual components, no unified theory exists which explains this systematic
variation. The cold-flow hypothesis predicts that galaxies grow by accretion of cold gas from cosmic
webs (cold accretion) when their mass is below a certain threshold, whereas in the high-mass regime
the gas that entered the dark matter halo is first heated by shock waves to high temperatures and then
accretes to the forming galaxy as it cools emitting radiation (cooling flow). This hypothesis also
predicts that massive galaxies at high redshifts have a hybrid accretion structure in which filaments
of cold inflowing gas penetrate surrounding hot gas. In the case of Milky Way, the previous study
suggested that the cold accretion created its thick disc in early times and the cooling flow formed
the thin disc in later epochs. Here we report that extending this idea to galaxies with various masses
and associating the hybrid accretion with the formation of bulges reproduces the observed mass-dependent
structures of spiral galaxies: namely, more massive galaxies have lower thick disc mass fractions
and higher bulge mass fractions. The proposed scenario predicts that thick discs are older in age
and poorer in iron than thin discs, the trend observed in the Milky Way (MW) and other spiral galaxies.
