We present a realistic numerical model of sunspot and active region formation based on the emergence
of flux bundles generated in a solar convective dynamo. To this end we use the magnetic and velocity
fields in a horizontal layer near the top boundary of the solar convective dynamo simulation to drive
realistic radiative-magnetohydrodynamic simulations of the upper most layers of the convection
zone. The main results are: (1) The emerging flux bundles rise with the mean speed of convective upflows,
and fragment into small-scale magnetic elements that further rise to the photosphere, where bipolar
sunspot pairs are formed through the coalescence of the small-scale magnetic elements. (2) Filamentary
penumbral structures form when the sunspot is still growing through ongoing flux emergence. In
contrast to the classical Evershed effect, the inflow seems to prevail over the outflow in a large
part of the penumbra. (3) A well formed sunspot is a mostly monolithic magnetic structures that is
anchored in a persistent deep-seated downdraft lane. The flow field outside the spot shows a giant
vortex ring that comprises of an inflow below 15 Mm depth and an outflow above 15 Mm depth. (4) The sunspots
successfully reproduce the fundamental properties of the observed solar active regions, including
the more coherent leading spots with a stronger field strength, and the correct tilts of bipolar
sunspot pairs. These asymmetries can be linked to the intrinsic asymmetries in the magnetic and
flow fields adapted from the convective dynamo simulation.
