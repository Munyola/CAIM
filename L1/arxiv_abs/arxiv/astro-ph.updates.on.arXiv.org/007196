We have studied the distribution patterns of lateral density, arrival time and angular position
of Cherenkov photons generated in Extensive Air Showers (EASs) initiated by $\gamma$-ray, proton
and iron primaries incident with various energies and at various zenith angles. This study is the
extension of our earlier work \cite{Hazarika} to cover a wide energy range of ground based $\gamma$-ray
astronomy with a wide range of zenith angles ($\le 40^\circ$) of primary particles, as well as the
extension to study the angular distribution patterns of Cherenkov photons in EASs. This type of
study is important for distinguishing the $\gamma$-ray initiated showers from the hadronic showers
in the ground based $\gamma$-ray astronomy, where Atmospheric Cherenkov Technique (ACT) is being
used. Importantly, such study gives an insight on the nature of $\gamma$-ray and hadronic showers
in general. In this work, the CORSIKA 6.990 simulation code is used for generation of EASs. Similarly
to the case of Ref.\cite{Hazarika}, this study also revealed that, the lateral density and arrival
time distributions of Cherenkov photons vary almost in accordance with the functions: $\rho_{ch}(r)
= \rho_{0}\;e^{-\beta r}$ and $t_{ch}(r) = t_{0}e^{\Gamma/r^{\lambda}}$ respectively by taking
different values of the parameters of functions for the type, energy and zenith angle of the primary
particle. The distribution of Cherenkov photon's angular positions with respect to shower axis
shows distinctive features depending on the primary type, its energy and the zenith angle.
