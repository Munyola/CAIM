Early observations of Type Ia supernovae (SNe) provide a unique probe of their progenitor systems
and explosion physics. Here, we report the intermediate Palomar Transient Factory (iPTF) discovery
of an extraordinarily young SN Ia, iPTF 16abc. By fitting a power law to our early light curve, we infer
that first light for the SN, that is when appreciable heating from $^{56}$Ni decay has first diffused
to the photosphere, only occurred $0.15\pm_{0.07}^{0.15}$ d before our first detection. In the
$\sim$24 hr after discovery, iPTF 16abc rose by $\sim$2 mag, following a near-linear rise in flux
for $\gtrsim$3 d. Strong C II absorption is detected in the early spectra of iPTF 16abc, before disappearing
after $\sim$7 d. Unlike the extensively-observed Type Ia SN 2011fe, the $(B-V)_0$ colors of iPTF
16abc are blue and nearly constant in the days after explosion. We show that our early observations
of iPTF 16abc cannot be explained by either SN shock breakout and the associated, subsequent cooling,
or the SN ejecta colliding with a stellar companion. Instead, we argue that the early characteristics
of iPTF 16abc, including: (i) the rapid, near-linear rise, (ii) the non-evolving blue colors, and
(iii) the strong absorption from ionized carbon, are the result of either vigorous mixing of radioactive
$^{56}$Ni in the SN ejecta, or ejecta interaction with diffuse material, or a combination of the
two. In the next few years, dozens of very young normal SNe Ia will be discovered, and observations
similar to those presented here will constrain the white dwarf explosion mechanism.
