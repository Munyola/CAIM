A rigorous definition of the habitable zone and its dependence on planetary properties is part of
the search for habitable exoplanets. In this work, we use the general circulation model ExoCAM to
determine how the inner edge of the habitable zone of tidally locked planets orbiting M dwarf stars
depends on planetary radius, surface gravity, and surface pressure. We find that the inner edge
of the habitable zone for more massive planets occurs at higher stellar irradiation, as found in
previous one-dimensional simulations. We also determine the relative effects of varying planetary
radius and surface gravity. Increasing the planetary radius leads to a lower planetary albedo and
warmer climate, pushing the inner edge of the habitable zone to lower stellar irradiation. This
results from a change in circulation regime that leads to the disruption of the thick, reflective
cloud deck around the substellar point. Increasing gravity increases the outgoing longwave radiation,
which moves the inner edge of the habitable zone to higher stellar irradiation. This is because the
column mass of water vapor decreases with increasing gravity, leading to a reduction in the greenhouse
effect. The effect of gravity on the outgoing longwave radiation is stronger than the effect of radius
on the planetary albedo, so that increasing gravity and radius together causes the inner edge of
the habitable zone to move to higher stellar irradiation. Our results show that the inner edge of
the habitable zone for more massive terrestrial planets occurs at a larger stellar irradiation.
