We present the results of a direct-imaging survey for very large separation ($>$100 au), companions
around 95 nearby young K5-L5 stars and brown dwarfs. They are high-likelihood candidates or confirmed
members of the young ($\lessapprox$150 Myr) $\beta$ Pictoris and AB Doradus moving groups (ABDMG)
and the TW Hya, Tucana-Horologium, Columba, Carina, and Argus associations. Images in $i'$ and
$z'$ filters were obtained with the Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph (GMOS) on Gemini South to
search for companions down to an apparent magnitude of $z'\sim$22-24 at separations $\gtrapprox$20"
from the targets and in the remainder of the wide 5.5' $\times$ 5.5' GMOS field of view. This allowed
us to probe the most distant region where planetary-mass companions could be gravitationally bound
to the targets. This region was left largely unstudied by past high-contrast imaging surveys, which
probed much closer-in separations. This survey led to the discovery of a planetary-mass (9-13 $\,M_{\rm{Jup}}$)
companion at 2000 au from the M3V star GU Psc, a highly probable member of ABDMG. No other substellar
companions were identified. These results allowed us to constrain the frequency of distant planetary-mass
companions (5-13 $\,M_{\rm{Jup}}$) to 0.84$_{-0.66}^{+6.73}$% (95% confidence) at semimajor
axes between 500 and 5000 au around young K5-L5 stars and brown dwarfs. This is consistent with other
studies suggesting that gravitationally bound planetary-mass companions at wide separations
from low-mass stars are relatively rare.
