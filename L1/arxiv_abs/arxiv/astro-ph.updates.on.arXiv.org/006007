We present an abundance analysis of the low-metallicity benchmark red giant star HD 122563 based
on realistic, state-of-the-art, high-resolution, three-dimensional (3D) model stellar atmospheres
including non-grey radiative transfer through opacity binning with four, twelve, and 48 bins.
The 48-bin 3D simulation reaches temperatures lower by ~ 300 - 500 K than the corresponding 1D model
in the upper atmosphere. Small variations in the opacity binning, adopted line opacities, or chemical
mixture can cool the photospheric layers by a further ~ 100 - 300 K and alter the effective temperature
by ~ 100 K. A 3D local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) spectroscopic analysis of Fe I and Fe II lines
gives discrepant results in terms of derived Fe abundance, which we ascribe to non-LTE effects and
systematic errors on the stellar parameters. We also determine C, N, and O abundances by simultaneously
fitting CH, OH, NH, and CN molecular bands and lines in the ultraviolet, visible, and infrared. We
find a small positive 3D-1D abundance correction for carbon (+0.03 dex) and negative ones for nitrogen
(-0.07 dex) and oxygen (-0.34 dex). From the analysis of the [O I] line at 6300.3 {\AA}, we derive a
significantly higher oxygen abundance than from molecular lines (+0.46 dex in 3D and +0.15 dex in
1D). We rule out important OH photodissociation effects as possible explanation for the discrepancy
and note that lowering the surface gravity would reduce the oxygen abundance difference between
molecular and atomic indicators.
