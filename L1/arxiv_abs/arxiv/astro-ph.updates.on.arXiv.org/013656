The angular momentum of a molecular cloud core plays a key role in star formation, since it is directly
related to the outflow and the jet emanating from the new-born star and it eventually results in the
formation of the protoplanetary disk. However, the origin of the core rotation and its time evolution
are not well understood. Recent observations reveal that molecular clouds exhibit a ubiquity of
filamentary structures and that star forming cores are associated with the densest filaments.
Since these results suggest that dense cores form primarily in filaments, the mechanism of core
formation from filament fragmentation should explain the distribution of the angular momentum
of these cores. In this paper we analyze the relation between velocity fluctuations along the filament
close to equilibrium and the angular momentum of the cores formed along its crest. We first find that
an isotropic velocity fluctuation that follows the three-dimensional Kolmogorov spectrum does
not reproduce the observed angular momentum of molecular cloud cores. We then identify the need
for a large power at small scales and study the effect of three power spectrum models. We show that
the one-dimensional Kolmogorov power spectrum with a slope -5/3 and an anisotropic model with reasonable
parameters are compatible with the observations. Our results stress the importance of more detailed
and systematic observations of both the velocity structure along filaments and the angular momentum
distribution of molecular cloud cores to determine the validity of the mechanism of core formation
from filamentary molecular clouds.
