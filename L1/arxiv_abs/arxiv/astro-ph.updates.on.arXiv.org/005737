Previous optical and radio observations of the binary millisecond pulsar PSR J1640+2224 have come
to inconsistent conclusions about the identity of its companion, with some observations suggesting
the companion is a low-mass helium-core (He-core) white dwarf (WD), while others indicate it is
most likely a high-mass carbon-oxygen (CO) WD. Binary evolution models predict PSR J1640+2224
most likely formed in a low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB) based on the pulsar's short spin period and long-period,
low-eccentricity orbit, in which case its companion should be a He-core WD with mass about $0.35
- 0.39 \, M_\odot$, depending on metallicity. If it is instead a CO WD, that would suggest the system
has an unusual formation history. In this paper we present the first astrometric parallax measurement
for this system from observations made with the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA), from which we determine
the distance to be $1520^{+170}_{-150}\,\mathrm{pc}$. We use this distance and a reanalysis of
archival optical observations originally taken in 1995 with the Wide Field Planetary Camera 2 (WFPC2)
on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) in order to measure the WD's mass. We also incorporate improvements
in calibration, extinction model, and WD cooling models. We find that the existing observations
are not sufficient to tightly constrain the companion mass, but we conclude the WD mass is $>0.4\,M_\odot$
with $>90\%$ confidence. The limiting factor in our analysis is the low signal-to-noise ratio of
the original HST observations.
