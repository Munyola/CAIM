We present a sub-kpc localization of the sites of supermassive black hole (SMBH) growth in three
active galactic nuclei (AGN) at $z \sim 3$ in relation to the regions of intense star formation in
their hosts. These AGNs are selected from Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) and Atacama Large
Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations in the HUDF and COSMOS, with the centimetric
radio emission tracing both star formation and AGN, and the sub/millimeter emission by dust tracing
nearly pure star formation. We require radio emission to be $\geqslant5\times$ more luminous than
the level associated with the sub/millimeter star formation to ensure that the radio emission is
AGN-dominated, thereby allowing localization of the AGN and star formation independently. In
all three galaxies, the AGN are located within the compact regions of gas-rich, heavily obscured,
intense nuclear star formation, with $R_e = 0.4-1.1$ kpc and average star formation rates of $\simeq100-1200$
$M_\odot$yr$^{-1}$. If the current episode of star formation continues at such a rate over the stellar
mass doubling time of their hosts, $\simeq 0.2$ Gyr, the newly formed stellar mass will be of the order
of $10^{11}$ $M_\odot$ within the central kpc region, concurrently and cospatially with significant
growth of the SMBH. This is consistent with a picture of in-situ galactic bulge and SMBH formation.
This work demonstrates the unique complementarity of VLA and ALMA observations to unambiguously
pinpoint the locations of AGN and star formation down to $\simeq30$ mas, corresponding to $\simeq
230$ pc at $z = 3$.
