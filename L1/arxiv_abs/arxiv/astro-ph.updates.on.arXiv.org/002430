We have developed an inversion method for determination of the characteristics of the acceleration
mechanism directly and non-parametrically from observations, in contrast to the usual forward
fitting of parametric model variables to observations. In two recent papers (Petrosian & Chen
2010, Chen & Petrosian 2013), we demonstrate the efficacy of this inversion method by its application
to acceleration of electrons in solar flares based on stochastic acceleration by turbulence. Here
we explore its application for determining the characteristics of shock acceleration in supernova
remnants (SNRs) based on the electron spectra deduced from the observed nonthermal radiation from
SNRs and the spectrum of the cosmic ray electrons observed near the Earth. These spectra are related
by the process of escape of the electrons from SNRs and energy loss during their transport in the galaxy.
Thus, these observations allow us to determine spectral characteristics of the momentum and pitch
angle diffusion coefficients, which play crucial roles in both direct acceleration by turbulence
and in high Mach number shocks. Assuming that the average electron spectrum deduced from a few well
known SNRs is representative of those in the solar neighborhood we find interesting discrepancies
between our deduced forms for these coefficients and those expected from well known wave-particle
interactions. This may indicate that the standard assumptions made in treatment of shock acceleration
need revision. In particular, the escape of particles from SNRs may be more complex than generally
assumed.
