In this paper, the detectability of habitable exomoons orbiting around giant planets in M-dwarf
systems using Transit Timing Variations (TTVs) and Transit Timing Durations (TDVs) with Kepler-class
photometry is investigated. Light curves of systems with various configurations were simulated
around M-dwarf hosts of mass 0.5 Msun and radius 0.55 Rsun. Jupiter-like giant planets which offer
the best potential for hosting habitable exomoons were considered with rocky super-Earth-mass
moons. The detectability is measured by using the phase-correlation between TTV and TDV signals.
Since the TDV signal is typically weaker than the TTV signal, confirmation of an exomoon detection
will depend on being able to detect a TDV signal. We find that exomoons around planets orbiting within
the habitable zone of an M-dwarf host star can produce both detectable TTV and TDV signatures with
Kepler-class photometry. While aliasing between the planet period and moon period may hinder exomoon
detection, we also find some strong correlation signatures in our simulation (eg. correlation:
>0.7) which would provide convincing exomoon signatures. With the addition of red noise stellar
variability, correlations generally weaken. However simulated examples with planet masses less
than around 25 Mearth, moons of mass 8-10 Mearth and specific values of planet and moon periods still
yield detectable correlation in 25-50% of cases. Our simulation indicates that Kepler provides
one of the best available opportunities for exomoon detection.
