We report on our discovery and observations of the Pan-STARRS1 supernova (SN) PS1-12sk, a transient
with properties that indicate atypical star formation in its host galaxy cluster or pose a challenge
to popular progenitor system models for this class of explosion. The optical spectra of PS1-12sk
classify it as a Type Ibn SN (c.f. SN 2006jc), dominated by intermediate-width (3x10^3 km/s) and
time variable He I emission. Our multi-wavelength monitoring establishes the rise time dt = 9-23
days and shows an NUV-NIR SED with temperature > 17x10^3 K and a peak rise magnitude of Mz = -18.9
mag. SN Ibn spectroscopic properties are commonly interpreted as the signature of a massive star
(17 - 100 M_sun) explosion within a He-enriched circumstellar medium. However, unlike previous
Type Ibn supernovae, PS1-12sk is associated with an elliptical brightest cluster galaxy, CGCG
208-042 (z = 0.054) in cluster RXC J0844.9+4258. The expected probability of an event like PS1-12sk
in such environments is low given the measured infrequency of core-collapse SNe in red sequence
galaxies compounded by the low volumetric rate of SN Ibn. Furthermore, we find no evidence of star
formation at the explosion site to sensitive limits (Sigma Halpha < 2x10^-3 M_sun/yr/kpc^2).
We therefore discuss white dwarf binary systems as a possible progenitor channel for SNe Ibn. We
conclude that PS1-12sk represents either a fortuitous and statistically unlikely discovery,
evidence for a top-heavy IMF in galaxy cluster cooling flow filaments, or the first clue suggesting
an alternate progenitor channel for Type Ibn SNe.
