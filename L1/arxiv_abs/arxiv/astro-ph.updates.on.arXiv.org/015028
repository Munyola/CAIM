The mechanism of mass loss in late evolutionary stages of low- and intermediate-mass stars is not
yet well understood. Therefore, it is crucial to study the dynamics of the region within a few stellar
radii, where the wind acceleration is considered to take place. We present three-dimensional diagnosis
of the atmospheric dynamics of the closest asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star R Dor from the low photospheric
layers to the extended outer atmosphere--for the first time for a star other than the Sun. The images
reconstructed with a spatial resolution of 6.8 mas--seven times finer than the star's angular diameter
of 51.2 mas in the continuum--using the AMBER instrument at the Very Large Telescope Interferometer
show a large, bright region over the surface of the star and an extended atmosphere. The velocity-field
maps over the star's surface and atmosphere obtained from the Mg and H2O lines near 2.3 micron forming
at atmospheric heights below ~1.5 stellar radii show little systematic motion beyond the measurement
uncertainty of 1.7 km/s. In marked contrast, the velocity-field map obtained from the CO first overtone
lines reveals systematic outward motion at 7--15 km/s in the extended outer atmosphere at a height
of ~1.8 stellar radii. Given the detection of dust formation at ~1.5 stellar radii, the strong acceleration
of material between ~1.5 and 1.8 stellar radii may be caused by the radiation pressure on dust grains.
However, we cannot yet exclude the possibility that the outward motion may be intermittent, caused
by ballistic motion due to convection and/or pulsation.
