A large-scale ordered magnetic field plays a very important role in the formation and acceleration
of a gamma-ray burst (GRB) jet. During the GRB prompt phase, some dissipation processes may happen
and disturb the magnetic field, making the field become random to some extent. Therefore, a mixed
magnetic field consisting of an ordered component and a random component is plausible for the early
afterglow phase. Here we investigate the polarization evolution and light curve of an afterglow
under such a 3-dimensional mixed magnetic field. Three kinds of ordered component (i.e., aligned,
toroidal and radial) are discussed. We find that the three cases are distinguishable through jet
polarization evolution. The polarization angle for a 3D mixed magnetic field with an aligned ordered
component can evolve gradually but only changes abruptly by $90^\circ$ in the toroidal and radial
cases. Furthermore, during the reverse shock crossing time, the polarization degree (PD) can be
non-zero for the toroidal case but roughly zero for the radial case. Since an aligned component in
a jet corresponds to a magnetar central engine and a toroidal component corresponds to a black hole,
GRB central engines are distinguishable through polarization observations even if the magnetic
field is mixed in a jet. In addition, our polarization calculation can be applied to GRB 170817A associated
with GW170817. Using the recently-observed PD upper limit $12\%$ of GRB 170817A at $t=244$ days,
the magnetic field strength ratio of the ordered to random components in this afterglow is constrained
to be $\lesssim0.9$.
