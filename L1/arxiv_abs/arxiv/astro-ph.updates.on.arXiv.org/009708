The galaxies found in optical surveys fall in two distinct regions of a diagram of optical colour
versus absolute magnitude: the red sequence and the blue cloud with the green valley in between.
We show that the galaxies found in a submillimetre survey have almost the opposite distribution
in this diagram, forming a `green mountain'. We show that these distinctive distributions follow
naturally from a single, continuous, curved Galaxy Sequence in a diagram of specific star-formation
rate versus stellar mass without there being the need for a separate star-forming galaxy Main Sequence
and region of passive galaxies. The cause of the red sequence and the blue cloud is the geometric mapping
between stellar mass/specific star-formation rate and absolute magnitude/colour, which distorts
a continuous Galaxy Sequence in the diagram of intrinsic properties into a bimodal distribution
in the diagram of observed properties. The cause of the green mountain is Malmquist bias in the submillimetre
waveband, with submillimetre surveys tending to select galaxies on the curve of the Galaxy Sequence,
which have the highest ratios of submillimetre-to-optical luminosity. This effect, working in
reverse, causes galaxies on the curve of the Galaxy Sequence to be underrepresented in optical samples,
deepening the green valley. The green valley is therefore not evidence (1) for there being two distinct
populations of galaxies, (2) for galaxies in this region evolving more quickly than galaxies in
the blue cloud and the red sequence, (c) for rapid quenching processes in the galaxy population.
