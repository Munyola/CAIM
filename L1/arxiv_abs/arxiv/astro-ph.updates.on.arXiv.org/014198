We present the first systematic study on how distant weak interactions impact the dynamical evolution
of merging binary black holes (BBHs) in dense stellar clusters. Recent studies indicate that dense
clusters are likely to significantly contribute to the rate of merging BBHs observable through
gravitational waves (GWs), and that many of these mergers will appear with notable eccentricities
measurable in the LISA and LIGO sensitivity bands. This is highly interesting, as eccentricity
can be used to distinguish between different astrophysical merger channels. However, all of these
recent studies are based on various Monte Carlo (MC) techniques that only include strong interactions
for the dynamical evolution of BBHs, whereas any binary generally undergoes orders-of-magnitude
more weak interactions than strong. It is well known that weak interactions primarily lead to a change
in the binary's eccentricity, which for BBHs implies that weak interactions can change their GW
inspiral time and thereby their merger probability. With this motivation, we perform MC simulations
of BBHs evolving in dense clusters under the influence of both weak and strong interactions. We find
that including weak interactions leads to a notable increase in the number of BBHs that merge inside
their cluster, which correspondingly leads to a higher number of eccentric LISA sources. These
preliminary results illustrate the importance of including weak interactions for accurately
modeling how BBHs merge in clusters, and how to link their emitted GW signals to their astrophysical
environment.
