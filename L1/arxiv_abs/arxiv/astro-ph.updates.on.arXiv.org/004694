To investigate the inner regions of protoplanetary disks, we performed near-infrared interferometric
observations of the classical TTauri binary system S CrA. We present the first VLTI-GRAVITY high
spectral resolution ($R\sim$4000) observations of a classical TTauri binary, S CrA (composed
of S CrA N and S CrA S and separated by $\sim$1.4"), combining the four 8-m telescopes in dual-field
mode. Our observations in the near-infrared K-band continuum reveal a disk around each binary component,
with similar half-flux radii of about 0.1 au at d$\sim$130 pc, inclinations ($i=$28$\pm$3$^o$\
and $i=$22$\pm$6$^o$), and position angles (PA=0$^o\pm$6$^o$ and PA=-2$^o\pm$12$^o$), suggesting
that they formed from the fragmentation of a common disk. The S CrA N spectrum shows bright HeI and
Br$\gamma$ line emission exhibiting inverse P-Cygni profiles, typically associated with infalling
gas. The continuum-compensated Br$\gamma$ line visibilities of S CrA N show the presence of a compact
Br$\gamma$ emitting region the radius of which is about $\sim$0.06 au, which is twice as big as the
truncation radius. This component is mostly tracing a wind. Moreover, a slight radius change between
the blue- and red-shifted Br$\gamma$ line components is marginally detected. The presence of an
inverse P-Cygni profile in the HeI and Br$\gamma$ lines, along with the tentative detection of a
slightly larger size of the blue-shifted Br$\gamma$ line component, hint at the simultaneous presence
of a wind and magnetospheric accretion in S CrA N.
