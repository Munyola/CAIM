Fossil galaxy groups are speculated to be old and highly evolved systems of galaxies that formed
early in the universe and had enough time to deplete their $L^{*}$ galaxies through successive mergers
of member galaxies, building up one massive central elliptical, but retaining the group X-ray halo.
Considering that fossils are the remnants of mergers in ordinary groups, the merger history of the
progenitor group is expected to be imprinted in the fossil central galaxy (FCG). We present for the
first time radial gradients of single-stellar population (SSP) ages and metallicites in a sample
of FCGs to constrain their formation scenario. Our sample comprises some of the most massive galaxies
in the universe exhibiting an average central velocity dispersion of $\sigma_0=271\pm28$ km s$^{-1}$.
Metallicity gradients are throughout negative with comparatively flat slopes of $\nabla_{[\rm{Fe/H}]}=-
0.19\pm0.08$ while age gradients are found to be insignificant ($\nabla_{\rm{age}}=0.00\pm0.05$).
All FCGs lie on the fundamental plane, suggesting that they are virialised systems. We find that
gradient strengths and central metallicities are similar to those found in cluster ellipticals
of similar mass. The comparatively flat metallicity gradients with respect to those predicted
by monolithic collapse ($\nabla_{Z}=-0.5$) suggest that fossils are indeed the result of multiple
major mergers. Hence we conclude that fossils are not 'failed groups' that formed with a top heavy
luminosity function. The low scatter of gradient slopes suggests a similar merging history for
all galaxies in our sample.
