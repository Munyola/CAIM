Context. The variations of solar activity over long time intervals using a solar activity reconstruction
based on the cosmogenic radionuclide 10Be measured in polar ice cores are studied. Methods. By applying
methods of nonlinear dynamics, the solar activity cycle is studied using solar activity proxies
that have been reaching into the past for over 9300 years. The complexity of the system is expressed
by several parameters of nonlinear dynamics, such as embedding dimension or false nearest neighbors,
and the method of delay coordinates is applied to the time series. We also fit a damped random walk
model, which accurately describes the variability of quasars, to the solar 10Be data and investigate
the corresponding power spectral distribution. The periods in the data series were searched by
the Fourier and wavelet analyses. The solar activity on the long-term scale is found to be on the edge
of chaotic behavior. This can explain the observed intermittent period of longer lasting solar
activity minima. Filtering the data by eliminating variations below a certain period (the periods
of 380 yr and 57 yr were used) yields a far more regular behavior of solar activity. A comparison between
the results for the 10Be data with the 14C data shows many similarities. Both cosmogenic isotopes
are strongly correlated mutually and with solar activity. Finally, we find that a series of damped
random walk models provides a good fit to the 10Be data with a fixed characteristic time scale of 1000
years, which is roughly consistent with the quasi-periods found by the Fourier and wavelet analyses.
