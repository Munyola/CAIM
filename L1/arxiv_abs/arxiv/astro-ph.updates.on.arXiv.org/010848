We analyze the X-ray spectra of the $\sim$8000 sources detected in the Cygnus OB2 Chandra Legacy
Survey (Drake et al., this issue), with the goals of characterizing the coronal plasma of the young
low-mass stars in the region and estimating their intrinsic X-ray luminosities. We adopt two different
strategies for X-ray sources for which more or less than 20 photons were detected. For the brighter
sample we fit the spectra with absorbed isothermal models. In order to limit uncertainties, for
most of the fainter Cygnus OB2 members in this sample, we constrain the spectral parameters to characteristic
ranges defined from the brightest stars. For X-ray sources with $<$20 net photons we adopt a conversion
factor from detected photon flux to intrinsic flux. This was defined, building on the results for
the previous sample, as a function of the 20% quantile of the detected photon energy distributions,
which we prove to also correlate well with extinction. We then use the X-ray extinction from the spectral
fits to constrain the ratio between optical and X-ray extinction toward Cygnus OB2, finding it consistent
with standard "Galactic"' values, when properly accounting for systematics. Finally we exploit
the large number of sources to constrain the average coronal abundances of several elements, through
two different ensemble analyses of the X-ray spectra of low-mass Cygnus OB2 members. We find the
pattern of abundances to be largely consistent with that derived for the young stellar coronae in
the Orion Nebula Cluster.
