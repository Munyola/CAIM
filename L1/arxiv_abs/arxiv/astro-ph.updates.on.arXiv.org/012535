3D data compression techniques can be used to determine the natural basis of radial eigenmodes that
encode the maximum amount of information in a tomographic large-scale structure survey. We explore
the potential of the Karhunen-Lo\`eve decomposition in reducing the dimensionality of the data
vector for cosmic shear measurements, and apply it to the final data from the CFHTLenS survey. We
find that practically all of the cosmological information can be encoded in one single radial eigenmode,
from which we are able to reproduce compatible constraints with those found in the fiducial tomographic
analysis with a factor of ~30 fewer datapoints. This simplifies the problem of computing the two-point
function covariance matrix from mock catalogues by the same factor, or by a factor of ~800 for an analytical
covariance. The resulting set of radial eigenfunctions is close to ell-independent, which gives
it a simple interpretation in terms of redshift-dependent galaxy weights. This simplifies the
application of the Karhunen-Lo\`eve decomposition to real-space and Fourier-space data, and
allows one to explore the effective radial window function of the principal eigenmodes as well as
the associated shear maps in order to identify potential systematics. We also apply the method to
extended parameter spaces and verify that additional information may be gained by including a second
mode to break parameter degeneracies. The data and analysis code are publicly available at https://github.com/emiliobellini/kl_sample.
