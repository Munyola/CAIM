The recent detection of the binary-neutron-star merger associated with GW170817 by both LIGO-
Virgo and the network of electromagnetic-spectrum observing facilities around the world has made
the multi-messenger detection of gravitational-wave events a reality. These joint detections
allow us to probe gravitational-wave sources in greater detail and provide us with the possibility
of confidently establishing events that would not have been detected in gravitational-wave data
alone. In this paper, we explore the prospects of using the electromagnetic follow-up of low-significance
gravitational-wave transient event candidates to increase the sample of confident detections
with electromagnetic counterparts. We find that the gravitational-wave alert threshold change
that would roughly double the number of detectable astrophysical events would increase the false-alarm
rate by 5 orders of magnitude from 1 per 100 years to 1000 per year. We quantify the expected purity
of low-significance candidate alerts issued by LIGO-Virgo as a function of the alert threshold.
Our analysis suggests that increasing the number of gravitational-wave detections via the electromagnetic
follow-up observations of low- significance LIGO-Virgo events will incur significant human and
opportunity costs in all-sky surveys, galaxy-targeted imaging, and large-aperture spectroscopy
in the near future. Nevertheless, increases in the rate of detected gravitational-wave events
may partially mitigate these costs as the Advanced LIGO-Virgo network reaches its design sensitivity.
