One of the major uncertainties in the dense matter equation of state has been the nuclear symmetry
energy. The density dependence of the symmetry energy is important in nuclear astrophysics, as
it controls the neutronization of matter in core-collapse supernovae, the radii of neutron stars
and the thicknesses of their crusts, the rate of cooling of neutron stars, and the properties of nuclei
involved in r-process nucleosynthesis. We show that fits of nuclear masses to experimental masses,
combined with other experimental information from neutron skins, heavy ion collisions, giant
dipole resonances and dipole polarizabilities, lead to stringent constraints on parameters that
describe the symmetry energy near the nuclear saturation density. These constraints are remarkably
consistent with inferences from theoretical calculations of pure neutron matter, and, furthermore,
with astrophysical observations of neutron stars. The concordance of experimental, theoretical
and observational analyses suggests that the symmetry parameters S_v and L are in the range 29.0
- 32.7 MeV and 40.5 - 61.9 MeV, respectively, and that the neutron star radius, for a 1.4 M_sun star,
is in the narrow window 10.7 km < R < 13.1 km (90% confidence). We can also set tight limits to
the size of neutron star crusts and the fractional moment of inertia they contain, as well as the overall
moment of inertia and quadrupole polarizability of 1.4 M_sun stars. Our results also have implications
for the disk mass and ejected mass of compact mergers involving neutron stars.
