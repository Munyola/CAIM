We perform two- (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) hydrodynamics simulations of convective oxygen
shell-burning that takes place deep inside a massive progenitor star of a core-collapse supernova.
Using one dimensional (1D) stellar evolution code, we first calculate the evolution of massive
stars with an initial mass of 9-40 $M_\odot$. Four different overshoot parameters are applied,
and CO core mass trend similar to previous works is obtained in the 1D models. Selecting eleven 1D
models that have a silicon and oxygen coexisting layer, we perform 2D hydrodynamics simulations
of the evolution $\sim$100 s until the onset of core-collapse. We find that convection with large-scale
eddies and the turbulent Mach number $\sim$0.1 is obtained in the models having a Si/O layer with
a scale of 10$^8$ cm, whereas most models that have an extended O/Si layer up to a few $\times 10^9$
cm exhibit lower turbulent velocity. Our results indicate that the supernova progenitors that
possess a thick Si/O layer could provide a preferable condition for perturbation-aided explosions.
We perform 3D simulation of a 25 $M_\odot$ model, which exhibits large-scale convection in the 2D
models. The 3D model develops large ($\ell = 2$) convection similar to the 2D model, however, the
turbulent velocity is lower. By estimating the neutrino emission properties of the 3D model, we
point out that a time modulation of the event rates, if observed in KamLAND and Hyper-Kamiokande,
would provide an important information about structural changes in the presupernova convective
layer.
