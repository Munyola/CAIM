Several tens of massive binary systems display indirect, or even strong evidence for non-thermal
radio emission, hence their particle accelerator status. These objects are referred to as particle-accelerating
colliding-wind binaries (PACWBs). WR 133 is one of the shortest period Wolf-Rayet + O systems in
this category, and is therefore critical to characterize the boundaries of the parameter space
adequate for particle acceleration in massive binaries. Our methodology consists in analyzing
JVLA observations of WR 133 at different epochs to search for compelling evidence for a phase-locked
variation attributable to synchrotron emission produced in the colliding-wind region. New data
obtained during two orbits reveal a steady and thermal emission spectrum, in apparent contradiction
with the previous detection of non-thermal emission. The thermal nature of the radio spectrum along
the 112.4-d orbit is supported by the strong free-free absorption by the dense stellar winds, and
shows that the simple binary scenario cannot explain the non-thermal emission reported previously.
Alternatively, a triple system scenario with a wide, outer orbit would fit with the observational
facts reported previously and in this paper, albeit no hint for the existence of a third component
exists to date. The epoch-dependent nature of the identification of synchrotron radio emission
in WR 133 emphasizes the issue of observational biases in the identification of PACWBs, that undoubtedly
affect the present census of PACWB among colliding-wind binaries.
