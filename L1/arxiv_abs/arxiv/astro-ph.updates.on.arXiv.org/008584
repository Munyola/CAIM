The calibration hardware system of the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) is designed to measure
two quantities: a telescope's instrumental response and atmospheric transmission, both as a function
of wavelength. First of all, a "collimated beam projector" is designed to measure the instrumental
response function by projecting monochromatic light through a mask and a collimating optic onto
the telescope. During the measurement, the light level is monitored with a NIST-traceable photodiode.
This method does not suffer from stray light effects or the reflections (known as ghosting) present
when using a flat-field screen illumination, which has a systematic source of uncertainty from
uncontrolled reflections. It allows for an independent measurement of the throughput of the telescope's
optical train as well as each filter's transmission as a function of position on the primary mirror.
Second, CALSPEC stars can be used as calibrated light sources to illuminate the atmosphere and measure
its transmission. To measure the atmosphere's transfer function, we use the telescope's imager
with a Ronchi grating in place of a filter to configure it as a low resolution slitless spectrograph.
In this paper, we describe this calibration strategy, focusing on results from a prototype system
at the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory (CTIO) 0.9 meter telescope. We compare the instrumental
throughput measurements to nominal values measured using a laboratory spectrophotometer, and
we describe measurements of the atmosphere made via CALSPEC standard stars during the same run.
