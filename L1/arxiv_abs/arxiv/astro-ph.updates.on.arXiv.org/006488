We present near-infrared observations of 35 of the most massive early-type galaxies in the local
universe. The observations were made using the infrared channel of the Hubble Space Telescope Wide
Field Camera 3 in the F110W (1.1 $\mu$m) filter. We measured surface brightness profiles and elliptical
isophotal fit parameters from the nuclear regions out to a radius of ~10 kpc in most cases. We find
that 37% (13) of the galaxies in our sample have isophotal position angle rotations greater than
20 degrees over the radial range imaged by WFC3/IR, which is often due to the presence of neighbors
or multiple nuclei. Most galaxies in our sample are significantly rounder near the center than in
the outer regions. This sample contains six fast rotators and 28 slow rotators. We find that all fast
rotators are either disky or show no measurable deviation from purely elliptical isophotes. Among
slow rotators, significantly disky and boxy galaxies occur with nearly equal frequency. The galaxies
in our sample often exhibit changing isophotal shapes, sometimes showing both significantly disky
and boxy isophotes at different radii. The fact that parameters vary widely between galaxies and
within individual galaxies is evidence that these massive galaxies have complicated formation
histories, and some of them have experienced recent mergers and have not fully relaxed. These data
demonstrate the value of high spatial resolution IR imaging of galaxies and provide measurements
necessary for determining stellar masses, dynamics, and black hole masses in high mass galaxies.
