The Kepler, K2, and Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) missions have provided a wealth
of confirmed exoplanets, benefiting from a huge effort from the planet-hunting and follow-up community.
With careful systematics mitigation, these missions provide precise photometric time series,
which enable detection of transiting exoplanet signals. However, exoplanet hunting can be confounded
by several factors, including instrumental noise, search biases, and host star variability. In
this Letter, we discuss strategies to overcome these challenges using newly emerging techniques
and tools. We demonstrate the power of new, fast open-source community tools (e.g., lightkurve,
starry, celerite, exoplanet), and discuss four high signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) exoplanets that
showcase specific challenges present in planet detection: K2-43c, K2-168c, K2-198c, and K2-198d.
These planets have been undetected in several large K2 planet searches, despite having transit
signals with S/N > 10. Two of the planets discussed here are new discoveries. In this work we confirm
all four as true planets. Alongside these planet systems, we discuss three key challenges in finding
small transiting exoplanets. The aim of this Letter is to help new researchers understand where
planet detection efficiency gains can be made, and to encourage the continued use of K2 archive data.
The considerations presented in this Letter are equally applicable to Kepler, K2, and TESS, and
the tools discussed here are available for the community to apply to improve exoplanet discovery
and fitting.
