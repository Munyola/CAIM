Since its launch in 1990, the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) has served as a platform with unique capabilities
for remote observations of comets in the far-ultraviolet region of the spectrum. Successive generations
of imagers and spectrographs have seen large advances in sensitivity and spectral resolution enabling
observations of the diverse properties of a representative number of comets during the past 25 years.
To date, four comets have been observed in the far-ultraviolet by the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph
(COS), the last spectrograph to be installed in HST, in 2009: 103P/Hartley 2, C/2009 P1 (Garradd),
C/2012 S1 (ISON), and C/2014 Q2 (Lovejoy). COS has unprecedented sensitivity, but limited spatial
information in its 2.5 arcsec diameter circular aperture, and our objective was to determine the
CO production rates from measurements of the CO Fourth Positive system in the spectral range of 1400
to 1700 A. In the two brightest comets, nineteen bands of this system were clearly identified. The
water production rates were derived from nearly concurrent observations of the OH (0,0) band at
3085 A by the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS). The derived CO/H2O production rate ratio
ranged from ~0.3% for Hartley 2 to ~22% for Garradd. In addition, strong partially resolved emission
features due to multiplets of S I, centered at 1429 A and 1479 A, and of C I at 1561 A and 1657 A, were observed
in all four comets. Weak emission from several lines of the H2 Lyman band system, excited by solar
Lyman-alpha and Lyman-beta pumped fluorescence, were detected in comet Lovejoy.
