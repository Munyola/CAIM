Studies on the massive star population in galaxies beyond the Local Group are the key to understand
the link between their numbers and modes of star formation in different environments. We present
the analysis of the massive star population of the galaxies NGC 1326A, NGC 1425 and NGC 4548 using
archival Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field Planetary Camera 2 images in the F555W and F814W filters.
Through high precision point spread function fitting photometry for all sources in the three fields
we identified 7640 candidate blue supergiants, 2314 candidate yellow supergiants, and 4270 candidate
red supergiants. We provide an estimation the ratio of blue to red supergiants for each field as a
function of galactocentric radius. Using Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA)
at solar metallicity, we defined the luminosity function and estimated the star formation history
of each galaxy. We carried out a variability search in the V and I filters using three variability
indexes: the median absolute deviation, the interquartile range, and the inverse von-Neumann
ratio. This analysis yielded 243 new variable candidates with absolute magnitudes ranging from
Mv= -4 to -10 mag. We classified the variable stars based on their absolute magnitude and their position
on the color-magnitude diagram using the MESA evolutionary tracks at solar metallicity. Our analysis
yielded 8 candidate variable blue supergiants, 12 candidate variable yellow supergiants, 21 candidate
variable red supergiants, and 4 candidate periodic variables.
