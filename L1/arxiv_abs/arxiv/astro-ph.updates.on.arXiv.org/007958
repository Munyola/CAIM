AIMS: We aim to evaluate the near-infrared colors of brown dwarfs as observed with four major infrared
imaging space observatories: the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), the James Webb Space Telescope
(JWST), the Euclid mission, and the WFIRST telescope. METHODS: We used the SPLAT SPEX/ISPEX spectroscopic
library to map out the colors of the M-, L-, and T-type dwarfs. We have identified which color-color
combination is optimal for identifying broad type and which single color is optimal to then identify
the subtype (e.g., T0-9). We evaluated each observatory separately as well as the narrow-field
(HST and JWST) and wide-field (Euclid and WFIRST) combinations. RESULTS: The Euclid filters perform
poorly typing brown dwarfs and WFIRST performs only marginally better, despite a wider selection
of filters. WFIRST's W146 and F062 combined with Euclid's Y-band discriminates somewhat better
between broad brown dwarf categories. However, subtyping with any combination of Euclid and WFIRST
observations remains uncertain due to the lack of medium or narrow-band filters. We argue that a
medium band added to the WFIRST filter selection would greatly improve its ability to preselect
brown dwarfs its imaging surveys. CONCLUSIONS: The HST filters used in high-redshift searches
are close to optimal to identify broad stellar type. However, the addition of F127M to the commonly
used broad filter sets would allow for unambiguous subtyping. An improvement over HST is one of two
broad and medium filter combinations on JWST: pairing F140M with either F150W or F162M discriminates
very well between subtypes.
