A precise extinction law is a critical input when interpreting observations of highly reddened
sources such as young star clusters and the Galactic Center (GC). We use Hubble Space Telescope observations
of a region of moderate extinction and a region of high extinction to measure the optical and near-infrared
extinction law (0.8 $\mu$m -- 2.2 $\mu$m). The moderate extinction region is the young massive cluster
Westerlund 1 (Wd1; A$_{Ks} \sim$ 0.6 mag), where 453 proper motion-selected main-sequence stars
are used to measure the shape of the extinction law. To quantify the shape we define the parameter
$\mathcal{S}_{1/\lambda}$, which behaves similarly to a color excess ratio but is continuous
as a function of wavelength. The high extinction region is the GC (A$_{Ks} \sim$ 2.5 mag), where 819
red clump stars are used to determine the normalization of the law. The best-fit extinction law is
able to reproduce the Wd1 main sequence colors, which previous laws misestimate by 10%-30%. The
law is inconsistent with a single power law, even when only the near-infrared filters are considered,
and has A$_{F125W}$/A$_{Ks}$ and A$_{F814W}$/A$_{Ks}$ values that are 18% and 24% larger than
the commonly used \citet{Nishiyama:2009fc} law, respectively. Using the law we recalculate the
Wd1 distance to be 3896 $\pm$ 328 pc from published observations of eclipsing binary W13. This new
extinction law should be used for highly reddened populations in the Milky Way, such as the Quintuplet
cluster and Young Nuclear Cluster. A python code is provided to generate the law for future use.
