We have observed three near-Earth objects(NEOs), 2017VR12, Camillo, and Midas during the year
2018. The observations were made by the 1-m telescope of Yunnan Observatory over 2 nights. Their
precise astrometric positions are derived from 989 CCD observations. The theoretical positions
of asteroids are retrieved from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) Horizons System and Institut
de M\'{e}canique C\'{e}leste et de Calcul des \'{E}ph\'{e}m\'{e}rides (IMCCE). The positions
of three asteroids are measured with respect to the stars in Gaia DR2 star catalogue. For 2017 VR12,
the mean (O-C) of right ascension and declination are -0.090$^{''}$ and -0.623$^{''}$ based on
the ephemeris of published JPL, but the mean (O-C) are 3.122$^{''}$ and -0.636$^{''}$ based on the
ephemeris of published IMCCE. The great difference in declination could be explained by several
factors. (1)The degenerated CCD images caused by the high apparent motion speed of the object leads
to the reduction of positioning accuracy. (2)The poor timing system may bring the system error,
especially in the high speed direction. (3)The asteroid may be perturbed by the earth when it approaches
the earth too closely. The astrometric results show that the centroid centring method can reduce
the dispersion of the non-Gaussian images compared with the PSF model method. For Camillo and Midas,
the astrometric results are consistent based on two ephemerides. High-precision timing system,
some astronomical effects and geometric distortion of CCD images should be carefully considered
in the future works.
