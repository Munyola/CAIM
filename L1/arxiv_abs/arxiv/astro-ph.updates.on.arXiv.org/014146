Recent advancements in the imaging of low-surface-brightness objects revealed numerous ultra-diffuse
galaxies in the local Universe. These peculiar objects are unusually extended and faint: their
effective radii are comparable to the Milky Way, but their surface brightnesses are lower than that
of dwarf galaxies. Their ambiguous properties motivate two potential formation scenarios: the
"failed" Milky Way and the dwarf galaxy scenario. In this paper, for the first time, we employ X-ray
observations to test these formation scenarios on a sample of isolated, low-surface-brightness
galaxies. Since hot gas X-ray luminosities correlate with the dark matter halo mass, "failed" Milky
Way-type galaxies, which reside in massive dark matter halos, are expected to have significantly
higher X-ray luminosities than dwarf galaxies, which reside in low-mass dark matter halos. We perform
X-ray photometry on a subset of low-surface-brightness galaxies identified in the Hyper Suprime-Cam
Subaru survey, utilizing the XMM-Newton XXL North survey. We find that none of the individual galaxies
show significant X-ray emission. By co-adding the signal of individual galaxies, the stacked galaxies
remain undetected and we set an X-ray luminosity upper limit of ${L_{\rm{0.3-1.2keV}}\leq6.2
\times 10^{37} (d/65 \rm{Mpc})^2 \ \rm{erg \ s^{-1}}}$ for an average isolated low-surface-brightness
galaxy. This upper limit is about 40 times lower than that expected in a galaxy with a massive dark
matter halo, implying that the majority of isolated low-surface-brightness galaxies reside in
dwarf-size dark matter halos.
