The slope of the star formation rate/stellar mass relation (the SFR ``Main Sequence"; SFR--Mstel)
is not quite unity: specific star formation rates (SFR/Mstel) are weakly-but-significantly anti-correlated
with Mstel. Here we demonstrate that this trend may simply reflect the well-known increase in bulge
mass-fractions -- portions of a galaxy not forming stars -- with Mstel. Using a large set of bulge/disk
decompositions and SFR estimates derived from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, we show that re-normalizing
SFR by disk stellar mass (sSFRd = SFR/Mdisk) reduces the Mstel-dependence of SF efficiency by ~0.25
dex per dex, erasing it entirely in some subsamples. Quantitatively, we find log(sSFRd)--log(Mstel)
to have a slope -0.20 < beta_disk < 0.00 +/- 0.02 (depending on SFR estimator and Main Sequence
definition) for star-forming galaxies with Mstel > 10^10 Msun and bulge mass-fractions B/T
< 0.7, generally consistent with a pure-disk control sample (beta_control = -0.05 +/- 0.04).
That <SFR/Mdisk> is (largely) independent of host mass for star-forming disks bears strongly
on scenarios of galaxy evolution derived from any SFR--Mstel relation, including: the principal
manifestation of ``mass quenching" (bulge growth); the constancy of the shape of the star-forming
stellar mass function (uniform dlog(Mstel)/dt, assuming disk-driven growth); and the degree
to which dispersion in SFR(Mstel,t) encodes diversity in star formation histories. Our results
emphasize the need to treat galaxies as composite systems -- not integrated masses -- in observational
and theoretical work.
