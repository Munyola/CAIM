Constraints on the properties of the cosmological dark matter have previously been obtained in
a model-independent fashion using the Generalised Dark Matter (GDM) framework. Here we extend
that work in several directions: We consider the inclusion of WiggleZ matter power spectrum data,
and show that this improves the constraints on the two perturbative GDM parameters, $c^2_s$ and
$c^2_\text{vis}$, by a factor of 3, for a conservative choice of wavenumber range. A less conservative
choice can yield an improvement of up to an order of magnitude compared to previous constraints.
In order to examine the robustness of this result we develop a GDM halo model to explore how non-linear
structure formation could proceed in this framework, since currently GDM has only been defined
perturbatively and only linear theory has been used when generating constraints. We then examine
how the halo model affects the constraints obtained from the matter power spectrum data. The less-conservative
wavenumber range shows a significant difference between linear and non-linear modelling, with
the latter favouring GDM parameters inconsistent with $\Lambda$CDM, underlining the importance
of careful non-linear modelling when using this data. We also use this halo model to establish the
robustness of previously obtained constraints, particularly those that involve weak gravitational
lensing of the cosmic microwave background. Additionally, we show how the inclusion of neutrino
mass as a free parameter affects previous constraints on the GDM parameters.
