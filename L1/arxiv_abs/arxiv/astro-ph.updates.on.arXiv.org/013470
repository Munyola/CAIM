We chart a path toward solving for the nonlinear gravitational dynamics of cold dark matter by relying
on a semiclassical description using the propagator. The evolution of the propagator is given by
a Schr\"odinger equation, where the small parameter $\hbar$ acts as a softening scale that regulates
singularities at shell-crossing. The leading-order propagator, called free propagator, is the
semiclassical equivalent of the Zel'dovich approximation (ZA), that describes inertial particle
motion along straight trajectories. At next-to-leading order, we solve for the propagator perturbatively
and obtain, in the classical limit the displacement field from second-order Lagrangian perturbation
theory (LPT). The associated velocity naturally includes an additional term that would be considered
as third order in LPT. We show that this term is actually needed to preserve the underlying Hamiltonian
structure, and ignoring it could lead to the spurious excitation of vorticity in certain implementations
of second-order LPT. We show that for sufficiently small $\hbar$ the corresponding propagator
solutions closely resemble LPT, with the additions that spurious vorticity is avoided and the dynamics
at shell-crossing is regularised. Our analytical results possess a symplectic structure that
allows us to advance numerical schemes for the large-scale structure. For times shortly after shell-crossing,
we explore the generation of vorticity, which in our method does not involve any explicit multi-stream
averaging, but instead arises naturally as a conserved topological charge.
