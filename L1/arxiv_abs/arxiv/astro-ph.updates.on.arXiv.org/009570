The "gravitational million-body problem," to model the dynamical evolution of a self-gravitating,
collisional N-body system with N ~10^6 over many relaxation times, remains a major challenge in
computational astrophysics. Unfortunately, current techniques to model such a system suffer
from severe limitations. A direct N-body simulation with more than 10^5 particles can require months
or even years to complete, while an orbit-sampling Monte Carlo approach cannot adequately treat
the details of the core dynamics, particularly in the presence of many black holes. We have developed
a new technique combining the precision of direct N-body codes with the speed of a Monte Carlo approach.
Our Rapid And Precisely Integrated Dynamics code, the RAPID code, statistically models interactions
between neighboring stars and stellar binaries while integrating directly the orbits of stars
in the cluster core. This allows us to accurately simulate the dynamics of the black holes in a realistic
globular cluster environment without the burdensome N^2 scaling of a full N-body integration.
We compare models of idealized globular clusters created by the RAPID approach to direct N-body
and Monte Carlo models. Our tests show that RAPID can reproduce the half-mass and core radii of the
direct N-body models far more accurately than the Monte Carlo approach and in ~1/200th of the computing
time. With this technique, it will be possible to create realistic models of Milky Way globular clusters
with sufficient rapidity to explore the full parameter space of dense stellar clusters.
