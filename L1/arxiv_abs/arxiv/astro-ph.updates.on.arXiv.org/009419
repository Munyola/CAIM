We report SDO/AIA observations of an extraordinary global extreme ultraviolet (EUV) wave triggered
by the X8.2 flare-CME eruption on 2017 September 10. This was one of the best EUV waves ever observed
with modern instruments, yet likely the last one of such magnitudes of Solar Cycle 24 as the Sun heads
toward the minimum. Its remarkable characteristics include: (1) The wave was observed, for the
first time, to traverse the full-Sun corona over the entire visible solar disk and off-limb circumference,
manifesting a truly global nature, owing to its exceptionally large amplitude, e.g., with EUV enhancements
by up to 300% at 1.1 Rsun from the eruption. (2) This leads to strong transmissions (besides commonly
observed reflections) in and out of both polar coronal holes, which are usually devoid of EUV waves.
It has elevated wave speeds >2000 km/s within them, consistent with the expected higher fast-mode
magnetosonic speeds. The coronal holes essentially serve as new "radiation centers" for the waves
being refracted out of them, which then travel toward the equator and collide head-on, causing additional
EUV enhancements. (3) The wave produces significant compressional heating to local plasma upon
its impact, indicated by long-lasting EUV intensity changes and differential emission measure
increases at higher temperatures (e.g., log T=6.2) accompanied by decreases at lower temperatures
(log T=6.0). These characteristics signify the potential of such EUV waves for novel magnetic and
thermal diagnostics of the solar corona {\it on global scales}.
