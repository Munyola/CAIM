We present the results of a semicoherent search for continuous gravitational waves from the low-mass
X-ray binary Scorpius X-1, using data from the first Advanced LIGO observing run. The search method
uses details of the modelled, parametrized continuous signal to combine coherently data separated
by less than a specified coherence time, which can be adjusted to trade off sensitivity against computational
cost. A search was conducted over the frequency range from 25 Hz to 2000 Hz, spanning the current observationally-constrained
range of the binary orbital parameters. No significant detection candidates were found, and frequency-dependent
upper limits were set using a combination of sensitivity estimates and simulated signal injections.
The most stringent upper limit was set at 175 Hz, with comparable limits set across the most sensitive
frequency range from 100 Hz to 200 Hz. At this frequency, the 95 pct upper limit on signal amplitude
h0 is 2.3e-25 marginalized over the unknown inclination angle of the neutron star's spin, and 8.03e-26
assuming the best orientation (which results in circularly polarized gravitational waves). These
limits are a factor of 3-4 stronger than those set by other analyses of the same data, and a factor of
about 7 stronger than the best upper limits set using initial LIGO data. In the vicinity of 100 Hz,
the limits are a factor of between 1.2 and 3.5 above the predictions of the torque balance model, depending
on inclination angle, if the most likely inclination angle of 44 degrees is assumed, they are within
a factor of 1.7.
