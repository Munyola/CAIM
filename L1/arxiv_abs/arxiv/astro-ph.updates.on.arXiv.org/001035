We use pair and environmental classifications of ~ 211,000 star-forming galaxies from the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey, along with a suite of merger simulations, to investigate the enhancement of
star formation as a function of separation in galaxy pairs. Using a new technique for distinguishing
between the influence of nearby neighbours and larger scale environment, we find a clear enhancement
in star formation out to projected separations of ~ 150 kpc, beyond which there is no net enhancement.
We find the strongest enhancements at the smallest separations (especially < 20 kpc), consistent
with earlier work. Similar trends are seen in the simulations, which indicate that the strongest
enhancements are produced in highly disturbed systems approaching final coalescence, whereas
the more modest enhancements seen at wider separations are the result of starburst activity triggered
at first pericentre passage, which persists as the galaxies move to larger separations. The absence
of any net enhancement beyond 150 kpc provides reassurance that the detected enhancements are due
to galaxy-galaxy interactions, rather than larger scale environmental effects or potential pair
selection biases. A rough census indicates that 66 per cent of the enhanced star formation in our
pair sample occurs at separations > 30 kpc. We conclude that significant interaction-induced
star formation is not restricted to merger remnants or galaxies with close companions; instead,
a larger population of wider separation pairs exhibit enhanced star formation due to recent close
encounters.
