There has been speculation of a class of relativistic explosions with an initial Lorentz factor
smaller than that of classical Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs). These "dirty fireballs" would lack prompt
GRB emission but could be pursued via their optical afterglow, appearing as transients that fade
overnight. Here we report a search for such transients (transients that fade by 5-$\sigma$ in magnitude
overnight) in four years of archival photometric data from the intermediate Palomar Transient
Factory (iPTF). Our search criteria yielded 45 candidates. Of these, two were afterglows to GRBs
that had been found in dedicated follow-up observations to triggers from the Fermi GRB Monitor (GBM).
Another (iPTF14yb; Cenko et al. 2015) was a GRB afterglow discovered serendipitously. Two were
spurious artifacts of reference image subtraction and one was an asteroid. The remaining 37 candidates
have red stellar counterparts in external catalogs. The photometric and spectroscopic properties
of the counterparts identify these transients as strong flares from M dwarfs of spectral type M3-M7
at distances of d ~ 0.15-2.1 kpc; two counterparts were already spectroscopically classified as
late-type M stars. With iPTF14yb as the only confirmed relativistic outflow discovered independently
of a high-energy trigger, we constrain the all-sky rate of transients that peak at m = 18 and fade by
$\Delta$2 mag in $\Delta$3 hr to be 680 per year with a 68% confidence interval of 119-2236 per year.
This implies that the rate of visible dirty fireballs is at most comparable to that of the known population
of long-duration GRBs.
