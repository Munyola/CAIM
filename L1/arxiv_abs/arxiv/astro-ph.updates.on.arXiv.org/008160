We present the study of SOL2015-03-15 M1.2 flare, revealing acceleration of electrons and plasma
heating in the sheared twisted magnetic structure in the polarity inversion line (PIL). The scope
is to make the analysis of nonthermal electrons dynamics and plasma heating in the highly stressed
magnetic loops interacting in the PIL by using X-ray, microwave, ultraviolet, and optical observations.
It is found that the most probable scenario for the energy release in the PIL is the tether-cutting
magnetic reconnection between the low-lying (3 Mm above the photosphere) magnetic loops within
a twisted magnetic flux rope. Energetic electrons with the hardest spectrum were appeared at the
onset of plasma heating up to the super-hot temperature of 40 MK. These electrons are localized in
a thin magnetic channel with width of around 0.5 Mm with high average magnetic field of about 1200
G. The plasma beta in the super-hot region is less than 0.01. The estimated density of accelerated
electrons is about 10^9 cm^-3 that is much less than the super-hot plasma density. The energy density
flux of non-thermal electrons is estimated up to 3x10^12 ergs cm^-2s^-1 that is much higher than
in the currently available radiative hydrodynamic models. These results revealed that one need
to develop new self-consisting flare models reproducing 3D magnetic reconnection in the PIL with
strong magnetic field, spatial filamentation of energy release, formation of high energy density
populations of nonthermal electrons and appearance of the super-hot plasma.
