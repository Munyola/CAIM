Radial velocity (RV) searches for exoplanets have surveyed many of the nearest and brightest stars
for long-term velocity variations indicative of a companion body. Such surveys often detect high-amplitude
velocity signatures of objects that lie outside the planetary mass regime, most commonly those
of a low-mass star. Such stellar companions are frequently discarded as false-alarms to the main
science goals of the survey, but high-resolution imaging techniques can be employed to either directly
detect or place significant constraints on the nature of the companion object. Here, we present
the discovery of a compact companion to the nearby star HD~118475. Our Anglo-Australian Telescope
(AAT) RV data allow the extraction of the full Keplerian orbit of the companion, found to have a minimum
mass of 0.445~$M_\odot$. Follow-up speckle imaging observations at the predicted time of maximum
angular separation rule out a main sequence star as the source of the RV signature at the 3.3$\sigma$
significance level, implying that the companion must be a low-luminosity compact object, most
likely a white dwarf. We provide an isochrone analysis combined with our data that constrain the
possible inclinations of the binary orbit. We discuss the eccentric orbit of the companion in the
context of tidal circularization timescales and show that non-circular orbit was likely inherited
from the progenitor. Finally, we emphasize the need for utilizing such an observation method to
further understand the demographics of white dwarf companions around nearby stars.
