The extragalactic background light (EBL) is the radiation accumulated through the history of the
Universe in the wavelength range from the ultraviolet to the far infrared. Local foregrounds make
the direct measurement of the diffuse EBL notoriously difficult, while robust lower limits have
been obtained by adding up the contributions of all the discrete sources resolved in deep infrared
and optical galaxy observations. Gamma-ray astronomy has emerged in the past few years as a powerful
tool for the study of the EBL: very-high-energy (VHE) photons traversing cosmological distances
can interact with EBL photons to produce e$^+$e$^-$ pairs, resulting in an energy-dependent depletion
of the gamma-ray flux of distant sources that can be used to set constraints on the EBL density. The
study of the EBL is one of the key scientific programs currently carried out by the MAGIC collaboration.
We present here the results of the analysis of 32 VHE spectra of 12 blazars in the redshift range 0.03
- 0.94, obtained with over 300 hours of observations with the MAGIC telescopes between 2010 and 2016.
A combined likelihood maximization approach is used to evaluate the density and spectrum of the
EBL most consistent with the MAGIC observations. The results are compatible with state-of-the-art
EBL models, and constrain the EBL density to be roughly within $\simeq 20\%$ of the nominal value
in such models. The study reveals no anomalies in gamma-ray propagation in the large optical depth
regime - contrary to some claims based on meta-analyses of published VHE spectra.
