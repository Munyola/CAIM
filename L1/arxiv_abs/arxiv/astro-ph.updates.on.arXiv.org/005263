The spatial distribution of satellite galaxies around pairs of galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky
Survey (SDSS) have been found to bulge significantly towards the respective partner. Highly anisotropic,
planar distributions of satellite galaxies are in conflict with expectations derived from cosmological
simulations. Does the lopsided distribution of satellite systems around host galaxy pairs constitute
a similar challenge to the standard model of cosmology? We investigate whether such satellite distributions
are present around stacked pairs of hosts extracted from the $\Lambda$CDM simulations Millennium-I,
Millennium-II, ELVIS, and Illustris-1. By utilizing this set of simulations covering different
volumes, resolutions, and physics, we implicitly test whether a lopsided signal exists for different
ranges of satellite galaxy masses, and whether the inclusion of hydrodynamical effects produces
significantly different results. All simulations display a lopsidedness similar to the observed
situation. The signal is highly significant for simulations containing a sufficient number of
hosts and resolved satellite galaxies (up to $5\,\sigma$ for Millennium-II). We find a projected
signal that is up to twice as strong as that reported for the SDSS systems for certain opening angles
($\sim16\%$ more satellites in the direction between the pair than expected for uniform distributions).
Considering that the SDSS signal is a lower limit owing to likely back- and foreground contamination,
the $\Lambda$CDM simulations appear to be consistent with this particular empirical property
of galaxy pairs.
