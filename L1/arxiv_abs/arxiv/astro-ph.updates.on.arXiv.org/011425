In our previous work, we propose a cross spectrum based method to extract single pulse signals from
RFI contaminated data, which is originated from geodetic VLBI postprocessing. This method fully
utilizes fringe phase information of the cross spectrum and hence maximizes signal power, however
the localization was not discussed in that work yet. As the continuation of that work, in this paper,
we further study how to localize single pulses using astrometric solving method. Assuming that
the burst is a point source, we derive the burst position by solving a set of linear equations given
the relation between residual delay and offset to a priori position. We find that the single pulse
localization results given by both astrometric solving and radio imaging are consistent within
3 $\sigma$ level. Therefore we claim that it is possible to derive the position of a single pulse with
reasonable precision based on only 3 or even 2 baselines with 4 milliseconds integration. The combination
of cross spectrum based detection and the localization proposed in this work then provide a thorough
solution for searching single pulse in VLBI observation. According to our calculation, our pipeline
gives comparable accuracy as radio imaging pipeline. Moreover, the computational cost of our pipeline
is much smaller, which makes it more practical for FRB search in regular VLBI observation. The pipeline
is now publicly available and we name it as "VOLKS", which is the acronym of "VLBI Observation for
frb Localization Keen Searcher".
