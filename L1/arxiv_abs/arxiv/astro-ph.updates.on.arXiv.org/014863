We show that individual (single-epoch) spectra of AGN can constrain some of the geometry and dynamics
of the AGN broad line region. Studies of the cosmic influence of supermassive black holes are limited
by the current large uncertainties in the determination of black hole masses. One dominant limitation
is the unknown geometry, dynamics and line-of-sight inclination of the broad line region, used
to probe the central black hole mass. Recent progress has been made to constrain the spatial and kinematic
structure of the broad line region using dynamical modelling of AGN monitoring data and an underlying
physical model for the broad line region. In this work we test the ability of a modified version of
this dynamical modelling code to constrain the broad line region structure using single-epoch
spectra. We test our modelling code on single-epoch spectra of nearby Arp 151 by comparing our results
with those obtained with monitoring data of this same object. We find that a significant fraction
of the broad line region parameters can indeed be adequately constrained, with uncertainties that
are comparable to, or at most a factor of ~ a few higher than those obtained from modelling of monitoring
data. Considering the wealth of available single-epoch spectroscopic observations, this method
is promising for establishing the overall AGN population trends in the geometry and dynamics of
the broad line region. This method can be applied to spectra of AGN at low and high redshift making
it valuable for studies of cosmological black hole and AGN evolution.
