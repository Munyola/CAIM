A spectroscopic study was carried out on the surface chemical abundances of CNO and several heavier
elements in the primary and secondary components of 5 eclipsing close binaries around A-type (AR
Aur, beta Aur, YZ Cas, WW Aur, and RR Lyn), in order to investigate the nature of chemical differences
between both components (being comparatively slow rotators alike due to tidal synchronization).
Regarding the systems comprising similar components, beta Aur and WW Aur were confirmed to exhibit
no compositional difference between the primary and secondary both showing almost the same Am anomaly,
though the chemical peculiarities seen in the component stars of AR Aur show distinct differences
(HgMn star and Am star). In contrast, as to the systems (YZ Cas and RR Lyn) consisting of considerably
different (A and early-F) components, the surface abundances are markedly different between the
primary (Am) and secondary (normal). These observational results may indicate Teff-dependent
characteristics regarding the chemical anomalies of non-magnetic stars on the upper main sequence:
(1) In the effective temperature range of 10000K > Teff > 7000K, rotational velocity is the most important
factor for determining the extent of Am peculiarity. (2) However, the emergence of Am phenomenon
seems to have a lower Teff limit at ~7000K, below which no abundance anomaly is observed regardless
of stellar rotation. (3) The transition from Am anomaly (mild deficiency in CNO) to HgMn anomaly
(unusually large N depletion) is likely to take place as Teff increases from ~10000K to ~11000K.
