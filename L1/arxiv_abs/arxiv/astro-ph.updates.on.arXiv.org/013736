Spectroscopic and structural properties of methoxymethyl radical (CH$_3$OCH$_2$, RDME) are
determined using explicitly correlated ab initio methods. This radical of astrophysical and atmospheric
relevance has not been fully characterized at low temperatures, which has delayed the astrophysical
searches. We provide rovibrational parameters, excitations to the low energy electronic states,
torsional and inversion barriers and low vibrational energy levels. In the electronic ground state
(X$^2$A), which appears "clean" from non-adiabatic effects, the minimum energy structure is an
asymmetric geometry which rotational constants and dipole moment have been determined to be A$_0$=46718.6745
MHz, B$_0$=10748.4182 MHz, and C$_0$=9272.5105 MHz, and 1.432 D ($\mu_A$=0.6952 D, $\mu_B$=1.215
D, $\mu_C$=0.3016 D), respectively. A variational procedure has been applied to determine torsion-inversion
energy levels. Each level splits into 3 subcomponents (A$_1$/A$_2$ and E) corresponding to the
three methyl torsion minima. Although the potential energy surface presents 12 minima, at low temperatures,
the infrared band shapes correspond to a surface with only three minima because the top of the inversion
V$^{\alpha}$ barrier at ${\alpha}=0^{\circ}$ (109 cm$^{-1}$) stands below the zero point vibrational
energy and the CH$_2$ torsional barrier is relatively high ($\sim$2000 cm$^{-1}$). The methyl
torsion barrier was computed to be $\sim$500 cm$^{-1}$ and produces a splitting of 0.01 cm$^{-1}$
of the ground vibrational state.
