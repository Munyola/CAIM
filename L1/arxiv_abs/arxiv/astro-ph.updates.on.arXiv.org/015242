Testing gravity theory in the strong field region becomes a reality due to the observations of gravitational
waves and black hole shadows. In this paper, we discuss how to constrain the possible deviations
of the classical general relativity with the image of M87* observed by the Event Horizon Telescope.
More precisely, we want to know where is the event horizon for a non-rotating black hole. General
relativity predicts the horizon is located at the Schwarzschild radius $r_\textrm{s}$, while
other gravity theories may give different predictions. We propose a parameterized Schwarzschild
metric (PSM) in which the horizon is located at $r=nr_\textrm{s}$, where $n$ is a real free parameter,
and prove general relativity with nonlinear electrodynamics allows $n\neq1$. In the weak field
region, the PSM is equivalent to the Schwarzschild metric regardless of the value of $n$. In the strong
field region, the difference between the PSM and Schwarzschild metric would leave an imprint on
the shadow image. We present detailed calculations and discussions on the black hole shadows with
large background light source and accretion disk in the PSM framework. More importantly, we point
out that $n\approx2$ can be used to explain why the black hole mass measured by the shadow is a factor
of about two larger than the previous gas dynamics measurements. If this explanation is confirmed
to be right, then this phenomenon, together with the late-time cosmological acceleration, will
be very important to test gravity theories.
