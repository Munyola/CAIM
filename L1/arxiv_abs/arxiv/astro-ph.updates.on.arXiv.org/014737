Chemical abundances and abundance ratios measured in galaxies provide precious information about
the mechanisms, modes and time scales of the assembly of cosmic structures. Yet, the nucleogenesis
and chemical evolution of elements heavier than helium are dictated mostly by the physics of the
stars and the shape of the stellar mass spectrum. In particular, estimates of CNO isotopic abundances
in the hot, dusty media of high-redshift starburst galaxies offer a unique glimpse into the shape
of the stellar initial mass function (IMF) in extreme environments that can not be accessed with
direct observations (star counts). Underlying uncertainties in stellar evolution and nucleosynthesis
theory, however, may hurt our chances of getting a firm grasp of the IMF in these galaxies. In this
work, we adopt new yields for massive stars, covering different initial rotational velocities.
First, we implement the new yield set in a well-tested chemical evolution model for the Milky Way.
The calibrated model is then adapted to the specific case of a prototype submillimeter galaxy (SMG).
We show that, if the formation of fast-rotating stars is favoured in the turbulent medium of violently
star-forming galaxies irrespective of metallicity, the IMF needs to be skewed towards high-mass
stars in order to explain the CNO isotope ratios observed in SMGs. If, instead, stellar rotation
becomes negligible beyond a given metallicity threshold, as is the case for our own Galaxy, there
is no need to invoke a top-heavy IMF in starbursts.
