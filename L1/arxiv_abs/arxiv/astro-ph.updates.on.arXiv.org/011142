_NGC 4589, a bright E2 merger-remnant galaxy, hosts the peculiar fast and faint calcium-rich Type
Ib supernova (SN) SN 2005cz. The progenitor of Ca-rich SNe Ib has been controversial: it could be
a) a young massive star with 6-12 M$\odot$ in a binary system, or b) an old low-mass star in a binary
system that was kicked out from the galaxy center. Moreover, previous distance estimates for this
galaxy have shown a large spread, ranging from 20 Mpc to 60 Mpc. Thus, using archival $Hubble$ $Space$
$Telescope$/ACS $F435W$, $F555W$, and $F814W$ images, we search for star clusters in NGC 4589 in
order to help resolve these issues. We find a small population of young star clusters with $25<V\leq27$
($-7.1<M_V\leq-5.1$) mag and age $< 1$ Gyr in the central region at $R<0.5'$ ($<3.8$ kpc), thus supporting
the massive-star progenitor scenario for SN 2005cz. In addition to young star clusters, we also
find a large population of old globular clusters. In contrast to previous results in the literature,
we find that the color distribution of the globular clusters is clearly bimodal. The turnover (Vega)
magnitude in the $V$-band luminosity functions of the blue (metal-poor) globular clusters is determined
to be $V_0{(\rm max)}=24.40\pm0.10$ mag. We derive the total number of globular clusters, $N_{\rm
GC} =640\pm50$, and the specific frequency, $S_N =1.7\pm0.2$. Adopting a calibration for the metal-poor
globular clusters, $M_V({\rm max})=-7.66\pm0.14$ mag, we derive a distance to this galaxy: $(m-M)_0=32.06\pm0.10({\rm
ran})\pm0.15({\rm sys})$ ($d=25.8\pm2.2$ Mpc).
