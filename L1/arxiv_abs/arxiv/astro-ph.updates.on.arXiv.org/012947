We analyse the phenomenological implications of the two-families scenario on the merger of compact
stars. That scenario is based on the coexistence of both hadronic stars and strange quark stars.
After discussing the classification of the possible mergers, we turn to detailed numerical simulations
of the merger of two hadronic stars, i.e., "first family" stars in which delta resonances and hyperons
are present, and we show results for the threshold mass of such binaries, for the mass dynamically
ejected and the mass of the disk surrounding the post-merger object. We compare these results with
those obtained within the one-family scenario and we conclude that relevant signatures of the two-families
scenario can be suggested, in particular: the possibility of a rapid collapse to a black hole for
masses even smaller than the ones associated to GW170817; during the first milliseconds, oscillations
of the postmerger remnant at frequencies higher than the ones obtained in the one-family scenario;
a large value of the mass dynamically ejected and a small mass of the disk, for binaries of low total
mass. Finally, based on a population synthesis analysis, we present estimates of the number of mergers
for: two hadronic stars; hadronic star - strange quark star; two strange quark stars. We show that
for unequal mass systems and intermediate values of the total mass, the merger of a hadronic star
and a strange quark star is very likely (GW170817 has a possible interpretation into this category
of mergers). On the other hand, mergers of two strange quark stars are strongly suppressed.
