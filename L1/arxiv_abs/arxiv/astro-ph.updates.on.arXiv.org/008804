The Greenland Telescope project has recently participated in an experiment to image the supermassive
black hole shadow at the center of M87 using Very Long Baseline Interferometry technique in April
of 2018. The antenna consists of the 12-m ALMA North American prototype antenna that was modified
to support two auxiliary side containers and to withstand an extremely cold environment. The telescope
is currently at Thule Air Base in Greenland with the long-term goal to move the telescope over the
Greenland ice sheet to Summit Station. The GLT currently has a single cryostat which houses three
dual polarization receivers that cover 84-96 GHz, 213-243 GHz and 271-377 GHz bands. A hydrogen
maser frequency source in conjunction with high frequency synthesizers are used to generate the
local oscillator references for the receivers. The intermediate frequency outputs of each receiver
cover 4-8 GHz and are heterodyned to baseband for digitization within a set of ROACH-2 units then
formatted for recording onto Mark-6 data recorders. A separate set of ROACH-2 units operating in
parallel provides the function of auto-correlation for real-time spectral analysis. Due to the
stringent instrumental stability requirements for interferometry a diagnostic test system was
incorporated into the design. Tying all of the above equipment together is the fiber optic system
designed to operate in a low temperature environment and scalable to accommodate a larger distance
between the control module and telescope for Summit Station. A report on the progress of the above
electronics instrumentation system will be provided.
