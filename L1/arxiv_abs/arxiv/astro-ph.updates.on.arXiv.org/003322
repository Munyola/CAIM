We use high resolution simulations of the formation of the local group post-processed by a radiative
transfer code for UV photons, to investigate the reionization of the satellite populations of an
isolated Milky Way-M31 galaxy pair in a variety of scenarios. We use an improved version of ATON which
includes a simple recipe for radiative feedback. In our baseline models, reionization is initiated
by low mass, radiatively regulated haloes at high redshift, until more massive haloes appear, which
then dominate and complete the reionization process. We investigate the relation between reionization
history and present-day positions of the satellite population. We find that the average reionization
redshift (zr) of satellites is higher near galaxy centers (MW and M31). This is due to the inside-out
reionization patterns imprinted by massive haloes within the progenitor during the EoR, which
end up forming the center of the galaxy. Thanks to incomplete dynamical mixing during galaxy assembly,
these early patterns survive down to present day, resulting in a a clear radial gradient in the average
satellites reionization redshift, up to the virial radius of MW and M31 and beyond. In the lowest
emissivity scenario, the outer satellites are reionized about 180 Myr later than the inner satellites.
This delay decreases with increasing source model emissivity, or in the case of external reionization
by Virgo or M31, because reionization happens faster overall, and becomes spatially quasi-uniform
at the highest emissivity.
