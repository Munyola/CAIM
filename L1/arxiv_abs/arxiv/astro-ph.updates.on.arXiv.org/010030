We present results of the mapping observations covering a large area of 1 square degree around W40
and Serpens South carried out in the 12CO (J=1-0), 13CO (J=1-0), C18O (J=1-0), CCS (J_{N}=8_{7}-7_{6}),
and N_2H+ (J=1-0) emission lines with the 45 m Nobeyama Radio Telescope. W40 is a blistered Hii region,
and Serpens South is an infrared dark cloud accompanied by a young cluster. The relationship between
these two regions which are separated by ~20' on the sky has not been clear so far. We found that the
C18O emission is distributed smoothly throughout the W40 and Serpens South regions, and it seems
that the two regions are physically connected. We divided the C18O emission into four groups in terms
of the spatial distributions around the HII region which we call 5, 6, 7, and 8 km s^{-1} components
according to their typical LSR velocities, and propose a three-dimensional model of the W40 and
Serpens South complex. We found two elliptical structures in position-velocity diagrams, which
can be explained as a part of two expanding shells. One of the shells is the small inner shell just around
the HII region, and the other is the large outer shell corresponding to the boundary of the HII region.
Dense gas associated with the young cluster of Serpens South is likely to be located at the surface
of the outer shell, indicating that the natal clump of the young cluster is interacting with the outer
shell being compressed by the expansion of the shell. We suggest that the expansion of the shell induced
the formation of the young cluster.
