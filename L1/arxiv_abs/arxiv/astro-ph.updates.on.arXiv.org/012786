We present a multi-messenger measurement of the Hubble constant H_0 using the binary-black-hole
merger GW170814 as a standard siren, combined with a photometric redshift catalog from the Dark
Energy Survey (DES). The luminosity distance is obtained from the gravitational wave signal detected
by the LIGO/Virgo Collaboration (LVC) on 2017 August 14, and the redshift information is provided
by the DES Year 3 data. Black-hole mergers such as GW170814 are expected to lack bright electromagnetic
emission to uniquely identify their host galaxies and build an object-by-object Hubble diagram.
However, they are suitable for a statistical measurement, provided that a galaxy catalog of adequate
depth and redshift completion is available. Here we present the first Hubble parameter measurement
using a black-hole merger. Our analysis results in $H_0 = 75.2^{+39.5}_{-32.4}~{\rm km~s^{-1}~Mpc^{-1}}$,
which is consistent with both SN Ia and CMB measurements of the Hubble constant. The quoted 68% credible
region comprises 60% of the uniform prior range [20,140] ${\rm km~s^{-1}~Mpc^{-1}}$, and it depends
on the assumed prior range. If we take a broader prior of [10,220] ${\rm km~s^{-1}~Mpc^{-1}}$, we
find $H_0 = 78^{+ 96}_{-24}~{\rm km~s^{-1}~Mpc^{-1}}$ ($57\%$ of the prior range). Although a
weak constraint on the Hubble constant from a single event is expected using the dark siren method,
a multifold increase in the LVC event rate is anticipated in the coming years and combinations of
many sirens will lead to improved constraints on $H_0$.
