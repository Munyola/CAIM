We study clusters in Warm Dark Matter (WDM) models of a thermally produced dark matter particle $0.5$
keV in mass. We show that, despite clusters in WDM cosmologies having similar density profiles as
their Cold Dark Matter (CDM) counterparts, the internal properties, such as the amount of substructure,
shows marked differences. This result is surprising as clusters are at mass scales that are {\em
a thousand times greater} than that at which structure formation is suppressed. WDM clusters gain
significantly more mass via smooth accretion and contain fewer substructures than their CDM brethren.
The higher smooth mass accretion results in subhaloes which are physically more extended and less
dense. These fine-scale differences can be probed by strong gravitational lensing. We find, unexpectedly,
that WDM clusters have {\em higher} lensing efficiencies than those in CDM cosmologies, contrary
to the naive expectation that WDM clusters should be less efficient due to the fewer substructures
they contain. Despite being less dense, the larger WDM subhaloes are more likely to have larger lensing
cross-sections than CDM ones. Additionally, WDM subhaloes typically reside at larger distances,
which radially stretches the critical lines associated with strong gravitational lensing, resulting
in excess in the number of clusters with large radial cross-sections at the $\sim2\sigma$ level.
Though lensing profile for an individual cluster vary significantly with the line-of-sight, the
radial arc distribution based on a sample of $\gtrsim100$ clusters may prove to be the crucial test
for the presence of WDM.
