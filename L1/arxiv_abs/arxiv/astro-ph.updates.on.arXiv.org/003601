The Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) has observed more than a hundred of gamma-ray pulsars, about
one third of which are radio-quiet, i.e. not detected at radio frequencies. The most of radio-loud
pulsars are detected by Fermi LAT by using the radio timing models, while the radio-quiet ones are
discovered in a blind search. The difference in the techniques introduces an observational selection
bias and, consequently, the direct comparison of populations is complicated. In order to produce
an unbiased sample, we perform a blind search of gamma-ray pulsations using Fermi-LAT data alone.
No radio data or observations at optical or X-ray frequencies are involved in the search process.
We produce a gamma-ray selected catalog of 25 non-recycled gamma-ray pulsars found in a blind search,
including 16 radio-quiet and 9 radio-loud pulsars. This results in the direct measurement of the
fraction of radio-quiet pulsars $\varepsilon_{RQ} = 64\pm 10\%$, which is in agreement with the
existing estimates from the population modeling in the outer magnetosphere model. The Polar cap
models are disfavored due to a lower expected fraction and the prediction of age dependence. The
age, gamma-ray energy flux, spin-down luminosity and sky location distributions of the radio-loud
and radio-quiet pulsars from the catalog do not demonstrate any statistically significant difference.
The results indicate that the radio-quiet and radio-loud pulsars belong to one and the same population.
The catalog shows no evidence for the radio beam evolution.
