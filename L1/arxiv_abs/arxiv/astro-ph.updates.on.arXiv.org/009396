We present a new radio-selected sample of PNe from the CORNISH survey. This is a radio continuum survey
of the inner Galactic plane covering Galactic longitude, $10^\circ <l< 65^\circ$ and latitude,
$|b| < 1^\circ$ with a resolution of 1.5$^{''}$ and sensitivity better than 0.4 mJy/beam. The radio
regime, being unbiased by dust extinction, allows for a more complete sample selection, especially
towards the Galactic mid-plane. Visual inspection of the CORNISH data, in combination with data
from multi-wavelength surveys of the Galactic plane, allowed the CORNISH team to identify 169 candidate
PNe. Here, we explore the use of multi-wavelength diagnostic plots and analysis to verify and classify
the candidate PNe. We present the multi-wavelength properties of this new PNe sample. We find 90
new PNe, of which 12 are newly discovered and 78 are newly classified as PN. A further 47 previously
suspected PNe are confirmed as such from the analysis presented here and 24 known PNe are detected.
Eight sources are classified as possible PNe or other source types. Our sample includes a young sub-sample,
with physical diameters < 0.12 pc, brightness temperatures (> 1000 K) and located closer than 7 kpc.
Within this sample is a water-maser PN with a spectral index of $-0.55\pm 0.08$, which indicates
non-thermal radio emission. Such a radio-selected sample, unaffected by extinction, will be particularly
useful to compare with population synthesis models and should contribute to the understanding
of the formation and evolution of PNe.
