Gliese 876 harbors one of the most dynamically rich and well-studied exoplanetary systems. The
nearby M4V dwarf hosts four known planets, the outer three of which are trapped in a Laplace mean-motion
resonance. A thorough characterization of the complex resonant perturbations exhibited by the
orbiting planets, and the chaotic dynamics therein, is key to a complete picture of the system's
formation and evolutionary history. Here we present a reanalysis of the system using six years of
new radial velocity (RV) data from four instruments. This new data augments and more than doubles
the size of the decades-long collection of existing velocity measurements. We provide updated
estimates of the system parameters by employing a computationally efficient Wisdom-Holman N-body
symplectic integrator, coupled with a Gaussian Process (GP) regression model to account for correlated
stellar noise. Experiments with synthetic RV data show that the dynamical characterization of
the system can differ depending on whether a white noise or correlated noise model is adopted. Despite
there being a region of stability for an additional planet in the resonant chain, we find no evidence
for one. Our new parameter estimates place the system even deeper into resonance than previously
thought and suggest that the system might be in a low energy, quasi-regular double apsidal corotation
resonance. This result and others will be used in a subsequent study on the primordial migration
processes responsible for the formation of the resonant chain.
