Aims: In this work, we analyse the multiwavelength brightness variations and flaring activity
of FSRQ PKS1510-089, aiming to constrain the position of the emission sources. Methods: We report
7 mm (43 GHz) radio and R-band polarimetric observations of PKS1510-089. The radio observations
were performed at the Itapetinga Radio Observatory, while the polarimetric data were obtained
at the Pico dos Dias Observatory. The 7 mm observations cover the period between 2011 and 2013, while
the optical polarimetric observations were made between 2009 and 2012. Results: At 7 mm, we detected
a correlation between four radio and $\gamma$-ray flares with a delay of about 54 days between them;
the higher frequency counterpart occurred first. Using optical polarimetry, we detected a large
variation in polarization angle (PA) within two days associated with the beginning of a $\gamma$-ray
flare. Complementing our data with other data obtained in the literature, we show that PA presented
rotations associated with the occurrence of flares. Conclusions: Our results can be explained
by a shock-in-jet model, in which a new component is formed in the compact core producing an optical
and/or $\gamma$-ray flare, propagates along the jet, and after some time becomes optically thin
and is detected as a flare at radio frequencies. The variability in the polarimetric parameters
can also be reproduced; we can explain large variation in both PA and polarization degree (PD), in
only one of them, or in neither, depending on the differences in PA and PD between the jet and the new
component.
