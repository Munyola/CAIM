We present narrow-band [O III]lambda5007 and H-alpha images, as well as long-slit high-resolution
echelle spectra of the planetary nebula NGC 6058. Our data reveal that NGC 6058 is a multipolar planetary
nebula of about ~45 arcsec in extent and formed by four bipolar outflows that are oriented at different
position angles. Assuming homologous expansion for all the structures, and a distance of 3.5 kpc,
we obtain polar velocities around ~68 km s^-1 for three of them. The estimated kinematical ages suggest
that the three oldest outflows have been ejected in intervals of ~ 1100 and ~ 400 yr during which, the
ejection axis has changes its orientation by ~ 60 degrees and ~ 40 degrees, respectively. Although
a inner ring-like structure is suggested by the direct images, its kinematics shows that no equatorial
ring or toroid exists in the nebula. At the contrary, the long-slit spectra reveal that the ring-like
structure corresponds to a fourth outflow that is oriented almost perpendicular to the other three.
This fourth outflow is the youngest one and appears to be interacting with the other three, creating
a protruding zone that sweeps material in a region almost perpendicular to the major axes of the oldest
outflows. This structure also presents two bright arcuate regions along the same direction of the
older outflows, and at opposite sides from the central star. From our model, we suggest that NGC 6058
could be anintermediate evolutionary stage between starfish planetary nebulae and multipolar
planetary nebula with apparent equatorial lobes.
