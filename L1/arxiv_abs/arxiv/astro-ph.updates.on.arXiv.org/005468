The Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) hosts a large number of candidate stellar cluster pairs. Binary
stellar clusters provide important clues about cluster formation processes and the evolutionary
history of the host galaxy. However, to properly extract and interpret this information, it is crucial
to fully constrain the fraction of real binary systems and their physical properties. Here we present
a detailed photometric analysis based on ESO-FORS2 images of three candidate cluster multiplets
in the LMC, namely SL349-SL353, SL385-SL387-NGC1922 and NGC1836-BRHT4b-NGC1839. For each cluster
we derived ages, structural parameters and morphological properties. We have also estimated the
degree of filling of their Roche lobe, as an approximate tool to measure the strength of the tidal
perturbations induced by the LMC. We find that the members of the possible pairs SL349-SL353 and
BRHT4b-NGC1839 have a similar age ($t = 1.00 \pm 0.12$ Gyr and $t = 140 \pm 15$ Myr, respectively),
thus possibly hinting to a common origin of their member systems We also find that all candidate pairs
in our sample show evidence of intra-cluster overdensities that can be a possible indication of
real binarity. Particularly interesting is the case of SL349-SL353. In fact, SL353 is relatively
close to the condition of critical filling, thus suggesting that these systems might actually constitute
an energetically bound pair. It is therefore key to pursue a detailed kinematic screening of such
clusters, without which, at present, we do not dare making a conclusive statement about the true
nature of this putative pair.
