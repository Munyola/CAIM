Community access to deep (i ~ 25), highly-multiplexed optical and near-infrared multi-object
spectroscopy (MOS) on 8-40m telescopes would greatly improve measurements of cosmological parameters
from LSST. The largest gain would come from improvements to LSST photometric redshifts, which are
employed directly or indirectly for every major LSST cosmological probe; deep spectroscopic datasets
will enable reduced uncertainties in the redshifts of individual objects via optimized training.
Such spectroscopy will also determine the relationship of galaxy SEDs to their environments, key
observables for studies of galaxy evolution. The resulting data will also constrain the impact
of blending on photo-z's. Focused spectroscopic campaigns can also improve weak lensing cosmology
by constraining the intrinsic alignments between the orientations of galaxies. Galaxy cluster
studies can be enhanced by measuring motions of galaxies in and around clusters and by testing photo-z
performance in regions of high density. Photometric redshift and intrinsic alignment studies
are best-suited to instruments on large-aperture telescopes with wider fields of view (e.g., Subaru/PFS,
MSE, or GMT/MANIFEST) but cluster investigations can be pursued with smaller-field instruments
(e.g., Gemini/GMOS, Keck/DEIMOS, or TMT/WFOS), so deep MOS work can be distributed amongst a variety
of telescopes. However, community access to large amounts of nights for surveys will still be needed
to accomplish this work. In two companion white papers we present gains from shallower, wide-area
MOS and from single-target imaging and spectroscopy.
