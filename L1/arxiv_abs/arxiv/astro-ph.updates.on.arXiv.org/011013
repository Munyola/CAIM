Disky bulges in spiral galaxies are commonly thought to form out of disk materials (mainly) via bar
driven secular processes, they are structurally and dynamically distinct from `classical bulges'
built in violent merger events. We use high-resolution GTC/MEGARA integral-field unit spectroscopic
observations of the Sa galaxy NGC 7025, obtained during the MEGARA commissioning run, together
with detailed 1D and 2D decompositions of this galaxy's SDSS $i$-band data to investigate the formation
of its disky (bulge) component which makes up $\sim 30\%$ of the total galaxy light. With a S\'ersic
index $n \sim 1.80 \pm 0.24$, half-light radius $R_{\rm e} \sim 1.70 \pm 0.43$ kpc and stellar mass
$M_{*} \sim (4.34 \pm 1.70) \times10^{10} M_{\odot}$, this bulge dominates the galaxy light distribution
in the inner $R \sim 15"$ ($\sim 4.7$ kpc). Measuring the spins ($\lambda$) and ellipticities ($\epsilon$)
enclosed within nine different circular apertures with radii $R \le R_{\rm e}$, we show that the
bulge, which exhibits a spin track of an outwardly rising $\lambda$ and $\epsilon$, is a fast rotator
for all the apertures considered. Our findings suggest that this inner disky component is a pseudo-bulge,
consistent with the stellar and dust spiral patterns seen in the galaxy down to the innermost regions
but in contrast to the classical bulge interpretation favored in the past. We propose that a secular
process involving the tightly wound stellar spiral arms of NGC 7025 may drive gas and stars out of
the disk into the inner regions of the galaxy, building up the massive pseudo-bulge.
