Some theories of planet formation and evolution predict that intermediate-mass stars host more
hot Jupiters than Sun-like stars, others reach the conclusion that such objects are very rare. By
determining the frequencies of those planets we can test those theories. Based on the analysis of
Kepler light curves it has been suggested that about 8 per cent of the intermediate-mass stars could
have a close-in substellar companion. This would indicate a very high frequency of such objects.
Up to now, there was no satisfactory proof or test of this hypothesis. We studied a previously reported
sample of 166 planet candidates around main-sequence A-type stars in the Kepler field. We selected
six of them for which we obtained extensive long-term radial velocity measurements with the Alfred-Jensch
2-m telescope in Tautenburg and the Perek 2-m telescope in Ond\v{r}ejov. We derive upper limits
of the masses of the planet candidates. We show that we are able to detect this kind of planet with our
telescopes and their instrumentation using the example of MASCARA-1 b. With the transit finding
pipeline EXOTRANS we confirm that there is no single transit event from a Jupiter-like planet in
the light curves of those 166 stars. We furthermore determine that the upper limit for the occurrence
rate of close-in, massive planets for A-type stars in the Kepler sample is around 0.75 per cent. We
argue that there is currently little evidence for a very high frequency of close-in, massive planets
of intermediate-mass stars.
