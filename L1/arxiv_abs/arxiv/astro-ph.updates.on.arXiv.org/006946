The notion of a Galactic Habitable Zone (GHZ), or regions of the Milky Way galaxy that preferentially
maintain the conditions to sustain complex life, has recently gained attention due to the detection
of numerous exoplanets and advances made in understanding habitability on the Earth and other environments.
We discuss what a habitable environment means on large spatial and temporal scales, which necessarily
requires an approximated definition of habitability to make an assessment of the astrophysical
conditions that may sustain complex life. We discuss a few key exoplanet findings that directly
relate to estimating the distribution of Earth-size planets in the Milky Way. With a broad notion
of habitability defined and major observable properties of the Milky Way described, we compare
selected literature on the GHZ and postulate why the models yield differing predictions of the most
habitable regions at the present day, which include: (1) the majority of the galactic disk; (2) an
annular ring between 7-9 kpc, and (3) the galactic outskirts. We briefly discuss the habitability
of other galaxies as influenced by these studies. We note that the dangers to biospheres in the Galaxy
taken into account in these studies may be incomplete and we discuss the possible role of Gamma-Ray
Bursts and other dangers to life in the Milky Way. We speculate how changing astrophysical properties
may affect the GHZ over time, including before the Earth formed, and describe how new observations
and other related research may fit into the bigger picture of the habitability of the Galaxy.
