Using dark matter haloes identified in a large $N$-body simulation, we study halo assembly bias,
with halo formation time, peak maximum circular velocity, concentration, and spin as the assembly
variables. Instead of grouping haloes at fixed mass into different percentiles of each assembly
variable, we present the joint dependence of halo bias on the {\it values} of halo mass and each assembly
variable. In the plane of halo mass and one assembly variable, the joint dependence can be largely
described as halo bias increasing outward from a global minimum. We find it unlikely to have a combination
of halo variables to absorb all assembly bias effects. We then present the joint dependence of halo
bias on two assembly variables at fixed halo mass. The gradient of halo bias does not necessarily
follow the correlation direction of the two assembly variables and it varies with halo mass. Therefore
in general for two correlated assembly variables one cannot be used as a proxy for the other in predicting
halo assembly bias trend. Finally, halo assembly is found to affect the kinematics of haloes. Low-mass
haloes formed earlier can have much higher pairwise velocity dispersion than those of massive haloes.
In general, halo assembly leads to a correlation between halo bias and halo pairwise velocity distribution,
with more strongly clustered haloes having higher pairwise velocity and velocity dispersion.
However, the correlation is not tight, and the kinematics of haloes at fixed halo bias still depends
on halo mass and assembly variables.
