From 2014 October 19 to 27, six X-class flares occurred in super active region (AR) 12192. They were
all confined flares and were not followed by coronal mass ejections (CMEs). To examine the structures
of the four flares close to the solar disk center from October 22 to 26, we employ firstly composite
triple-time images in each flare process to display {the stratified structure} of these flare loops.
The loop structures of each flare in both lower (171 {\AA}) and higher (131 {\AA}) temperature channels
are complex, e.g., the flare loops rooting at flare ribbons are sheared or twisted (enwound) together,
and the complex structures have not been destroyed during the flares. For the first flare, although
the flare loop system appears as a spindle shape, we can estimate their structure from observations,
with lengths ranging from 130 to 300 Mm, heights from 65 to 150 Mm, widths at the middle part of the spindle
from 40 to 100 Mm, and shear angles from 16$^\circ$ to 90$^\circ$. Moreover, the flare ribbons display
irregular movements, such as the left ribbon fragments of the flare on 22 swept a small region repeatedly,
and the both ribbons of the flare on 26 moved along the same direction, instead of separating from
each other. These irregular movements also imply that the corresponding flare loops are complex,
e.g. several sets of flare loops are twisted together. Although previous studies suggest that the
background magnetic fields prevent confined flares from erupting, we firstly suggest based on
these observations that the complex flare loop structures may be responsible for these confined
flares.
