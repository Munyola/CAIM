Cassini/UVIS FUV observations of stellar occultations at Titan are well suited for probing its
atmospheric composition and structure. However, due to instrument pointing motion, only five
out of tens of observations have been analyzed. We present an innovative retrieval method that corrects
for the effect of pointing motion by forward modeling the Cassini/UVIS instrument response function
with the pointing motion value obtained from the SPICE C-kernel along the spectral dimension. To
illustrate the methodology, an occultation observation made during flyby T52 is analyzed, when
the Cassini spacecraft had insufficient attitude control. A high-resolution stellar model and
an instrument response simulator that includes the position of the point source on the detector
are used for the analysis of the pointing motion. The Markov Chain Monte-Carlo method is used to retrieve
the line-of-sight abundance profiles of eleven species (CH4, C2H2, C2H4, C2H6, C4H2, C6H6, HCN,
C2N2, HC3N, C6N2 and haze particles) in the spectral vector fitting process. We obtain tight constraints
on all of the species aside from C2H6, C2N2 and C6N2, for which we only retrieved upper limits. This
is the first time that the T52 occultation was used to derive abundances of major hydrocarbon and
nitrile species in Titan's upper and middle atmosphere, as pointing motion prohibited prior analysis.
With this new method, nearly all of the occultations obtained over the entire Cassini mission could
yield reliable profiles of atmospheric composition, allowing exploration of Titan's upper atmosphere
over seasons, latitudes, and longitudes.
