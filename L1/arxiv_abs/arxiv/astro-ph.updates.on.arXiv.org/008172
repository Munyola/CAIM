Context. Transition disks (TDs) are circumstellar disks with inner regions highly depleted in
dust. TDs are observed in a small fraction of disk-bearing objects at ages of 1-10 Myr. They are important
laboratories to study evolutionary effects in disks, from photoevaporation to planet-disk interactions.
Aims. We report the discovery of a large inner dust-empty region in the disk around the very low mass
star CIDA 1 (M$_{\star} \sim 0.1-0.2$ M$_{\odot}$). Methods. We used ALMA continuum observations
at 887$\mu$m, which provide a spatial resolution of $0."21\times0."12$ ($\sim$15$\times$8 au
in radius at 140 pc). Results. The data show a dusty ring with a clear cavity of radius $\sim$20 au,
the typical characteristic of a TD. The emission in the ring is well described by a narrow Gaussian
profile. The dust mass in the disk is $\sim$17 M$_{\oplus}$. CIDA 1 is one of the lowest mass stars
with a clearly detected millimeter cavity. When compared to objects of similar stellar mass, it
has a relatively massive dusty disk (less than $\sim5$% of Taurus Class II disks in Taurus have a ratio
of $M_{\rm{disk}}/M_{\star}$ larger than CIDA 1) and a very high mass accretion rate (CIDA 1 is a
disk with one of the lowest values of $M_{\rm{disk}}/\dot M$ ever observed). In light of these unusual
parameters, we discuss a number of possible mechanisms that can be responsible for the formation
of the dust cavity (e.g., photoevaporation, dead zones, embedded planets, close binary). We find
that an embedded planet of a Saturn mass or a close binary are the most likely possibilities.
