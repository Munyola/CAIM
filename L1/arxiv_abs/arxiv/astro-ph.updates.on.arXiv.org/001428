The large gas and dust reservoirs of submm galaxies (SMGs) could potentially provide ample fuel
to trigger an Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN), but previous studies of the AGN fraction in SMGs have
been controversial largely due to the inhomogeneity and limited angular resolution of the available
submillimeter surveys. Here we set improved constraints on the AGN fraction and X-ray properties
of the SMGs with ALMA and Chandra observations in the Extended Chandra Deep Field-South (E-CDF-S).
This study is the first among similar works to have unambiguously identified the X-ray counterparts
of SMGs; this is accomplished using the fully submm-identified, statistically reliable SMG catalog
with 99 SMGs from the ALMA LABOCA E-CDF-S Submillimeter Survey (ALESS). We found 10 X-ray sources
associated with SMGs (median redshift z = 2.3), of which 8 were identified as AGNs using several techniques
that enable cross-checking. The other 2 X-ray detected SMGs have levels of X-ray emission that can
be plausibly explained by their star-formation activity. 6 of the 8 SMG-AGNs are moderately/highly
absorbed, with N_H > 10e23 cm-2. An analysis of the AGN fraction, taking into account the spatial
variation of X-ray sensitivity, yields an AGN fraction of 17+16-6% for AGNs with rest-frame 0.5-8
keV absorption-corrected luminosity >7.8x10e42 erg s-1; we provide estimated AGN fractions
as a function of X-ray flux and luminosity. ALMA's high angular resolution also enables direct X-ray
stacking at the precise positions of SMGs for the first time, and we found 4 potential SMG-AGNs in
our stacking sample.
