During its mission in the Saturn system, Cassini performed five close flybys of Dione. During three
of them, radio tracking data were collected during the closest approach, allowing estimation of
the full degree-2 gravity field by precise spacecraft orbit determination. The gravity field of
Dione is dominated by $J_{2}$ and $C_{22}$, for which our best estimates are $J_{2} \times 10^6 =
1496 \pm 11$ and $C_{22} \times 10^6 = 364.8 \pm 1.8$ (unnormalized coefficients, 1-$\sigma$ uncertainty).
Their ratio is $J_{2}/C_{22} = 4.102 \pm 0.044$, showing a significative departure (about 17-$\sigma$)
from the theoretical value of 10/3, predicted for a relaxed body in slow, synchronous rotation around
a planet. Therefore, it is not possible to retrieve the moment of inertia directly from the measured
gravitational field. The interior structure of Dione is investigated by a combined analysis of
its gravity and topography, which exhibits an even larger deviation from hydrostatic equilibrium,
suggesting some degree of compensation. The gravity of Dione is far from the expectation for an undifferentiated
hydrostatic body, so we built a series of three-layer models, and considered both Airy and Pratt
compensation mechanisms. The interpretation is non-unique, but Dione's excess topography may
suggest some degree of Airy-type isostasy, meaning that the outer ice shell is underlain by a higher
density, lower viscosity layer, such as a subsurface liquid water ocean. The data permit a broad
range of possibilities, but the best fitting models tend towards large shell thicknesses and small
ocean thicknesses.
