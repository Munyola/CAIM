In the solar corona, magnetic helicity slowly and continuously accumulates in response to plasma
flows tangential to the photosphere and magnetic flux emergence through it. Analyzing this transfer
of magnetic helicity is key for identifying its role in the dynamics of active regions (ARs). The
connectivity-based helicity flux density method was recently developed for studying the 2D and
3D transfer of magnetic helicity in ARs. The method takes into account the 3D nature of magnetic helicity
by explicitly using knowledge of the magnetic field connectivity, which allows it to faithfully
track the photospheric flux of magnetic helicity. Because the magnetic field is not measured in
the solar corona, modeled 3D solutions obtained from force-free magnetic field extrapolations
must be used to derive the magnetic connectivity. Different extrapolation methods can lead to markedly
different 3D magnetic field connectivities, thus questioning the reliability of the connectivity-based
approach in observational applications. We address these concerns by applying this method to the
isolated and internally complex AR 11158 with different magnetic field extrapolation models.
We show that the connectivity-based calculations are robust to different extrapolation methods,
in particular with regards to identifying regions of opposite magnetic helicity flux. We conclude
that the connectivity-based approach can be reliably used in observational analyses and is a promising
tool for studying the transfer of magnetic helicity in ARs and relate it to their flaring activity.
