Our motion relative to the cosmic-microwave-background (CMB) rest frame deflects light rays giving
rise to shifts as large as L -> L(1+beta), where beta=0.00123 is our velocity (in units of the speed
of light) on measurements CMB fluctuations. Here we present a novel harmonic-space approach to
this CMB aberration that improves upon prior work by allowing us to (i) go to higher orders in beta,
thus extending the validity of the analysis to measurements at L > 1/beta ~ 800; and (ii) treat
the effects of window functions and pixelization in a more accurate and computationally efficient
manner. We calculate precisely the magnitude of the systematic bias in the power spectrum inferred
from the partial sky, and show that aberration shifts the multipole moment by Delta L/L ~ beta<cos(theta)>,
with <cos(theta)> averaged over the survey footprint. Such a shift, if ignored, would bias
the measurement of the sound-horizon size theta_* at the 0.01%-level, which is comparable to the
measurement uncertainties of Planck. The bias can then propagate into cosmological parameters
such as the angular-diameter distance, Hubble parameter and dark-energy equation of state. We
study the effect of aberration for current Planck, South Pole Telescope (SPT) and Atacama Cosmology
Telescope (ACT) data and show that the bias cannot be neglected. We suggest that the small tension
between Planck, ACT, and SPT may be due partially to aberration. An Appendix shows how the near constancy
of the full-sky power spectrum under aberration follows from unitarity of the aberration kernel.
