Galaxy mergers play an important role in the growth of galaxies and their supermassive black holes.
Simulations suggest that tidal interactions could enhance black hole accretion, which can be tested
by the fraction of binary active galactic nuclei (AGNs) among galaxy mergers. But determining the
fraction requires a statistical sample of binaries. We have identified kpc-scale binary AGNs directly
from high-resolution radio imaging. Inside the 92 square deg covered by the high-resolution Very
Large Array survey of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Stripe 82 field, we identified 22 grade
A and 30 grade B candidates of binary radio AGNs with angular separations less than 5" (10 kpc at z =
0.1). Eight of the candidates have optical spectra for both components from the SDSS spectroscopic
surveys and our Keck program. Two grade B candidates are projected pairs, but the remaining six candidates
are all compelling cases of binary AGNs based on either emission line ratios or the excess in radio
power compared to the H-alpha-traced star formation rate. Only two of the six binaries were previously
discovered by an optical spectroscopic search. Based on these results, we estimate that ~60% of
our binary candidates would be confirmed once we obtain complete spectroscopic information. We
conclude that wide-area high-resolution radio surveys offer an efficient method to identify large
samples of binary AGNs. These radio-selected binary AGNs complement binaries identified at other
wavelengths and are useful for understanding the triggering mechanisms of black hole accretion.
