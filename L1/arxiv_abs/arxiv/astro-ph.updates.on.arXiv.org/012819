The global influence of AGN-driven outflows remains uncertain, due to a lack of large samples with
accurately-determined outflow properties. In the second paper of this series, we determine the
mass and energetics of ionized outflows is 234 type II AGN, the largest such sample to date, by combining
the infrared emission of the dust in the wind (paper I) with the emission line properties. We provide
new general expressions for the properties of the outflowing gas, which depend on the ionization
state of the gas. We also present a novel method to estimate the electron density in the outflow, based
on optical line ratios and on the known location of the wind. The inferred electron densities, $n_{\mathrm{e}}
\sim 10^{4.5}\,\mathrm{(cm^{-3})}$, are two orders of magnitude larger than typically found
in most other cases of ionized outflows. We argue that the discrepancy is due to the fact that the commonly-used
[SII]-based method underestimates the true density by a large factor. As a result, the inferred
mass outflow rates and kinetic coupling efficiencies are $\dot{M}_{\mathrm{out}} \sim 10^{-2}\,
\mathrm{(M_{\odot}/yr)}$ and $\epsilon = \dot{E}_{\mathrm{kin}}/L_{\mathrm{bol}} \sim 10^{-5}$
respectively, 1--2 orders of magnitude lower than previous estimates. Our analysis suggests the
existence of a significant amount of neutral atomic gas at the back of the outflowing ionized gas
clouds, with mass that is a factor of a few larger than the observed ionized gas mass. This has significant
implications for the estimated mass and energetics of such flows.
