Context. This is the third study dedicated to the observed parallelism of properties between galaxy
clusters and early-type galaxies. Aims. Here we investigate the mechanisms which concur to shape
the Mass-Radius Relation, in order to cast light on the physical origin of its slope, tightness,
and zero point. Methods. First we collect data on masses and radii from different sources deriving
the observational Mass-Radius Relation and point out that the relation derived for early type galaxies
can be extended to grossly match the position of Globular Clusters and Galaxy Clusters. Second we
perform a theoretical analysis of the physical reasons for the Mass-Radius Relation. To this aim,
we present the Mass-Radius Relation of numerical hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy formation
and evolution in the monolithic and hierarchical schemes. Results. We propose a new interpretation
of the Mass-Radius Relation, which we claim to be the result of two complementary mechanisms: on
one hand, the result of local physical processes, which fixes the masses and radii of individual
objects; on the other hand, the action of cosmological global, statistical principles, which shape
the distribution of objects in the Mass-Radius plane. We reproduce the Mass-Radius relation with
simple arguments. Conclusions. The Mass-Radius Relation for objects going from Globular Clusters
to Galaxy Clusters stems from the same physical principles but continuously changes its slope.
It is the locus of objects in mechanical (virial) equilibrium and passive or nearly passive evolutionary
stage.
