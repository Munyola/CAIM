In order to study a molecular-cloud-scale chemical composition, we have conducted a mapping spectral
line survey toward the Galactic molecular cloud W3(OH), which is one of the most active star forming
regions in the Perseus arm, with the NRO 45 m telescope. We have observed the area of 16' $\times$ 16',
which corresponds to 9.0 pc $\times$ 9.0 pc. The observed frequency ranges are 87--91, 96--103,
and 108--112 GHz. We have prepared the spectrum averaged over the observed area, in which 8 molecular
species CCH, HCN, HCO$^+$, HNC, CS, SO, C$^{18}$O, and $^{13}$CO are identified. On the other hand,
the spectrum of the W3(OH) hot core observed at a 0.17 pc resolution shows the lines of various molecules
such as OCS, H$_2$CS CH$_3$CCH, and CH$_3$CN, in addition to the above species. In the spatially
averaged spectrum, emission of the species concentrated just around the star-forming core such
as CH$_3$OH and HC$_3$N is fainter than in the hot core spectrum, whereas emission of the species
widely extended over the cloud such as CCH is relatively brighter. We have classified the observed
area into 5 subregions according to the integrated intensity of $^{13}$CO, and have evaluated the
contribution to the averaged spectrum from each subregion. The CCH, HCN, HCO$^+$, and CS lines can
be seen even in the spectrum of the subregion with the lowest $^{13}$CO integrated intensity range
($< 10$ K km s$^{-1}$). Thus, the contributions of the spatially extended emission is confirmed
to be dominant in the spatially averaged spectrum.
