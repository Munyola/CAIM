Motivated by its potential use as a starting point for solving various cosmological constant problems,
we study F-theory compactified on the warped product $\mathbb{R}_{\text{time}} \times S^3 \times
Y_{8}$ where $Y_{8}$ is a $Spin(7)$ manifold, and the $S^3$ factor is the target space of an $SU(2)$
Wess--Zumino--Witten (WZW) model at level $N$. Reduction to M-theory exploits the abelian duality
of this WZW model to an $S^3 / \mathbb{Z}_N$ orbifold. In the large $N$ limit, the untwisted sector
is captured by 11D supergravity. The local dynamics of intersecting 7-branes in the $Spin(7)$ geometry
is controlled by a Donaldson--Witten twisted gauge theory coupled to defects. At late times, the
system is governed by a 1D supersymmetric quantum mechanics system with two real supercharges,
which in four dimensions would appear as "$\mathcal{N} = 1/2$ supersymmetry" on a curved background.
This leads to a cancellation of zero point energies in the 4D field theory but a split mass spectrum
for superpartners of order $\Delta m_\text{4D} \sim \sqrt{M_\text{IR} M_\text{UV}}$ specified
by the IR and UV cutoffs of the model. This is suggestively close to the TeV scale in some scenarios.
The classical 4D geometry has an intrinsic instability which can produce either a collapsing or
expanding Universe, the latter providing a promising starting point for a number of cosmological
scenarios. The resulting 1D quantum mechanics in the time direction also provides an appealing
starting point for a more detailed study of quantum cosmology.
