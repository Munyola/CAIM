We study the BELs in a sample of 11 gravitationally lensed quasars with at least two epochs of observation
to identify intrinsic variability and to disentangle it from microlensing. To improve our statistical
significance we also include 15 systems with single-epoch spectra. MgII and CIII] emission lines
are only weakly affected by microlensing, but CIV shows strong microlensing in some cases, even
for regions of the line core, associated with small projected velocities. However, excluding the
strongly microlensed cases, there is a strikingly good match between the red wings of the CIV and
CIII] profiles. Analysis of these results supports the existence of two regions in the BLR, one that
is insensitive to microlensing (of size $\gtrsim$ 50 light-days and kinematics not confined to
a plane) and another that shows up only when it is magnified by microlensing (of size of a few light-days,
comparable to the accretion disk). Both regions can contribute in different proportions to the
emission lines of different species and, within each line profile, to different velocity bins,
all of which complicates detailed studies of the BLR based on microlensing size estimates. The strength
of the microlensing indicates that some spectral features that make up the pseudo-continuum, such
as the shelf-like feature at {\lambda}1610 or several FeIII blends, may in part arise from an inner
region of the accretion disk. In the case of FeII, microlensing is strong in some blends but not in
others. This opens up interesting possibilities to study quasar accretion disk kinematics.
