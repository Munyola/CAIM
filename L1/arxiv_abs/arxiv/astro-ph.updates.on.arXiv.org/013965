Uncertainties in our knowledge of the properties of dense matter near and above nuclear saturation
density are among the main sources of variations in multi-messenger signatures predicted for core-collapse
supernovae (CCSNe) and the properties of neutron stars (NSs). We construct 97 new finite-temperature
equations of state (EOSs) of dense matter that obey current experimental, observational, and theoretical
constraints and discuss how systematic variations in the EOS parameters affect the properties
of cold nonrotating NSs and the core collapse of a $20\,M_\odot$ progenitor star. The core collapse
of the $20\,M_\odot$ progenitor star is simulated in spherical symmetry using the general-relativistic
radiation-hydrodynamics code GR1D where neutrino interactions are computed for each EOS using
the NuLib library. We conclude that the effective mass of nucleons at densities above nuclear saturation
density is the largest source of uncertainty in the CCSN neutrino signal and dynamics even though
it plays a subdominant role in most properties of cold NS matter. Meanwhile, changes in other observables
affect the properties of cold NSs, while having little effect in CCSNe. To strengthen our conclusions,
we perform six octant three-dimensional CCSN simulations varying the effective mass of nucleons
at nuclear saturation density. We conclude that neutrino heating and, thus, the likelihood of explosion
is significantly increased for EOSs where the effective mass of nucleons at nuclear saturation
density is large.
