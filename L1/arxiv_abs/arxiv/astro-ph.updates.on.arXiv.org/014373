The disconnected part of the power spectrum covariance matrix (also known as the "Gaussian" covariance)
is the dominant contribution on large scales for galaxy clustering and weak lensing datasets. The
presence of a complicated sky mask causes non-trivial correlations between different Fourier/harmonic
modes, which must be accurately characterized in order to obtain reliable cosmological constraints.
This is particularly relevant for galaxy survey data. Unfortunately, an exact calculation of these
correlations involves $O(\ell_{\rm max}^6)$ operations that become computationally impractical
very quickly. We present an implementation of approximate methods to estimate the Gaussian covariance
matrix of power spectra involving spin-0 and spin-2 flat- and curved-sky fields, expanding on existing
algorithms. These methods achieve an $O(\ell_{\rm max}^3)$ scaling, which makes the computation
of the covariance matrix as fast as the computation of the power spectrum itself. We quantify the
accuracy of these methods on large-scale structure and weak lensing data, making use of a large number
of Gaussian but otherwise realistic simulations. We show that, using the approximate covariance
matrix, we are able to recover the true posterior distribution of cosmological parameters to high
accuracy. We also quantify the shortcomings of these methods, which become unreliable on the very
largest scales, as well as for covariance matrix elements involving cosmic shear $B$ modes. The
algorithms presented here are implemented in the public code NaMaster (https://github.com/LSSTDESC/NaMaster).
