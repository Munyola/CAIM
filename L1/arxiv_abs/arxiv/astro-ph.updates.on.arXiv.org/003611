LOFT (the Large Observatory for X-ray Timing), is a mission concept that was considered by ESA as
a candidate for an M3 mission and has been studied during an extended >2-years long assessment
phase. The mission was specifically designed to perform fast X-ray timing and probe the status of
the matter near black holes and neutron stars. The LOFT scientific payload is composed of a Large
Area Detector (LAD) and a Wide Field Monitor (WFM). The LAD is a 10 m^2-class pointed instrument with
about 15 times the collecting area of the largest past timing missions (as the Rossi XTE) over the
2-30 keV range (30-80 keV expanded), combined with CCD-class spectral resolution, which holds
the capability to revolutionise studies of X-ray variability down to the millisecond time scales.
Its ground-breaking characteristic is a mass per unit surface in the range of 10 kg/m^2, enabling
an effective area of about 10 m^2 (at 8 keV) at a reasonable weight. The development of such large but
light experiment, with low mass and power per unit area, is now made possible by the recent advancements
in the field of large-area silicon drift detectors and capillary-plate X-ray collimators. Although
the LOFT mission has not been down-selected for launch in the M3 ESA programme (with launch in 2022-2024),
during the assessment phase most of the trade off have been closed leading to a robust and well documented
design which will be re-proposed in the future ESA calls. In this paper, we will summarize the characteristics
of the LAD instrument and briefly describe the status of the detectors design.
