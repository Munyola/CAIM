Low brightness dips have been recently observed in images of protoplanetary disks, and they are
believed to be shadows by the inner disk. We present VLT/SPHERE polarimetric differential imaging
of the transition disk around the dipper star RX J1604.3-2130. We gathered 11 epochs that cover a
large temporal baseline, to search for variability over timescales of years, months, weeks, and
days. Our observations unambiguously reveal two dips along an almost face-on narrow ring (with
a width of $\sim$20 au), and the location of the peak of this ring is at $\sim$65 au. The ring lies inside
the ring-like structure observed with ALMA, which peaks at $\sim$83 au. This segregation can result
from particle trapping in pressure bumps, potentially due to planet(s). We find that the dips are
variable, both in morphology and in position. The eastern dip, at a position angle (PA) of $\sim$83.7$\pm$13.7$^\circ$,
has an amplitude that varies between 40% to 90%, and its angular width varies from 10$^{\circ}$ to
34$^{\circ}$. The western dip, at a PA of $\sim$265.90$\pm$13.0$^\circ$, is more variable, with
amplitude and width variations of 31% to 95% and 12$^{\circ}$ to 53$^{\circ}$, respectively. The
separation between the dips is 178.3$^{\circ}\pm$14.5$^{\circ}$, corresponding to a large misalignment
between the inner and outer disk, supporting the classification of J1604 as an aperiodic dipper.
The variability indicates that the innermost regions are highly dynamic, possibly due to a massive
companion or to a complex magnetic field topology.
