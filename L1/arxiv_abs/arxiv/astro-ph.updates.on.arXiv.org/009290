Recent studies show that rotation significantly affects the s-process in massive stars. We provide
tables of yields for non-rotating and rotating massive stars between 10 and 150 $M_{\odot}$ at $Z=10^{-3}$
([Fe/H] $=-1.8$). Tables for different mass cuts are provided. The complete s-process is followed
during the whole evolution with a network of 737 isotopes, from Hydrogen to Polonium. A grid of stellar
models with initial masses of 10, 15, 20, 25, 40, 60, 85, 120 and 150 $M_{\odot}$ and with an initial
rotation rate of both 0 or 40$~\%$ of the critical velocity was computed. Three extra models were
computed in order to investigate the effect of faster rotation (70$~\%$ of the critical velocity)
and of a lower $^{17}$O($\alpha,\gamma$) reaction rate. At the considered metallicity, rotation
has a strong impact on the production of s-elements for initial masses between 20 and 60 $M_{\odot}$.
In this range, the first s-process peak is boosted by $2-3$ dex if rotation is included. Above 60 $M_{\odot}$,
s-element yields of rotating and non-rotating models are similar. Increasing the initial rotation
from 40$~\%$ to 70$~\%$ of the critical velocity enhances the production of $40 \lesssim Z \lesssim
60$ elements by $\sim 0.5-1$ dex. Adopting a reasonably lower $^{17}$O($\alpha,\gamma$) rate
in the fast rotating model (70$~\%$ of the critical velocity) boosts again the yields of s-elements
with $55 \lesssim Z \lesssim 82$ by about 1 dex. In particular, a modest amount of Pb is produced. Together
with s-elements, some light elements (particularly fluorine) are strongly overproduced in rotating
models.
