If the alpha effect plays a role in the generation of the Sun's magnetic field, the field should show
evidence of magnetic helicity of opposite signs at large and small length scales. Measuring this
faces two challenges: (i) in weak-field regions, horizontal field measurements are unreliable
because of the pi ambiguity, and (ii) one needs a truly global approach to computing helicity spectra
in the case where one expects a sign reversal across the equator at all wavenumbers. Here we develop
such a method using spin-2 spherical harmonics to decompose the linear polarization in terms of
the parity-even and parity-odd E and B polarizations, respectively. Using simple one- and two-dimensional
models, we show that the product of the spectral decompositions of E and B, taken at spherical harmonic
degrees that are shifted by one, can act as a proxy of the global magnetic helicity with a sign that
represents that in the northern hemisphere. We then apply this method to the analysis of solar synoptic
vector magnetograms, from which we extract a pseudo-polarization corresponding to a "pi-ambiguated"
magnetic field, i.e., a magnetic field vector that has no arrow. We find a negative sign of the global
EB helicity proxy at spherical harmonic degrees of around 6. This could indicate a positive magnetic
helicity at large length scales, but the spectrum fails to capture clear evidence of the well-known
negative magnetic helicity at smaller scales. This method might also be applicable to stellar and
Galactic polarization data.
