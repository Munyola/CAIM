We analyze the stellar initial mass functions (IMF) of a large sample of early type galaxies (ETGs)
provided by MaNGA. The large number of IFU spectra of individual galaxies provide high signal-to-noise
composite spectra that are essential for constraining IMF and to investigate possible radial gradients
of the IMF within individual galaxies. The large sample of ETGs also make it possible to study how
the IMF shape depends on various properties of galaxies. Our analysis is based on fitting the whole
spectrum of a galaxy with a Bayesian approach that provides a statistical way to explore potential
degeneracy in spectrum fitting, and to distinguish different IMF models with Bayesian evidence.
We find that the IMF slope depends systematically on galaxy velocity dispersion, in that galaxies
of higher velocity dispersion prefer a more bottom-heavy IMF, but the dependence is almost entirely
due to the change of metallicity, $Z$, with velocity dispersion. The IMF shape also depends on stellar
age, $A$, but the dependence is completely degenerate with that on metallicity through a combination
$AZ^{-1.42}$. Using independent age and metallicity estimates we find that the IMF variation is
produced by metallicity instead of age. The IMF near the centers of massive ETGs appears more bottom-heavy
than that in the outer parts, while a weak opposite trend is seen for low-mass ETGs. Uncertainties
produced by star formation history, dust extinction, $\alpha$-element abundance enhancement
and noise in the spectra are tested.
