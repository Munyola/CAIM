Gravitational lens modeling of spatially resolved sources is a challenging inverse problem with
many observational constraints and model parameters. We examine established pixel-based source
reconstruction algorithms for de-lensing the source and constraining lens model parameters.
Using test data for four canonical lens configurations, we explore statistical and systematic
uncertainties associated with gridding, source regularisation, interpolation errors, noise,
and telescope pointing. Specifically, we compare two gridding schemes in the source plane: a fully
adaptive grid that follows the lens mapping but is irregular, and an adaptive Cartesian grid. We
also consider regularisation schemes that minimise derivatives of the source (using two finite
difference methods) and introduce a scheme that minimises deviations from an analytic source profile.
Careful choice of gridding and regularisation can reduce "discreteness noise" in the $\chi^2$
surface that is inherent in the pixel-based methodology. With a gridded source, some degree of interpolation
is unavoidable, and errors due to interpolation need to be taken into account (especially for high
signal-to-noise data). Different realisations of the noise and telescope pointing lead to slightly
different values for lens model parameters, and the scatter between different "observations"
can be comparable to or larger than the model uncertainties themselves. The same effects create
scatter in the lensing magnification at the level of a few percent for a peak signal-to-noise ratio
of 10, which decreases as the data quality improves.
