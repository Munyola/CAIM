Environment is one of the key external drivers of the galaxies, while active galactic nucleus (AGN)
is one of the key internal drivers. Both of them play fundamental roles in regulating the formation
and evolution of galaxies. We explore the interrelationship between environment and AGN in SDSS.
At a given stellar mass, the specific star formation rate distribution of the AGN host galaxies remains
unchanged with over-density, with the peak of the distribution around the Green Valley. We show
that, at a given stellar mass, the AGN fraction that has been commonly used in previous studies (defined
as the number of AGNs relative to all galaxies including passive and star forming ones) does decrease
with increasing over-density for satellites. This is largely due to the fact that the fraction of
passive galaxies strongly depends on environment. In order to investigate the intrinsic correlation
between AGN and environment, especially under the assumption that AGN feedback is responsible
for star formation quenching, the AGN fraction should be defined as the number of AGNs relative to
the star-forming galaxies only. With the new definition, we find little dependence of AGN fraction
on over-density, central/satellite, and group halo mass. There is only marginal evidence that
AGN may prefer denser regions, which is possibly due to more frequent interaction of galaxies or
higher merger rate in groups. Our results support the scenario that internal secular evolution
is the predominant mechanism of triggering AGN activity, while external environment related processes
only play a minor role.
