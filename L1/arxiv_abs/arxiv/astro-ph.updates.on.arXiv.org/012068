A linear correlation has been proposed between the CO luminosity ($\rm{L}^{\prime}_{\rm{CO}}$)
and full-width at half maximum (FWHM) for high-redshift (z > 1) submillimeter galaxies. However,
the controversy concerning the $\rm{L}^{\prime}_{\rm{CO}}$-FWHM correlation seems to have
been caused by the use of heterogeneous samples (e.g., different transition lines) and/or data
with large measurement uncertainties. In order to avoid the uncertainty caused by using different
rotational transitions, in this work we make an extensive effort to select only CO($J = 1-0$) data
from the literature. We separate these wide-ranging redshift data into two samples : the low-redshift
(z < 1) and high-redshift (z > 1) samples. The samples are corrected for lensing magnification factors
if gravitational-lensing effects appeared in the observations. The correlation analysis shows
that there exists significant $\rm{L}^{\prime}_{\rm{CO}}$-FWHM correlations for both the low-redshift
and high-redshift samples. A comparison of the low- and high-redshift $\rm{L}^{\prime}_{\rm{CO}}$-FWHM
correlations does not show strong evolution with redshift. Assuming that there is no evolution,
we can use this relation to determine the model independent distances of high-redshift galaxies.
We then constrain cosmological models with the calibrated high-redshift CO data and the sample
of Type Ia supernovae in the Union 2.1 compilation. In the constraint for wCDM with our samples, the
derived values are w_{0} = -1.02 {\pm} 0.17, {\Omega}_{m0} = 0.30{\pm}0.02, and H_{0} = 70.00 {\pm}0.60
km\,s^{-1}\,Mpc^{-1}.
