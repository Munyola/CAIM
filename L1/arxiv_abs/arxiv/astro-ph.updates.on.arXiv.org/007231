Stellar surface rotation carries information about stellar parameters---particularly ages---and
thus the large rotational datasets extracted from Kepler timeseries represent powerful probes
of stellar populations. In this article, we address the challenge of interpreting such datasets
with a forward-modeling exercise. We combine theoretical models of stellar rotation, a stellar
population model for the galaxy, and prescriptions for observational bias and confusion to predict
the rotation distribution in the Kepler field under standard "vanilla" assumptions. We arrive
at two central conclusions: first, that standard braking models fail to reproduce the observed
distribution at long periods, and second, that the interpretation of the period distribution is
complicated by mixtures of unevolved and evolved stars and observational uncertainties. By assuming
that the amplitude and thus detectability of rotational signatures is tied to the Rossby number,
we show that the observed period distribution contains an apparent "Rossby edge" at $\textrm{Ro}_{thresh}
= 2.08$, above which long-period, high-Rossby number stars are either absent or undetected. This
$\textrm{Ro}_{thresh}$ is comparable to the Rossby number at which van Saders et al. (2016) observed
the onset of weakened magnetic braking, and suggests either that this modified braking is in operation
in the full Kepler population, or that stars undergo a transition in spottedness and activity at
a very similar Rossby number. We discuss the observations necessary to disentangle these competing
scenarios. (abridged)
