We present a new technique that allows us to compute ensemble statistics on a local basis, directly
relating halo properties to their local environment. This is achieved by the use of a correlated
ensemble in which the Large Scale Structure is common to all realizations while having each an independent
halo population. The correlated ensemble can be stacked, effectively increasing the halo number
density by an arbitrary factor, thus breaking the fundamental limit in the halo number density given
by the haloe mass function. This technique allows us to compute \textit{local ensemble statistics}
of the matter/haloe distribution at any position in the simulation box, while removing the intrinsic
stochasticity in the halo formation process and directly relating halo properties to their environment.
We introduce the \textit{Multum In Parvo} (MIP) correlated ensemble simulation consisting of
220 realizations on a 32 h$^{-1}$ Mpc box with $256^3$ particles each. This is equivalent in terms
of effective volume and number of particles to a box of $\sim 193$ h$^{-1}$ Mpc of side with $\sim 1540^3$
particles containing $\sim 5\times 10^6$ haloes with a minimum mass of $3.25 \times 10^9$ h$^{-1}$
M$_{\odot}$. The potential of the technique presented here is illustrated by computing the local
ensemble statistics of the halo ellipticity and halo shape-LSS alignment. We show that, while there
are general trends in the ellipticity and alignment of haloes with their LSS, there are also significant
spatial variations which has important implications for observational studies of galaxy shape
and alignment.
