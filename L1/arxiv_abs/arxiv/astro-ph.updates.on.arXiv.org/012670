LSST and Euclid must address the daunting challenge of analyzing the unprecedented volumes of imaging
and spectroscopic data that these next-generation instruments will generate. A promising approach
to overcoming this challenge involves rapid, automatic image processing using appropriately
trained Deep Learning (DL) algorithms. However, reliable application of DL requires large, accurately
labeled samples of training data. Galaxy Zoo Express (GZX) is a recent experiment that simulated
using Bayesian inference to dynamically aggregate binary responses provided by citizen scientists
via the Zooniverse crowd-sourcing platform in real time. The GZX approach enables collaboration
between human and machine classifiers and provides rapidly generated, reliably labeled datasets,
thereby enabling online training of accurate machine classifiers. We present selected results
from GZX and show how the Bayesian aggregation engine it uses can be extended to efficiently provide
object-localization and bounding-box annotations of two-dimensional data with quantified reliability.
DL algorithms that are trained using these annotations will facilitate numerous panchromatic
data modeling tasks including morphological classification and substructure detection in direct
imaging, as well as decontamination and emission line identification for slitless spectroscopy.
Effectively combining the speed of modern computational analyses with the human capacity to extrapolate
from few examples will be critical if the potential of forthcoming large-scale surveys is to be realized.
