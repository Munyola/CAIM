Our understanding of the brown dwarf population in star forming regions is dependent on knowing
distances and proper motions, and therefore will be improved through the Gaia space mission. In
this paper, we select new samples of very low mass objects (VLMOs) in Upper Scorpius using UKIDSS
colors and optimised proper motions calculated using Gaia DR1. The scatter in proper motions from
VLMOs in Upper Scorpius is now (for the first time) dominated by the kinematic spread of the region
itself, not by the positional uncertainties. With age and mass estimates updated using Gaia parallaxes
for early type stars in the same region, we determine masses for all VLMOs. Our final most complete
sample includes 453 VLMOs of which $\sim$125 are expected to be brown dwarfs. The cleanest sample
is comprised of 131 VLMOs, with $\sim$105 brown dwarfs. We also compile a joint sample from the literature
which includes 415 VLMOs, out of which 152 are likely brown dwarfs. The disc fraction among low-mass
brown dwarfs ($M<0.05 M_{\odot}$) is substantially higher than in more massive objects, indicating
that discs around low-mass brown dwarf survive longer than in low-mass stars overall. The mass function
for $0.01<M<0.1$ $M_{\odot}$ is consistent with the Kroupa IMF. We investigate the possibility
that some 'proper motion outliers' have undergone a dynamical ejection early in their evolution.
Our analysis shows that the color-magnitude cuts used when selecting samples introduce strong
bias into the population statistics due to varying level of contamination and completeness.
