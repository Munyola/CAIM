We investigate correlations induced by gravitational lensing on simulated cosmic microwave background
data of experiments with an incomplete sky coverage and their effect on inferences from the South
Pole Telescope data. These correlations agree well with the theoretical expectations, given by
the sum of super-sample and intra-sample lensing terms, with only a typically negligible $\sim$
5% discrepancy in the amplitude of the super-sample lensing effect. Including these effects we
find that lensing constraints are in $3.0\sigma$ or $2.1\sigma$ tension between the SPT polarization
measurements and Planck temperature or lensing reconstruction constraints respectively. If
the lensing-induced covariance effects are neglected, the significance of these tensions increases
to $3.5\sigma$ or $2.5\sigma$. Using the standard scaling parameter $A_L$ substantially underestimates
the significance of the tension once other parameters are marginalized over. By parameterizing
the super-sample lensing through the mean convergence in the SPT footprint, we find a hint of underdensity
in the SPT region. We also constrain extra sharpening of the CMB acoustic peaks due to missing smoothing
of the peaks by super-sample lenses at a level that is much smaller than the lens sample variance.
Finally, we extend the usual "shift in the means" statistic for evaluating tensions to non-Gaussian
posteriors, generalize an approach to extract correlation modes from noisy simulated covariance
matrices, and present a treatment of correlation modes not as data covariances but as auxiliary
model parameters.
