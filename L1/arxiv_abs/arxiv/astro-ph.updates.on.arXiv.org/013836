We study the destruction of interstellar dust via sputtering in supernova (SN) shocks using three-dimensional
hydrodynamical simulations. With a novel numerical framework, we follow both sputtering and dust
dynamics governed by direct collisions, plasma drag and betatron acceleration. Grain-grain collisions
are not included and the grain-size distribution is assumed to be fixed. The amount of dust destroyed
per SN is quantified for a broad range of ambient densities and fitting formulae are provided. Integrated
over the grain-size distribution, nonthermal (inertial) sputtering dominates over thermal sputtering
for typical ambient densities. We present the first simulations that explicitly follow dust sputtering
within a turbulent multiphase interstellar medium. We find that the dust destruction timescales
$\tau$ are 0.35 Gyr for silicate dust and 0.44 Gyr for carbon dust in solar neighborhood conditions.
The SN environment has an important impact on $\tau$. SNe that occur in preexisting bubbles destroy
less dust as the destruction is limited by the amount of dust in the shocked gas. This makes $\tau$
about 2.5 times longer than the estimate based on results from a single SN explosion. We investigate
the evolution of the dust-to-gas mass ratio (DGR), and find that a spatial inhomogeneity of $\sim$
14\% develops for scales below 10 pc. It locally correlates positively with gas density but negatively
with gas temperature even in the exterior of the bubbles due to incomplete gas mixing. This leads
to a $\sim$ 30\% lower DGR in the volume filling warm gas compared to that in the dense clouds.
