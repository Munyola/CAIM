Many astrochemical models today explicitly consider the species that comprise the bulk of interstellar
dust grain ice-mantles separately from those in the top few monolayers. Bombardment of these ices
by ionizing radiation - whether in the form of cosmic rays, stellar winds, or radionuclide emission
- represents an astrochemically viable means of driving a rich chemistry even in the bulk of the ice-mantle,
now supported by a large body of work in laboratory astrophysics. In this study, using an existing
rate equation-based astrochemical code modified to include a method of considering radiation
chemistry recently developed by us, we attempted to simulate two such studies in which (a) pure O$_2$
ice at 5 K and, (b) pure H$_2$O ice at 16 K and 77 K, were bombarded by keV H$^+$ ions. Our aims are twofold:
(1) to test the capability of our newly developed method to replicate the results of ice-irradiation
experiments, and (2) to determine in such a well-constrained system how bulk chemistry is best handled
using the same gas-grain codes that are used to model the interstellar medium (ISM). We find that
our modified astrochemical model is able to reproduce both the abundance of O$_3$ in the 5 K pure O$_2$
ice, as well as both the abundance of H$_2$O$_2$ in the 16 K water ice and the previously noted decrease
of hydrogen peroxide at higher temperatures. However, these results require the assumption that
radicals and other reactive species produced via radiolysis react quickly and non-diffusively
with neighbors in the ice.
