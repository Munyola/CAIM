We present a weak lensing analysis for galaxy clusters from the APEX-SZ survey. For $39$ massive
galaxy clusters that were observed via the Sunyaev-Zel\textquotesingle dovich effect (SZE) with
the APEX telescope, we analyse deep optical imaging data from WFI(@2.2mMPG/ESO) and Suprime-Cam(@SUBARU)
in three bands. The masses obtained in this study, including an X-ray selected subsample of 27 clusters,
are optimised for and used in studies constraining the mass to observable scaling relations at fixed
cosmology. A novel focus of our weak lensing analysis is the multi-colour background selection
to suppress effects of cosmic variance on the redshift distribution of source galaxies. We investigate
the effects of cluster member contamination through galaxy density, shear profile, and recovered
concentrations. We quantify the impact of variance in source redshift distribution on the mass
estimate by studying nine sub-fields of the COSMOS survey for different cluster redshift and manitude
limits. We measure a standard deviation of $\sim 6$\% on the mean angular diameter distance ratio
for a cluster at $z\!=\!0.45$ and shallow imaging data of $R\!\approx\!23$ mag. It falls to $\sim
1$\% for deep, $R=26$ mag, observations. This corresponds to 8.4\% and 1.4\% scatter in $M_{200}$.
Our background selection reduces this scatter by $20-40$\%, depending on cluster redshift and
imaging depth. We derived cluster masses with and without using a mass concentration relation and
find consistent results, and concentrations consistent with the used mass-concentration relation.
