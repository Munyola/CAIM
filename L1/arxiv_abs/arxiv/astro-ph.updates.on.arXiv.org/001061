A number of mechanisms have been proposed to connect star-forming dwarf irregular galaxies with
the formation of non-star-forming dwarf spheroidal galaxies, but distinguishing between these
mechanisms has been difficult. We use the Via Lactea dark matter only cosmological simulations
to test two well-motivated simple hypotheses---transformation of irregulars into dwarf spheroidal
galaxies by tidal stirring and ram pressure stripping following a close passage to the host galaxy,
and transformation via mergers between dwarfs---and predict the radial distribution and inferred
formation times of the resulting dwarf spheroidal galaxies. We compare this to the observed distribution
in the Local Group and show that 1) the observed dSph distribution far from the Galaxy or M31 can be
matched by the VL halos that have passed near the host galaxy at least once, though significant halo-to-halo
scatter exists, 2) models that require two or more pericenter passages for dSph-formation cannot
account for the dSphs beyond 500 kpc such as Cetus and Tucana, and 3) mergers predict a flat radial
distribution of dSphs and cannot account for the high dSph fraction near the Galaxy, but are not ruled
out at large distances. The models also suggest that for dSphs found today beyond 500 kpc, mergers
tend to occur significantly earlier than dwarf--host encounters, thus leading to a potentially
observable difference in stellar populations. We argue that tidal interactions are sufficient
to reproduce the observed distribution of dSphs if and only if a single pericenter passage is sufficient
to form a dSph.
