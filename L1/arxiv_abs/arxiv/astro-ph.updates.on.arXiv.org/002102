We present spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of 69 QSOs at z>5, covering a rest frame wavelength
range of 0.1mu to ~80mu, and centered on new Spitzer and Herschel observations. The detection rate
of the QSOs with Spitzer is very high (97% at lambda_rest ~< 4mu), but drops towards the Herschel
bands with 30% detected in PACS (rest frame mid-infrared) and 15% additionally in the SPIRE (rest
frame far-infrared; FIR). We perform multi-component SED fits for Herschel-detected objects
and confirm that to match the observed SEDs, a clumpy torus model needs to be complemented by a hot
(~1300K) component and, in cases with prominent FIR emission, also by a cold (~50K) component. In
the FIR detected cases the luminosity of the cold component is on the order of 10^13 L_sun which is
likely heated by star formation. From the SED fits we also determine that the AGN dust-to-accretion
disk luminosity ratio declines with UV/optical luminosity. Emission from hot (~1300K) dust is
common in our sample, showing that nuclear dust is ubiquitous in luminous QSOs out to redshift 6.
However, about 15% of the objects appear under-luminous in the near infrared compared to their optical
emission and seem to be deficient in (but not devoid of) hot dust. Within our full sample, the QSOs
detected with Herschel are found at the high luminosity end in L_UV/opt and L_NIR and show low equivalent
widths (EWs) in H_alpha and in Ly_alpha. In the distribution of H_alpha EWs, as determined from the
Spitzer photometry, the high-redshift QSOs show little difference to low redshift AGN.
