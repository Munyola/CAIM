Context: In protoplanetary disks, dust grains coagulate with each other and grow to form aggregates.
As these aggregates grow by coagulation, their filling factor \phi decreases down to \phi <<
1. However, comets, the remnants of these early planetesimals, have \phi ~ 0.1. Thus, static compression
of porous dust aggregates is important in planetesimal formation. However, the static compression
strength has been investigated only for relatively high density aggregates (\phi > 0.1). Aims:
We investigate and find the compression strength of highly porous aggregates (\phi << 1).
Methods: We perform three dimensional N-body simulations of aggregate compression with a particle-particle
interaction model. We introduce a new method of static compression: the periodic boundary condition
is adopted and the boundaries move with low speed to get closer. The dust aggregate is compressed
uniformly and isotropically by themselves over the periodic boundaries. Results: We empirically
derive a formula of the compression strength of highly porous aggregates (\phi << 1). We check
the validity of the compression strength formula for wide ranges of numerical parameters, such
as the size of initial aggregates, the boundary speed, the normal damping force, and material. We
also compare our results to the previous studies of static compression in the relatively high density
region (\phi > 0.1) and confirm that our results consistently connect to those in the high density
region. The compression strength formula is also derived analytically.
