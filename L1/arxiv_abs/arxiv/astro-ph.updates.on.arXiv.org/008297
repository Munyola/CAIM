Observational detection of quasi-periodic drifting fine structures in a type III radio burst associated
with a solar flare SOL2015-04-16T11:22, with Low Frequency Array, is presented. Although similar
modulations of the type III emission have been observed before and were associated with the plasma
density fluctuations, the origin of those fluctuations was unknown. Analysis of the striae of the
intensity variation in the dynamic spectrum allowed us to reveal two quasi-oscillatory components.
The shorter component has the apparent wavelength of $\sim2$ Mm, phase speed of $\sim657$ km s$^{-1}$,
which gives the oscillation period of $\sim3$ s, and the relative amplitude of $\sim0.35$%. The
longer component has the wavelength of $\sim12$ Mm, and relative amplitude of $\sim5.1$%. The short
frequency range of the detection does not allow us to estimate its phase speed. However, the properties
of the shorter oscillatory component allowed us to interpret it as a fast magnetoacoustic wave guided
by a plasma non-uniformity along the magnetic field outwards from the Sun. The assumption that the
intensity of the radio emission is proportional to the amount of plasma in the emitting volume allowed
us to show that the superposition of the plasma density modulation by a fast wave and a longer-wavelength
oscillation of an unspecified nature could readily reproduce the fine structure of the observed
dynamic spectrum. The observed parameters of the fast wave give the absolute value of the magnetic
field in the emitting plasma of $\sim1.1$ G which is consistent with the radial magnetic field model.
