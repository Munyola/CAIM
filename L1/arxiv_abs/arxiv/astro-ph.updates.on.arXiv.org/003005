We aim to investigate the polarization properties of a starless core in a very early evolutionary
stage. Linear polarization data reveal the properties of the dust grains in the distinct phases
of the interstellar medium. Our goal is to investigate how the polarization degree and angle correlate
with the cloud and core gas. We use optical, near infrared and submillimeter polarization observations
toward the starless object Pipe-109 in the Pipe nebula. Our data cover a physical scale range of 0.08
to 0.4 pc, comprising the dense gas, envelope and the surrounding cloud. The cloud polarization
is well traced by the optical data. The near infrared polarization is produced by a mixed population
of grains from the core border and the cloud gas. The optical and near infrared polarization toward
the cloud reach the maximum possible value and saturate with respect to the visual extinction. The
core polarization is predominantly traced by the submillimeter data and have a steep decrease with
respect to the visual extinction. Modeling of the submillimeter polarization indicates a magnetic
field main direction projected onto the plane-of-sky and loss of grain alignment for densities
higher than $6\times10^4$ cm$^{-3}$ (or $A_V > 30$ mag). Pipe-109 is immersed in a magnetized
medium, with a very ordered magnetic field. The absence of internal source of radiation significantly
affects the polarization efficiencies in the core, creating a polarization hole at the center of
the starless core. This result supports the theory of dust grain alignment via radiative torques.
