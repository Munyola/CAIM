The last seven years have seen an explosion in the number of Integral Field galaxy surveys, obtaining
resolved 2D spectroscopy, especially at high-redshift. These have taken advantage of the mature
capabilities of 8-10 m class telescopes and the development of associated technology such as AO.
Surveys have leveraged both high spectroscopic resolution enabling internal velocity measurements
and high spatial resolution from AO techniques and sites with excellent natural seeing. For the
first time, we have been able to glimpse the kinematic state of matter in young, assembling star-forming
galaxies and learn detailed astrophysical information about the physical processes and compare
their kinematic scaling relations with those in the local Universe. Observers have measured disc
galaxy rotation, merger signatures, and turbulence-enhanced velocity dispersions of gas-rich
discs. Theorists have interpreted kinematic signatures of galaxies in a variety of ways (rotation,
merging, outflows, and feedback) and attempted to discuss evolution vs. theoretical models and
relate it to the evolution in galaxy morphology. A key point that has emerged from this activity is
that substantial fractions of high-redshift galaxies have regular kinematic morphologies despite
irregular photometric morphologies and this is likely due to the presence of a large number of highly
gas-rich discs. There has not yet been a review of this burgeoning topic. In this first Dawes review,
I will discuss the extensive kinematic surveys that have been done and the physical models that have
arisen for young galaxies at high-redshift.
