Departures of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) frequency spectrum from a blackbody - commonly
referred to as spectral distortions - encode information about the thermal history of the early
Universe (redshift z < few x 10^6). While the signal is usually characterized as mu- and y-type
distortion, a smaller residual (non-y/non-mu) distortion can also be created at intermediate
redshifts 10^4 < z < 3 x 10^5. Here, we construct a new set of observables, mu_k, that describes
the principal components of this residual distortion. The principal components are orthogonal
to temperature shift, y- and mu-type distortion, and ranked by their detectability, thereby delivering
a compression of all valuable information offered by the CMB spectrum. This method provides an efficient
way of analyzing the spectral distortion for given experimental settings, and can be applied to
a wide range of energy-release scenarios. As an illustration, we discuss the analysis of the spectral
distortion signatures caused by dissipation of small-scale acoustic waves and decaying/annihilating
particles for a PIXIE-type experiments. We provide forecasts for the expected measurement uncertainties
of model parameters and detections limits in each case. We furthermore show that a PIXIE-type experiments
can in principle distinguish dissipative energy release from particle decays for a nearly scale-invariant
primordial power spectrum with small running. Future CMB spectroscopy thus offers a unique probe
of physical processes in the primordial Universe.
