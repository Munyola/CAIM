In a standard cold dark matter (CDM) cosmology, microhalos at the CDM cutoff scale are the first and
smallest objects expected to form in the universe. Here we present results of high resolution simulations
of three representative roughly Earth-mass microhalos in order to determine their inner density
profile. We find that CDM microhalos in simulations without a cutoff in the power spectrum roughly
follow the NFW density profile, just like the much larger CDM halos on galaxy and galaxy cluster scales.
But having a cutoff in the initial power spectrum at a typical neutralino free streaming scale of
$10^{-7} M_{\odot}$ makes their inner density profiles considerably steeper, i.e. $\rho \propto
r^{-(1.3-1.4)}$, in good agreement with the results from Ishiyama et al. (2010). An extrapolation
of the halo and subhalo mass functions down to the cutoff scale indicates that microhalos are extremely
abundant throughout the present day dark matter distribution and might contribute significantly
to indirect dark matter detection signals. Assuming a transition from a NFW to a steeper inner profile
($\rho \propto r^{-1.4}$) two orders of magnitude above the cutoff scale, the total boost factor
for a Milky Way sized dark matter halo increases from about 3.5 to 4. We further find that CDM microhalo
concentrations are consistent with the Bullock et al. (2001) model and clearly rule out simplistic
power law models for the mass dependence of concentrations and subhalo annihilation, which would
erroneously lead to very large boost factors (a few hundred for galaxy halos and over 1000 for clusters).
