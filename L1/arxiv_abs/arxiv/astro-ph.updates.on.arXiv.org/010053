This paper presents our observational attempts to precisely measure the central mass of a proto-brown
dwarf candidate, L328-IRS, in order to investigate whether L328-IRS is in the substellar mass regime.
Observations were made for the central region of L328-IRS with the dust continuum and CO isotopologue
line emission at ALMA band 6, discovering the detailed outflow activities and a deconvolved disk
structure of a size of $\sim$87 AU $\times$ 37 AU. We investigated the rotational velocities as a
function of the disk radius, finding that its motions between 130 AU and 60 AU are partially fitted
with a Keplerian orbit by a stellar object of $\sim0.30 ~\rm\,M_\odot$, while the motions within
60 AU do not follow any Keplerian orbit at all. This makes it difficult to lead a reliable estimation
of the mass of L328-IRS. Nonetheless, our ALMA observations were useful enough to well constrain
the inclination angle of the outflow cavity of L328-IRS as $\sim 66^{\circ}$, enabling us to better
determine the mass accretion rate of $\sim 8.9\times 10^{-7} \rm\,M_\odot~yr^{-1}$. From assumptions
that the internal luminosity of L328-IRS is mostly due to this mass accretion process in the disk,
or that L328-IRS has mostly accumulated the mass through this constant accretion rate during its
outflow activity, its mass was estimated to be $\sim 0.012 - 0.023\rm\,M_\odot$, suggesting L328-IRS
to be a substellar object. However, we leave our identification of L328-IRS as a proto-brown dwarf
to be tentative because of various uncertainties especially regarding the mass accretion rate.
