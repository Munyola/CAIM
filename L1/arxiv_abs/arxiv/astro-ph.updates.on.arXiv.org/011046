The equation of state for a free gas of fermions at zero temperature in the non relativistic case is
a polytrope, i.e. $p=\gamma \rho^{5/3}/m_F^{8/3}$. If dark matter is modelled by such non interacting
fermion, this dependence in the mass of the fermion $m_F$ explains why if dark matter is very heavy
the effective pressure of dark matter is negligible. Nevertheless, if the mass of the dark matter
is very small, the effective pressure can be very large, and thus, a system of self-gravitating fermions
can be formed. By solving the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkov equations, it is found the self-gravitating
object with the equation of state for a ultralight non interacting fermion. It is found that the resulting
self-gravitating objects have radii of some kiloparsecs and masses of the order of $\sim 10^{11}\mbox{M}_\odot$,
and thus, they might be used to describe dark matter halos. In this work we model the dark matter halo
of the Milky-Way and it is found that in order to fit its rotational velocity curve the mass of the fermion
should be in the range $75 ~\mbox{eV} < m_F < 104 ~$eV. Moreover, the central density is in the range
of $0.22<\rho_0<.45$ GeV/cm$^3$. The fermionic dark matter halo has a very different profile as
compared with the standard Navarro-Frenk-White profile, thus, the possible indirect signals
for annihilating dark matter may change by orders of magnitude. We found bounds for the annihilation
cross section in this case by using the Saggitarius A* spectral energy distribution. Limits are
very strong confirming the idea that the lightest the dark matter particle is, the darkest becomes.
