We present $J$-band near-infrared (NIR) imaging of the host galaxies of nine narrow-line Seyfert
1 galaxies (NLS1). Based on high-frequency radio observations at 37~GHz, seven of them could host
powerful, most likely relativistic jets. Host galaxy morphology studies of NLS1 galaxies are scarce,
but exceedingly important for understanding the seemingly heterogeneous nature of the NLS1 population
as well as their evolution and place in the active galactic nuclei (AGN) scheme. Increasing the sample
size is essential for achieving statistically significant results. We determine the morphological
types of the host galaxies by performing photometric decomposition of NIR images using a 2D image
decomposition algorithm GALFIT. We were able to sufficiently model five of the nine host galaxies.
Based on the fitting parameters, mainly the S\'{e}rsic index, all of them are disk-like galaxies.
Sources with clearly distinguishable bulge components all have pseudo-bulges, and four out of
five sources show a component resembling a bar. A surprisingly large fraction, three out of five,
show signs of interaction or disturbed morphology. Our results suggest that spiral galaxies with
pseudo-bulges are able to launch and maintain powerful jets. They also imply that interaction -
mainly minor mergers - may have a role in initially triggering higher levels of nuclear activity
in NLS1 galaxies. Furthermore, our results support the heterogeneous nature of the NLS1 class and
indicate that this diversity is caused by different evolutionary stages, possibly due to mergers.
