We propose a novel beam model for radio pulsars based on the scenario that the broadband and coherent
emission from secondary relativistic particles, as they move along a flux tube in a dipolar magnetic
field, forms a radially extended sub-beam with unique properties. The whole radio beam may consist
of several sub-beams, forming a fan-shaped pattern. When only one or a few flux tubes are active,
the fan beam becomes very patchy. This model differs essentially from the conal beam models in the
respects of beam structure and predictions on the relationship between pulse width and impact angle
$\beta$ (the angle between line of sight and magnetic pole) and the relationship between emission
intensity and beam angular radius. The evidence for this model comes from the observed patchy beams
of precessional binary pulsars and three statistical relationships found for a sample of 64 pulsars,
of which $\beta$ were mostly constrained by fitting polarization position angle data with the Rotation
Vector Model. With appropriate assumptions, the fan beam model can reproduce the relationship
between 10\% peak pulse width and $|\beta|$, the anticorrelation between the emission intensity
and $|\beta|$, and the upper boundary line in the scatter plot of $|\beta|$ versus pulsar distance.
An extremely patchy beam model with the assumption of narrowband emission from one or a few flux tubes
is studied and found unlikely to be a general model. The implications of the fan beam model to the studies
on radio and gamma-ray pulsar populations and radio polarization are discussed.
