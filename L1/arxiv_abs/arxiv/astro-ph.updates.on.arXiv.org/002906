We have observed a sample of typical z=1 star forming galaxies, selected from the HiZELS survey,
with the new KMOS near-infrared, multi-IFU instrument on the VLT, in order to obtain their dynamics
and metallicity gradients. The majority of our galaxies have a metallicity gradient consistent
with being flat or negative (i.e. higher metallicity cores than outskirts). Intriguingly, we find
a trend between metallicity gradient and specific star formation rate (sSFR), such that galaxies
with a high sSFR tend to have relatively metal-poor centres, a result which is strengthened when
combined with datasets from the literature. This result appears to explain the discrepancies reported
between different high redshift studies and varying claims for evolution. From a galaxy evolution
perspective, the trend we see would mean that a galaxy's sSFR is governed by the amount of metal poor
gas that can be funnelled into its core, triggered either by merging or through efficient accretion.
In fact merging may play a significant role as it is the starburst galaxies at all epochs, which have
the more positive metallicity gradients. Our results may help to explain the origin of the fundamental
metallicity relation, in which galaxies at a fixed mass are observed to have lower metallicities
at higher star formation rates, especially if the metallicity is measured in an aperture encompassing
only the central regions of the galaxy. Finally, we note that this study demonstrates the power of
KMOS as an efficient instrument for large scale resolved galaxy surveys.
