Rapidly rotating stars have been recently recognized as having a major role in the interpretation
of colour-magnitude diagrams of young and intermediate-age star clusters in the Magellanic Clouds
and in the Milky Way. In this work, we evaluate the distinctive spectra and distributions in colour-colour
space that follow from the presence of a substantial range in effective temperatures across the
surface of fast rotators. The calculations are inserted in a formalism similar to the one usually
adopted for non-rotating stars, which allows us to derive tables of bolometric corrections as a
function not only of a reference effective temperature, surface gravity and metallicity, but also
of the rotational speed with respect to the break-up value, $\omega$, and the inclination angle,
$i$. We find that only very fast rotators ($\omega>0.95$) observed nearly equator-on ($i>45^\circ$)
present sizable deviations from the colour-colour relations of non-rotating stars. In light of
these results, we discuss the photometry of the $\sim$ 200-Myr-old cluster NGC 1866 and its split
main sequence, which has been attributed to the simultaneous presence of slow and fast rotators.
The small dispersion of its stars in colour-colour diagrams allow us to conclude that fast rotators
in this cluster either have rotational velocities $\omega<0.95$, or are all observed nearly pole-on.
Such geometric colour-colour effects, although small, might be potentially detectable in the
huge, high-quality photometric samples in the post-Gaia era, in addition to the evolutionary effects
caused by rotation-induced mixing.
