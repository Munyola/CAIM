Be stars exhibit variability for a great number of observables. Putting the pieces together of the
disk dynamics is not an easy task and requires arduous modeling before achieving a good fit of the
observational data. In order to guide the modeling process and make it more efficient, it is very
instructive to investigate reference dynamical cases. This paper focuses on continuum polarimetric
quantities and is the second of a series that aims to demonstrate the capacity of deriving the dynamical
history and fundamental parameters of a classical Be star through the follow-up of various observables.
After a detailed study of the different opacities at play in the formation of polarized spectra,
we investigate predictions of polarimetric observables in the continuum for different dynamical
scenarios. Our models are based on a coupling of a hydrodynamic viscous decretion simulations in
a disk and a 3-D non-LTE radiative transfer code. Introducing the polarization color diagram (PCD),
we show that certain combinations of polarimetric observables exhibit features that are characteristic
of a mass loss history. This diagram also enables to estimate fundamental parameters such as the
inclination angle, the disk density scale and the $\alpha$ viscous diffusion parameter. We present
the PCD as a powerful diagnosis tool to track the dynamical phases of a Be star such as disk building-up,
dissipation, periodic and episodic outbursts. Finally we confront our models with observations
of 4 Be stars that exhibited long-term polarimetric activity.
