Cratering on small bodies is crucial for the collision cascade and also contributes to the ejection
of dust particles into interplanetary space. A crater cavity forms against the mechanical strength
of the surface, gravitational acceleration, or both. The formation of moderately sized craters
that are sufficiently larger than the thickness of the regolith on small bodies, in which mechanical
strength plays the dominant role rather than gravitational acceleration, is in the strength regime.
The formation of microcraters on blocks on the surface is also within the strength regime. On the
other hand, the formation of a crater of a size comparable to the thickness of the regolith is affected
by both gravitational acceleration and cohesion between regolith particles. In this short review,
we compile data from the literature pertaining to impact cratering experiments on porous targets,
and summarize the ratio of spall diameter to pit diameter, the depth, diameter, and volume of the
crater cavity, and the ratio of depth to diameter. Among targets with various porosities studied
in the laboratory to date, based on conventional scaling laws (Holsapple and Schmidt, J. Geophys.
Res., 87, 1849-1870, 1982) the cratering efficiency obtained for porous sedimentary rocks (Suzuki
et al., J. Geophys. Res. 117, E08012, 2012) is intermediate. A comparison with microcraters formed
on a glass target with impact velocities up to 14 $km s^{-1}$ indicates a different dependence of
cratering efficiency and depth-to-diameter ratio on impact velocity.
