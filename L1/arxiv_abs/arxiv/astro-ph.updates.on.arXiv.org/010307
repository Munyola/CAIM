It is of broad interest for galaxy formation theory to carry out a full inventory of the numbers and
properties of dwarf galaxies in the Local Volume, both satellites and isolated ones. Ultra-deep
imaging in wide areas of the sky with small amateur telescopes can help to complete the census of these
hitherto unknown low surface brightness galaxies, which cannot be detected by the current resolved
stellar population and HI surveys. We report the discovery of Donatiello I, a dwarf spheroidal galaxy
located one degree from the star Mirach (Beta And) in a deep image taken with an amateur telescope.
The color--magnitude diagram obtained from follow-up observations obtained with the Gran Telescopio
Canarias (La Palma, Spain) reveals that this system is beyond the Local Group and is mainly composed
of old stars. The absence of young stars and HI emission in the ALFALFA survey are typical of quenched
dwarf galaxies. Our photometry suggests a distance modulus for this galaxy of (m-M)=27.6 +/- 0.2
(3.3 Mpc), although this distance cannot yet be established securely owing to the crowding effects
in our color--magnitude diagram. At this distance, Donatiello I's absolute magnitude (M_v =-8.3),
surface brightness (mu_v=26.5 mag arcsec^-2) and stellar content are similar to the "classical"
Milky Way companions Draco or Ursa Minor. The projected position and distance of Donatiello I are
consistent with being a dwarf satellite of the closest S0-type galaxy NGC 404 ("Mirach's Ghost").
Alternatively, it could be one of the most isolated quenched dwarf galaxies reported so far behind
the Andromeda galaxy.
