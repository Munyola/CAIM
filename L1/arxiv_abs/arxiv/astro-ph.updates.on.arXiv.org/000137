We present a study of SN 2009js in NGC 918. Multi-band Kanata optical photometry covering the first
~120 days show the source to be a Type IIP SN. Reddening is dominated by that due to our Galaxy. One-year-post-explosion
photometry with the NTT, and a Subaru optical spectrum 16 days post-discovery, both imply a good
match with the well-studied subluminous SN 2005cs. The plateau phase luminosity of SN 2009js and
its plateau duration are more similar to the intermediate luminosity IIP SN 2008in. Thus, SN 2009js
shares characteristics with both subluminous and intermediate luminosity SNe. Its radioactive
tail luminosity lies between SN 2005cs and SN 2008in, whereas its quasi-bolometric luminosity
decline from peak to plateau (quantified by a newly-defined parameter Delta[logL] measuring adiabatic
cooling following shock breakout) is much smaller than both the others. We estimate the ejected
mass of 56Ni to be low (~0.007 Msun). The SN explosion energy appears to have been small, similar to
SN 2005cs. SN 2009js is the first subluminous SN IIP to be studied in the mid-infrared. It was serendipitously
caught by Spitzer at very early times. In addition, it was detected by WISE 105 days later with a significant
4.6 micron flux excess above the photosphere. The infrared excess luminosity relative to the photosphere
is clearly smaller than that of SN 2004dj extensively studied in the mid-infrared. The excess may
be tentatively assigned to heated dust with mass ~3e-5 Msun, or to CO fundamental emission as a precursor
to dust formation.
