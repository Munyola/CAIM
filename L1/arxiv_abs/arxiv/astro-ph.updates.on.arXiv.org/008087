We present optical long-slit spectroscopy and far-ultraviolet to near-infrared spectral energy
distribution fitting of two diffuse dwarf galaxies, LSBG-285 and LSBG-750, which were recently
discovered by the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program (HSC-SSP). We measure redshifts
using H$\alpha$ line emission, and find that these galaxies are at comoving distances of ${\approx}25$
and ${\approx}41$ Mpc, respectively, after correcting for the local velocity field. They have
effective radii of $r_\mathrm{eff}=1.2$ and 1.8 kpc and stellar masses of $M_\star\approx2$-$3\times10^{7}~M_\odot$.
There are no massive galaxies ($M_\star>10^{10} M_\odot$) within a comoving separation of at least
1.5 Mpc from LSBG-285 and 2 Mpc from LSBG-750. These sources are similar in size and surface brightness
to ultra-diffuse galaxies, except they are isolated, star-forming objects that were optically
selected in an environmentally blind survey. Both galaxies likely have low stellar metallicities
$[Z_\star/Z_\odot] < -1.0$ and are consistent with the stellar mass-metallicity relation for
dwarf galaxies. We set an upper limit on LSBG-750's rotational velocity of ${\sim}50$ km s$^{-1}$,
which is comparable to dwarf galaxies of similar stellar mass with estimated halo masses $<10^{11}~M_\odot$.
We find tentative evidence that the gas-phase metallicities in both of these diffuse systems are
high for their stellar mass, though a statistically complete, optically-selected galaxy sample
at very low surface brightness will be necessary to place these results into context with the higher-surface-brightness
galaxy population.
