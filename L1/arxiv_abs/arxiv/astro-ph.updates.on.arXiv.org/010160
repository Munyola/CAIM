We report on the discovery of a merger-driven starburst at z = 1.52, PACS-787, based on high signal-to-noise
ALMA observations. CO(5-4) and continuum emission (850um) at a spatial resolution of 0.3" reveal
two compact (r_1/2 ~ 1 kpc) and interacting molecular gas disks at a separation of 8.6 kpc thus indicative
of an early stage in a merger. With a SFR of 991 Msun/yr, this starburst event should occur closer to
final coalescence, as usually seen in hydrodynamical simulations. From the CO size, inclination,
and velocity profile for both disks, the dynamical mass is calculated through a novel method that
incorporates a calibration using simulations of galaxy mergers. Based on the dynamical mass, we
measure (1) the molecular gas mass, independent from the CO luminosity, (2) the ratio of the total
gas mass and the CO(1 - 0) luminosity (alpha_CO = M_gas/L'_CO(1-0)), and (3) the gas-to-dust ratio,
with the latter two being lower than typically assumed. We find that the high star formation, triggered
in both galaxies, is caused by a set of optimal conditions: a high gas mass/fraction, a short depletion
time (t_depl=85 and 67 Myrs) to convert gas into stars, and the interaction of likely counter-rotating
molecular disks that may accelerate the loss of angular momentum. The state of interaction is further
established by the detection of diffuse CO and continuum emission, tidal debris that bridges the
two nuclei and is associated with stellar emission seen by HST/WFC3. This observation demonstrates
the power of ALMA to study the dynamics of galaxy mergers at high redshift.
