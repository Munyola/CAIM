We present 870 $\mu$m ALMA observations of polarized dust emission toward the Class II protoplanetary
disk IM Lup. We find that the orientation of the polarized emission is along the minor axis of the disk,
and that the value of the polarization fraction increases steadily toward the center of the disk,
reaching a peak value of ~1.1%. All of these characteristics are consistent with models of self-scattering
of submillimeter-wave emission from an optically thin inclined disk. The distribution of the polarization
position angles across the disk reveals that while the average orientation is along the minor axis,
the polarization orientations show a significant spread in angles; this can also be explained by
models of pure scattering. We compare the polarization with that of the Class I/II source HL Tau.
A comparison of cuts of the polarization fraction across the major and minor axes of both sources
reveals that IM Lup has a substantially higher polarization fraction than HL Tau toward the center
of the disk. This enhanced polarization fraction could be due a number of factors, including higher
optical depth in HL Tau, or scattering by larger dust grains in the more evolved IM Lup disk. However,
models yield similar maximum grain sizes for both HL Tau (72 $\mu$m) and IM Lup (61 $\mu$m, this work).
This reveals continued tension between grain-size estimates from scattering models and from models
of the dust emission spectrum, which find that the bulk of the (unpolarized) emission in disks is
most likely due to millimeter (or even centimeter) sized grains.
