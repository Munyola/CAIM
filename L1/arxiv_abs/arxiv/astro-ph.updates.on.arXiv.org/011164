We present new ${}^{12}$CO(J=1-0) observations of Henize 2-10, a blue compact dwarf galaxy about
8.7 Mpc away, taken with the Atacama Large Millimeter Array. These are the highest spatial and spectral
resolution observations, to date, of the molecular gas in this starburst galaxy. We measure a molecular
mass of $1.2\times10^8 M_\odot$ in Henize 2-10, and most of the molecular gas is contained within
a region having a size of about 310 pc. We use the CPROPS algorithm to identify 119 resolved giant molecular
clouds distributed throughout the galaxy, and the molecular gas contained within these clouds
make up between 45 to 70% of the total molecular mass. The molecular clouds in Henize 2-10 have similar
median sizes (~26 pc), luminous masses (~$ 4\times 10^5$ $M_\odot$), and surface densities (~$180$
$M_\odot$ pc$^{-2}$) to Milky Way clouds. We provide evidence that Henize 2-10 clouds tend to be
in virial equilibrium, with the virial and luminous masses scaling according to $M_{vir}\propto
M_{lum}^{1.2\pm0.1}$, similar to clouds in the Milky Way. However, we measure a scaling relationship
between luminous mass and size, $M_{vir}\propto R^{3.0\pm0.3}$, that is steeper than what is observed
in Milky Way clouds. Assuming Henize 2-10 molecular clouds are virialized, we infer values of the
CO-to-H$_2$ conversion factor ranging from 0.5 to 13 times the standard value in the Solar Neighborhood.
Given star formation efficiencies as low as 5%, the most massive molecular clouds in Henize 2-10
currently have enough mass to form the next generation of super-star clusters in the galaxy.
