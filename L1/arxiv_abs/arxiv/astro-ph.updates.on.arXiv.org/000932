We investigate the formation process of self-gravitating protoplanetary disks in unmagnetized
molecular clouds. The angular momentum is redistributed by the action of gravitational torques
in the massive disk during its early formation. We develop a simplified one-dimensional accretion
disk model that takes into account the infall of gas from the envelope onto the disk and the transfer
of angular momentum in the disk with an effective viscosity. First we evaluate the gas accretion
rate from the cloud core onto the disk by approximately estimating the effects of gas pressure and
gravity acting on the cloud core. We formulate the effective viscosity as a function of the Toomre
Q parameter that measures the local gravitational stability of the rotating thin disk. We use a function
for viscosity that changes sensitively with Q when the disk is gravitationally unstable. We find
a strong self-regulation mechanism in the disk evolution. During the formation stage of protoplanetary
disks, the evolution of the surface density does not depend on the other details of the modeling of
effective viscosity, such as the prefactor of the viscosity coefficient. Next, to verify our model,
we compare the time evolution of the disk calculated with our formulation with that of three-dimensional
hydrodynamical simulations. The structures of the resultant disks from the one-dimensional accretion
disk model agree well with those of the three-dimensional simulations. Our model is a useful tool
for the further modeling of chemistry, radiative transfer, and planet formation in protoplanetary
disks.
