We present here the characterization of the main properties of a sample of 98 AGN host galaxies, both
type-II and type-I, in comparison with those of about 2700 non-active galaxies observed by the MaNGA
survey. We found that AGN hosts are morphologically early-type or early-spirals. For a given morphology
AGN hosts are, in average, more massive, more compact, more central peaked and rather pressurethan
rotational-supported systems. We confirm previous results indicating that AGN hosts are located
in the intermediate/transition region between star-forming and non-star-forming galaxies (i.e.,
the so-called green valley), both in the ColorMagnitude and the star formation main sequence diagrams.
Taking into account their relative distribution in terms of the stellar metallicity and oxygen
gas abundance and a rough estimation of their molecular gas content, we consider that these galaxies
are in the process of halting/quenching the star formation, in an actual transition between both
groups. The analysis of the radial distributions of the starformation rate, specific star-formation
rate, and molecular gas density shows that the quenching happens from inside-out involving both
a decrease of the efficiency of the star formation and a deficit of molecular gas. All the intermediate
data-products used to derive the results of our analysis are distributed in a database including
the spatial distribution and average properties of the stellar populations and ionized gas, published
as a Sloan Digital Sky Survey Value Added Catalog being part of the 14th Data Release: this http URL
