We study the properties of the central spheroids located within 10 kpc of the centre of mass of Milky
Way mass-sized galaxies simulated in a cosmological context. The simulated central regions are
dominated by stars older than 10 Gyr, mostly formed in situ, with a contribution of ~30 per cent from
accreted stars. These stars formed in well-defined starbursts, although accreted stars exhibit
sharper and earlier ones. The fraction of accreted stars increases with galactocentric distance,
so that at a radius of ~8-10 kpc a fraction of ~40 per cent, on average, are detected. Accreted stars
are slightly younger, lower metallicity, and more $\alpha$-enhanced than in situ stars. A significant
fraction of old stars in the central regions come from a few ($2-3$) massive satellites ($\sim 10^{10}{\rm
M}_\odot$). The bulge components receive larger contributions of accreted stars formed in dwarfs
smaller than $\sim 10^{9.5}{\rm M}_\odot$. The difference between the distributions of ages and
metallicities of old stars is thus linked to the accretion histories -- those central regions with
a larger fraction of accreted stars are those with contributions from more massive satellites.
The kinematical properties of in situ and accreted stars are consistent with the latter being supported
by their velocity dispersions, while the former exhibit clear signatures of rotational support.
Our simulations demonstrate a range of characteristics, with some systems exhibiting a co-existing
bar and spheroid in their central regions, resembling in some respect the central region of the Milky
Way.
