We investigate the abundance, small-scale clustering and galaxy-galaxy lensing signal of galaxies
in the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS). To this end, we present new measurements
of the redshift and stellar mass dependence of the lensing properties of the galaxy sample. We analyse
to what extent models assuming the Planck18 cosmology fit to the number density and clustering can
accurately predict the small-scale lensing signal. In qualitative agreement with previous BOSS
studies at redshift $z \sim 0.5$ and with results from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, we find that the
expected signal at small scales ($0.1 < r_{\rm p} < 3 \, h^{-1} \mathrm{Mpc}$) is higher by $\sim 25\%$
than what is measured. Here, we show that this result is persistent over the redshift range $0.1 <
z < 0.7$ and for galaxies of different stellar masses. If interpreted as evidence for cosmological
parameters different from the Planck CMB findings, our results imply $S_8 = \sigma_8 \sqrt{\Omega_{\rm
m} / 0.3} = 0.744 \pm 0.015$, whereas $S_8 = 0.832 \pm 0.013$ for Planck18. However, in addition to
being in tension with CMB results, such a change in cosmology alone does not accurately predict the
lensing amplitude at larger scales. Instead, other often neglected systematics like baryonic
feedback or assembly bias are likely contributing to the small-scale lensing discrepancy. We show
that either effect alone, though, is unlikely to completely resolve the tension. Ultimately, a
combination of the two effects in combination with a moderate change in cosmological parameters
might be needed.
