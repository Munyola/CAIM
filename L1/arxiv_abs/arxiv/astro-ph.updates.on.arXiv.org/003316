We have performed our data analysis of the observations by Swift and Fermi satellites in order to
probe the induced gravitational collapse (IGC) paradigm for GRBs associated with supernovae (SNe),
in the "terra incognita" of GRB 130427A. We compare and contrast our data analysis with those in the
literature. We have verified that the GRB 130427A conforms to the IGC paradigm by examining the power
law behavior of the luminosity in the early $10^4$ s of the Swift-XRT observations. This has led to
the successful prediction of the occurrence of SN 2013cq and to the identification of the four different
episodes of the "binary driven hypernovae" (BdHNe). The exceptional quality of the data has allowed
the identification of novel features in Episode 3 including: a) the confirmation and the extension
of the existence of the recently discovered "nested structure" in the late X-ray luminosity in GRB
130427A, as well as the identification of a spiky structure at $10^2$ s in the cosmological rest-frame
of the source; b) a power law emission of the GeV luminosity light curve and its onset at the end of Episode
2 c) different Lorentz $\Gamma$ factors for the emitting regions of the X-ray and GeV emissions in
this Episode 3. These results make it possible to test the details of the physical and astrophysical
regimes at work in the BdHNe: 1) a newly born neutron star and the supernova ejecta, originating in
Episode 1, 2) a newly formed black hole originating in Episode 2, and 3) the possible interaction
among these components, observable in the standard features of Episode 3.
