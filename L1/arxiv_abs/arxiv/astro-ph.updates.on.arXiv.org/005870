Nearby type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), such as SN 2017cbv, are useful events to address the question
of what the elusive progenitor systems of the explosions are. Hosseinzadeh et al. (2017) suggested
that the early blue excess of the lightcurve of SN 2017cbv could be due to the supernova ejecta interacting
with a non-degenerate companion star. Some SN Ia progenitor models suggest the existence of circumstellar
(CS) environments in which strong outflows create low density cavities of different radii. Matter
deposited at the edges of the cavities, should be at distances at which photoionisation due to early
ultraviolet (UV) radiation of SNe Ia causes detectable changes to the observable Na I D and Ca II H&K
absorption lines. To study possible narrow absorption lines from such material, we obtained a time-series
of high-resolution spectra of SN 2017cbv at phases between $-14.8$ and $+83$ days with respect to
$B$-band maximum, covering the time at which photoionisation is predicted to occur. Both narrow
Na I D and Ca II H&K are detected in all spectra, with no measurable changes between the epochs. We use
photoionisation models to rule out the presence of Na I and Ca II gas clouds along the line-of-sight
of SN 2017cbv between $\sim8\times10^{16}$--$2\times10^{19}$~cm and $\sim10^{15}$--$10^{17}$~cm,
respectively. Assuming typical abundances, the mass of a homogenous spherical CS gas shell with
radius $R$ must be limited to $M^{\rm CSM}_{\rm HI}<3\times10^{-4}\times(R/10^{17}[{\rm cm}])^2$
M$_{\odot}$. The bounds point to progenitor models that deposit little gas in their CS environment.
