The fullerene C$_{60}$, one of the largest molecules identified in the interstellar medium (ISM),
has been proposed to form top-down through the photo-chemical processing of large (more than 60
C-atoms) polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) molecules. In this article, we focus on the opposite
process, investigating the possibility that fullerenes form from small PAHs, in which bowl-forming
plays a central role. We combine laboratory experiments and quantum chemical calculations to study
the formation of larger PAHs from charged fluorene clusters. The experiments show that with visible
laser irradiation, the fluorene dimer cation - [C$_{13}$H$_{9}$$-$C$_{13}$H$_{9}$]$^+$ - and
the fluorene trimer cation - [C$_{13}$H$_{9}$$-$C$_{13}$H$_{8}$$-$C$_{13}$H$_{9}$]$^+$
- undergo photo-dehydrogenation and photo-isomerization resulting in bowl structured aromatic
cluster-ions, C$_{26}$H$_{12}$$^+$ and C$_{39}$H$_{20}$$^+$, respectively. To study the details
of this chemical process, we employ quantum chemistry that allows us to determine the structures
of the newly formed cluster-ions, to calculate the hydrogen loss dissociation energies, and to
derive the underlying reaction pathways. These results demonstrate that smaller PAH clusters
(with less than 60 C-atoms) can convert to larger bowled geometries that might act as building blocks
for fullerenes, as the bowl-forming mechanism greatly facilitates the conversion from dehydrogenated
PAHs to cages. Moreover, the bowl-forming induces a permanent dipole moment that - in principle
- allows to search for such species using radio astronomy.
