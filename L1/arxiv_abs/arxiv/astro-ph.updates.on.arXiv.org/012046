The $e$MERLIN Galaxy Evolution Survey ($e$MERGE) is an ambitious, multi-tiered extragalactic
radio continuum survey being carried out with $e$MERLIN and the VLA at 1.4GHz and 6GHz. Exploiting
the unique combination of high sensitivity and high angular resolution provided by radio interferometry,
these observations will provide a powerful, obscuration-independent tool for tracing intense
star-formation and AGN activity in galaxies out to $z\sim5$. In our first data release (DR1) we present
$e$MERGE Tier 1, a 15-arcmin pointing centred on the GOODS-N field, imaged at 1.4GHz with the VLA
and $e$MERLIN at $\sim 0.28''$ resolution down to an rms sensitivity of $\sim 1.2\,\mu$Jy beam$^{-1}$.
This unique radio survey -- unrivaled at 1.4GHz in its combination of depth, areal coverage and angular
resolution in the pre-SKA era -- allows us to localise and separate extended star-forming regions,
nuclear starbursts and compact AGN core/jet systems in galaxies over the past two-thirds of cosmic
history, a crucial step in tracing the apparently simultaneous growths of the stellar populations
and central black holes in massive galaxies. In these proceedings we highlight some early science
results from $e$MERGE DR1, including some examples of the sub-arcsecond morphologies and cold
dust properties of 1.4GHz-selected galaxies. $e$MERGE Tier 1 will eventually reach sub-$\mu$Jy
beam$^{-1}$ sensitivity at $0.28''$ resolution over a 30-arcmin field, providing crucial benchmarks
for deep extragalactic surveys which will be undertaken with SKA in the next decade.
