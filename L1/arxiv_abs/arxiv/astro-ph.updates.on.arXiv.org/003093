We present a new sample of M subdwarfs compiled from the 7th data release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey.
With 3517 new subdwarfs, this new sample significantly increases the number of spectroscopically
confirmed low-mass subdwarfs. This catalog also includes 905 extreme and 534 ultra sudwarfs. We
present the entire catalog including observed and derived quantities, and template spectra created
from co-added subdwarf spectra. We show color-color and reduced proper motion diagrams of the three
metallicity classes, which are shown to separate from the disk dwarf population. The extreme and
ultra subdwarfs are seen at larger values of reduced proper motion as expected for more dynamically
heated populations. We determine 3D kinematics for all of the stars with proper motions. The color-magnitude
diagrams show a clear separation of the three metallicity classes with the ultra and extreme subdwarfs
being significantly closer to the main sequence than the ordinary subdwarfs. All subdwarfs lie
below (fainter) and to the left (bluer) of the main sequence. Based on the average $(U,V,W)$ velocities
and their dispersions, the extreme and ultra subdwarfs likely belong to the Galactic halo, while
the ordinary subdwarfs are likely part of the old Galactic (or thick) disk. An extensive activity
analysis of subdwarfs is performed using H$\alpha$ emission and 208 active subdwarfs are found.
We show that while the activity fraction of subdwarfs rises with spectral class and levels off at
the latest spectral classes, consistent with the behavior of M dwarfs, the extreme and ultra subdwarfs
are basically flat.
