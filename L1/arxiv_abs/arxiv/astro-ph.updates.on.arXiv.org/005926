We derive analytic estimates for the ability with which one can obtain precise, empirical stellar
masses and radii via single-lined eclipsing binaries (EBs) in the era of Gaia and TESS. Including
stars that host transiting substellar companions, such single-lined EBs already number in the
hundreds from ground-based transit surveys and will comprise a major component of the science yield
from the upcoming TESS mission. We explore the requirements for obtaining a given fractional precision
on the masses and radii of single-lined EBs using primarily empirical means: radial velocity and
eclipse measurements along with either: estimates of the primary's (1) surface gravity from high-resolution
spectroscopy, (2) radius inferred from parallax, effective temperature, and bolometric flux,
or (3) surface gravity and density from asteroseismology. We then compare these requirements to
the precision obtained from invoking stellar models or empirical relations. We show that, for a
fiducial transiting Hot Jupiter system, precise, accurate, and essentially model-independent
mass and radius measurements for such single-lined eclipsing binaries will be possible in the era
of \emph{Gaia}. These will be comparable in precision to those obtained with double-lined eclipsing
binaries. Moreover, the systems for which these methods can be applied will vastly outnumber double-lined
EBs, thereby possessing the potential to sample a more complete range of stellar types (such as M-dwarfs);
these systems will also, in many cases, be more amenable to precision metallicity and abundance
determinations than are double-lined EBs.
