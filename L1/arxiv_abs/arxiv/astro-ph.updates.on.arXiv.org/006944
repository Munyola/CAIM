An evolving Japanese gravitational-wave (GW) mission at deci-Hz band: B-DECIGO (DECihertz laser
Interferometer Gravitational wave Observatory) will enable us to detect GW150914-like binary
black-holes, GW170817-like binary neutron-stars, and the intermediate mass binary black-holes
out to cosmological distances. The B-DECIGO band slots in between the aLIGO-Virgo-KAGRA-IndIGO
(hecto-Hz) and LISA (milli-Hz) bands to broader bandwidth, and these sources emit GWs for weeks
to years across the multiband to accumulate high signal-to-noise ratios. This suggests the possibility
that the joint detection would greatly improve the parameter estimation of the binaries. We examine
the B-DECIGO's ability to measure binary parameters and assess what extent multiband analysis
could improve such measurement, thanks to the broader bandwidth. Using non-precessing post-Newtonian
waveforms with Fisher matrix approach, we find for systems like GW150914 and GW170817 that B-DECIGO
can measure the mass ratio to within $< 0.1\%$, the individual black-hole spins to within $< 10\%$,
and the coalescence time to within $< 2\,$s about a week before to alert aLIGO and electromagnetic
facilities. aLIGO having prior information from B-DECIGO can further reduce the uncertainty in
the measurement of, e.g., certain neutron-star tidal deformability by factor of $\sim 4$. Joint
LISA and B-DECIGO measurement will also be able to recover masses and spins of intermediate mass
binary black-holes at percent-level precision. However, there will be large systematic bias in
these results due to post-Newtonian approximation to exact GW signals.
