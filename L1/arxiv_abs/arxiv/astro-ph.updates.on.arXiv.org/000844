We present deep echelle spectrophotometry of the Galactic HII region NGC 2579. The data have been
taken with the Very Large Telescope Ultraviolet-Visual Echelle Spectrograph in the 3550--10400
\AA\ range. This object, which has been largely neglected, shows however a rather high surface brightness,
a high ionization degree and is located at a galactocentric distance of 12.4 $\pm$ 0.7 kpc. Therefore,
NGC 2579 is an excellent probe for studying the behaviour of the gas phase radial abundance gradients
in the outer disc of the Milky Way. We derive the physical conditions of the nebula using several emission
line-intensity ratios as well as the abundances of several ionic species from the intensity of collisionally
excited lines. We also determine the ionic abundances of C$^{2+}$, O$^+$ and O$^{2+}$ -- and therefore
the total O abundance -- from faint pure recombination lines. The results for NGC 2579 permit to extend
our previous determinations of the C, O and C/O gas phase radial gradients of the inner Galactic disc
(Esteban etal. 2005) to larger galactocentric distances. We find that the chemical composition
of NGC 2579 is consistent with flatten gradients at its galactocentric distance. In addition, we
have built a tailored chemical evolution model that reproduces the observed radial abundance gradients
of O, C and N and other observational constraints. We find that a levelling out of the star formation
efficiency about and beyond the isophotal radius can explain the flattening of chemical gradients
observed in the outer Galactic disc.
