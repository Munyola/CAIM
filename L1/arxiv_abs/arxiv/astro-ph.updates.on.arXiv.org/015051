We present a revised and complete optical afterglow light curve of the binary neutron star merger
GW170817, enabled by deep Hubble Space Telescope (HST) F606W observations at $\approx\!584$ days
post-merger, which provide a robust optical template. The light curve spans $\approx 110-362$
days, and is fully consistent with emission from a relativistic structured jet viewed off-axis,
as previously indicated by radio and X-ray data. Combined with contemporaneous radio and X-ray
observations, we find no spectral evolution, with a weighted average spectral index of $\langle
\beta \rangle = -0.583 \pm 0.013$, demonstrating that no synchrotron break frequencies evolve
between the radio and X-ray bands over these timescales. We find that an extrapolation of the post-peak
temporal slope of GW170817 to the luminosities of cosmological short GRBs matches their observed
jet break times, suggesting that their explosion properties are similar, and that the primary difference
in GW170817 is viewing angle. Additionally, we place a deep limit on the luminosity and mass of an
underlying globular cluster of $L \lesssim 6.7 \times 10^{3}\,L_{\odot}$, or $M \lesssim 1.3 \times
10^{4}\,M_{\odot}$, at least 4 standard deviations below the peak of the globular cluster mass
function of the host galaxy, NGC4993. This limit provides a direct and strong constraint that GW170817
did not form and merge in a globular cluster. As highlighted here, HST (and soon JWST) enables critical
observations of the optical emission from neutron star merger jets and outflows.
