The High Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) Gamma-ray Observatory is an extensive air shower detector
operating in central Mexico, which has recently completed its first two years of full operations.
If for a burst like GRB 130427A at a redshift of 0.34 and a high-energy component following a power
law with index -1.66, the high-energy component is extended to higher energies with no cut-off other
than from extragalactic background light attenuation, HAWC would observe gamma rays with a peak
energy of $\sim$300 GeV. This paper reports the results of HAWC observations of 64 gamma-ray bursts
(GRBs) detected by $\mathit{Swift}$ and $\mathit{Fermi}$, including three GRBs that were also
detected by the Large Area Telescope ($\mathit{Fermi}$-LAT). An ON/OFF analysis method is employed,
searching on the time scale given by the observed light curve at keV-MeV energies and also on extended
time scales. For all GRBs and time scales, no statistically significant excess of counts is found
and upper limits on the number of gamma rays and the gamma-ray flux are calculated. GRB 170206A, the
third brightest short GRB detected by the Gamma-ray Burst Monitor on board the $\mathit{Fermi}$
satellite ($\mathit{Fermi}$-GBM) and also detected by the LAT, occurred very close to zenith.
The LAT measurements can neither exclude the presence of a synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) component
nor constrain its spectrum. Instead, the HAWC upper limits constrain the expected cut-off in an
additional high-energy component to be less than $100~\rm{GeV}$ for reasonable assumptions about
the energetics and redshift of the burst.
