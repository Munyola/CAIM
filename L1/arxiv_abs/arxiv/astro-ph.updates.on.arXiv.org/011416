We study the evolution of the hydrogen ionization field during the epoch of reionization (EoR) using
semi-numerical model simulations. By calculating the Minkowski functionals (MFs) of the 21cm
brightness temperature field, which provides a quantitative description of topology of the neutral
and ionized regions, we find that the reionization process can be divided into five stages, each
with different topological structures, corresponding to isolated ionized regions ("bubbles");
connected ionized region ("ionized fibers") which percolate through the cosmic volume; a sponge-like
configuration with intertwined neutral and ionized regions after the overlap of bubbles; connected
neutral regions ("neutral fibers") when the ionized region begin to surround the remaining neutral
region; and isolated neutral regions ("islands"), before the whole space is ionized except for
the rare dense clumps in galaxies and minihalos and the reionization process is completed. We use
the MFs and the size statistics on the ionized or neutral regions to distinguish these different
stages, and find the neutral fractions at which the transition of the different stages occur. At
the later stages of reionization the neutral regions are more isolated than the ionized regions,
this is the motivation for the island model description of reionization. We compare the late stage
topological evolution in the island model and the bubble model, showing that in the island model
the neutral fibers are more easily broken into multiple pieces due to the ionizing background.
