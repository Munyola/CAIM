Forecasts of statistical constraints on model parameters using the Fisher matrix abound in many
fields of astrophysics. The Fisher matrix formalism involves the assumption of Gaussianity in
parameter space and hence fails to predict complex features of posterior probability distributions.
Combining the standard Fisher matrix with Box-Cox transformations, we propose a novel method that
accurately predicts arbitrary posterior shapes. The Box-Cox transformations are applied to parameter
space to render it approximately multivariate Gaussian, performing the Fisher matrix calculation
on the transformed parameters. We demonstrate that, after the Box-Cox parameters have been determined
from an initial likelihood evaluation, the method correctly predicts changes in the posterior
when varying various parameters of the experimental setup and the data analysis, with marginally
higher computational cost than a standard Fisher matrix calculation. We apply the Box-Cox-Fisher
formalism to forecast cosmological parameter constraints by future weak gravitational lensing
surveys. The characteristic non-linear degeneracy between matter density parameter and normalisation
of matter density fluctuations is reproduced for several cases, and the capabilities of breaking
this degeneracy by weak lensing three-point statistics is investigated. Possible applications
of Box-Cox transformations of posterior distributions are discussed, including the prospects
for performing statistical data analysis steps in the transformed Gaussianised parameter space.
