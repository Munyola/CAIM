The Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) represents the next generation of very high-energy gamma-ray
observatory, which will provide broad coverage of gamma rays from 20 GeV to 300 TeV with unprecedented
sensitivity. CTA will employ three different sizes of telescopes, and the Large-Sized Telescopes
(LSTs) of 23-m diameter dish will provide the sensitivity in the lowest energies down to 20 GeV. The
first LST prototype has been inaugurated in October 2018 at La Palma (Canary Islands, Spain) and
has entered the commissioning phase. The camera of the LST consists of 265 PMT modules. Each module
is equipped with seven high-quantum-efficiency Photomultiplier Tubes (PMTs), a slow control
board, and a readout board. Ensuring high uniformity and precise characterization of the camera
is the key aspects leading to the best performance and low systematic uncertainty of the LST cameras.
Therefore, prior to the installation on site, we performed a quality check of all PMT modules. Moreover,
the absolute calibration of light throughput is essential to reconstruct the amount of light received
by the telescope. The amount of light is affected by the atmosphere, by the telescope optical system
and camera, and can be calibrated using the ring-shaped images produced by cosmic-ray muons. In
this contribution, we will show the results of off-site quality control of PMT modules and on-site
calibration using muon rings. We will also highlight the status of the development of Silicon Photomultiplier
modules that could be considered as a replacement of PMT modules for further improvement of the camera.
