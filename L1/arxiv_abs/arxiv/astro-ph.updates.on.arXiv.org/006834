Forward modeling of the full galaxy SED is a powerful technique, providing self-consistent constraints
on stellar ages, dust properties, and metallicities. However, the accuracy of these results is
contingent on the accuracy of the model. One significant source of uncertainty is the contribution
of obscured AGN, as they are relatively common and can produce substantial mid-IR (MIR) emission.
Here we include emission from dusty AGN torii in the Prospector SED-fitting framework, and fit the
UV-IR broadband photometry of 129 nearby galaxies. We find that 10% of the fitted galaxies host an
AGN contributing $>$10% of the observed galaxy MIR luminosity. We demonstrate the necessity of
this AGN component in the following ways. First, we compare observed spectral features to spectral
features predicted from our model fit to the photometry. We find that the AGN component greatly improves
predictions for observed H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$ luminosities, as well as mid-infrared Akari and
Spitzer/IRS spectra. Second, we show that inclusion of the AGN component changes stellar ages and
SFRs by up to a factor of 10, and dust attenuations by up to a factor of 2.5. Finally, we show that the
strength of our model AGN component correlates with independent AGN indicators, suggesting that
these galaxies truly host AGN. Notably, only 46% of the SED-detected AGN would be detected with a
simple MIR color selection. Based on these results, we conclude that SED models which fit MIR data
without AGN components are vulnerable to substantial bias in their derived parameters.
