In this paper we present the discovery of a highly unequal-mass eclipsing M-dwarf binary, providing
a unique constraint on binary star formation theory and on evolutionary models for low-mass binary
stars. The binary is discovered using high- precision infrared light curves from the WFCAM Transit
Survey (WTS) and has an orbital period of 2.44 d. We find stellar masses of M1 = 0.53 (0.02) Msun and
M2 = 0.143 (0.006) Msun (mass ratio 0.27), and radii of R1 = 0.51 (0.01) Rsun and R2 = 0.174 (0.006) Rsun.
This puts the companion in a very sparsely sampled and important late M-dwarf mass-regime. Since
both stars share the same age and metallicity and straddle the theoretical boundary between fully
and partially convective stellar interiors, a comparison can be made to model predictions over
a large range of M-dwarf masses using the same model isochrone. Both stars appear to have a slightly
inflated radius compared to 1 Gyr model predictions for their masses, but future work is needed to
properly account for the effects of star spots on the light curve solution. A significant, subsynchronous,
~2.56 d signal with ~2% peak-to-peak amplitude is detected in the WFCAM light curve, which we attribute
to rotational modulation of cool star spots. We propose that the subsynchronous rotation is either
due to a stable star-spot complex at high latitude on the (magnetically active) primary (i.e. differential
rotation), or to additional magnetic braking, or to interaction of the binary with a third body or
circumbinary disk during its pre-main-sequence phase.
