In this work, we study the Galactic evolution of lithium by means of chemical evolution models in
the light of the most recent spectroscopic data from Galactic stellar surveys. We consider detailed
chemical evolution models for the Milky Way halo, discs and bulge, and we compare our model predictions
with the most recent spectroscopic data for these different Galactic components. In particular,
we focus on the decrease of lithium at high metallicity observed by the AMBRE Project, the Gaia-ESO
Survey, and other spectroscopic surveys, which still remains unexplained by theoretical models.
We analyse the various lithium producers and confirm that novae are the main source of lithium in
the Galaxy, in agreement with other previous studies. Moreover, we show that, by assuming that the
fraction of binary systems giving rise to novae is lower at higher metallicity, we can suggest a novel
explanation to the lithium decline at super-solar metallicities: the above assumption is based
on independent constraints on the nova system birthrate, that have been recently proposed in the
literature. As regards to the thick disc, it is less lithium enhanced due to the shorter timescale
of formation and higher star formation efficiency with respect to the thin disc and, therefore,
we have a faster evolution and the "reverse knee" in the A(Li) vs. [Fe/H] relation is shifted towards
higher metallicities. Finally, we present our predictions about lithium evolution in the Galactic
bulge, that, however, still need further data to be confirmed or disproved.
