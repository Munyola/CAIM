Motivated by recent measurements of the number density of faint AGN at high redshift, we investigate
the contribution of quasars to reionization by tracking the growth of central supermassive black
holes in an update of the Meraxes semi-analytic model. The model is calibrated against the observed
stellar mass function at $z\sim0.6-7$, the black hole mass function at $z\lesssim0.5$, the global
ionizing emissivity at $z\sim2-5$ and the Thomson scattering optical depth. The model reproduces
a Magorrian relation in agreement with observations at $z<0.5$ and predicts a decreasing black
hole mass towards higher redshifts at fixed total stellar mass. With the implementation of an opening
angle of 80 deg for quasar radiation, corresponding to an observable fraction of ${\sim}23.4$ per
cent due to obscuration by dust, the model is able to reproduce the observed quasar luminosity function
at $z\sim0.6-6$. The stellar light from galaxies hosting faint AGN contributes a significant or
dominant fraction of the UV flux. At high redshift, the model is consistent with the bright end quasar
luminosity function and suggests that the recent faint $z\sim4$ AGN sample compiled by Giallongo
et al. (2015) includes a significant fraction of stellar light. Direct application of this luminosity
function to the calculation of AGN ionizing emissivity consequently overestimates the number
of ionizing photons produced by quasars by a factor of 3 at $z\sim6$. We conclude that quasars are
unlikely to make a significant contribution to reionization.
