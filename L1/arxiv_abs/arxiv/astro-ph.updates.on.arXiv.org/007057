The obliquity of a terrestrial planet is an important clue about its formation and critical to its
climate. Previous studies using simulated photometry of Earth show that continuous observations
over most of a planet's orbit can be inverted to infer obliquity. However, few studies of more general
planets with arbitrary albedo markings have been made and, in particular, a simple theoretical
understanding of why it is possible to extract obliquity from light curves is missing. Reflected
light seen by a distant observer is the product of a planet's albedo map, its host star's illumination,
and the visibility of different regions. It is useful to treat the product of illumination and visibility
as the kernel of a convolution. Time-resolved photometry constrains both the albedo map and the
kernel, the latter of which sweeps over the planet due to rotational and orbital motion. The kernel's
movement distinguishes prograde from retrograde rotation for planets with non-zero obliquity
on inclined orbits. We demonstrate that the kernel's longitudinal width and mean latitude are distinct
functions of obliquity and axial orientation. Notably, we find that a planet's spin axis affects
the kernel -- and hence time-resolved photometry -- even if this planet is East-West uniform or spinning
rapidly, or if it is North-South uniform. We find that perfect knowledge of the kernel at 2-4 orbital
phases is usually sufficient to uniquely determine a planet's spin axis. Surprisingly, we predict
that East-West albedo contrast is more useful for constraining obliquity than North-South contrast.
