Using a global network of small telescopes, we have obtained light curves of Proxima Centauri at
329 observation epochs from 2006 to 2017. The planet Proxima b discovered by Anglada-Escude et al.
(2016) with an orbital period of 11.186 d has an a priori transit probability of ~ 1.5%; if it transits,
the predicted transit depth is about 5 millimagnitudes. In Blank et al. (2018), we analyzed 96 of
our light curves that overlapped with predicted transit ephemerides from previously published
tentative transit detections, and found no evidence in our data that would corroborate claims of
transits with a period of 11.186 d. Here we broaden our analysis, using 262 high-quality light curves
from our dataset to search for any periodic transit-like events over a range of periods from 1 to 30
d. We also inject a series of simulated planet transits and find that our data are sufficiently sensitive
to have detected transits of 5 millimagnitude depth, with recoverability ranging from ~100% for
orbital period of 1 d to ~20% for orbital period of 20 d for the parameter spaces tested. The recoverability
specifically at the 11.186 d period of Proxima b is ~ 40% for the parameter spaces tested. While we
are able to rule out virtually all transits of other planets at periods shorter than 5 d and depths
greater than 5 millimagnitudes, we cannot rule out the possibility that transits of Proxima b are
present but escaped detection. However, we are able to rule out virtually all transits of other planets
at periods shorter than 5 d and depths greater than 3 millimagnitudes.
