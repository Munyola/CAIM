Lithium abundance in most of the warm metal-poor main sequence stars shows a constant plateau (A(Li)~2.2
dex) and then the upper envelope of the lithium vs. metallicity distribution increases as we approach
solar metallicity. Meteorites, which carry information about the chemical composition of the
interstellar medium at the solar system formation time, show a lithium abundance A(Li)~3.26 dex.
This pattern reflects the Li enrichment history of the interstellar medium during the Galaxy lifetime.
After the initial Li production in Big Bang Nucleosynthesis, the sources of the enrichment include
AGB stars, low-mass red giants, novae, type II supernovae, and Galactic cosmic rays. The total amount
of enriched Li is sensitive to the relative contribution of these sources. Thus different Li enrichment
histories are expected in the Galactic thick and thin disc. We investigate the main sequence stars
observed with UVES in Gaia-ESO Survey iDR4 catalog and find a Li-[alpha/Fe] anticorrelation independent
of [Fe/H], Teff, and log(g). Since in stellar evolution different {\alpha} enhancements at the
same metallicity do not lead to a measurable Li abundance change, the anticorrelation indicates
that more Li is produced during the Galactic thin disc phase than during the Galactic thick disc phase.
We also find a correlation between the abundance of Li and s-process elements Ba and Y, and they both
decrease above the solar metallicity, which can be explained in the framework of the adopted Galactic
chemical evolution models.
