It has been known for decades that the observed number of baryons in the local universe falls about
30-40% short of the total number of baryons predicted by Big-Bang Nucleosynthesis, as inferred
from density fluctuations of the Cosmic Microwave Background and seen during the first 2-3 billion
years of the universe in the so called Lyman-alpha Forest. A theoretical solution to this paradox
locates the missing baryons in the hot and tenuous filamentary gas between galaxies, known as the
warm-hot intergalactic medium. However, it is difficult to detect them there because the largest
by far constituent of this gas - hydrogen - is mostly ionized and therefore almost invisible in far-ultraviolet
spectra with typical signal-to-noise ratios. Indeed, despite the large observational efforts,
only a few marginal claims of detection have been made so far. Here we report observations of two absorbers
of highly ionized oxygen (OVII) in the high signal-to-noise-ratio X-ray spectrum of a quasar at
redshift >0.4. These absorbers show no variability over a 2-year timescale and have no associated
cold absorption, making the assumption that they originate from the quasar's intrinsic outflow
or the host galaxy's interstellar medium implausible. The OVII systems lie in regions characterized
by large (x4 compared to average) galaxy over-densities and their number (down to the sensitivity
threshold of our data), agrees well with numerical simulation predictions for the long-sought
warm-hot intergalactic medium (WHIM). We conclude that the missing baryons have been found.
