Identifying the mechanism by which high energy Lyman continuum (LyC) photons escaped from early
galaxies is one of the most pressing questions in cosmic evolution. Haro 11 is the best known local
LyC leaking galaxy, providing an important opportunity to test our understanding of LyC escape.
The observed LyC emission in this galaxy presumably originates from one of the three bright, photoionizing
knots known as A, B, and C. It is known that Knot C has strong Ly$\alpha$ emission, and Knot B hosts an
unusually bright ultraluminous X-ray source, which may be a low-luminosity AGN. To clarify the
LyC source, we carry out ionization-parameter mapping (IPM) by obtaining narrow-band imaging
from the Hubble Space Telescope WFC3 and ACS cameras to construct spatially resolved ratio maps
of [OIII]/[OII] emission from the galaxy. IPM traces the ionization structure of the interstellar
medium and allows us to identify optically thin regions. To optimize the continuum subtraction,
we introduce a new method for determining the best continuum scale factor derived from the mode of
the continuum-subtracted, image flux distribution. We find no conclusive evidence of LyC escape
from Knots B or C, but instead, we identify a high-ionization region extending over at least 1 kpc
from Knot A. Knot A shows evidence of an extremely young age ($\lesssim 1$ Myr), perhaps containing
very massive stars ($>100$ M$_\odot$). It is weak in Ly$\alpha$, so if it is confirmed as the LyC source,
our results imply that LyC emission may be independent of Ly$\alpha$ emission.
