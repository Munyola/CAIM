X-rays are particularly suited to probe the physics of extreme objects. However, despite the enormous
improvements of X-ray Astronomy in imaging, spectroscopy and timing, polarimetry remains largely
unexplored. We propose the photoelectric polarimeter Gas Pixel Detector (GPD) as an instrument
candidate to fill the gap of more than thirty years of lack of measurements. The GPD, in the focus of
a telescope, will increase the sensitivity of orders of magnitude. Moreover, since it can measure
the energy, the position, the arrival time and the polarization angle of every single photon, allows
to perform polarimetry of subsets of data singled out from the spectrum, the light curve or the image
of source. The GPD has an intrinsic very fine imaging capability and in this work we report on the calibration
campaign carried out in 2012 at the PANTER X-ray test facility of the Max-Planck-Institut f\"ur
extraterrestrische Physik of Garching (Germany) in which, for the first time, we coupled it to a
JET-X optics module with a focal length of 3.5 m and an angular resolution of 18 arcsec at 4.5 keV. This
configuration was proposed in 2012 aboard the X-ray Imaging Polarimetry Explorer (XIPE) in response
to the ESA call for a small mission. We derived the imaging and polarimetric performance for extended
sources like Pulsar Wind Nebulae and Supernova Remnants as case studies for the XIPE configuration,
discussing also possible improvements by coupling the detector with advanced optics, having finer
angular resolution and larger effective area, to study with more details extended objects.
