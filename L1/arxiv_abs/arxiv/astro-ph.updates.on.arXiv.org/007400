We have explored the evolution of gas distributions from cosmological simulations carried out
using the RAMSES adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) code, to explore the effects of resolution on cosmological
hydrodynamical simulations. It is vital to understand the effect of both the resolution of initial
conditions and the final resolution of the simulation. Lower initial resolution simulations tend
to produce smaller numbers of low mass structures. This will strongly affect the assembly history
of objects, and has the same effect of simulating different cosmologies. The resolution of initial
conditions is an important factor in simulations, even with a fixed maximum spatial resolution.
The power spectrum of gas in simulations using AMR diverges strongly from the fixed grid approach
- with more power on small scales in the AMR simulations - even at fixed physical resolution and also
produces offsets in the star formation at specific epochs. This is because before certain times
the upper grid levels are held back to maintain approximately fixed physical resolution, and to
mimic the natural evolution of dark matter only simulations. Although the impact of hold back falls
with increasing spatial and initial-condition resolutions, the offsets in the star formation
remain down to a spatial resolution of 1 kpc. These offsets are of order of 10-20%, which is below the
uncertainty in the implemented physics but are expected to affect the detailed properties of galaxies.
We have implemented a new grid-hold-back approach to minimize the impact of hold back on the star
formation rate.
