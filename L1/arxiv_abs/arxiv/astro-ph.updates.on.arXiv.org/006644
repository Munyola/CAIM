Technology has advanced to the point that it is possible to image the entire sky every night and process
the data in real time. The sky is hardly static: many interesting phenomena occur, including variable
stationary objects such as stars or QSOs, transient stationary objects such as supernovae or M dwarf
flares, and moving objects such as asteroids and the stars themselves. Funded by NASA, we have designed
and built a sky survey system for the purpose of finding dangerous near-Earth asteroids (NEAs).
This system, the "Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System" (ATLAS), has been optimized
to produce the best survey capability per unit cost, and therefore ATLAS is an efficient and competitive
system for finding potentially hazardous asteroids (PHAs) but also for tracking variables and
finding transients. While carrying out its NASA mission, ATLAS now discovers the greatest number
of bright ($m < 19$) supernovae candidates of any ground based survey, frequently detecting very
young explosions due to its 2 day cadence. ATLAS discovered the afterglow of a gamma-ray burst independent
of the high energy trigger and has released a variable star catalogue of 5$\times10^{6}$ sources.
This, the first of a series of articles describing ATLAS, is devoted to the design and performance
of the ATLAS system. Subsequent articles will describe in more detail the software, the survey strategy,
ATLAS-derived NEA population statistics, transient detections, and the first data release of
variable stars and transient lightcurves.
