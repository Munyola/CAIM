In September 2012, the high-synchrotron-peaked (HSP) blazar Markarian 421 underwent a rapid wideband
radio flare, reaching nearly twice the brightest level observed in the centimeter band in over three
decades of monitoring. In response to this event we carried out a five epoch centimeter- to millimeter-band
multifrequency Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) campaign to investigate the aftermath of this emission
event. Rapid radio variations are unprecedented in this object and are surprising in an HSP BL Lac
object. In this flare, the 15 GHz flux density increased with an exponential doubling time of about
9 days, then faded to its prior level at a similar rate. This is comparable with the fastest large-amplitude
centimeter-band radio variability observed in any blazar. Similar flux density increases were
detected up to millimeter bands. This radio flare followed about two months after a similarly unprecedented
GeV gamma-ray flare (reaching a daily E>100 MeV flux of (1.2 +/- 0.7)x10^(-6) ph cm^(-2) s^(-1))
reported by the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) collaboration, with a simultaneous tentative
TeV detection by ARGO-YBJ. A cross-correlation analysis of long-term 15 GHz and LAT gamma-ray light
curves finds a statistically significant correlation with the radio lagging ~40 days behind, suggesting
that the gamma-ray emission originates upstream of the radio emission. Preliminary results from
our VLBA observations show brightening in the unresolved core region and no evidence for apparent
superluminal motions or substantial flux variations downstream.
