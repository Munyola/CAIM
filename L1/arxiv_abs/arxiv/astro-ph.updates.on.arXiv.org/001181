Our Spitzer IRS observation of the infrared companion Glass Ib revealed fine structure emission
with high ionization ([NeIII]/[NeII]=2.1 and [SIV]/[SIII]=0.6) that indicates the gas is likely
illuminated by hard radiation. While models suggest extreme ultraviolet radiation could be present
in T Tauri stars (Hollenbach & Gorti 2009 and references therein), this is the first detection
of [SIV] and such a high [NeIII]/[NeII] ratio in a young star. We also find that Glass Ib displays the
molecules HCN, CO2, and H2O in emission. Here we investigate the Glass I binary system and consider
possible mechanisms that may have caused the high ionization, whether from an outflow or disk irradiation.
We also model the spectral energy distributions of Glass Ia and Ib to test if the system is a young member
of the Chameleon I star-forming region, and consider other possible classifications for the system.
We find Glass Ib is highly variable, showing changes in continuum strength and emission features
at optical, near-infrared, and mid-infrared wavelengths. The optical light curve indicates that
a central stellar component in Glass Ib became entirely visible for 2.5 years beginning in mid-2002,
and that possibly displayed periodic variability with repeated, short-period dimming during
that time. As the fine structure emission was not detected in observations before or after our Spitzer
IRS observation, we explore whether the variable nature of Glass Ib is related to the gas being highly
ionized, possibly due to variable accretion or an X-ray flare.
