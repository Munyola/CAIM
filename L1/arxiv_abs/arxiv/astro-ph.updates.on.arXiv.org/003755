Placing signal templates (grid points) as efficiently as possible to cover a multi-dimensional
parameter space is crucial in computing-intensive matched-filtering searches for gravitational
waves, but also in similar searches in other fields of astronomy. To generate efficient coverings
of arbitrary parameter spaces, stochastic template banks have been advocated, where templates
are placed at random while rejecting those too close to others. However, in this simple scheme, for
each new random point its distance to every template in the existing bank is computed. This rapidly
increasing number of distance computations can render the acceptance of new templates computationally
prohibitive, particularly for wide parameter spaces or in large dimensions. This work presents
a neighboring cell algorithm that can dramatically improve the efficiency of constructing a stochastic
template bank. By dividing the parameter space into sub-volumes (cells), for an arbitrary point
an efficient hashing technique is exploited to obtain the index of its enclosing cell along with
the parameters of its neighboring templates. Hence only distances to these neighboring templates
in the bank are computed, massively lowering the overall computing cost, as demonstrated in simple
examples. Furthermore, we propose a novel method based on this technique to increase the fraction
of covered parameter space solely by directed template shifts, without adding any templates. As
is demonstrated in examples, this method can be highly effective..
