Radiative feedback from stars and galaxies has been proposed as a potential solution to many of the
tensions with simplistic galaxy formation models based on $\Lambda$CDM, such as the faint end of
the UV luminosity function. The total energy budget of radiation could exceed that of galactic winds
and supernovae combined, which has driven the development of sophisticated algorithms that evolve
both the radiation field and the hydrodynamical response of gas simultaneously, in a cosmological
context. We probe self-feedback on galactic scales using the adaptive mesh refinement, radiative
transfer, hydrodynamics, and $N$-body code. Unlike previous studies which assume a homogeneous
UV background, we self-consistently evolve both the radiation field and gas to constrain the halo
baryon fraction during cosmic reionization. We demonstrate that the characteristic halo mass
with mean baryon fraction half the cosmic mean, $M_{\mathrm{c}}(z)$, shows very little variation
as a function of mass-weighted ionization fraction. Furthermore, we find that the inclusion of
metal cooling and the ability to resolve scales small enough for self-shielding to become efficient
leads to a significant drop in $M_{\mathrm{c}}$ when compared to recent studies. Finally, we develop
an Artificial Neural Network that is capable of predicting the baryon fraction of haloes based on
recent tidal interactions, gas temperature, and mass-weighted ionization fraction. Such a model
can be applied to any reionization history, and trivially incorporated into semi-analytical models
of galaxy formation.
