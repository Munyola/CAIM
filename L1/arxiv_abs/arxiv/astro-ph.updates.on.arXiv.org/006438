Wide Field Adaptive Optics (WFAO) systems are among the most sophisticated AO systems available
today on large telescopes. The knowledge of the vertical spatio-temporal distribution of the wind
speed (WS) and direction (WD) are fundamental to optimize the performance of such systems. Previous
studies already proved that the Gemini Multi-Conjugated AO system (GeMS) is able to retrieve measurements
of the WS and WD stratification using the SLODAR technique and to store measurements in the telemetry
data. In order to assess the reliability of these estimates and of the SLODAR technique applied to
such a kind of complex AO systems, in this study we compared WS and WD retrieved from GeMS with those
obtained with the atmospherical model Meso-Nh on a rich statistical sample of nights. It has been
previously proved that, the latter technique, provided an excellent agreement with a large sample
of radiosoundings both, in statistical terms and on individual flights. It can be considered, therefore,
as an independent reference. The excellent agreement between GeMS measurements and the model that
we find in this study, proves the robustness of the SLODAR approach. To by-pass the complex procedures
necessary to achieve automatic measurements of the wind with GeMS, we propose a simple automatic
method to monitor nightly WS and WD using the Meso-Nh model estimates. Such a method can be applied
to whatever present or new generation facilities supported by WFAO systems. The interest of this
study is, therefore, well beyond the optimization of GeMS performance.
