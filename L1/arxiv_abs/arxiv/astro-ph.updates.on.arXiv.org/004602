We explain the fast-moving, ripple-like features in the edge-on debris disk orbiting the young
M dwarf AU Mic. The bright features are clouds of sub-micron dust repelled by the host star's wind.
The clouds are produced by avalanches: radial outflows of dust that gain exponentially more mass
as they shatter background disk particles in collisional chain reactions. The avalanches are triggered
from a region a few AU across -- the "avalanche zone" -- located on AU Mic's primary "birth" ring, at
a true distance of $\sim$35 AU from the star but at a projected distance more than a factor of 10 smaller:
the avalanche zone sits directly along the line of sight to the star, on the side of the ring nearest
Earth, launching clouds that disk rotation sends wholly to the southeast, as observed. The avalanche
zone marks where the primary ring intersects a secondary ring of debris left by the catastrophic
disruption of a progenitor up to Varuna in size, less than tens of thousands of years ago. Only where
the rings intersect are particle collisions sufficiently violent to spawn the sub-micron dust
needed to seed the avalanches. We show that this picture works quantitatively, reproducing the
masses, sizes, and velocities of the observed escaping clouds. The Lorentz force exerted by the
wind's magnetic field, whose polarity reverses periodically according to the stellar magnetic
cycle, promises to explain the observed vertical undulations. The timescale between avalanches,
about 10 yr, might be set by time variability of the wind mass-loss rate or, more speculatively, by
some self-regulating limit cycle.
