The Design Reference Asteroid (DRA) is a compilation of all that is known about the OSIRIS-REx mission
target, asteroid (101955) Bennu. It contains our best knowledge of the properties of Bennu based
on an extensive observational campaign that began shortly after its discovery, and has been used
to inform mission plan development and flight system design. The DRA will also be compared with post-encounter
science results to determine the accuracy of our Earth-based characterization efforts. The extensive
observations of Bennu in 1999 has made it one of the best-characterized near-Earth asteroids. Many
physical parameters are well determined, and span a number of categories: Orbital, Bulk, Rotational,
Radar, Photometric, Spectroscopic, Thermal, Surface Analog, and Environment Properties. Some
results described in the DRA have been published in peer-reviewed journals while others have been
reviewed by OSIRIS-REx Science Team members and/or external reviewers. Some data, such as Surface
Analog Properties, are based on our best knowledge of asteroid surfaces, in particular those of
asteroids Eros and Itokawa. This public release of the OSIRIS-REx Design Reference Asteroid is
a annotated version of the internal OSIRIS-REx document OREX-DOCS-04.00-00002, Rev 9 (accepted
by the OSIRIS-REx project on 2014-April-14). The supplemental data products that accompany the
official OSIRIS-REx version of the DRA are not included in this release. We are making this document
available as a service to future mission planners in the hope that it will inform their efforts.
