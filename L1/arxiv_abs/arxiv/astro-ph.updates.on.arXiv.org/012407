The scaling relations between supermassive black holes and their host galaxy properties are of
fundamental importance in the context black hole-host galaxy co-evolution throughout cosmic
time. In this work, we use a novel algorithm that identifies smooth trends in complex datasets and
apply it to a sample of 2,000 type I active galactic nuclei (AGN) spectra. We detect a sequence in emission
line shapes and strengths which reveals a correlation between the narrow L([OIII])/L(H$\beta$)
line ratio and the width of the broad H$\alpha$. This scaling relation ties the kinematics of the
gas clouds in the broad line region to the ionisation state of the narrow line region, connecting
the properties of gas clouds kiloparsecs away from the black hole to material gravitationally bound
to it on sub-parsec scales. This relation can be used to estimate black hole masses from narrow emission
lines only. It therefore enables black hole mass estimation for obscured type II AGN and allows us
to explore the connection between black holes and host galaxy properties for thousands of objects,
well beyond the local Universe. Using this technique, we present the $M_{\mathrm{BH}} - \sigma$
and $M_{\mathrm{BH}} - M_{*}$ scaling relations for a sample of about 10,000 type II AGN from SDSS.
These relations are remarkably consistent with those observed for type I AGN, suggesting that this
new method may perform as reliably as the classical estimate used in non-obscured type I AGN. These
findings open a new window for studies of black hole-host galaxy co-evolution throughout cosmic
time.
