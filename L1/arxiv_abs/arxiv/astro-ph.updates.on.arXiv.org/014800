We implement a search for exoplanets in campaigns zero through eight (C0-8) of the K2 extension of
the Kepler spacecraft. We apply a modified version of the QATS planet search algorithm to K2 light
curves produced by the EVEREST pipeline, carrying out the C0-8 search on $1.5 \times 10^5$ target
stars with magnitudes in the range of Kp = 9-15. We detect 818 transiting planet candidates, of which
374 were undiscovered by prior searches, with {64,15,5,2,1} in {2,3,4,5,6}-planet multi-planet
candidate systems, respectively. Of the new planets detected, 100 orbit M dwarfs, including one
which is potentially rocky and in the habitable zone. 154 of our candidates reciprocally transit
with our Solar System: they are geometrically aligned to see at least one Solar System planet transit.
We find candidates which display transit timing variations and dozens of candidates on both period
extremes with single transits or ultra-short periods. We point to evidence that our candidates
display similar patterns in frequency and size-period relation as confirmed planets, such as tentative
evidence for the radius gap. Confirmation of these planet candidates with follow-up studies will
increase the number of K2 planets by up to 50%, and characterization of their host stars will improve
statistical studies of planet properties. Our sample includes many planets orbiting bright stars
amenable for radial velocity follow-up and future characterization with JWST. We also list the
579 eclipsing binary systems detected as part of this search.
