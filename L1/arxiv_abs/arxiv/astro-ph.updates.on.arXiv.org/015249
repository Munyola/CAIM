Photon-hadronic interactions are important for the sources and the transport of Ultra-High Energy
Cosmic Rays (UHECRs). Current state-of-the-art cosmic ray transport simulations handle nuclear
disintegration at energies of the Giant Dipole Resonance at a more sophisticated level, as well
as the photohadronic interactions of nucleons in the high-energy regime above the pion production
threshold. However, the interactions of nuclei above the pion production threshold are commonly
modeled by treating the nucleus as a superposition of free nucleons -- ignoring the effect of the
nuclear medium. We construct an improved, inclusive model for the photomeson regime for nuclei
with $A \leq 56$ by employing more accurate, data-driven parametrizations of the interaction cross
section, the fragmentation of the primary nucleus and the inclusive pion production cross section
that directly affects the production of astrophysical neutrinos. We apply our results to two multi-messenger
scenarios (Tidal Disruption Events and Gamma-Ray Bursts) in which photonuclear interactions
in the photomeson regime are the dominant cooling process for the highest energy cosmic rays. While
we find moderate changes to the mass composition of UHECRs, the astrophysical neutrino fluxes exhibit
a significant (factor of a few) reduction compared to the na\"ive superposition of free nucleons
for sources of UHECR nuclei with a populated cascade. The numerical code implementing the model
has been made publicly available, which facilitates the integration of our results in similar frameworks.
