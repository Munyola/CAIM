Dynamical properties of spherically symmetric galaxy models where both the stellar and total mass
density distributions are described by the Jaffe (1983) profile (with different scale-lenghts
and masses), are presented. The orbital structure of the stellar component is described by Osipkov--Merritt
anisotropy, and a black hole (BH) is added at the center of the galaxy; the dark matter halo is isotropic.
First, the conditions required to have a nowhere negative and monothonically decreasing dark matter
halo density profile, are derived. We then show that the phase-space distribution function can
be recovered by using the Lambert-Euler $W$ function, while in absence of the central BH only elementary
functions appears in the integrand of the inversion formula. The minimum value of the anisotropy
radius for consistency is derived in terms of the galaxy parameters. The Jeans equations for the
stellar component are solved analytically, and the projected velocity dispersion at the center
and at large radii are also obtained analytically for generic values of the anisotropy radius. Finally,
the relevant global quantities entering the Virial Theorem are computed analytically, and the
fiducial anisotropy limit required to prevent the onset of Radial Orbit Instability is determined
as a function of the galaxy parameters. The presented models, even though highly idealized, represent
a substantial generalization of the models presentd in Ciotti et al. (2009), and can be useful as
starting point for more advanced modeling the dynamics and the mass distribution of elliptical
galaxies.
