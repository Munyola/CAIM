We analysed the centre of NGC 1566, which hosts a well-studied active galactic nucleus (AGN), known
for its variability. With the aid of techniques such as Principal Component Analysis Tomography,
analysis of the emission-line spectra, channel maps, Penalized Pixel Fitting and spectral synthesis
applied to the optical and near-infrared data cubes, besides the analysis of Hubble Space Telescope
images, we found that: (1) the AGN has a Seyfert 1 emission, with a very strong featureless continuum
that we described as a power law with spectral index of 1.7. However, this emission may come not only
from the AGN [as its point spread function (PSF) is broader than the PSF of the broad-line region (BLR)],
but from hot and young stars, the same ones that probably account for the observed sigma-drop. (2)
There is a correlation between redshift and the full width at half-maximum of the BLR emission lines.
With a simple model assuming gravitational redshift, we described it as an emitting ring with varying
emitting radii and small inclination angles. (3) There is an H II region close to the AGN, which is
composed of many substructures forming an apparent spiral with a velocity gradient. (4) We also
detected a probable outflow coming from the AGN and it seems to contaminate the H II region emission.
(5) We identified an H2 rotating disc with orientation approximately perpendicular to this outflow.
This suggests that the rotating disc is an extension of an inner torus/disc structure, which collimates
the outflow emission, according to the Unified Model.
