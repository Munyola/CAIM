Dyson (2013) argued that the extraordinarily large number of gravitons in a gravitational wave
makes them impossible to be resolved as individual particles. While true, it is shown in this paper
that a LIGO interferometric detector also undergoes frequent and {\it discrete} quantum interactions
with an incident gravitational wave, in such a way as to allow the exchange of energy and momentum
between the wave and the detector. This opens the door to another way of clinching gravitons. The
most basic form of an interaction is the first order Fermi acceleration (deceleration) of a laser
photon as it is reflected by a test mass mirror oscillating in the gravitational wave, resulting
in a frequency blueshift (redshift) of the photon depending on whether the mirror is advancing towards
(receding from) the photon before the reflection. If \eg~a blueshift occurred, wave energy is absorbed
and the oscillation will be damped. It is demonstrated that such energy-momentum exchanging interactions
are responsible for the {\it observed} radiation reaction noise of LIGO (although the more common
way of calculating the amplitude of this noise is based on momentum considerations). Most importantly,
in each interaction the detector absorbs or emits wave energy in amounts far smaller than the standard
graviton energy $\hbar\om$ where $\om$ is the angular frequency of the gravitational wave. This
sets a very tight upper limit on the quantization of the wave energy, {\it viz.} it must be at least
$\ap 10^{11}$ times below $\hbar\om$, independently of the value of $\om$ itself.
