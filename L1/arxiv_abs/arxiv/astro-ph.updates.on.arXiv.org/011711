We present e-MERLIN and EVN observations which reveal unambiguous jet activity within radio quiet
quasar HS~0810+2554. With an intrinsic flux density of 880~nJy, this is the faintest radio source
ever imaged. The findings present new evidence against the idea that radio loud and radio quiet quasars
are powered by different underlying radio emission mechanisms, showing instead that the same AGN
mechanism can operate as the dominant source of radio emission even in the very lowest radio luminosity
quasars. Thanks to strong gravitational lensing, our source is not only visible, but with VLBI is
imaged to a scale of just 0.27~pc: the highest ever resolution image of a radio quiet quasar. Brightness
temperatures of at least $8.4\times 10^6$~K are associated with two highly compact components,
and subsequent modelling of the lensed system has revealed that the components are linearly aligned
on opposing sides of the optical quasar core, with the typical morphology of a compact symmetric
object (CSO). Given that this source has been found to fall on the radio--FIR correlation, we suggest
that the radio--FIR correlation cannot always be used to rule out AGN activity in favour of star-formation
activity. The correlation -- or at least its scatter -- may conceal the coexistence of kinetic and
radiative feedback modes in AGN. Modelling of the lensing mass itself points to a non-smooth mass
distribution, hinting at the presence of dark matter substructure which has manifested as astrometric
perturbations of the VLBI lensed images, posing no threat to the CDM paradigm.
