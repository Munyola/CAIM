Nearly 150 massive black hole binary (MBHB) candidates at sub-pc orbital separations have been
reported in recent literature. Nevertheless, the definitive detection of even a single such object
remains elusive. If at least one of the black holes is accreting, the light emitted from its accretion
disc will be lensed by the other black hole for binary orbital inclinations near to the line of sight.
This binary self-lensing could provide a unique signature of compact MBHB systems. We show that,
for MBHBs with masses in the range 10^6 - 10^10 solar masses and with orbital periods less than ~10
years, strong lensing events should occur in 1 to 10's of percent of MBHB systems that are monitored
for an entire orbit. Lensing events will last from days for the less massive, shorter period MBHBs
up to a year for the most massive ~10 year orbital period MBHBs. At small inclinations of the binary
orbit to the line of sight, lensing must occur and will be accompanied by periodicity due to the relativistic
Doppler boost. Flares at the same phase as the otherwise average flux of the Doppler modulation would
be a smoking gun signature of self-lensing and can be used to constrain binary parameters. For MBHBs
with separation >100 Schwarzschild radii, we show that finite-size source effects could serve
as a probe of MBH accretion disc structure. Finally, we stress that our lensing probability estimate
implies that ~10 of the known MBHB candidates identified through quasar periodicity should exhibit
strong lensing flares.
