We provide a new bound on the amplitude of primordial magnetic fields (PMFs) by using a novel mechanism,
named {\it magnetic reheating}. Before the epoch of recombination, PMFs induce the fluid motions
in a photon-baryon plasma through the Lorentz force. Due to the viscosity in the plasma, such induced
fluid motions would be damped and this means the dissipation of PMFs. In the early Universe with $z
\gtrsim 2 \times 10^6$, cosmic microwave background (CMB) photons are quickly thermalized with
the dissipated energy and shift to a different Planck distribution with a new temperature. In other
words, the energy injection due to the dissipation of PMFs changes the baryon-photon number ratio
during this era and we name such a process {\it magnetic reheating}. By using the current results
of the baryon-photon number ratio obtained from the Big Bang nucleosynthesis and CMB observations,
we put a strongest constraint on the amplitude of PMFs on small scales which we can not access through
CMB anisotropy and CMB distortions, $B_{0} \lesssim 1.0 \; \mu{\rm G}$ at the scales $10^{4} \; h{\rm
Mpc}^{-1} < k < 10^{8} \; h{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$. Moreover, when the spectrum of PMFs is given by the power-law,
the magnetic reheating puts a quite strong constraint in the case of the blue-tilted spectrum, for
example, $B_0 \lesssim 10^{-17} \;{\rm nG}$, $10^{-23} \;{\rm nG}$, and $10^{-29} \;{\rm nG}$
at 1~comoving Mpc for $n_{B}=1.0$, $2.0$, and $3.0$, respectively. This constraint would give
an impact on generation mechanisms of PMFs in the early Universe.
