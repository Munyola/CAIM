Recent observations show that the buildup and triggering of minifilament eruptions that drive
coronal jets result from magnetic flux cancelation at the neutral line between merging majority-
and minority-polarity magnetic flux patches. We investigate the magnetic setting of ten on-disk
small-scale UV/EUV jets (jetlets), smaller than coronal X-ray jets but larger than chromospheric
spicules) in a coronal hole by using IRIS UV images and SDOAIA EUV images and line-of-sight magnetograms
from SDO/HMI. We observe recurring jetlets at the edges of magnetic network flux lanes in the coronal
hole. From magnetograms co-aligned with the IRIS and AIA images, we find, clearly visible in nine
cases, that the jetlets stem from sites of flux cancelation proceeding at an average rate of 1.5 X
10^18 Mx hr^{-1}, and show brightenings at their bases reminiscent of the base brightenings in larger-scale
coronal jets. We find that jetlets happen at many locations along the edges of network lanes (not
limited to the base of plumes) with average lifetimes of 3 min and speeds of 70 kms. The average jetlet-base
width (4000 km) is three to four times smaller than for coronal jets (18,000 km). Based on these observations
of ten obvious jetlets, and our previous observations of larger-scale coronal jets in quiet regions
and coronal holes, we infer that flux cancelation is an essential process in the buildup and triggering
of jetlets. Our observations suggest that network jetlet eruptions might be small-scale analogs
of both larger-scale coronal jets and the still-larger-scale eruptions producing CMEs.
