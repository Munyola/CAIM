We study the alignment of irregular dust grains by mechanical torques due to the drift of grains through
the ambient gas. We first calculate mechanical torques (MATs) resulting from specular reflection
of gas atoms for seven irregular shapes: one shape of mirror symmetry, three highly irregular shapes
(HIS), and three weakly irregular shapes (WIS). We find that the grain with mirror symmetry experiences
negligible MATs due to its mirror-symmetry geometry. Three highly irregular shapes can produce
strong MATs which exhibit some generic properties as radiative torques, while three weakly irregular
shapes produce less efficient MATs. We then study grain alignment by MATs for the different angles
between the drift velocity and the ambient magnetic field, for paramagnetic and superparamagnetic
grains assuming efficient internal relaxation. We find that for HIS grains, MATs can align subsonically
drifting grains in the same way as radiative torques, with low-J and high-J attractors. For supersonic
drift, MATs can align grains with low-J and high-J attractors, analogous to radiative alignment
by anisotropic radiation. We also show that the joint action of MATs and magnetic torques in grains
with iron inclusions can lead to perfect MAT alignment. Our results point out the potential importance
of MAT alignment for HIS grains predicted by the analytical model of Lazarian \& Hoang (2007b), although
more theoretical and observational studies are required due to uncertainty in the shape of interstellar
grains. We outline astrophysical environments where MAT alignment is potentially important.
