We present results from a survey designed to probe the star formation properties of 32 damped Ly-alpha
systems (DLAs) at z~2.7. By using the "double-DLA" technique that eliminates the glare of the bright
background quasars, we directly measure the rest-frame FUV flux from DLAs and their neighbouring
galaxies. At the position of the absorbing gas, we place stringent constraints on the unobscured
star formation rates (SFRs) of DLAs to 2-sigma limits of <0.09-0.27 M/yr, corresponding to SFR
surface densities <10^(-2.6)-10^(-1.5) M/yr/kpc^2. The implications of these limits for
the star formation law, metal enrichment, and cooling rates of DLAs are examined. By studying the
distribution of impact parameters as a function of SFRs for all the galaxies detected around these
DLAs, we place new direct constraints on the bright end of the UV luminosity function of DLA hosts.
We find that <13% of the hosts have SFR>2 M/yr at impact parameters b < (SFR/(M/yr))^(0.8)+6
kpc, differently from current samples of confirmed DLA galaxies. Our observations also disfavor
a scenario in which the majority of DLAs arise from bright LBGs at distances 20 < b < 100 kpc.
These new findings corroborate a picture in which DLAs do not originate from highly star forming
systems that are coincident with the absorbers, and instead suggest that DLAs are associated with
faint, possibly isolated, star-forming galaxies. Potential shortcomings of this scenario and
future strategies for further investigation are discussed.
