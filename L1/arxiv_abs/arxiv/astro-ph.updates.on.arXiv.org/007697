IC443 is a supernova remnant located in a quite complex environment since it interacts with nearby
clouds. Indications for the presence of overionized plasma have been found though the possible
physical causes of overionization are still debated. Moreover, because of its peculiar position
and proper motion, it is not clear if the pulsar wind nebula (PWN) within the remnant is the relic of
the IC443 progenitor star or just a rambling one seen in projection on the remnant. Here we address
the study of IC443 plasma in order to clarify the relationship PWN-remnant, the presence of overionization
and the origin of the latter. We analyzed two \emph{XMM-Newton} observations producing background-subtracted,
vignetting-corrected and mosaicked images in two different energy bands and we performed a spatially
resolved spectral analysis of the X-ray emission. We identified an elongated (jet-like) structure
with Mg-rich plasma in overionization. The head of the jet is interacting with a molecular cloud
and the jet is aligned with the position of the PWN at the instant of the supernova explosion. Interestingly,
the direction of the jet of ejecta is somehow consistent with the direction of the PWN jet. Our discovery
of a jet of ejecta in IC443 enlarge the sample of core-collapse SNRs with collimated ejecta structures.
IC443's jet is the first one which shows overionized plasma, possibly associated with the adiabatic
expansion of ejecta. The match between the jet's direction and the original position of the PWN strongly
supports the association between the neutron star and IC443.
