The Sun in not located in a major spiral arm, and sits in a small Local Arm (variously called arm, armlet,
blob, branch, bridge, feather, finger, segment, spur, sub-arm, swath, etc). The diversity of names
for the Local Arm near the Sun indicates an uncertainty about its shape or pitch or its extent from
the Sun in each galactic quadrant, as well as an uncertainty about its origin. Here we extract data
about the small Local Arm near the Sun, from the recent observational literature, over many arm tracers,
and we use statistics in order to find the its mean extent from the Sun, its possible shape and pitch
angle from the direction of galactic longitude 90 degrees. Employing all tracers, the Local Arm
is about 4 kpc long by 2 kpc large. The Sun is within 1 kpc of the center of the local arm. Proposed bridges
and fingers are assessed. These bridges to nearby spiral arms and fingers across spiral arms may
not reach the nearest spiral arms, owing to kinematic and photometric distance effects. We then
compare these statistical results with some predictions from recent models proposed to explain
the local arm (perturbations, resonances, density wave, halo supercloud, debris trail from a dwarf
galaxy). The least controversial models involve importing materials from elsewhere (halo supercloud,
debris trail) as a first step, and to be later deformed in a second step (by the Galactic differential
rotation into become roughly parallel to spiral arms) and then subjected to ongoing forces (global
density waves, local perturbations).
