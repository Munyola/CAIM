A prime question in the formation and early evolution of the Solar system studies is to discern the
source(s) of short-lived now extinct nuclides and to determine the ab-initio isotopic composition
of our Solar System (ref. 1). The proposed genesis of a short-lived now extinct radionuclide,10Be,
by spallation reactions of carbon and oxygen led to the hypothesis of enhanced irradiation in the
early Solar system (ref. 2-8). An alternative scenario of production of 10Be (t1/2 =1.386 +- 0.016
million years (ref.9)) by neutrino process in a low mass star (11.8Msun) core collapse supernova
has been recently suggested (ref. 10) that can explain the observed abundance of 10Be in the early
Solar System. Here, we report well resolved excesses in 7Li/6Li of up to ~21.5 percent in a Type B1
Ca,-Al rich inclusion (CAI) from the Efremovka meteorite that correlate with 9Be/6Li, suggestive
of in situ decay of 7Be. The in situ decay of 7Be, with characteristic half-life of 53.12+- 0.07 days
(ref. 11) to 7Li, entails multiple episodes of enhanced irradiation in the ESS. The short half-life
of 7Be limits its production by interaction of Solar energetic particles with the nebular gas and
solids and provides constraints on genealogy and chronology of CAIs. Irradiation of precursor
solids/gas of CAIs of Solar composition by a superflare (Lx=10 exp(32) erg/sec) during the terminal
phase of class I or II of pre-main sequence stages of the Sun cogently explains the isotopic properties,
distinctive petrographic features, and diffusivity constraints in the CAI.
