Spectropolarimetric inversions are routinely used in the field of Solar Physics for the extraction
of physical information from observations. The application to two-dimensional fields of view
often requires the use of supercomputers with parallelized inversion codes. Even in this case,
the computing time spent on the process is still very large. Our aim is to develop a new inversion code
based on the application of convolutional neural networks that can quickly provide a three-dimensional
cube of thermodynamical and magnetic properties from the interpretation of two-dimensional maps
of Stokes profiles. We train two different architectures of fully convolutional neural networks.
To this end, we use the synthetic Stokes profiles obtained from two snapshots of three-dimensional
magneto-hydrodynamic numerical simulations of different structures of the solar atmosphere.
We provide an extensive analysis of the new inversion technique, showing that it infers the thermodynamical
and magnetic properties with a precision comparable to that of standard inversion techniques.
However, it provides several key improvements: our method is around one million times faster, it
returns a three-dimensional view of the physical properties of the region of interest in geometrical
height, it provides quantities that cannot be obtained otherwise (pressure and Wilson depression)
and the inferred properties are decontaminated from the blurring effect of instrumental point
spread functions for free. The code is provided for free on a specific repository, with options for
training and evaluation.
