Over the past two decades, an avalanche of data from multiwavelength imaging and spectroscopic
surveys has revolutionized our view of galaxy formation and evolution. Here we review the range
of complementary techniques and theoretical tools that allow astronomers to map the cosmic history
of star formation, heavy element production, and reionization of the Universe from the cosmic "dark
ages" to the present epoch. A consistent picture is emerging, whereby the star-formation rate density
peaked approximately 3.5 Gyr after the Big Bang, at z~1.9, and declined exponentially at later times,
with an e-folding timescale of 3.9 Gyr. Half of the stellar mass observed today was formed before
a redshift z = 1.3. About 25% formed before the peak of the cosmic star-formation rate density, and
another 25% formed after z = 0.7. Less than ~1% of today's stars formed during the epoch of reionization.
Under the assumption of a universal initial mass function, the global stellar mass density inferred
at any epoch matches reasonably well the time integral of all the preceding star-formation activity.
The comoving rates of star formation and central black hole accretion follow a similar rise and fall,
offering evidence for co-evolution of black holes and their host galaxies. The rise of the mean metallicity
of the Universe to about 0.001 solar by z = 6, one Gyr after the Big Bang, appears to have been accompanied
by the production of fewer than ten hydrogen Lyman-continuum photons per baryon, a rather tight
budget for cosmological reionization.
