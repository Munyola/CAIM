Gravitational wave astronomy is just beginning, after the recent success of the four direct detections
of binary black hole (BBH) mergers, the first observation from a binary neutron star inspiral and
with the expectation of many more events to come. Given the possibility to detect waves from not perfectly
modeled astrophysical processes, it is fundamental to be ready to calculate the polarization waveforms
in the case of searches using non-template algorithms. In such case, the waveform polarizations
are the only quantities that contain direct information about the generating process. We present
the performance of a new valuable tool to estimate the inverse solution of gravitational wave transient
signals, starting from the analysis of the signal properties of a non-template algorithm that is
open to a wider class of gravitational signals not covered by template algorithms. We highlight
the contributions to the wave polarization associated with the detector response, the sky localization
and the polarization angle of the source. In this paper we present the performances of such method
and its implications by using two main classes of transient signals, resembling the limiting case
for most simple and complicated morphologies. Performances are encouraging, for the tested waveforms:
the correlation between the original and the reconstructed waveforms spans from better than 80%
for simple morphologies to better than 50% for complicated ones. For a not-template search this
results can be considered satisfactory to reconstruct the astrophysical progenitor.
