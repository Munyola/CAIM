Unusual extinction curves of high-redshift QSOs have been taken as evidence that dust is primarily
produced by supernovae at high redshift. In particular, the 3000 A Todini-Ferrara-Maiolino kink
in the extinction curve of the z = 6.20 SDSS J1048+4637 has been attributed to supernova dust. Here
we discuss the challenges in inferring robust extinction curves of high-redshift QSOs and critically
assess previous claims of detection of supernova dust. In particular, we address the sensitivity
to the choice of intrinsic QSO spectrum, the need for a long wavelength baseline, and the drawbacks
in fitting theoretical extinction curves. In a sample of 21 QSOs at z ~ 6 we detect significant ultraviolet
extinction using existing broad-band optical, near-infrared, and Spitzer photometry. The median
extinction curve is consistent with a Small Magellanic Cloud curve with A_1450 ~ 0.7 mag and does
not exhibit any conspicuous (restframe) 2175 A or 3000 A features. For two QSOs, SDSS J1044-0125
at z = 5.78 and SDSS J1030+0524 at z = 6.31, we further present X-shooter spectra covering the wavelength
range 0.9-2.5 um. The resulting non-parametric extinction curves do not exhibit the 3000 A kink.
Finally, in a re-analysis of literature spectra of SDSS J1048+4637, we do not find evidence for a
conspicuous kink. We conclude that the existing evidence for a 3000 A feature is weak and that the
overall dust properties at high and low redshift show no significant differences. This, however,
does not preclude supernovae from dominating the dust budget at high redshift.
