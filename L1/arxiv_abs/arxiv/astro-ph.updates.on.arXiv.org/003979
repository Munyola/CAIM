The properties of the dusty tori in active galactic nuclei (AGNs) have been investigated in detail,
mainly focusing on the geometry and components; however, the kinematics of the torus is still not
clear. The narrow iron K$\alpha$ line at 6.4 keV is thought to be produced by the X-ray reflection
from the torus. Thus, the velocity-resolved reverberation mapping of it is able to constrain the
kinematics of the torus. Such effort is limited by the spectral resolution of current CCD detectors
and should be possible with the microcalorimeter on the next generation X-ray satellite. In this
paper, we first construct the response functions of the torus under a uniform inflow, a Keplerian
rotation, and a uniform outflow. Then the energy-dependent light curve of the narrow iron K$\alpha$
line is simulated according to the performance of the X-ray Integral Field Unit in Athena. Finally,
the energy-dependent cross-correlation function is calculated to reveal the kinematic signal.
According to our results, one hundred observations with 5 ks exposure of each are sufficient to distinguish
the above three velocity fields. Although the real geometry and velocity field of the torus could
be more complex than we assumed, the present result proves the feasibility of the velocity-resolved
reverberation mapping of the narrow iron K$\alpha$ line. The combination of the dynamics of the
torus with those of the broad line region and the host galaxy is instructive for the understanding
of the feeding and feedback process of AGNs.
