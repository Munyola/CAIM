Dark Energy not only has background effects through its equation of state $w_{DE}$, but also it can
cluster through its sound speed $c^2_{sDE}$, subject to certain conditions. As is well-known,
for dynamical dark energy models, dark energy perturbations get sourced into matter perturbations
through metric perturbations which is always accompanied by the term $(1+w_{DE})$. Hence, for
dynamical dark energy models with $w_{DE}$ close $-1$, their perturbations get almost decoupled
from metric leaving nearly null imprints on matter power spectra. Furthermore, Quintessence models
with its sound speed equal to speed of light, washes out almost any inhomogeneities occurred within
sub-Hubble scales, hence making detectability of dark energy perturbations far more difficult
than already is. In this article we look for these imprints by going beyond Quintessence considering
an Early Dark Energy parametrization that not only have a non-negligible energy density at early
times, but also it can achieve $w_{DE}$ far from $-1$, making dark energy perturbations detectable
in sub-horizon scales. With the help of current datasets, we are able to constrain sound speed of
dark energy to a low value ($c^2_{sDE} \sim 0.14$), along with a much higher range allowed for early
dark energy density, with strong constraints on it ($\Omega_e \sim 0.02$). We discuss effects of
different datasets on this parametrization along with possible explanation for deviation on certain
parameter(s) comparing between $c^2_{sDE}=1$ case and the case where it is kept open.
