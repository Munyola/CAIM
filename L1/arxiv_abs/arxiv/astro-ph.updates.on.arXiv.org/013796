Motivated by the recently discovered kinematic "Hubble sequence" shown by the stellar orbit-circularity
distribution of 260 CALIFA galaxies, we make use of a comparable galaxy sample at z = 0 with a stellar
mass range from 5E9 to 5E11 solar masses, selected from the IllustrisTNG simulation and study their
stellar orbit compositions in relation to a number of other fundamental galaxy properties.We find
that the TNG100 simulation broadly reproduces the observed fractions of different orbital components
and their stellar mass dependencies. In particular, the mean mass dependencies of the luminosity
fractions for the kinematically warm and hot orbits are well reproduced within model uncertainties
of the observed galaxies. The simulation also largely reproduces the observed peak and trough features
at a stellar mass of 1-2E10 solar masses, in the mean distributions of the cold- and hot-orbit fractions,
respectively, indicating fewer cooler orbits and more hotter orbits in both more- and less-massive
galaxies beyond such a mass range. Several marginal disagreements are seen between the simulation
and observations: the average cold-orbit (counter-rotating) fractions of the simulated galaxies
below (above) a stellar mass of 6E10 solar masses, are systematically higher than the observational
data by < 10% (absolute orbital fraction); the simulation also seems to produce more scatter for
the cold-orbit fraction and less so for the non-cold orbits at any given galaxy mass. Possible causes
that stem from the adopted heating mechanisms are discussed.
