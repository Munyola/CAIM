Using archival X-ray observations and a log-normal population model, we estimate constraints
on the intrinsic scatter in halo mass at fixed optical richness for a galaxy cluster sample identified
in Dark Energy Survey Year-One (DES-Y1) data with the redMaPPer algorithm. We examine the scaling
behavior of X-ray temperatures, $T_X$, with optical richness, $\lambda_{RM}$, for clusters in
the redshift range $0.2<z<0.7$. X-ray temperatures are obtained from Chandra and XMM observations
for 58 and 110 redMaPPer systems, respectively. Despite non-uniform sky coverage, the $T_X$ measurements
are $> 50\%$ complete for clusters with $\lambda_{RM} > 130$. Regression analysis on the two samples
produces consistent posterior scaling parameters, from which we derive a combined constraint
on the residual scatter, $\sigma_{\ln Tx | \lambda} = 0.275 \pm 0.019$. Joined with constraints
for $T_X$ scaling with halo mass from the Weighing the Giants program and richness--temperature
covariance estimates from the LoCuSS sample, we derive the richness-conditioned scatter in mass,
$\sigma_{\ln M | \lambda} = 0.30 \pm 0.04\, _{({\rm stat})} \pm 0.09\, _{({\rm sys})}$, at an optical
richness of approximately 70. Uncertainties in external parameters, particularly the slope and
variance of the $T_X$--mass relation and the covariance of $T_X$ and $\lambda_{RM}$ at fixed mass,
dominate the systematic error. The $95\%$ confidence region from joint sample analysis is relatively
broad, $\sigma_{\ln M | \lambda} \in [0.14, \, 0.55]$, or a factor ten in variance.
