Exploiting the full statistical power of future cosmic shear surveys will necessitate improvements
to the accuracy with which the gravitational lensing signal is measured. We present a framework
for calibrating shear with image simulations that demonstrates the importance of including realistic
correlations between galaxy morphology, size and more importantly, photometric redshifts. This
realism is essential so that selection and shape measurement biases can be calibrated accurately
for a tomographic cosmic shear analysis. We emulate Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS) observations of
the COSMOS field using morphological information from {\it Hubble} Space Telescope imaging, faithfully
reproducing the measured galaxy properties from KiDS observations of the same field. We calibrate
our shear measurements from lensfit, and find through a range of sensitivity tests that lensfit
is robust and unbiased within the allowed 2 per cent tolerance of our study. Our results show that
the calibration has to be performed by selecting the tomographic samples in the simulations, consistent
with the actual cosmic shear analysis, because the joint distributions of galaxy properties are
found to vary with redshift. Ignoring this redshift variation could result in misestimating the
shear bias by an amount that exceeds the allowed tolerance. To improve the calibration for future
cosmic shear analyses, it will be essential to also correctly account for the measurement of photometric
redshifts, which requires simulating multi-band observations.
