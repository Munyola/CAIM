We present Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) images of 20 TeV blazars (HBLs) not previously well-studied
on the parsec scale. Observations were made between August and December 2013, at a frequency of 8.4
GHz. These observations represent the first epoch of a VLBA monitoring campaign on these blazars,
and they significantly increase the fraction of TeV HBLs studied with high-resolution imaging.
The peak VLBI flux densities of these sources range from about 10 to 100 mJy/beam, and parsec-scale
jet structure is detected in all sources. About half of the VLBI cores are resolved, with brightness
temperature upper limits of a few times 10^10 K, and we find that a brightness temperature of about
2x10^10 K is consistent with the VLBI data for all but one of the sources. Such brightness temperatures
do not require any relativistic beaming to reduce the observed value below commonly invoked intrinsic
limits; however, the lack of detection of counter-jets does place a modest limit on the bulk Lorentz
factor of greater than about 2. These data are thus consistent with a picture where weak-jet sources
like the TeV HBLs develop significant velocity structures on parsec-scales. We also extend consideration
to the full sample of TeV HBLs by combining the new VLBI data with VLBI and gamma-ray data from the literature.
By comparing measured VLBI and TeV fluxes to samples with intrinsically uncorrelated luminosities
generated by Monte Carlo simulations, we find a marginally significant correlation between the
VLBI and TeV fluxes for the full TeV HBL sample.
