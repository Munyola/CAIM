The use of SN rates to probe explosion scenarios and to trace the cosmic star formation history received
a boost from a number of synoptic surveys. There has been a recent claim of a mismatch by a factor of
two between star formation and core collapse SN rates, and different explanations have been proposed
for this discrepancy.} We attempted an independent test of the relation between star formation
and supernova rates in the extreme environment of starburst galaxies, where both star formation
and extinction are extremely high. To this aim we conducted an infrared supernova search in a sample
of local starburts galaxies. The rational to search in the infrared is to reduce the bias due to extinction,
which is one of the putative reasons for the observed discrepancy between star formation and supernova
rates. To evaluate the outcome of the search we developed a MonteCarlo simulation tool that is used
to predict the number and properties of the expected supernovae based on the search characteristics
and the current understanding of starburst galaxies and supernovae. During the search we discovered
6 supernovae (4 with spectroscopic classification) which is in excellent agreement with the prediction
of the MonteCarlo simulation tool that is, on average, $5.3\pm2.3$ events. The number of supernovae
detected in starburst galaxies is consistent with that predicted from their high star formation
rate when we recognize that a major fraction ($\sim 60%$) of the events remains hidden in the unaccessible,
high density nuclear regions because of a combination of reduced search efficiency and high extinction.
