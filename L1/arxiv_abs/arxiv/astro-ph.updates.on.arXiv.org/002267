The formation and evolution of dwarf galaxies in clusters need to be understood, and this requires
large aperture telescopes. In this sense, we selected the Antlia cluster to continue our previous
work in the Virgo, Fornax, and Hydra clusters and in the Local Volume (LV). Because of the scarce available
literature data, we selected a small sample of five blue compact dwarf (BCD) candidates in Antlia
for observation. Using the Gemini South and GMOS camera, we acquired the Halpha imaging needed to
detect star-forming regions in this sample. With the long-slit spectroscopic data of the brightest
seven knots detected in three BCD candidates, we derived their basic chemical properties. Using
archival VISTA VHS survey images, we derived K_S magnitudes and surface brightness profile fits
for the whole sample to assess basic physical properties. FS90-98, FS90-106, and FS90-147 are confirmed
as BCDs and cluster members, based on their morphology, K_S surface photometry, oxygen abundance,
and velocity redshift. FS90-155 and FS90-319 did not show any H{\alpha} emission, and they could
not be confirmed as dwarf cluster star-forming galaxies. Based on our data, we studied some fundamental
relations to compare star forming dwarfs (BCDs and dIs) in the LV and in the Virgo, Fornax, Hydra,
and Antlia clusters. Star-forming dwarfs in nearby clusters appear to follow same fundamental
relations in the near infrared with similar objects in the LV, specifically the size-luminosity
and the metallicity-luminosity, while other more fundamental relations could not be checked in
Antlia due to lack of data.
