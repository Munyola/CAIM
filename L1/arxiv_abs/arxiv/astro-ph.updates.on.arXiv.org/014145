A star coming too close to a supermassive black hole gets disrupted by the tidal force of the compact
object in a tidal disruption event, or TDE. Following this encounter, the debris evolves into an
elongated stream, half of which coming back to pericenter. Relativistic apsidal precession then
leads to a self-crossing shock that initiates the formation of an accretion disc. We perform the
first simulation of this process considering a realistic stellar trajectory and black hole mass,
which has so far eluded investigations for computational reasons. This numerical issue is alleviated
by using as initial conditions the outflow launched by the self-crossing shock according the local
simulation of Lu & Bonnerot (2019). We find that the gas leaving the intersection point experiences
numerous secondary shocks that result in the rapid formation of a thick and marginally-bound disc.
The mass distribution features two overdensities identified as spiral shocks that drive slow gas
inflow along the mid-plane. Inward motion primarily takes place along the funnels of the newly-formed
torus, from which a fraction of the matter can get accreted. Further out, the gas moves outward forming
an extended envelope completely surrounding the accretion flow. Secondary shocks heat the debris
at a rate of a few times $10^{44} \, \rm erg \, s^{-1}$ with a large fraction likely participating to
the bolometric luminosity. These results pave the way towards a complete understanding of the early
radiation from TDEs that progressively becomes accessible from observations.
