We report our independent GeV gamma-ray study of the young shell-type supernova remnant (SNR) Kes
73 which harbors a central magnetar, and CO-line millimeter observations toward the SNR. Using
7.6 years of Fermi-LAT observation data, we detected an extended gamma-ray source ("source A")
with the centroid on the west of the SNR, with a significance of 21.6 sigma in 0.1-300 GeV and an error
circle of 5.4 arcminute in angular radius. The gamma-ray spectrum cannot be reproduced by a pure
leptonic emission or a pure emission from the magnetar, and thus a hadronic emission component is
needed. The CO-line observations reveal a molecular cloud (MC) at V_LSR~90 km/s, which demonstrates
morphological correspondence with the western boundary of the SNR brightened in multiwavelength.
The 12CO (J=2-1)/12CO (J=1-0) ratio in the left (blue) wing 85-88 km/s is prominently elevated to
~1.1 along the northwestern boundary, providing kinematic evidence of the SNR-MC interaction.
This SNR-MC association yields a kinematic distance 9 kpc to Kes 73. The MC is shown to be capable of
accounting for the hadronic gamma-ray emission component. The gamma-ray spectrum can be interpreted
with a pure hadronic emission or a magnetar+hadronic hybrid emission. In the case of pure hadronic
emission, the spectral index of the protons is 2.4, very similar to that of the radio-emitting electrons,
essentially consistent with the diffusive shock acceleration theory. In the case of magnetar+hadronic
hybrid emission, a magnetic field decay rate >= 10^36 erg/s is needed to power the magnetar's curvature
radiation.
