We present an empirical stellar spectra library created using spectra from the Large Sky Area Multi-Object
Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST) DR5. This library represents a uniform data set ranging
from 3750 through 8500K in effective temperature (T_eff), from -2.5 through +1.0 dex in metallicity
([Fe/H]), and from 0 to 5.0 dex in gravity (log g). The spectra in the library have resolution R~1800,
with well-calibrated fluxes and rest-framed wavelengths. Using a large number of red stars observed
by LAMOST, we generated denser K type templates to fill in data missing from current empirical spectral
libraries, particularly the late K type. For K giants, we calibrated the spectroscopic surface
gravities against the asteroseismic surface gravities. To verify the reliability of the parameters
labeled for this library, we performed an internal cross-validation by using a chi^2 minimization
method to interpolate parameters of each individual spectrum using the remaining spectra in the
library. We obtained precisions of 41 K, 0.11 dex, and 0.05 dex for T_eff, log g, and [Fe/H], respectively,
which means the templates are labeled with correct stellar parameters. Through external comparisons,
we confirmed that measurements of the stellar parameters through this library can achieve accuracies
of approximately 125K in T_eff, 0.1 dex in [Fe/H] and 0.20 dex in log g without systematic offset.
This empirical library is useful for stellar parameter measurements because it has large parameter
coverage and full wavelength coverage from 3800 to 8900A.
