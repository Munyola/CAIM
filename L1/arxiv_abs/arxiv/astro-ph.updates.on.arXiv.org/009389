In this paper, we study the effects of a recent drop in star formation rate (SFR) on the spectra of epoch
of reionization (EoR) galaxies, and the resulting degeneracy with the spectral features produced
by extreme Lyman continuum leakage. In order to study these effects in the wavelength range relevant
for the upcoming James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), we utilize synthetic spectra of simulated EoR
galaxies from cosmological simulations together with synthetic spectra of partially quenched
mock galaxies. We find that rapid declines in the SFR of EoR galaxies could seriously affect the applicability
of methods that utilize the equivalent width of Balmer lines and the ultraviolet spectral slope
to assess the escape fraction of EoR galaxies. In order to determine if the aforementioned degeneracy
can be avoided by using the overall shape of the spectrum, we generate mock NIRCam observations and
utilize a classification algorithm to identify galaxies that have undergone quenching. We find
that while there are problematic cases, JWST/NIRCam or NIRSpec should be able to reliably identify
galaxies with redshifts $z\sim 7$ that have experienced a significant decrease in the SFR (by a factor
10-100) in the past 50-100 Myr with a success rate $\gtrsim 85\%$. We also find that uncertainties
in the dust-reddening effects on EoR galaxies significantly affect the performance of the results
of the classification algorithm. We argue that studies that aim to characterize the dust extinction
law most representative in the EoR would be extremely useful.
