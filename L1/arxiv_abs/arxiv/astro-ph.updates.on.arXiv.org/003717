Geodetic precession has been observed directly in the double-pulsar system PSR J0737-3039. Its
rate has even been measured and agrees with predictions of general relativity. Very recently, the
double pulsar has been detected in X-rays and gamma-rays. This fuels the hope observing geodetic
precession in the high-energy pulse profile of this system. Unfortunately, the geometric configuration
of the binary renders any detection of such an effect unlikely. Nevertheless, this precession is
probably present in other relativistic binaries or double neutron star systems containing at least
one X-ray or gamma-ray pulsar.}{We compute the variation of the high-energy pulse profile expected
from this geodetic motion according to the striped-wind model. We compare our results with two-pole
caustic and outer gap emission patterns.}{For a sufficient misalignment between the orbital angular
momentum and the spin angular momentum, a significant change in the pulse profile as a result of geodetic
precession is expected in the X-ray and gamma-ray energy band.}{The essential features of the striped
wind are indicated in several plots showing the evolution of the maximum of the pulsed intensity,
the separation of both peaks, if present, and the variation in the width of each peak. We highlight
the main differences with other competing high-energy models.}{We make some predictions about
possible future detection of high-energy emission from double neutron star systems with the highest
spin precession rate. Such observations will definitely favour some pulsed high-energy emission
scenarios.
