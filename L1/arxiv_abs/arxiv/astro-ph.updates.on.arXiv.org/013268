We present imaging and spectroscopic observations of 6478 Gault, a 6 km diameter inner main-belt
asteroid currently exhibiting strong, comet-like characteristics. Three distinct tails indicate
that ultra-slow dust (ejection speed 0.15+/-0.05 m/s) was emitted from Gault in separate episodes
beginning UT 2018 October 28+/-5 (Tail A), UT 2018 December 31+/-5 (Tail B), and UT 2019 February
10+/-7, with durations of 10 to 20 days. With a mean particle radius 100 micron, the estimated masses
of the tails are M_A = 2e7 kg, M_B = 3e6 kg and M_C = 3e5 kg, respectively, and the mass loss rates from
the nucleus are 10 to 20 kg/s for Tail A, 2 to 3 kg/s for Tail B and about 0.2 kg/s for Tail C. In its optical
colors Gault is more similar to C-type asteroids than to S-types, even though the latter are numerically
dominant in the inner asteroid belt. A spectroscopic upper limit to the production of gas is set at
1 kg/s. Discrete emission in three protracted episodes effectively rules out an impact origin for
the observed activity. Sublimation driven activity is unlikely given the inner belt orbit and the
absence of detectable gas. In any case, sublimation would not easily account for the observed multiple
ejections. The closest similarity is between Gault and active asteroid 311P/(2013 P5), an object
showing repeated but aperiodic ejections of dust over a 9 month period. While Gault is 10 times larger
than 311P/(2013 P5), and the spin-up time to radiation torques is 100 times longer, its properties
are likewise most consistent with episodic emission from a body rotating near breakup.
