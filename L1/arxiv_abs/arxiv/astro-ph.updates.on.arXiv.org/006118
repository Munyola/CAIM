We present high-precision timing data over timespans of up to 11 years for 45 millisecond pulsars
observed as part of the North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves (NANOGrav)
project, aimed at detecting and characterizing low-frequency gravitational waves. The pulsars
were observed with the Arecibo Observatory and/or the Green Bank Telescope at frequencies ranging
from 327 MHz to 2.3 GHz. Most pulsars were observed with approximately monthly cadence, with six
high--timing-precision pulsars observed weekly, and all were observed at widely separated frequencies
at each observing epoch in order to fit for time-variable dispersion delays. We describe our methods
for data processing, time-of-arrival (TOA) calculation, and the implementation of a new, automated
method for removing outlier TOAs. We fit a timing model for each pulsar which includes spin, astrometric,
and, if necessary, binary parameters, in addition to time-variable dispersion delays and parameters
that quantify pulse-profile evolution with frequency. The new timing solutions provide three
new parallax measurements, two new Shapiro-delay measurements, and two new measurements of large
orbital-period variations. We fit models that characterize sources of noise for each pulsar. We
find that 11 pulsars show significant red noise, with generally smaller spectral indices than typically
measured for non-recycled pulsars, possibly suggesting a different origin. Future papers will
use these data to constrain or detect the signatures of gravitational-wave signals.
