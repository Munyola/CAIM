The Deep Impact spacecraft fly-by of comet 103P/Hartley 2 occurred on 2010 November 4, one week after
perihelion with a closest approach (CA) distance of about 700 km. We used narrowband images obtained
by the Medium Resolution Imager (MRI) onboard the spacecraft to study the gas and dust in the innermost
coma. We derived an overall dust reddening of 15\%/100 nm between 345 and 749 nm and identified a blue
enhancement in the dust coma in the sunward direction within 5 km from the nucleus, which we interpret
as a localized enrichment in water ice. OH column density maps show an anti-sunward enhancement
throughout the encounter except for the highest resolution images, acquired at CA, where a radial
jet becomes visible in the innermost coma, extending up to 12 km from the nucleus. The OH distribution
in the inner coma is very different from that expected for a fragment species. Instead, it correlates
well with the water vapor map derived by the HRI-IR instrument onboard Deep Impact \citep{AHearn2011}.
Radial profiles of the OH column density and derived water production rates show an excess of OH emission
during CA that cannot be explained with pure fluorescence. We attribute this excess to a prompt emission
process where photodissociation of H$_2$O directly produces excited OH*($A^2\it{\Sigma}^+$)
radicals. Our observations provide the first direct imaging of Near-UV prompt emission of OH. We
therefore suggest the use of a dedicated filter centered at 318.8 nm to directly trace the water in
the coma of comets.
