We present an analysis of the core linear polarization properties of 387 parsec-scale active galactic
nuclei (AGN) jets. Using 15 GHz VLBA data, we revisit the conclusions of the first paper in this series
with multi-epoch measurements and more detailed analysis of a larger AGN sample which spans a broader
range of synchrotron peak frequencies. Each AGN has been observed for at least five epochs between
1996 and 2017. We find that BL Lac objects have core electric vector position angles (EVPAs) which
tend towards alignment with the local jet direction; compared to flat spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs),
their EVPAs are also less variable over time. The AGN cores which are most fractionally polarized
and least variable in polarization have EVPAs that are closely aligned with the local jet direction;
they also have low variability in EVPA. These results support the popular model of a standing transverse
shock at the base of the jet which collimates the jet magnetic field perpendicular to the jet direction,
increasing the fractional polarization and leading to greater polarization stability over time.
High-synchrotron-peaked (HSP) BL Lac objects form a low luminosity, low fractional polarization
population. The five narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies in our sample have low fractional polarization
and large EVPA-jet misalignments. Although AGN detected at gamma-rays are thought to be more Doppler
boosted than non-detected AGN, we find no significant differences in fractional polarization
based on detection by Fermi-LAT; the gamma-loud AGN are, however, more variable in core EVPAs.
