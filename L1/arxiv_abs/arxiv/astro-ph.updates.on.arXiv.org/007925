Mass estimators are a key tool to infer the distribution of dark matter in pressure-supported systems
like dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs). We construct an estimator for enclosed masses based on
the virial theorem which is insensitive to anisotropy in the velocity dispersion and tailored to
yield masses with minimum uncertainty introduced by our ignorance on (i) the shape of the inner halo
profile, and (ii) how deeply the stellar component is embedded within the halo: $M(<1.8\,R_\mathrm{h})
\approx 3.5 \times 1.8\,R_\mathrm{h} \langle \sigma_\mathrm{los}^2 \rangle G^{-1}$, where
by $R_\mathrm{h}$ we denote the projected half-light radius and by $\langle \sigma_\mathrm{los}^2
\rangle$ the luminosity-averaged squared line-of-sight velocity dispersion. Tests against
controlled simulations show that this method provides unbiased mass estimates with an accuracy
of $\sim 10$ per cent. Application to published kinematic data of Milky Way dSphs reveals a tight
correlation between enclosed mass and luminosity. Using $N$-body models we show that tidal stripping
has little effect on this relation. Comparison against cuspy and cored dark matter haloes extracted
from controlled re-simulations of the Aquarius A2 merger tree show that the high mass densities
of ultra-faint galaxies are not compatible with large dark matter cores, and that the (total) halo
masses of the Milky Way dSphs span a remarkably narrow range ($8 \lesssim \lg(M/\mathrm{M_\odot})
\lesssim 10$) at present, showing no clear trend with either galaxy size or luminosity.
