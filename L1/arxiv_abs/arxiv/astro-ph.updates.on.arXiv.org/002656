The dark matter halo of the Milky Way is expected to be triaxial and filled with substructure. It is
hoped that streams or shells of stars produced by tidal disruption of stellar systems will provide
precise measures of the gravitational potential to test these predictions. We develop a method
for inferring the Galactic potential with tidal streams based on the idea that the stream stars were
once close in phase space. Our method can flexibly adapt to any form for the Galactic potential: it
works in phase-space rather than action-space and hence relies neither on our ability to derive
actions nor on the integrability of the potential. Our model is probabilistic, with a likelihood
function and priors on the parameters. The method can properly account for finite observational
uncertainties and missing data dimensions. We test our method on synthetic datasets generated
from N-body simulations of satellite disruption in a static, multi-component Milky Way including
a triaxial dark matter halo with observational uncertainties chosen to mimic current and near-future
surveys of various stars. We find that with just four well-measured stream stars, we can infer properties
of a triaxial potential with precisions of order 5-7 percent. Without proper motions we obtain 15
percent constraints on potential parameters and precisions around 25 percent for recovering missing
phase-space coordinates. These results are encouraging for the eventual goal of using flexible,
time-dependent potential models combined with larger data sets to unravel the detailed shape of
the dark matter distribution around the Milky Way.
