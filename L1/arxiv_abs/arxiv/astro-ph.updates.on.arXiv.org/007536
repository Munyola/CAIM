This is the first in a series of papers examining the demographics of star-forming galaxies at $0.2<z<2.5$
in CANDELS. We study 9,100 galaxies from GOODS-S and UDS having published values of redshifts, masses,
star-formation rates (SFRs), and dust attenuation ($A_V$) derived from UV-optical SED fitting.
In agreement with previous works, we find that the $UVJ$ colors of a galaxy are closely correlated
with its specific star-formation rate (SSFR) and $A_V$. We define rotated $UVJ$ coordinate axes,
termed $S_\mathrm{SED}$ and $C_\mathrm{SED}$, that are parallel and perpendicular to the star-forming
sequence and derive a quantitative calibration that predicts SSFR from $C_\mathrm{SED}$ with
an accuracy of ~0.2 dex. SFRs from UV-optical fitting and from UV+IR values based on Spitzer/MIPS
24 $\mu\mathrm{m}$ agree well overall, but systematic differences of order 0.2 dex exist at high
and low redshifts. A novel plotting scheme conveys the evolution of multiple galaxy properties
simultaneously, and dust growth, as well as star-formation decline and quenching, exhibit "mass-accelerated
evolution" ("downsizing"). A population of transition galaxies below the star-forming main sequence
is identified. These objects are located between star-forming and quiescent galaxies in $UVJ$
space and have lower $A_V$ and smaller radii than galaxies on the main sequence. Their properties
are consistent with their being in transit between the two regions. The relative numbers of quenched,
transition, and star-forming galaxies are given as a function of mass and redshift.
