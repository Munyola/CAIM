We present a semi-analytic, computationally inexpensive model to identify halos capable of forming
a Population III star in cosmological simulations across a wide range of times and environments.
This allows for a much more complete and representative set of Population III star forming halos
to be constructed, which will lead to Population III star formation simulations that more accurately
reflect the diversity of Population III stars, both in time and halo mass. This model shows that Population
III and chemically enriched stars coexist beyond the formation of the first generation of stars
in a cosmological simulation until at least z~10, and likely beyond, though Population III stars
form at rates that are 4-6 orders of magnitude lower than chemically enriched stars by z=10. A catalog
of more than 40,000 candidate Population III forming halos were identified, with formation times
temporally ranging from z=30 to z=10, and ranging in mass from 2.3x10^5 M_sun to 1.2x10^10 M_sun.
At early times, the environment that Population III stars form in is very similar to that of halos
hosting chemically enriched star formation. At later times Population III stars are found to form
in low-density regions that are not yet chemically polluted due to a lack of previous star formation
in the area. Population III star forming halos become increasingly spatially isolated from one
another at later times, and are generally closer to halos hosting chemically enriched star formation
than to another halo hosting Population III star formation by z~10.
