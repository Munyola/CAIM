We report on the acceleration properties of 329 features in 95 blazar jets from the MOJAVE VLBA program.
Nearly half the features and three-quarters of the jets show significant changes in speed and/or
direction. In general, apparent speed changes are distinctly larger than changes in direction,
indicating that changes in the Lorentz factors of jet features dominate the observed speed changes
rather than bends along the line of sight. Observed accelerations tend to increase the speed of features
near the jet base, $\lesssim 10-20$ parsecs projected, and decrease their speed at longer distances.
The range of apparent speeds at fixed distance in an individual jet can span a factor of a few, indicating
that shock properties and geometry may influence the apparent motions; however, we suggest that
the broad trend of jet features increasing their speed near the origin is due to an overall acceleration
of the jet flow out to de-projected distances of order $10^2$ parsecs, beyond which the flow begins
to decelerate or remains nearly constant in speed. We estimate intrinsic rates of change of the Lorentz
factors in the galaxy frame of order $\dot{\Gamma}/\Gamma \simeq 10^{-3}$ to $10^{-2}$ per year
which can lead to total Lorentz factor changes of a factor of a few on the length scales observed here.
Finally, we also find evidence for jet collimation at projected distances of $\lesssim 10$ parsecs
in the form of the non-radial motion and bending accelerations that tend to better align features
with the inner jet.
