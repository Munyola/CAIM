We present a detailed analysis of GRB 151006A, the first GRB detected by Astrosat CZT Imager (CZTI).
We study the long term spectral evolution by exploiting the capabilities of \emph{Fermi} and \emph{Swift}
satellites at different phases, which is complemented by the polarization measurement with the
CZTI. While the light curve of the GRB in different energy bands show a simple pulse profile, the spectrum
shows an unusual evolution. The first phase exhibits a hard-to-soft (HTS) evolution until $\sim16-20$\,s,
followed by a sudden increase in the spectral peak reaching a few MeV. Such a dramatic change in the
spectral evolution in case of a single pulse burst is reported for the first time. This is captured
by all models we used namely, Band function, Blackbody+Band and two blackbodies+power law. Interestingly,
the \emph{Fermi} Large Area Telescope (LAT) also detects its first photon ($>100$\,MeV) during
this time. This new injection of energy may be associated with either the beginning of afterglow
phase, or a second hard pulse of the prompt emission itself which, however, is not seen in the otherwise
smooth pulse profile. By constructing Bayesian blocks and studying the hardness evolution we find
a good evidence for a second hard pulse. The \emph{Swift} data at late epochs ($>T_{90}$ of the GRB)
also shows a significant spectral evolution consistent with the early second phase. The CZTI data
(100--350\,keV), though having low significance ($1\sigma$), show high values of polarization
in the two epochs ($77\%$ to $94\%$), in agreement with our interpretation.
