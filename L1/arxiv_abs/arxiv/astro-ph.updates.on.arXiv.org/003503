Young massive clusters are as young as open clusters but more massive and compact compared with typical
open clusters. The formation process of young massive clusters is still unclear, and it is an open
question whether the formation process is the same as typical open clusters or not. We perform a series
of $N$-body simulations starting from initial conditions constructed from the results of hydrodynamical
simulations of turbulent molecular clouds. In our simulations, both open clusters and young massive
clusters form when we assume a density-dependent star formation efficiency. We find that a local
star formation efficiency higher than 50 % is necessary for the formation of young massive clusters,
but open clusters forms from less dense regions with a local star formation efficiency of $<50$
%. We confirm that the young massive clusters formed in our simulations have mass, size, and density
profile similar to those of observed young massive clusters such as NGC 3603 and Trumpler 14. We also
find that these simulated clusters evolve via hierarchical mergers of sub-clusters within a few
Myr, as is suggested by recent simulations and observations. Although we do not assume initial mass
segregation, we observe that the simulated massive clusters show a shallower slope of the mass function
($\Gamma\sim-1$) in the cluster center compared to that of the entire cluster ($\Gamma\sim-1.3$).
These values are consistent with those of some young massive clusters in the Milky Way such as Westerlund
1 and Arches.
