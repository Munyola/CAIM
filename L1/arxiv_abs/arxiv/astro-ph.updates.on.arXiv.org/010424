Context: Astrometric gravitational microlensing is an excellent tool to determine the mass of
stellar objects. Using precise astrometric measurements of the lensed position of a background
source in combination with accurate predictions of the positions of the lens and the unlensed source
it is possible to determine the mass of the lens with an accuracy of a few percent. Aims: Making use
of the recently published Gaia Data Release 2 (DR2) catalogue, we want to predict astrometric microlensing
events caused by foreground stars with high proper motion passing a background source in the coming
decades. Methods: We selected roughly 148 000 high-proper-motion stars from Gaia DR2 with $\mu_{tot}
> 150\,\mathrm{mas/yr}$ as potential lenses. We then searched for background sources close to
their paths. Using the astrometric parameters of Gaia DR2, we calculated the future positions of
source and lens. With a nested-intervals algorithm we determined the date and separation of the
closest approach. Using Gaia DR2 photometry we determined an approximate mass of the lens, which
we used to calculate the expected microlensing effects. Results: We predict 3914 microlensing
events caused by 2875 different lenses between 2010 and 2065, with expected shifts larger than $0.1\,\mathrm{mas}$
between the lensed and unlensed positions of the source. Of those, 513 events are expected to happen
between 2014.5 - 2026.5 and might be measured by Gaia. For 127 events we also expect a magnification
between $1\,\mathrm{mmag}$ and $3\,\mathrm{mag}$.
