Lifetimes of protoplanetary disks (PPDs) are believed to be severely constrained by material depleting
mechanisms, including photoevaporative winds due to the host star radiation or external radiation
sources. Most previous studies focused on exploring the role of the winds in the exposed PPDs with
a single star; however, exploring the evolution of the circumbinary disks with the photoevaporative
winds driven by the host star radiation and external radiation sources deserves further investigation.
In this study, we investigate the evolution of the circumbinary PPDs with the photoevaporative
winds induced by external far ultraviolet (FUV) radiation field. We show that this mass-loss process
can significantly constrain properties of a circumbinary PPD, including its lifetime, mass and
radius. The lifetime of a circumbinary PPD, for instance, is found by a factor of about two longer
than a similar circumstellar disk and this enhancement strongly depends on the viscosity parameter.
But our model shows that viscosity dependence of the disk lifetime in the circumbinary case is more
pronounced compared to the circumstellar case. We also show that dispersal of a circumbinary PPD
occurs over a longer time as the disk temperature distribution becomes steeper. Our results also
imply that dead zone in a photoevaporative circumbinary PPD extends over a larger radial range in
comparison to a circumstellar disk counterpart. We also show that our calculations are in agreement
with the observed circumbinary PPDs orbiting equal-mass binaries.
