Very high energy gamma-ray emission of Fanaroff-Riley I objects is not univocally explained by
a single emission model. Leptonic models with one and multi-zone emission regions, occurring in
the jet of these objects, are usually used to describe the broadband spectral energy distribution.
A correlation between the X-ray and TeV emission is naturally expected within leptonic models whereas
a lack of correlation between these two observables represents a challenge and favors the hadronic
scenarios. This is the case of M87 as we show here by analyzing its TeV and X-ray emission recorded
in the last decade. Furthermore, we point out that the spectra obtained by MAGIC, H.E.S.S. and VERITAS
telescopes cannot be described with the same leptonic model introduced by the Fermi-LAT collaboration.
We introduce hadronic scenarios to explain the TeV gamma-ray fluxes of this radiogalaxy as products
of Fermi-accelarated protons interacting with seed photons in the jet or thermal particles in the
giant lobes. By fitting this part of spectral energy distribution as pion decay products, we obtain
the expected neutrino counterpart and the luminosity of accelerating protons in the jet and/or
lobes. With the expected neutrino fluxes we investigate, through Monte Carlo simulations, the
possibility to see the signal from M87 with a Km$^{3}$ neutrino telescope, and compare the results
with what has been seen by IceCube experiment up to now. Finally we constrain the features of giant
lobes through the observations performed at ultra high energies by TA experiment.
