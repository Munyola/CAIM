This work presents $\tt AutoLens$, the first entirely automated modeling suite for the analysis
of galaxy-scale strong gravitational lenses. $\tt AutoLens$ simultaneously models the lens galaxy's
light and mass whilst reconstructing the extended source galaxy on an adaptive pixel-grid. The
method's approach to source-plane discretization is amorphous, adapting its clustering and regularization
to the intrinsic properties of the lensed source. The lens's light is fitted using a superposition
of Sersic functions, allowing $\tt AutoLens$ to cleanly deblend its light from the source. Single
component mass models representing the lens's total mass density profile are demonstrated, which
in conjunction with light modeling can detect central images using a centrally cored profile. Decomposed
mass modeling is also shown, which can fully decouple a lens's light and dark matter and determine
whether the two component are geometrically aligned. The complexity of the light and mass models
are automatically chosen via Bayesian model comparison. These steps form $\tt AutoLens$'s automated
analysis pipeline, such that all results in this work are generated without any user-intervention.
This is rigorously tested on a large suite of simulated images, assessing its performance on a broad
range of lens profiles, source morphologies and lensing geometries. The method's performance
is excellent, with accurate light, mass and source profiles inferred for data sets representative
of both existing Hubble imaging and future Euclid wide-field observations.
