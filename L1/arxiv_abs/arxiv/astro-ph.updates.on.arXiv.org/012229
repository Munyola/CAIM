Gaia measures the five astrometric parameters for stars in the Milky Way, but only four of them (positions
and proper motion, but not parallax) are well measured beyond a few kpc from the Sun. Modern spectroscopic
surveys such as APOGEE cover a large area of the Milky Way disk and we can use the relation between spectra
and luminosity to determine distances to stars beyond Gaia's parallax reach. Here, we design a deep
neural network trained on stars in common between Gaia and APOGEE that determines spectro-photometric
distances to APOGEE stars, while including a flexible model to calibrate parallax zero-point biases
in Gaia DR2. We determine the zero-point offset to be $-52.3 \pm 2.0uas$ when modeling it as a global
constant, but also train a multivariate zero-point offset model that depends on $G$, $G_{BP} - G_{RP}$
color, and $T_\mathrm{eff}$ and that can be applied to all 139 million stars in Gaia DR2 within APOGEE's
color--magnitude range. Our spectro-photometric distances are more precise than Gaia at distances
$\approx 2kpc$ from the Sun. We release a catalog of spectro-photometric distances for the entire
APOGEE DR14 data set which covers Galactocentric radii $2kpc\lesssim R \lesssim19kpc$; $\approx
150,000$ stars have <10% uncertainty, making this a powerful sample to study the chemo-dynamical
structure of the disk. We use this sample to map the mean [Fe/H] and 15 abundance ratios [X/Fe] from
the Galactic center to the edge of the disk. Among many interesting trends, we find that the bulge
and bar region at $R \lesssim 5kpc$ clearly stands out in [Fe/H] and most abundance ratios.
