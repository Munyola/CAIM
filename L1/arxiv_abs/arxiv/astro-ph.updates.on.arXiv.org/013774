L 98-59 (TIC 307210830, TOI-175) is a nearby M3 dwarf around which TESS revealed three terrestrial-sized
transiting planets (0.80, 1.35, 1.57 Earth radii) in a compact configuration with orbital periods
shorter than 7.5 days. Here we aim to measure the masses of the known transiting planets in this system
using precise radial velocity (RV) measurements taken with the HARPS spectrograph. We consider
both trained and untrained Gaussian process regression models of stellar activity to simultaneously
model the RV data with the planetary signals. Our RV analysis is then supplemented with dynamical
simulations to provide strong constraints on the planets' orbital eccentricities by requiring
long-term stability. We measure the planet masses of the two outermost planets to be $2.46\pm 0.31$
and $2.26\pm 0.50$ Earth masses which confirms their bulk terrestrial compositions. We are able
to place an upper limit on the mass of the smallest, innermost planet of $<0.98$ Earth masses with
95% confidence. Our RV plus dynamical stability analysis places strong constraints on the orbital
eccentricities and reveals that each planet's orbit likely has $e<0.1$ to ensure a dynamically
stable system. The L 98-59 compact system of three likely rocky planets offers a unique laboratory
for studies of planet formation, dynamical stability, and comparative atmospheric planetology.
Continued RV monitoring will help refine the characterization of the innermost planet and potentially
reveal additional planets in the system at wider separations.
