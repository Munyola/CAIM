Kinetic Sunyaev Zel'dovich (kSZ) tomography provides a powerful probe of the radial velocity field
of matter in the Universe. By cross-correlating a high resolution CMB experiment like CMB S4 and
a galaxy survey like DESI or LSST, one can measure the radial velocity field with very high signal
to noise over a large volume of the universe. In this paper we show how this measurement can be used
to improve constraints on primordial non-Gaussianities of the local type. The velocity field provides
a measurement of the unbiased matter perturbations on large scales, which can be cross-correlated
with the biased large-scale galaxy density field. This results in sample variance cancellation
for a measurement of scale-dependent bias due to a non-zero $f_{NL}$. Using this method we forecast
that CMB S4 and LSST combined reach a sensitivity $\sigma_{f_{NL}} \sim 0.5$, which is a factor of
three improvement over the sensitivity using LSST alone (without internal sample variance cancellation).
We take into account critical systematics like photometric redshifts, the kSZ optical depth degeneracy,
and systematics affecting the shape of the galaxy auto-power spectrum and find that these have negligible
impact, thus making kSZ tomography a robust probe for primordial non-Gaussianities. We also forecast
the impact of mass binning on our constraints. The techniques proposed in this paper could be an important
component of achieving the theoretically important threshold of $\sigma_{f_{NL}} \lesssim 1$
with future surveys.
