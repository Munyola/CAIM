New methods have been recently developed to search for strong gravitational lenses, in particular
lensed quasars, in wide-field imaging surveys. Here, we compare the performance of three different,
morphology-based methods to find lens candidates over the Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS) DR3 footprint
(440 deg$^2$). The three methods are: i) a multiplet detection in KiDS-DR3 and/or Gaia-DR1, ii)
direct modeling of KiDS cutouts and iii) positional offsets between different surveys (KiDS-vs-Gaia,
Gaia-vs-2MASS), with purpose-built astrometric recalibrations. The first benchmark for the
methods has been set by the recovery of known lenses. We are able to recover seven out of ten known lenses
and pairs of quasars observed in the KiDS DR3 footprint, or eight out of ten with improved selection
criteria and looser colour pre-selection. This success rate reflects the combination of all methods
together, which, taken individually, performed significantly worse (four lenses each). One movelty
of our analysis is that the comparison of the performances of the different methods has revealed
the pros and cons of the approaches and, most of all, the complementarities. We finally provide a
list of high-grade candidates found by one or more methods, awaiting spectroscopic follow-up for
confirmation. Of these, KiDS 1042+0023 is to our knowledge the first confirmed lensed quasar from
KiDS, exhibiting two quasar spectra at the same source redshift at either sides of a red galaxy, with
uniform flux-ratio $f\approx1.25$ over the wavelength range $0.45\mu\mathrm{m}<\lambda<0.75\mu\mathrm{m}.$
