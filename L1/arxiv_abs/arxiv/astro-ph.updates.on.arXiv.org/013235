Cosmic-ray-induced whole-grain heating induces evaporation and other processes that affect
the chemistry of interstellar clouds. With recent data on grain heating frequencies as an input
for a modified rate-equation astrochemical model, this study examines, which whole-grain heating
temperature regime is the most efficient at altering the chemical composition of gas and ices. Such
a question arises because low-temperature heating, albeit less effective at inducing evaporation
of adsorbed species, happens much more often than high-temperature grain heating. The model considers
a delayed gravitational collapse of a Bonnor-Ebert sphere, followed by a quiescent cloud core stage.
It was found that the whole-grain heating regimes can be divided in three classes, depending on their
induced physico-chemical effects. Heating to low-temperature thresholds of 27 and 30 K induce
desorption of the most volatile of species - N2 and O2 ices, and adsorbed atoms. The medium-temperature
thresholds 40, 50, and 60 K allow effective evaporation of CO and CH4, delaying their accumulation
in ices. We find that the 40 K threshold is the most effective cosmic-ray induced whole-grain heating
regime because its induced evaporation of CO promotes major abundance changes also for other compounds.
An important role in grain cooling may be played by molecular nitrogen as the most volatile of the
abundant species in the icy mantles. Whole-grain heating determines the sequence of accretion
for different molecules on to grain surface, which plays a key role in the synthesis of complex organic
molecules.
