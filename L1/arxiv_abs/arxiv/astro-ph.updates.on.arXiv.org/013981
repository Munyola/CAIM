We report on a detailed analysis of the radio emission during the different modes of the pulsar J0826+2637
(B0823+26), observed using the Giant Meterwave Radio Telescope at 306-339 MHz observing frequencies.
The pulsar profile has a postcursor and interpulse emission in addition to the main pulse. The single
pulses showed the presence of nulling, periodic fluctuation in the emission as well as two prominent
modes. In addition the pulsar also showed the presence of a null state where no emission was seen for
roughly an hour which was immediately followed by a short duration ($\sim$5 minutes) bright state
termed the Q-bright state. The nulling varied significantly in the two modes, from a few percent
nulls in B-mode to more than 90 percent nulling during the Q-mode. Additionally, the pulsar showed
the presence of low level emission in both the interpulse and postcursor components when the main
pulse nulled in B-mode. We detected periodic fluctuations in both the main pulse and postcursor
during B-mode which were most likely a form of periodic amplitude modulation unrelated to subpulse
drifting. We have also detected the appearance of periodicity during the transitions from the null
to the burst states in the Q-mode, which was longer than the B-mode modulations. Our analysis further
revealed a significant increase in the main pulse and post-cursor intensity during the transition
from the Q-mode to the short duration Q-bright mode. On the other hand no commensurate variation
was visible in the interpulse intensity.
