We investigate star forming scaling relations using Bayesian inference on a comprehensive data
sample of low- (z<0.1) and high-redshift (1<z<5) star forming regions. This full data set spans
a wide range of host galaxy stellar mass ($M_{*} \sim10^6-10^{11} M_{\odot}$) and clump star formation
rates (SFR $ \sim10^{-5}-10^2 M_\odot yr^{-1}$). We fit the power-law relationship between the
size (r$_{H\alpha}$) and luminosity (L$_{H\alpha}$) of the star forming clumps using the Bayesian
statistical modeling tool Stan that makes use of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling techniques.
Trends in the scaling relationship are explored for the full sample and subsets based on redshift
and selection effects between samples. In our investigation we find no evidence of redshift evolution
of the size-luminosity scaling relationship, nor a difference in slope between lensed and unlensed
data. There is evidence of a break in the scaling relationship between high and low star formation
rate surface density ($\Sigma_{SFR}$) clumps. The size-luminosity power law fit results are L$_{H\alpha}\sim$
r$_{H\alpha}^{2.8}$ and L$_{H\alpha}\sim$ r$_{H\alpha}^{1.7}$ for low and high $\Sigma_{SFR}$
clumps, respectively. We present a model where star forming clumps form at locations of gravitational
instability and produce an ionized region represented by the Str\"{o}mgren radius. A radius smaller
than the scale height of the disk results in a scaling relationship of $L \propto r^3$ (high $\Sigma_{SFR}$
clumps), and a scaling of $L \propto r^2$ (low $\Sigma_{SFR}$ clumps) if the radius is larger than
the disk scale height.
