Understanding the processes that drive the formation of black holes (BHs) is a key topic in observational
cosmology. While the observed $M_{\mathrm{BH}}$--$M_{\mathrm{Bulge}}$ correlation in bulge-dominated
galaxies is thought to be produced by major mergers, the existence of a $M_{\mathrm{BH}}$--$M_{\star}$
relation, across all galaxy morphological types, suggests that BHs may be largely built by secular
processes. Recent evidence that bulge-less galaxies, which are unlikely to have had significant
mergers, are offset from the $M_{\mathrm{BH}}$--$M_{\mathrm{Bulge}}$ relation, but lie on the
$M_{\mathrm{BH}}$--$M_{\star}$ relation, has strengthened this hypothesis. Nevertheless,
the small size and heterogeneity of current datasets, coupled with the difficulty in measuring
precise BH masses, makes it challenging to address this issue using empirical studies alone. Here,
we use Horizon-AGN, a cosmological hydrodynamical simulation to probe the role of mergers in BH
growth over cosmic time. We show that (1) as suggested by observations, simulated bulge-less galaxies
lie offset from the main $M_{\mathrm{BH}}$--$M_{\mathrm{Bulge}}$ relation, but on the $M_{\mathrm{BH}}$--$M_{\star}$
relation, (2) the positions of galaxies on the $M_{\mathrm{BH}}$--$M_{\star}$ relation are not
affected by their merger histories and (3) only $\sim$35 per cent of the BH mass in today's massive
galaxies is directly attributable to merging -- the majority ($\sim$65 per cent) of BH growth, therefore,
takes place gradually, via secular processes, over cosmic time.
