The Quintuplet star cluster is one of only three known young ($<10$ Myr) massive (M $>10^4$ M$_\odot$)
clusters within $\sim100$ pc of the Galactic Center. In order to explore star cluster formation
and evolution in this extreme environment, we analyze the Quintuplet's dynamical structure. Using
the HST WFC3-IR instrument, we take astrometric and photometric observations of the Quintuplet
covering a $120''\times120''$ field-of-view, which is $19$ times larger than those of previous
proper motion studies of the Quintuplet. We generate a catalog of the Quintuplet region with multi-band,
near-infrared photometry, proper motions, and cluster membership probabilities for $10,543$
stars. We present the radial density profile of $715$ candidate Quintuplet cluster members with
$M\gtrsim4.7$ M$_\odot$ out to $3.2$ pc from the cluster center. A $3\sigma$ lower limit of $3$ pc
is placed on the tidal radius, indicating the lack of a tidal truncation within this radius range.
Only weak evidence for mass segregation is found, in contrast to the strong mass segregation found
in the Arches cluster, a second and slightly younger massive cluster near the Galactic Center. It
is possible that tidal stripping hampers a mass segregation signature, though we find no evidence
of spatial asymmetry. Assuming that the Arches and Quintuplet formed with comparable extent, our
measurement of the Quintuplet's comparatively large core radius of $0.62^{+0.10}_{-0.10}$ pc
provides strong empirical evidence that young massive clusters in the Galactic Center dissolve
on a several Myr timescale.
