We have carried out a study of the X-ray properties of the supernova remnant (SNR) population in M33
with XMM-Newton, comprising deep observations of 8 fields in M33 covering all of the area within
the D$_{25}$ contours, and with a typical luminosity of 7.1$\times$10$^{34}$ erg s$^{-1}$ (0.2-2.0
keV) . Here we report our work to characterize the X-ray properties of the previously identified
SNRs in M33, as well as our search for new X-ray detected SNRs. With our deep observations and large
field of view we have detected 105 SNRs at the 3$\sigma$ level, of which 54 SNRs are newly detected
in X-rays, and three are newly discovered SNRs. Combining XMM-Newton data with deep Chandra survey
data allows detailed spectral fitting of 15 SNRs, for which we have measured temperatures, ionization
timescales, and individual abundances. This large sample of SNRs allows us to construct an X-ray
luminosity function, and compare its shape to luminosity functions from host galaxies of differing
metallicities and star formation rates to look for environmental effects on SNR properties. We
conclude that while metallicity may play a role in SNR population characteristics, differing star
formation histories on short timescales, and small-scale environmental effects appear to cause
more significant differences between X-ray luminosity distributions. In addition, we analyze
the X-ray detectability of SNRs, and find that in M33 SNRs with higher [SII]/H$\alpha$ ratios, as
well as those with smaller galactocentric distances, are more detectable in X-rays.
