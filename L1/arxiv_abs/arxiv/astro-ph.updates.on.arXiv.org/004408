Supermassive blackholes with masses of a billion solar masses or more are known to exist up to $z=7$.
However, the present-day environments of the descendants of first quasars is not well understood
and it is not known if they live in massive galaxy clusters or more isolated galaxies at $z=0$. We use
a dark matter-only realization (BTMassTracer) of the BlueTides cosmological hydrodynamic simulation
to study the halo properties of the descendants of the most massive black holes at $z=8$. We find that
the descendants of the quasars with most massive black holes are not amongst the most massive halos.
They reside in halos of with group-like ($\sim 10^{14}M_{\odot}$) masses, while the most massive
halos in the simulations are rich clusters with masses $\sim 10^{15} M_{\odot}$. The distribution
of halo masses at low redshift is similar to that of the descendants of least massive black holes,
for a similar range of halo masses at $z=8$, which indicates that they are likely to exist in similar
environments. By tracing back to the $z = 8$ progenitors of the most massive (cluster sized) halos
at $z=0$; we find that their most likely black hole mass is less than $10^7 M_{\odot}$; they are clearly
not amongst the most massive black holes. We also provide estimates for the likelihood of finding
a high redshift quasar hosting a black hole with masses above $10^{7} M_{\odot}$ for a given halo
mass at $z=0$. For halos above $10^{15} M_{\odot}$, there is only $20 \%$ probability that their
$z=8$ progenitors hosted a black hole with mass above $10^{7} M_{\odot}$.
