Using archival data from the Chandra X-ray telescope, we have measured the spatial extent of the
hot interstellar gas in a sample of 49 nearby interacting galaxy pairs, mergers, and merger remnants.
For systems with SFR > 1 M(sun)/yr, the volume and mass of hot gas are strongly and linearly correlated
with the star formation rate (SFR). This supports the idea that stellar/supernovae feedback dominates
the production of hot gas in these galaxies. We compared the mass of X-ray-emitting hot gas Mx(gas)
with the molecular and atomic hydrogen interstellar gas masses in these galaxies (M(H2) and M(HI),
respectively), using published carbon monoxide and 21 cm HI measurements. Systems with higher
SFRs have larger Mx(gas)/(M(H2) + M(HI)) ratios on average, in agreement with recent numerical
simulations of star formation and feedback in merging galaxies. The Mx(gas)/(M(H2) + M(HI)) ratio
also increases with dust temperature on average. The ratio Mx(gas)/SFR is anti-correlated with
the IRAS 60 micron to 100 micron flux ratio and with the Spitzer 3.6 micron to 24 micron. These trends
may be due to variations in the spatial density of young stars, the stellar age, the ratio of young
to old stars, the initial mass function, and/or the efficiency of stellar feedback. Galaxies with
low SFR (<1 M(sun)/yr) and high K band luminosities may have an excess of hot gas relative to the relation
for higher SFR galaxies, while galaxies with low K band luminosities (and therefore low stellar
masses) may have a deficiency in hot gas, but our sample is not large enough for strong statistical
significance.
