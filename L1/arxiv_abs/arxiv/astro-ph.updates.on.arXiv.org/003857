Ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) with luminosities lying between ~3x10^{39} - 2x10^{40} erg/s
represent a contentious sample of objects as their brightness, together with a lack of unambiguous
mass estimates for the vast majority of the central objects, leads to a degenerate scenario where
the accretor could be a stellar remnant (black hole or neutron star) or intermediate mass black hole
(IMBH). Recent, high-quality observations imply that the presence of IMBHs in the majority of these
objects is unlikely unless the accretion flow somehow deviates strongly from expectation based
on objects with known masses. On the other-hand, physically motivated models for super-critical
inflows can re-create the observed X-ray spectra and their evolution, although have been lacking
a robust explanation for their variability properties. In this paper we include the effect of a partially
inhomogeneous wind that imprints variability onto the X-ray emission via two distinct methods.
The model is heavily dependent on both inclination to the line-of-sight and mass accretion rate,
resulting in a series of qualitative and semi-quantitative predictions. We study the time-averaged
spectra and variability of a sample of well-observed ULXs, finding that the source behaviours can
be explained by our model in both individual cases as well as across the entire sample, specifically
in the trend of hardness-variability power. We present the covariance spectra for these sources
for the first time, which shed light on the correlated variability and issues associated with modelling
broad ULX spectra.
