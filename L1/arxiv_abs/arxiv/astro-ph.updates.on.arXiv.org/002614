We use the observed anisotropic clustering of galaxies in the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic
Survey (BOSS) Data Release 11 CMASS sample to measure the linear growth rate of structure, the Hubble
expansion rate and the comoving distance scale. Our sample covers 8498 ${\rm deg}^2$ and encloses
an effective volume of 6.0 ${\rm Gpc}^3$ at an effective redshift of $\bar{z} = 0.57$. We find $f\sigma_8
= 0.441 \pm 0.044$, $H = 93.1 \pm 3.0\ {\mathrm{km}\ \mathrm{s}^{-1} \mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}}$ and $D_{\rm
A} = 1380 \pm 23\ {\rm Mpc}$ when fitting the growth and expansion rate simultaneously. When we fix
the background expansion to the one predicted by spatially-flat $\Lambda$CDM model in agreement
with recent Planck results, we find $f\sigma_8 = 0.447 \pm 0.028$ (6 per cent accuracy). While our
measurements are generally consistent with the predictions of $\Lambda$CDM and General Relativity,
they mildly favor models in which the strength of gravitational interactions is weaker than what
is predicted by General Relativity. Combining our measurements with recent cosmic microwave background
data results in tight constraints on basic cosmological parameters and deviations from the standard
cosmological model. Separately varying these parameters, we find $w = -0.983 \pm 0.075$ (8 per cent
accuracy) and $\gamma = 0.69 \pm 0.11$ (16 per cent accuracy) for the effective equation of state
of dark energy and the growth rate index, respectively. Both constraints are in good agreement with
the standard model values of $w=-1$ and $\gamma = 0.554$.
