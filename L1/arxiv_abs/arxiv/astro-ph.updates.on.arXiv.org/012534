Determining the radial positions of galaxies up to a high accuracy depends on the correct identification
of salient features in their spectra. Classical techniques for spectroscopic redshift estimation
make use of template matching with cross-correlation. These templates are usually constructed
from empirical spectra or simulations based on the modeling of local galaxies. We propose two new
spectroscopic redshift estimation schemes based on new learning techniques for galaxy spectra
representation, using either a dictionary learning technique for sparse representation or denoising
autoencoders. We investigate how these representations impact redshift estimation. These methods
have been tested on realistic simulated galaxy spectra, with photometry modelled after the Large
Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) and spectroscopy reproducing properties of the Sloan Digital
Sky Survey (SDSS). They were compared to Darth Fader, a robust technique extracting line features
and estimating redshift through eigentemplates cross-correlations. We show that both dictionary
learning and denoising autoencoders provide improved accuracy and reliability across all signal-to-noise
regimes and galaxy types. The representation learning framework for spectroscopic redshift analysis
introduced in this work offers high performance in feature extraction and redshift estimation,
improving on a classical eigentemplates approach. This is a necessity for next-generation galaxy
surveys, and we demonstrate a successful application in realistic simulated survey data.
