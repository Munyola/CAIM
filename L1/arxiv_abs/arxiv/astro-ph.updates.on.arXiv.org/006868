Recent observations of Jupiter have suggested the existence of global oscillatory modes at millihertz
frequencies, yet the source mechanism responsible for driving these modes is still unknown. However,
the energies necessary to produce observable surface oscillations have been predicted. Here we
investigate if moist convection in Jupiter's upper atmosphere can be responsible for driving the
global oscillations and what moist convective energy requirements are necessary to achieve these
theoretical mode energies and surface amplitudes. We begin by creating a one-dimensional moist
convective cloud model and find that the available kinetic energy of the rising cloud column falls
below theoretical estimates of oscillations energies. That is, mode excitation cannot occur with
a single storm eruption. We then explore stochastic excitation scenarios of the oscillations by
moist convective storms. We find that mode energies and amplitudes can reach theoretical estimates
if the storm energy available to the modes is more than just kinetic. In order for the modes to be excited,
we find that they require $5 \times 10^{27}$ to 10$^{28}$ erg per day. However, even for a large storm
eruption each day, the available kinetic energy from the storms falls two orders of magnitude short
of the required driving energy. Although our models may oversimplify the true complexity of the
coupling between Jovian storms and global oscillations, our findings reveal that enough thermal
energy is associated with moist convection to drive the modes, should it be available to them.
