We present new deep ALMA and HST/WFC3 observations of MASOSA and VR7, two luminous Ly$\alpha$ emitters
(LAEs) at $z=6.5$, for which the UV continuum level differ by a factor four. No IR dust continuum emission
is detected in either, indicating little amounts of obscured star formation and/or high dust temperatures.
MASOSA, with a UV luminosity M$_{1500}=-20.9$, compact size and very high Ly$\alpha$ EW$_{0}\approx145$
A, is undetected in [CII] to a limit of L$_{\rm [CII]}<2.2\times10^7$ L$_{\odot}$ implying a metallicity
$Z\lesssim0.07 Z_{\odot}$. Intriguingly, our HST data indicates a red UV slope $\beta=-1.1\pm0.7$,
at odds with the low dust content. VR7, which is a bright (M$_{1500}=-22.4$) galaxy with moderate
color ($\beta=-1.4\pm0.3$) and Ly$\alpha$ EW$_0 = 34$ A, is clearly detected in [CII] emission
(S/N=15). VR7's rest-frame UV morphology can be described by two components separated by $\approx1.5$
kpc and is globally more compact than the [CII] emission. The global [CII]-UV ratio indicates $Z\approx0.2
Z_{\odot}$, but there are large variations in the UV-[CII] ratio on kpc scales. We also identify
diffuse, possibly outflowing, [CII]-emitting gas at $\approx 100$ km s$^{-1}$. VR7 appears assembling
its components at a slightly more evolved stage than other luminous LAEs, with outflows already
shaping its direct environment at $z\sim7$. Our results further indicate that the global [CII]-UV
relation steepens at SFR $<30$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$, naturally explaining why the [CII]-UV ratio
is anti-correlated with Ly$\alpha$ EW in many, but not all, observed LAEs.
