We report the discovery of PSR J0952$-$0607, a 707-Hz binary millisecond pulsar which is now the
fastest-spinning neutron star known in the Galactic field (i.e., outside of a globular cluster).
PSR J0952$-$0607 was found using LOFAR at a central observing frequency of 135 MHz, well below the
300 MHz to 3 GHz frequencies typically used in pulsar searches. The discovery is part of an ongoing
LOFAR survey targeting unassociated Fermi Large Area Telescope $\gamma$-ray sources. PSR J0952$-$0607
is in a 6.42-hr orbit around a very low-mass companion ($M_\mathrm{c}\gtrsim0.02$ M$_\odot$)
and we identify a strongly variable optical source, modulated at the orbital period of the pulsar,
as the binary companion. The light curve of the companion varies by 1.6 mag from $r^\prime=22.2$
at maximum to $r^\prime>23.8$, indicating that it is irradiated by the pulsar wind. Swift observations
place a 3-$\sigma$ upper limit on the $0.3-10$ keV X-ray luminosity of $L_X < 1.1 \times 10^{31}$
erg s$^{-1}$ (using the 0.97 kpc distance inferred from the dispersion measure). Though no eclipses
of the radio pulsar are observed, the properties of the system classify it as a black widow binary.
The radio pulsed spectrum of PSR J0952$-$0607, as determined through flux density measurements
at 150 and 350 MHz, is extremely steep with $\alpha\sim-3$ (where $S \propto \nu^{\alpha}$). We
discuss the growing evidence that the fastest-spinning radio pulsars have exceptionally steep
radio spectra, as well as the prospects for finding more sources like PSR J0952$-$0607.
