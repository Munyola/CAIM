We present and study the largest and the most comprehensive catalog of microlensing events ever
constructed. The sample of standard microlensing events comprises 3718 unique events from years
2001--2009, with 1410 not detected before in real-time by the Early Warning System of the Optical
Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE). The search pipeline makes use of Machine Learning algorithms
in order to help find rare phenomena among 150 million objects and derive the detection efficiency.
Applications of the catalog can be numerous, from analyzing individual events to large statistical
studies for the Galactic mass and kinematics distributions and planetary abundances. We derive
the maps of the mean Einstein ring crossing time of events spanning 31 sq. deg. toward of the Galactic
Center and compare the observed distributions with the most recent models. We find good agreement
within the observed region and we see the signature of the tilt of the bar in the microlensing data.
However, the asymmetry of the mean time-scales seems to rise more steeply than predictions, indicating
either a somewhat different orientation of the bar or a larger bar width. The map for the events with
sources in the Galactic bulge shows a dependence of the mean time-scale on the Galactic latitude,
signaling an increasing contribution from disk lenses closer to the plane, related with the height
of the disk. Our data present a perfect set for comparing and enhancing new models of the central parts
of the Milky Way and creating the 3D picture of the Galaxy.
