It is widely accepted that stars in a spiral disk, like the Milky Way's, can radially migrate on order
a scale length over the disk's lifetime. With the exception of cold torquing, also known as "churning,"
processes that contribute to the radial migration of stars are necessarily associated with kinematic
heating. Additionally, it is an open question whether or not an episode of cold torquing is kinemically
cold over long radial distances. This study uses a suite of analytically based simulations to investigate
the dynamical response when stars are subject to cold torquing and are also resonant with an ultraharmonic.
Model results demonstrate that these populations are kinematically heated and have RMS changes
in orbital angular momentum around corotation that can exceed those of populations that do not experience
resonant overlap. Thus, kinematic heating can occur during episodes of cold torquing. In a case
study of a Milky Way-like disk with an exponential surface density profile and flat rotation curve,
up to 40% of cold torqued stars in the solar cylinder experience resonant overlap. This fraction
increases toward the galactic center. To first approximation, the maximum radial excursions from
cold torquing depend only on the strength of the spiral pattern and the underlying rotation curve.
This work places an upper limit to these excursions to be the distance between the ultraharmonics,
otherwise radial migration near corotation can kinematically heat. The diffusion rate for kinematically
cold radial migration is thus constrained by limiting the step size in the random walk approximation.
