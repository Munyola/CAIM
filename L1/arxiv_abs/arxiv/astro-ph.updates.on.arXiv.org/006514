M dwarfs are the most numerous stars in our Galaxy with masses between approximately 0.5 and 0.1 solar
mass. Many of them show surface activity qualitatively similar to our Sun and generate flares, high
X-ray fluxes, and large-scale magnetic fields. Such activity is driven by a dynamo powered by the
convective motions in their interiors. Understanding properties of stellar magnetic fields in
these stars finds a broad application in astrophysics, including, e.g., theory of stellar dynamos
and environment conditions around planets that may be orbiting these stars. Most stars with convective
envelopes follow a rotation-activity relationship where various activity indicators saturate
in stars with rotation periods shorter than a few days. The activity gradually declines with rotation
rate in stars rotating more slowly. It is thought that due to a tight empirical correlation between
X-ray and magnetic flux, the stellar magnetic fields will also saturate, to values around ~4kG.
Here we report the detection of magnetic fields above the presumed saturation limit in four fully
convective M-dwarfs. By combining results from spectroscopic and polarimetric studies we explain
our findings in terms of bistable dynamo models: stars with the strongest magnetic fields are those
in a dipole dynamo state, while stars in a multipole state cannot generate fields stronger than about
four kilogauss. Our study provides observational evidence that dynamo in fully convective M dwarfs
generates magnetic fields that can differ not only in the geometry of their large scale component,
but also in the total magnetic energy.
