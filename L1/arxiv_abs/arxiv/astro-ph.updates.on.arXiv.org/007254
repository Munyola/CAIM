Recent Atacama Large Millimeter and Submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations of the protoplanetary
disk around the Herbig Ae star HD 163296 revealed three depleted dust gaps at 60, 100 and 160 au in the
1.3 mm continuum as well as CO depletion in the middle and outer dust gaps. However, no CO depletion
was found in the inner dust gap. To examine the planet--disk interaction model, we present results
of two-dimensional two fluid (gas + dust) hydrodynamic simulations coupled with three-dimensional
radiative transfer simulations. In order to fit the high gas-to-dust ratio of the first gap, we find
the Shakura--Sunyaev viscosity parameter $\alpha$ must be very small ($\lesssim 10^{-4}$) in
the inner disk. On the other hand, a relatively large $\alpha$ ($\sim 7.5\times 10^{-3}$) is required
to reproduce the dust surface density in the outer disk. We interpret the variation of $\alpha$ as
an indicator of the transition from an inner dead zone to the outer magnetorotational instability
(MRI) active zone. Within $\sim 100$ au, the HD 163296 disk's ionization level is low, and non-ideal
magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) effects could suppress the MRI, so the disk can be largely laminar. The
disk's ionization level gradually increases toward larger radii, and the outermost disk ($r > 300$
au) becomes turbulent due to MRI. Under this condition, we find that the observed dust continuum
and CO gas line emissions can be reasonably fit by three half-Jovian-mass planets (0.46, 0.46 and
0.58 $M_\textrm{J}$) at 59, 105 and 160 au, respectively.
