Within the context of the concordance model of cosmology we test the consistency of the angular power
spectrum data from WMAP and Planck looking for possible systematics. The best fit concordance model
to each observation is used as a mean function along with a Crossing function with an orthogonal basis
to fit the data from the other observation searching for any possible deviation. We report that allowing
an overall amplitude shift in the observed angular power spectra of the two observations, the best
fit mean function from Planck data is consistent with WMAP 9 year data but the best fit mean function
generated from WMAP-9 data is not consistent with Planck data at the $3\sigma$ level. This is an expected
result when there is no clear systematic/tension between two observations and one of them has a considerably
higher precision. We conclude that there is no clear tension between Planck and WMAP 9 year angular
power spectrum data from a statistical point of view (allowing the overall amplitude shift). Our
result highlights the fact that while the angular power spectrum from cosmic microwave background
observations is a function of various cosmological parameters, comparing individual parameters
might be misleading in the presence of cosmographic degeneracies. Another main result of our analysis
is the importance of the overall amplitudes of the observed spectra from Planck and WMAP observations.
Fixing the amplitudes at their reported values results in an unresolvable tension between the two
observations at more than $3\sigma$ level which can be a hint towards a serious systematic.
