We have observed the CCH (N=3-2, J=7/2-5/2, F=4-3 and 3-2) and SO (6_7-5_6) emission at a 0"2 angular
resolution toward the low-mass Class 0 protostellar source IRAS 15398-3359 with ALMA. The CCH emission
traces the infalling-rotating envelope near the protostar with the outflow cavity extended along
the northeast-southwest axis. On the other hand, the SO emission has a compact distribution around
the protostar. The CCH emission is relatively weak at the continuum peak position, while the SO emission
has a sharp peak there. Although the maximum velocity shift of the CCH emission is about 1 km s^-1 from
the systemic velocity, a velocity shift higher than 2 km s^{-1} is seen for the SO emission. This high
velocity component is most likely associated with the Keplerian rotation around the protostar.
The protostellar mass is estimated to be 0.007^{+0.004}_{-0.003} from the velocity profile of
the SO emission. With this protostellar mass, the velocity structure of the CCH emission can be explained
by the model of the infalling-rotating envelope, where the radius of the centrifugal barrier is
estimated to be 40 au from the comparison with the model. The disk mass evaluated from the dust continuum
emission by assuming the dust temperature of 20 K-100 K is 0.1-0.9 times the stellar mass, resulting
in the Toomre Q parameter of 0.4-5. Hence, the disk structure may be partly unstable. All these results
suggest that a rotationally-supported disk can be formed in the earliest stages of the protostellar
evolution.
