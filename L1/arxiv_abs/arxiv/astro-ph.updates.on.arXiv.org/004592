We investigate measuring the peculiar motions of galaxies up to $z=0.5$ using Type Ia supernovae
(SNe Ia) from LSST, and predict the subsequent constraints on the growth rate of structure. We consider
two cases. Our first is based on measurements of the volumetric SNe Ia rate and assumes we can obtain
spectroscopic redshifts and light curves for varying fractions of objects that are detected pre-peak
luminosity by LSST (some of which may be obtained by LSST itself and others which would require additional
follow-up). We find that these measurements could produce growth rate constraints at $z<0.5$ that
significantly outperform those using Redshift Space Distortions (RSD) with DESI or 4MOST, even
though there are $\sim4\times$ fewer objects. For our second case, we use semi-analytic simulations
and a prescription for the SNe Ia rate as a function of stellar mass and star formation rate to predict
the number of LSST SNe IA whose host redshifts may already have been obtained with the Taipan+WALLABY
surveys, or with a future multi-object spectroscopic survey. We find $\sim 18,000$ and $\sim 160,000$
SN Ia with host redshifts for these cases respectively. Whilst this is only a fraction of the total
LSST-detected SNe Ia, they could be used to significantly augment and improve the growth rate constraints
compared to only RSD. Ultimately, we find that combining LSST SNe Ia with large numbers of galaxy
redshifts will provide the most powerful probe of large scale gravity in the $z<0.5$ regime over
the coming decades.
