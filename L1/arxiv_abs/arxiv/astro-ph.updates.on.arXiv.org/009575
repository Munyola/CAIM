We study dwarf galaxy formation at high redshift ($z\ge5$) using a suite of high- resolution, cosmological
hydrodynamic simulations and a semi-analytic model (SAM). We focus on gas accretion, cooling and
star formation in this work by isolating the relevant process from reionization and supernova feedback,
which will be further discussed in a companion paper. We apply the SAM to halo merger trees constructed
from a collisionless N-body simulation sharing identical initial conditions to the hydrodynamic
suite, and calibrate the free parameters against the stellar mass function predicted by the hydrodynamic
simulations at z = 5. By making comparisons of the star formation history and gas components calculated
by the two modelling techniques, we find that semi-analytic prescriptions that are commonly adopted
in the literature of low-redshift galaxy formation do not accurately represent dwarf galaxy properties
in the hydrodynamic simulation at earlier times. We propose 3 modifications to SAMs that will provide
more accurate high-redshift simulations. These include 1) the halo mass and baryon fraction which
are overestimated by collisionless N-body simulations; 2) the star formation efficiency which
follows a different cosmic evolutionary path from the hydrodynamic simulation; and 3) the cooling
rate which is not well defined for dwarf galaxies at high redshift. Accurate semi-analytic modelling
of dwarf galaxy formation informed by detailed hydrodynamical modelling will facilitate reliable
semi-analytic predictions over the large volumes needed for the study of reionization.
