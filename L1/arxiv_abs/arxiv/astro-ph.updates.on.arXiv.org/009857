Planets that form early enough to be embedded in the circumstellar gas disk accumulate thick atmospheres
of nebular gas. Models of these atmospheres need to specify the surface luminosity (i.e. energy
loss rate) of the planet. This luminosity is usually associated with a continuous inflow of solid
bodies, where the gravitational energy released from these bodies is the source of energy. However,
if these bodies release energy in the atmosphere instead of at the surface, this assumption might
not be justified. Our aim is to explore the interactions of infalling planetesimals with primordial
atmospheres at an embedded phase of evolution. We investigate effects of atmospheric interaction
on the planetesimals (mass loss) and the atmosphere (heating/cooling). We used atmospheric parameters
from a snapshot of time-dependent evolution simulations for embedded atmospheres and simulated
purely radial, infall events of siliceous planetesimals in a 1D, explicit code. We implemented
energy transfer between friction, radiation transfer by the atmosphere and the body and thermal
ablation; this gives us the possibility to examine the effects on the planetesimals and the atmosphere.
We find that a significant amount of gravitational energy is indeed dissipated into the atmosphere,
especially for larger planetary cores, which consequently cannot contribute to the atmospheric
planetary luminosity. Furthermore, we examine that planetesimal infall events for cores, $M_\mathrm{C}
> 2$M$_{\oplus}$, which actually result in a local cooling of the atmosphere; this is totally in
contradiction with the classical model.
