We investigate the origin of the evolution of the population-averaged central stellar mass density
($\Sigma_1$) of quiescent galaxies (QGs) by probing the relation between stellar age and $\Sigma_1$
at $z\sim0$. We use the Zurich ENvironmental Study (ZENS), which is a survey of galaxy groups with
a large fraction of satellite galaxies. QGs shape a narrow locus in the $\Sigma_1-M_{\star}$ plane,
which we refer to as $\Sigma_1$ ridgeline. Colors of ($B-I$) and ($I-J$) are used to divide QGs into
three age categories: young ($<2~\mathrm{Gyr}$), intermediate ($2-4~\mathrm{Gyr}$), and old
($>4~\mathrm{Gyr}$). At fixed stellar mass, old QGs on the $\Sigma_1$ ridgeline have higher $\Sigma_1$
than young QGs. This shows that galaxies landing on the $\Sigma_1$ ridgeline at later epochs arrive
with lower $\Sigma_1$, which drives the zeropoint of the ridgeline down with time. We compare the
present-day zeropoint of the oldest population at $z=0$ with the zeropoint of the quiescent population
4 Gyr back in time, at $z=0.37$. These zeropoints are identical, showing that the intrinsic evolution
of individual galaxies after they arrive on the $\Sigma_1$ ridgeline must be negligible, or must
evolve parallel to the ridgeline during this interval. The observed evolution of the global zeropoint
of 0.07 dex over the last 4 Gyr is thus largely due to the continuous addition of newly quenched galaxies
with lower $\Sigma_1$ at later times ("progenitor bias"). While these results refer to the satellite-rich
ZENS sample as a whole, our work suggests a similar age-$\Sigma_1$ trend for central galaxies.
