Pebble accretion is a promising process for decreasing growth timescales of planetary cores, allowing
gas giants to form at wide orbital separations. However, nebular turbulence can reduce the efficiency
of this gas-assisted growth. We present an order of magnitude model of pebble accretion, which calculates
the impact of turbulence on the average velocity of small bodies, the radius for binary capture,
and the sizes of the small bodies that can be accreted. We also include the effect of turbulence on
the particle scale height, which has been studied in previous works. We find that turbulence does
not prevent rapid growth in the high-mass regime: the last doubling time to the critical mass to trigger
runaway gas accretion ($M \sim 10 \, M_\oplus$) is well within the disk lifetime even for strong ($\alpha
\gtrsim 10^{-2}$) turbulence. We find that while the growth timescale is quite sensitive to the
local properties of the protoplanetary disk, over large regimes of parameter space large cores
grow in less than the disk lifetime if appropriately-sized small bodies are present. Instead, the
effects of turbulence are most pronounced for low planetary masses. For strong turbulence the growth
timescale is longer than the gas disk lifetime until the core reaches masses $\gtrsim 10^{-2}-10^{-1}
M_\oplus$. A "Flow Isolation Mass", at which binary capture ceases, emerges naturally from our
model framework. We comment that the dependence of this mass on orbital separation is similar to
the semi-major axis distribution of solar-system cores.
