We constrain gas inflow speeds in several star-forming galaxies having color gradients consistent
with inside-out disk growth. Our method combines new measurements of disk orientation with previously
described circumgalactic absorption in background quasar spectra. Two quantities, a position
angle and an axis ratio, describe the projected shape of each galactic disk on the sky, leaving an
ambiguity about which side of the minor axis is tipped toward the observer. This degeneracy regarding
the 3D orientation of disks has compromised previous efforts to measure gas inflow speeds. We present
HST and Keck/LGSAO imaging that resolves spiral structure in redshift $z\approx0.2$ galaxies.
We then determine the sign of the disk inclination, under the assumption that the spiral arms trail
the rotation. Using the measured rotation curve, we then model the projection of both radial infall
in the disk plane and circular orbits onto each quasar sightline. We compare the resulting line-of-sight
velocities to the observed velocity range of Mg II absorption in quasar spectra. We find maximum
radial inflow speeds of 30-40 km s$^{-1}$ in two sightlines. We also rule out a velocity component
from radial inflow in one sightline, suggesting that the structures feeding gas to these disks do
not have unity covering factor (even within 30$^{\circ}$ of the major axis and low impact parameters).
We recommend appropriate selection criteria for building larger samples of galaxy -- quasar pairs
that produce orientations sensitive to constraining inflow properties.
