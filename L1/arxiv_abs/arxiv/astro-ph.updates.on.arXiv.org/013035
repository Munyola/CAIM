LAMOST DR5 released more than 200,000 low resolution spectra of early-type stars with S/N>50. Searching
for metallic-line (Am) stars in such a large database and study of their statistical properties
are presented in this paper. Six machine learning algorithms were experimented with using known
Am spectra, and both the empirical criteria method(Hou et al. 2015) and the MKCLASS package(Gray
et al. 2016) were also investigated. Comparing their performance, the random forest (RF) algorithm
won, not only because RF has high successful rate but also it can derives and ranks features. Then
the RF was applied to the early type stars of DR5, and 15,269 Am candidates were picked out. Manual
identification was conducted based on the spectral features derived from the RF algorithm and verified
by experts. After manual identification, 9,372 Am stars and 1,131 Ap candidates were compiled into
a catalog. Statistical studies were conducted including temperature distribution, space distribution,
and infrared photometry. The spectral types of Am stars are mainly between F0 and A4 with a peak around
A7, which is similar to previous works. With the Gaia distances, we calculated the vertical height
Z from the Galactic plane for each Am star. The distribution of Z suggests that the incidence rate
of Am stars shows a descending gradient with increasing jZj. On the other hand, Am stars do not show
a noteworthy pattern in the infrared band. As wavelength gets longer, the infrared excess of Am stars
decreases, until little or no excess in W1 and W2 bands.
