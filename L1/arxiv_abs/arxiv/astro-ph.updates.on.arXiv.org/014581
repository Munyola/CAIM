We present deep near-infrared spectroscopy of six quasars at 6.1<z<6.7 with VLT/X-Shooter and
Gemini-N/GNIRS. Our objects, originally discovered through a wide-field optical survey with
the Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) Subaru Strategic Program (HSC-SSP), have the lowest luminosities
(-25.5< M1450<-23.1 mag) of the z>5.8 quasars with measured black hole masses. From single-epoch
mass measurements based on MgII2798, we find a wide range in black hole masses, from M_BH=10^7.6
to 10^9.3 Msun. The Eddington ratios L_bol/L_Edd range from 0.16 to 1.1, but the majority of the HSC
quasars are powered by M_BH=10^9 Msun supermassive black holes (SMBHs) accreting at sub-Eddington
rates. The Eddington ratio distribution of the HSC quasars is inclined to lower accretion rates
than those of Willott et al. (2010a), who measured the black hole masses for similarly faint z=6 quasars.
This suggests that the global Eddington ratio distribution is wider than has previously been thought.
The presence of M_BH=10^9 Msun SMBHs at z=6 cannot be explained with constant sub-Eddington accretion
from stellar remnant seed black holes. Therefore, we may be witnessing the first buildup of the most
massive black holes in the first billion years of the universe, the accretion activity of which is
transforming from active growth to a quiescent phase. Measurements of a larger complete sample
of z>6 low-luminosity quasars, as well as deeper observations with future facilities will enable
us to better understand the early SMBH growth in the reionization epoch.
