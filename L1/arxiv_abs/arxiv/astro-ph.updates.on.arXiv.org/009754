The high spatial resolution and precise astrometry and photometry of the Gaia mission should make
it particularly apt at discovering and resolving transients occurring in, or near, the centres
of galaxies. Indeed, some nuclear transients are reported by the Gaia Science Alerts (GSA) team,
but not a single confirmed Tidal Disruption Event has been published. In order to explore the sensitivity
of GSA, we performed an independent and systematic search for nuclear transients using Gaia observations.
Our transient search is driven from an input galaxy catalogue (derived from the Sloan Digital Sky
Survey Release 12). We present a candidate detection metric which is independent from the existing
GSA methodology, to see if Gaia Alerts are biased against the discovery of nuclear transients, and
in particular which steps may have an impact. Our technique does require significant manual vetting
of candidates, making implementation in the GSA system impractical for daily operations, although
it could be run weekly, which for month-to-year long transients would make a scientifically valuable
addition. Our search yielded ~480 nuclear transients, 5 of which were alerted and published by GSA.
The list of (in some cases ongoing) transients includes candidates for events related to enhanced
accretion onto a super-massive black hole and TDEs. An implementation of the detection methodology
and criteria used in this paper as an extension of GSA could open up the possibility for Gaia to fulfil
the role as a main tool to find transient nuclear activity as predicted in the literature.
