We present the first binary modelling results for the pulsating eclipsing binary KIC 11285625,
discovered by the Kepler mission. An automated method to disentangle the pulsation spectrum and
the orbital variability in high quality light curves, was developed and applied. The goal was to
obtain accurate orbital and component properties, in combination with essential information
derived from spectroscopy. A binary model for KIC 11285625 was obtained, using a combined analysis
of high-quality space-based Kepler light curves and ground-based high-resolution HERMES echelle
spectra. The binary model was used to separate the pulsation characteristics from the orbital variability
in the Kepler light curve in an iterative way. We used an automated procedure to perform this task,
based on the JKTEBOP binary modelling code, and adapted codes for frequency analysis and prewhitening
of periodic signals. Using a disentangling technique applied to the composite HERMES spectra,
we obtained a higher signal-to-noise mean component spectrum for both the primary and the secondary.
A model grid search method for fitting synthetic spectra was used for fundamental parameter determination
for both components. Accurate orbital and component properties of KIC 11285625 were derived, and
we have obtained the pulsation spectrum of the gamma Dor pulsator in the system. Detailed analysis
of the pulsation spectrum revealed amplitude modulation on a time scale of a hundred days, and strong
indications of frequency splittings at both the orbital frequency, and the rotational frequency
derived from spectroscopy.
