Turbulence evolution in a density-stratified medium differs from that of homogeneous isotropic
turbulence described by the Kolmogorov picture. We evaluate the degree of this effect in the intracluster
medium (ICM) with hydrodynamical simulations. We find that the buoyancy effect induced by ICM density
stratification introduces qualitative changes to the turbulence energy evolution, morphology,
and the density fluctuation - turbulence Mach number relation, and likely explains the radial dependence
of the ICM turbulence amplitude as found previously in cosmological simulations. A new channel
of energy flow between the kinetic and the potential energy is opened up by buoyancy. When the gravitational
potential is kept constant with time, this energy flow leaves oscillations to the energy evolution,
and leads to a balanced state of the two energies where both asymptote to power-law time evolution
with slopes shallower than that for the turbulence kinetic energy of homogeneous isotropic turbulence.
We discuss that the energy evolution can differ more significantly from that of homogeneous isotropic
turbulence when there is a time variation of the gravitational potential. Morphologically, ICM
turbulence can show a layered vertical structure and large horizontal vortical eddies in the central
regions with the greatest density stratification. In addition, we find that the coefficient in
the linear density fluctuation - turbulence Mach number relation caused by density stratification
is in general a variable with position and time.
