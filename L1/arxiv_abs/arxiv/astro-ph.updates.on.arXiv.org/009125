We present the results of our power spectral density analysis for the BL Lac object OJ\,287, utilizing
the {\it Fermi}-LAT survey at high-energy $\gamma$-rays, {\it Swift}-XRT in X-rays, several ground-based
telescopes and the {\it Kepler} satellite in the optical, and radio telescopes at GHz frequencies.
The light curves are modeled in terms of continuous-time auto-regressive moving average (CARMA)
processes. Owing to the inclusion of the {\it Kepler} data, we were able to construct \emph{for the
first time} the optical variability power spectrum of a blazar without any gaps across $\sim6$ dex
in temporal frequencies. Our analysis reveals that the radio power spectra are of a colored-noise
type on timescales ranging from tens of years down to months, with no evidence for breaks or other
spectral features. The overall optical power spectrum is also consistent with a colored noise on
the variability timescales ranging from 117 years down to hours, with no hints of any quasi-periodic
oscillations. The X-ray power spectrum resembles the radio and optical power spectra on the analogous
timescales ranging from tens of years down to months. Finally, the $\gamma$-ray power spectrum
is noticeably different from the radio, optical, and X-ray power spectra of the source: we have detected
a characteristic relaxation timescale in the {\it Fermi}-LAT data, corresponding to $\sim 150$\,days,
such that on timescales longer than this, the power spectrum is consistent with uncorrelated (white)
noise, while on shorter variability timescales there is correlated (colored) noise.
