We explore the connection between the atomic gas fraction, f_atm, and `global disc stability' parameter,
q, of galaxies within a fully cosmological context by examining galaxies in the Dark Sage semi-analytic
model. The q parameter is given by the ratio of disc specific angular momentum to mass, i.e. q \propto
j_disc/m_disc. Dark Sage is well suited to our study, as it includes the numerical evolution of one-dimensional
disc structure, making both j_disc and q predicted quantities. We show that Dark Sage produces a
clear correlation between gas fraction and j_disc, at fixed disc mass, in line with recent results
from observations and hydrodynamic simulations. This translates to a tight q--f_atm sequence
for star-forming central galaxies, which closely tracks the analytic prediction of Obreschkow
et al. The scatter in this sequence is driven by the probability distribution function of mass as
a function of j (PDF of j) within discs, specifically where it peaks. We find that halo mass is primarily
responsible for the peak location of the PDF of j, at least for low values of q. Two main mechanisms
of equal significance are then identified for disconnecting f_atm from q. Mergers in the model can
trigger quasar winds, with the potential to blow out most of the gas disc, while leaving the stellar
disc relatively unharmed. Ram-pressure stripping of satellite galaxies has a similar effect,
where f_atm can drop drastically with only a minimal effect to q. We highlight challenges associated
with following these predictions up with observations.
