The non-thermal dark matter (DM) production via the so-called freeze-in mechanism provides a simple
alternative to the standard thermal WIMP scenario. In this work, we consider a popular $U(1)_{B-L}$
extension of the standard model (SM) in the context of inverse seesaw mechanism which has at least
one (fermionic) FIMP DM candidate. Due to the added $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ symmetry, a SM gauge singlet
fermion, with mass of order keV, is stable and can be a warm DM candidate. Also, the same $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$
symmetry helps the lightest right-handed neutrino, with mass of order GeV, to be a stable or long-lived
particle by making a corresponding Yukawa coupling very small. This provides a possibility of a
two component DM scenario as well. Firstly, in the absence of a GeV DM component (i.e., without tuning
its corresponding Yukawa coupling to be very small), we consider only a keV DM as a single component
DM, which is produced by the freeze-in mechanism via the decay of the extra $Z'$ gauge boson associated
to $U(1)_{B-L}$ and can consistently explain the DM relic density measurements. In contrast with
most of the existing literature, we have found a reasonable DM production from the annihilation
processes. After numerically studying the DM production, we show the dependence of the DM relic
density as a function of its relevant free parameters. We use these results to obtain the parameter
space regions that are compatible with the DM relic density bound. Secondly, we study a two component
DM scenario and emphasize that the current DM relic density bound can be satisfied for a wide range
of parameter space.
