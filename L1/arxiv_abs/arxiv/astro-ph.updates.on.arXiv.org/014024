The ultra-diffuse dwarf galaxy NGC 1052-DF2 (DF2) has ten (eleven) measured globular clusters
(GCs) with a line-of-sight velocity dispersion of $\sigma=7.8^{+5.2}_{-2.2}\,$km/s ($\sigma=10.6^{+3.9}_{-2.3}\,$km/s).
Our conventional statistical analysis of the original ten GCs gives $\sigma=8.0^{+4.3}_{-3.0}\,$km/s.
The overall distribution of velocities agrees well with a Gaussian of this width. Due to the non-linear
Poisson equation in MOND, a dwarf galaxy has weaker self-gravity when in close proximity to a massive
host. This external field effect is investigated using a new analytic formulation and fully self-consistent
live $N$-body models in MOND. Our formulation agrees well with that of Famaey and McGaugh (2012).
These new simulations confirm our analytic results and suggest that DF2 may be in a deep-freeze state
unique to MOND. The correctly calculated MOND velocity dispersion agrees with our inferred dispersion
and that of van Dokkum et al. (2018b) if DF2 is within 150 kpc of NGC 1052 and both are 20 Mpc away. The
GCs of DF2 are however significantly brighter and larger than normal GCs, a problem which disappears
if DF2 is significantly closer to us. A distance of 10-13 Mpc makes DF2 a normal dwarf galaxy even more
consistent with MOND and the 13 Mpc distance reported by Trujillo et. al. (2019). We discuss the similar
dwarf DF4, finding good agreement with MOND. We also discuss possible massive galaxies near DF2
and DF4 along with their distances and peculiar velocities, noting that NGC 1052 may lie at a distance
near 10 Mpc.
