Jet, a considerable amount of plasma being ejected from chromosphere or lower corona into higher
corona, is a common phenomenon. Usually a jet is triggered by a brightening or a flare, which provides
the first driving force to push plasma upward. In this process, magnetic reconnection is thought
to be the mechanism to convert magnetic energy into thermal, non-thermal and kinetic energies.
However, most jets could reach an unusual high altitude and end much later than the end of its associated
flare. This fact implies that there is another way to continuously transfer magnetic energy into
kinetic energy even after the reconnection. The whole picture described above is well known in the
community, but how and how much magnetic energy is released through the way other than the reconnection
is still unclear. Here, through studying a prominence-like jet observed by SDO/AIA and STEREO-A/EUVI,
we find that the continuous relaxation of the post-reconnection magnetic field structure is an
important process for a jet to climb up higher than it could through only reconnec- tion. The kinetic
energy of the jet gained through the relaxation is 1.6 times of that gained from the recon- nection.
The resultant energy flux is hundreds of times larger than the flux required for the local coronal
heating, suggesting that such jets are a possible source to keep corona hot. Furthermore, rotational
motions ap- pear all the time during the jet. Our analysis suggests that torsional Alfven waves induced
during reconnection could not be the only mechanism to release magnetic energy and drive jets.
