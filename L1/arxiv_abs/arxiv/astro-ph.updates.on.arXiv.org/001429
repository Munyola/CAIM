As early as 10 Gyr ago, galaxies with more than 10^11 Msun in stars already existed. While most of these
massive galaxies must have subsequently transformed through on-going star formation and mergers
with other galaxies, a small fraction (<0.1%) may have survived untouched till today. Searches
for such relic galaxies, useful windows to explore the early Universe, have been inconclusive to
date: galaxies with masses and sizes like those observed at high redshift (M*>10^11 Msun; Re<1.5
kpc) have been found in the local Universe, but their stars are far too young for the galaxy to be a relic
galaxy. This paper explores the first case of a nearby galaxy, NGC1277 (in the Perseus cluster at
a distance of 73 Mpc), which fulfills all the criteria to be considered a relic galaxy. Using deep
optical spectroscopy, we derive the star formation history along the structure of the galaxy: the
stellar populations are uniformly old (>10 Gyr) with no evidence for more recent star formation
episodes. The metallicity of their stars is super-solar ([Fe/H]=0.20+-0.04) and alpha enriched
([alpha/Fe]=0.4+-0.1). This suggests a very short formation time scale for the bulk of stars of
this galaxy. This object also rotates very fast (Vrot~300 km/s) and has a large velocity dispersion
(sigma>300 km/s). NGC1277 will allow future explorations in full detail of properties such
as the structure, internal dynamics, metallicity, dust content and initial mass function at around
10-12 Gyr back in time when the first massive galaxies were built.
