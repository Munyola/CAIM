The evolution of Earth's early atmosphere and the emergence of habitable conditions on our planet
are intricately coupled with the development and duration of the magma ocean phase during the early
Hadean period (4 to 4.5 Ga). In this paper, we deal with the evolution of the steam atmosphere during
the magma ocean period. We obtain the outgoing longwave radiation using a line-by-line radiative
transfer code GARLIC. Our study suggests that an atmosphere consisting of pure H$_{2}$O, built
as a result of outgassing extends the magma ocean lifetime to several million years. The thermal
emission as a function of solidification timescale of magma ocean is shown. We study the effect of
thermal dissociation of H$_{2}$O at higher temperatures by applying atmospheric chemical equilibrium
which results in the formation of H$_{2}$ and O$_{2}$ during the early phase of the magma ocean. A
1-6\% reduction in the OLR is seen. We also obtain the effective height of the atmosphere by calculating
the transmission spectra for the whole duration of the magma ocean. An atmosphere of depth ~100 km
is seen for pure water atmospheres. The effect of thermal dissociation on the effective height of
the atmosphere is also shown. Due to the difference in the absorption behavior at different altitudes,
the spectral features of H$_{2}$ and O$_{2}$ are seen at different altitudes of the atmosphere.
Therefore, these species along with H$_{2}$O have a significant contribution to the transmission
spectra and could be useful for placing observational constraints upon magma ocean exoplanets.
