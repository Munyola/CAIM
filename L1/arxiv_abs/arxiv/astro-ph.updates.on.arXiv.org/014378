Jet models of Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) data should also conform to the observed jet profiles
just downstream. This study evaluates conformance of models of black hole jets to images of the innermost
jet of M87. This is a basic test that should be passed before using them to perform a physical interpretation
of EHT data. Recent 86 GHz Very Long Baseline Interferometry observations of M87 have revealed the
morphology and size of the jet near its source ($<65$\,M, or 0.06 lt-yrs after correcting for line
of sight to the jet, where $M$ is the black hole mass in geometrized units) for the first time. Current
transverse resolution indicates that this region is dominated by flux emanating from the edge of
the jet. The observed inner jet profiles are compared to all existing published synthetic radio
images constructed from "state of the art" 3-D numerical simulations of the black hole accretion
system in M87. Despite efforts to produce the characteristic wide, edge dominated jet, these models
are too narrow (by a factor of $\sim2$) in the region 0.06 - 0.32 lt-yrs from the source, even though
the jets (spine and/or sheath) in the image plane might appear conformant farther downstream. Furthermore,
the synthetic radio images are not edge dominated 0.06 - 0.32 lt-yrs from the source, but spine dominated.
Analyses that implement these models as physical diagnostics of EHT visibility amplitudes are
therefore suspect. Thus, these inner jet characteristics are important considerations before
applying simulations to the EHT data.
