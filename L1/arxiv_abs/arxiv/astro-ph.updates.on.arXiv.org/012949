The tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) is a well-established standard candle used to measure distances
to nearby galaxies. The TRGB luminosity is typically measured in the I-band, where the luminosity
has little dependency on stellar age or stellar metallicity. As the TRGB is brighter at wavelengths
redder than the I-band, observational gains can be made if the TRGB luminosity can be robustly calibrated
at longer wavelengths. This is of particular interest given the infrared capabilities that will
be available with the James Webb Space Telescope and an important calibration consideration for
using TRGB distances as part of an independent measurement of the Hubble constant. Here, we use simulated
photometry to investigate the dependency of the TRGB luminosity on stellar age and metallicity
as a function of wavelength (475 nm - 4.5 micron). We find intrinsic variations in the TRGB magnitude
to increase from a few hundredths of a magnitude at 800-900 nm to ~0.6 mag by 1.5 micron. We show that
variations at the longer infrared wavelengths can be reduced to 0.02-0.05 mag (1-2% accuracy in
distance) with careful calibrations that account for changes in age and metal content. Such calibration
efforts may also provide independent constraints of the age and metallicity of stellar halos where
TRGB distances are best measured. At 3.6 and 4.5 micron, the TRGB magnitude is predicted to vary up
to ~0.15 mag even after corrections for stellar age and metallicity, making these wavelengths less
suitable for precision distances.
