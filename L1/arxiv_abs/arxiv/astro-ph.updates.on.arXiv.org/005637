We explore the effect of using different kinematic tracers (HI and H$\alpha$) on reconstructing
the encounter parameters of the Mice major galaxy merger (NGC 4676A/B). We observed the Mice using
the SparsePak Integral Field Unit (IFU) on the WIYN telescope, and compared the H$\alpha$ velocity
map with VLA HI observations. The relatively high spectral resolution of our data (R $\approx$ 5000)
allows us to resolve more than one kinematic component in the emission lines of some fibers. We separate
the H$\alpha$-[N II] emission of the star-forming regions from shocks using their [N II]/H$\alpha$
line ratio and velocity dispersion. We show that the velocity of star-forming regions agree with
that of the cold gas (HI), particularly, in the tidal tails of the system. We reconstruct the morphology
and kinematics of these tidal tails utilizing an automated modeling method based on the Identikit
software package. We quantify the goodness of fit and the uncertainties of the derived encounter
parameters. Most of the initial conditions reconstructed using H$\alpha$ and HI are consistent
with each other, and qualitatively agree with the results of previous works. For example, we find
210$\pm^{50}_{40}$ Myrs, and 180$\pm^{50}_{40}$ Myrs for the time since pericenter, when modeling
H$\alpha$ and HI kinematics, respectively. This confirms that in some cases, H$\alpha$ kinematics
can be used instead of HI kinematics for reconstructing the initial conditions of galaxy mergers,
and our automated modeling method is applicable to some merging systems.
