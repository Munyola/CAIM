High-resolution interferometric observations of the circumstellar environments of AGB stars
show a variety of morphologies. Guided by the unusual carbon monoxide line profile of the AGB star
EP Aquarii, we have observed its circumstellar environment with ALMA band 6 in cycle 4. We describe
the morphological complexity of the CO, SiO and SO2 molecular emission. The CO emission exhibits
the characteristics of a bi-conical wind with a bright nearly face-on spiral feature around the
systemic velocity. This is the first convincing detection of a spiral morphology in an O-rich wind.
Based on the offsets of the centers of the two bi-conical wind hemispheres, we deduce the position
angle of the inclination axis to be ~150 deg measured counterclockwise from north. Based on the velocity
width of the spiral signature we estimate the inclination angle of the system to be between 4 deg and
18 deg. The central emission zone exhibits a morphology that resembles simulations modelling the
spiral-inducing wind-Roche-lobe-overflow mechanism. Though the spiral may be a (companion-induced)
density enhancement in the stellar outflow, the extremely narrow width of the spiral signature
in velocity space suggests that it may be a hydrodynamical perturbation in a face-on differentially
rotating disk. The SiO emission does not show the spiral, but exhibits a local emission void approximately
0.5'' west of the continuum brightness peak. We hypothesise that this may be a local environment
caused by the presence of a (stellar) companion with a mass of at most 0.1 Msol, based on its non-detection
in the continuum...
