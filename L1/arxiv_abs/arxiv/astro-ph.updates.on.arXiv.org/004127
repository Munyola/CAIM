On small scales the observable Universe is highly inhomogeneous, with galaxies and clusters forming
a complex web of voids and filaments. The optical properties of such configurations can be quite
different from the perfectly smooth Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) solutions
that are frequently used in cosmology, and must be well understood if we are to make precise inferences
about fundamental physics from cosmological observations. We investigate this problem by calculating
redshifts and luminosity distances within a class of cosmological models that are constructed
explicitly in order to allow for large density contrasts on small scales. Our study of optics is then
achieved by propagating one hundred thousand null geodesics through such space-times, with matter
arranged in either compact opaque objects or diffuse transparent haloes. We find that in the absence
of opaque objects, the mean of our ray tracing results faithfully reproduces the expectations from
FLRW cosmology. When opaque objects with sizes similar to those of galactic bulges are introduced,
however, we find that the mean of distance measures can be shifted up from FLRW predictions by as much
as $10\%$. This bias is due to the viable photon trajectories being restricted by the presence of
the opaque objects, which means that they cannot probe the regions of space-time with the highest
curvature. It corresponds to a positive bias of order $10\%$ in the estimation of $\Omega_{\Lambda}$
and highlights the important consequences that astronomical selection effects can have on cosmological
observables.
