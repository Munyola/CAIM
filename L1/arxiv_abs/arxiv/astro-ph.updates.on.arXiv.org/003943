We set out to compile a catalogue of RRab pulsating variables in the SuperWASP archive and identify
candidate Blazhko effect objects within this catalogue. We analysed their light curves and power
spectra for correlations in their common characteristics to further our understanding of the phenomenon.
Pulsation periods were found for each SWASP RRab object using PDM techniques. Low frequency periodic
signals detected in the CLEAN power spectra of RRab stars were matched with modulation sidebands
and combined with pairs of sidebands to produce a list of candidate Blazhko periods. A novel technique
was used in an attempt to identify Blazhko effect stars by comparing scatter at different parts of
the folded light curve. Pulsation amplitudes were calculated based on phase folded light curves.
The SuperWASP RRab catalogue consists of 4963 objects of which 3397 are previously unknown. We discovered
983 distinct candidates for Blazhko effect objects, 613 of these being previously unknown in the
literature as RR Lyrae stars, and 894 are previously unknown to be Blazhko effect stars. Correlations
were investigated between the scatter of points on the light curve, the periods and amplitudes of
the objects' pulsations, and those of the Blazhko effect. A statistical analysis has been performed
on a large population of Blazhko effect stars from the wide-field SuperWASP survey. No correlations
were found between the Blazhko period and other parameters including the Blazhko amplitude, although
we confirmed a lower rate of occurrence of the Blazhko effect in long pulsation period objects.
