A massive star can enter the blue supergiant region either evolving directly from the main-sequence,
or evolving from a previous red supergiant stage. The fractions of the blue supergiants having different
histories depend on the internal mixing and mass-loss during the red supergiant stage. We study
the possibility to use diagnostics based on stellar pulsation to discriminate blue supergiants
having different evolution histories. For this purpose we have studied the pulsation property
of massive star models calculated with the Geneva stellar evolution code for initial masses ranging
from 8 to 50 M$_\odot$ with a solar metallicity of $Z=0.014$. We have found that radial pulsations
are excited in the blue-supergiant region only in the models that had been red-supergiants before.
This would provide us with a useful mean to diagnose the history of evolution of each blue-supergiant.
At a given effective temperature, much more nonradial pulsations are excited in the model after
the red-supergiant stage than in the model evolving towards the red-supergiant. The properties
of radial and nonradial pulsations in blue supergiants are discussed. Predicted periods are compared
with period ranges observed in some \alpha-Cygni variables in the Galaxy and NGC 300. We have found
that blue supergiant models after the red-supergiant stage roughly agree with observed period
ranges in most cases. However, we are left with the puzzle that the predicted surface N/C and N/O ratios
seem to be too high compared with those of Deneb and Rigel.
