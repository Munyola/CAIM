We identify 814 discrete HI clouds in 40 dwarf irregular galaxies from the LITTLE THINGS survey using
an automated cloud-finding algorithm. The cloud masses range from ~10^3 to 10^7 Msolar, have a surface
density averaged over all of the clouds of ~9.65 Msolar/pc^2, and constitute 2-53% of the total HI
mass of the host galaxy. For individual clouds, the mass including He varies with cloud radius as
log M_{gas} = (2.11\pm0.04)x log R_{cl}+(0.78\pm0.08) and the internal velocity dispersion varies
as log V_{disp} = 0.5xlog R_{cl}-0.57\pm0.21. The HI clouds tend to be in the outer regions of the
galaxies, with 72% of the galaxies having more than 70% of their clouds outside one disk scale length,
and 32% of the galaxies having more than 50% of their clouds outside the radius encircling the HII
emission. 36% of the clouds are essentially non-self-gravitating from HI alone, with a virial parameter
that exceeds alpha_{vir}~10, and 5% have alpha_{vir}\le2. We estimate the missing molecular mass,
based on the total star formation rate and a typical molecular consumption time of 2 Gyr, as observed
in CO-rich galaxies. The resulting molecular fraction has a value averaged over the galaxies of
0.23 and correlates with both the surface density of star formation and the fraction of HI clouds
in the outer regions. We conclude that a significant fraction of the inner parts of these dwarf galaxy
disks is in the form of dark molecular gas, and that this fraction could be high enough to make the inner
disks mildly gravitationally unstable as a precursor to star formation.
