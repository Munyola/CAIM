Observations of thermonuclear X-ray bursts from accreting neutron stars (NSs) in low-mass X-ray
binary systems can be used to constrain NS masses and radii. Most previous work of this type has set
these constraints using Planck function fits as a proxy: both the models and the data are fit with
diluted blackbody functions to yield normalizations and temperatures which are then compared
against each other. Here, for the first time, we fit atmosphere models of X-ray bursting NSs directly
to the observed spectra. We present a hierarchical Bayesian fitting framework that uses state-of-the-art
X-ray bursting NS atmosphere models with realistic opacities and relativistic exact Compton scattering
kernels as a model for the surface emission. We test our approach against synthetic data, and find
that for data that are well-described by our model we can obtain robust radius, mass, distance, and
composition measurements. We then apply our technique to Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer observations
of five hard-state X-ray bursts from 4U 1702-429. Our joint fit to all five bursts shows that the theoretical
atmosphere models describe the data well but there are still some unmodeled features in the spectrum
corresponding to a relative error of 1-5% of the energy flux. After marginalizing over this intrinsic
scatter, we find that at 68% credibility the circumferential radius of the NS in 4U 1702-429 is R =
12.4+-0.4 km, the gravitational mass is M=1.9+-0.3 Msun, the distance is 5.1 < D/kpc < 6.2, and the
hydrogen mass fraction is X < 0.09.
