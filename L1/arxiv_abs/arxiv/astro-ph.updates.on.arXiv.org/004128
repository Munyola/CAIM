X-ray spectral timing analysis is presented of XMM-Newton observations of the narrow line Seyfert
1 galaxy I Zwicky 1 (I Zw 1) taken in 2015 January. After exploring the effect of background flaring
on timing analyses, X-ray time lags between the reflection-dominated 0.3-1.0keV energy and continuum-dominated
1.0-4.0keV band are measured, indicative of reverberation off the inner accretion disc. The reverberation
lag time is seen to vary as a step function in frequency; across lower frequency components of the
variability, 3e-4 to 1.2e-3Hz a lag of 160s is measured, but the lag shortens to (59 +/- 4)s above 1.2e-3Hz.
The lag-energy spectrum reveals differing profiles between these ranges with a change in the dip
showing the earliest arriving photons. The low frequency signal indicates reverberation of X-rays
emitted from a corona extended at low height over the disc while at high frequencies, variability
is generated in a collimated core of the corona through which luminosity fluctuations propagate
upwards. Principal component analysis of the variability supports this interpretation, showing
uncorrelated variation in the spectral slope of two power law continuum components. The distinct
evolution of the two components of the corona is seen as a flare passes inwards from the extended to
the collimated portion. An increase in variability in the extended corona was found preceding the
initial increase in X-ray flux. Variability from the extended corona was seen to die away as the flare
passed into the collimated core leading to a second sharper increase in the X-ray count rate.
