We are experiencing a period of extreme intellectual effervescence in the area of cosmology. A huge
volume of observational data in unprecedented quantity and quality and a more consistent theoretical
framework propelled cosmology to an era of precision, turning the discipline into a cutting-edge
area of contemporary science. Observations with type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia), showed that the expanding
Universe is accelerating, an unexplained fact in the traditional decelerated model. Identifying
the cause of this acceleration is the most fundamental problem in the area. As in the scientific renaissance,
the solution will guide the course of the discipline in the near future and the possible answers (whether
dark energy, some extension of general relativity or a still unknown mechanism) should also leverage
the development of physics. In this context, without giving up a pedagogical approach, we present
an overview of both the main theoretical results and the most significant observational discoveries
of cosmology in the last 100 years. The saga of cosmology will be presented in a trilogy. In this article
(Part I), based on the articles by Einstein, de Sitter, Friedmann, Lema\^itre and Hubble, we will
describe the period between the origins of cosmology and the discovery of Universal expansion (1929).
In Part II, we will see the period from 1930 to 1997, closing with the old standard decelerated model.
The Part III will be entirely devoted to the accelerated model of the universe, the cosmic paradigm
of the XXI century.
