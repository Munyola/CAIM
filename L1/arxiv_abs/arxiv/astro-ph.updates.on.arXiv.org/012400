A fundamental property of an expanding universe is that any time dependent characteristic of distant
objects must appear to scale by the factor $(1+z$). This is called time dilation. Light curves of
type Ia supernovae and the duration of Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRB) are the only observations that can
directly measure time dilation over a wide range of redshifts. An analysis of raw observations of
2,333 type Ia supernovae light-curves shows that their widths, relative to a standard template,
have a power-law exponent as a function of ${(1+z)}$, of (0.083 +/- 0.024) which is consistent with
no time dilation and inconsistent with standard time dilation. In addition, it is shown that the
standard method for calibrating the type Ia supernovae light curves (SALT2) is flawed, which explains
why this lack of time dilation has not been previously observed. \par Nearby observations show that
the peak absolute magnitude of type Ia supernovae is also constant. Here it is shown that the peak
absolute magnitude is independent of redshift if a static universe cosmology, Curvature Cosmology,
is used to provide the distance moduli. Furthermore, it is explained why the modified $\Lambda$-CDM
model provides similar results. \par Analysis of the duration of GRB shows that they are consistent
with no time dilation and have no support for standard time dilation. Consequently, this paper argues
for a fundamental change from the current paradigm of an expanding universe to one for a static universe.
