Citizen science has helped astronomers comb through large data sets to identify patterns and objects
that are not easily found through automated processes. The Milky Way Project (MWP), a citizen science
initiative on the Zooniverse platform, presents internet users with infrared (IR) images from
Spitzer Space Telescope Galactic plane surveys. MWP volunteers make classification drawings
on the images to identify targeted classes of astronomical objects. We present the MWP second data
release (DR2) and an updated data reduction pipeline written in Python. We aggregate ${\sim}3$
million classifications made by MWP volunteers during the years 2012-2017 to produce the DR2 catalogue,
which contains 2600 IR bubbles and 599 candidate bow-shock driving stars. The reliability of bubble
identifications, as assessed by comparison to visual identifications by trained experts and scoring
by a machine-learning algorithm, is found to be a significant improvement over DR1. We assess the
reliability of IR bow shocks via comparison to expert identifications and the colours of candidate
bow-shock driving stars in the 2MASS point-source catalogue. We hence identify highly-reliable
subsets of 1394 DR2 bubbles and 453 bow-shock driving stars. Uncertainties on object coordinates
and bubble size/shape parameters are included in the DR2 catalog. Compared with DR1, the DR2 bubbles
catalogue provides more accurate shapes and sizes. The DR2 catalogue identifies 311 new bow shock
driving star candidates, including three associated with the giant HII regions NGC 3603 and RCW
49.
