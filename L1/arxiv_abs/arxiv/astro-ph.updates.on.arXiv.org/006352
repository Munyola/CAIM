This is the first paper of a series dedicated to nebular physics and the chemical evolution of nearby
galaxies by investigating large samples of HII regions with the CFHT imaging spectrograph SITELLE.
We present a technique adapted to imaging spectroscopy to identify and extract parameters from
4285 HII region candidates found in the disc of NGC628. Using both the spatial and spectral capabilities
of SITELLE, our technique enables the extraction of the position, dust extinction, velocity, Halpha
profile, diffuse ionised gas (DIG) background, luminosity, size, morphological type, and the
emission line fluxes for individual spaxels and the integrated spectrum for each region. We have
produced a well-sampled HII region luminosity function and studied its variation with galactocentric
radius and level of the DIG background. We found a slope of 1.12+/-0.03 with no evidence of a break
at high luminosity. Based on the width of the region profile, bright regions are rather compact,
while faint regions are seen over a wide range of sizes. The radius function reveals a slope of 1.81+/-0.02.
BPT diagrams of the individual spaxels and integrated line ratios confirm that most detections
are HII regions. Also, maps of the line ratios show complex variations of the ionisation conditions
within HII regions. All this information is compiled in a new catalogue for HII regions. The objective
of this database is to provide a complete sample which will be used to study the whole parameter space
covered by the physical conditions in active star-forming regions.
