We investigate infrared dynamics of four-dimensional Einstein gravity in de Sitter space. We set
up a general framework to investigate dynamical scaling relations in quantum/classical gravitational
theories. The conformal mode dependence of Einstein gravity is renormalized to the extent that
general covariance is not manifest. We point out that the introduction of an inflaton is necessary
as a counter term. We observe and postulate a duality between quantum effects in Einstein gravity
and classical evolutions in inflation/quintessence models. The quantum effective action of Einstein
gravity can be constructed as inflation/quintessence models with manifest general covariance.
We show that $g=G_N H^2/\pi$: the only dimensionless coupling of $H^2$ (Hubble parameter) and $G_N$
(Newton's coupling) in Einstein gravity is screened by the infrared logarithmic fluctuations
of the conformal mode. We evaluate the one-loop $\beta$ function of $g$ with respect to the cosmic
time $\log Ht$ as $\beta(g)=-(1/2)g^2$, i.e., $g$ is asymptotically free toward future. We have
identified de Sitter entropy $1/g$ with von Neumann entropy of the conformal zero modes. The former
evolves according to the $\beta$ function and Gibbons-Hawking formula. The latter is found to increase
by diffusion in the stochastic process at the horizon in a consistent way. Our Universe is located
very close to the fixed point $g=0$ with a large entropy. We discuss possible physical implications
of our results such as logarithmic decay of dark energy.
