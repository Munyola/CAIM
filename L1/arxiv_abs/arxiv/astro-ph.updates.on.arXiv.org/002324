We study the relationship between dark-matter haloes and matter in the MIP $N$-body simulation
ensemble, which allows precision measurements of this relationship, even deeply into voids. What
enables this is a lack of discreteness, stochasticity, and exclusion, achieved by averaging over
hundreds of possible sets of initial small-scale modes, while holding fixed large-scale modes
that give the cosmic web. We find (i) that dark-matter-halo formation is greatly suppressed in voids;
there is an exponential downturn at low densities in the otherwise power-law matter-to-halo density
bias function. Thus, the rarity of haloes in voids is akin to the rarity of the largest clusters, and
their abundance is quite sensitive to cosmological parameters. The exponential downturn appears
both in an excursion-set model, and in a model in which fluctuations evolve in voids as in an open universe
with an effective $\Omega_m$ proportional to a large-scale density. We also find that (ii) haloes
typically populate the average halo-density field in a super-Poisson way, i.e. with a variance
exceeding the mean; and (iii) the rank-order-Gaussianized halo and dark-matter fields are impressively
similar in Fourier space. We compare both their power spectra and cross-correlation, supporting
the conclusion that one is roughly a strictly-increasing mapping of the other. The MIP ensemble
especially reveals how halo abundance varies with `environmental' quantities beyond the local
matter density; (iv) we find a visual suggestion that at fixed matter density, filaments are more
populated by haloes than clusters.
