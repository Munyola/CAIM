The historic first detection of gravitational wave emission from a binary neutron star merger by
the advanced LIGO/Virgo detector network was also the inauguration of GW/EM multi-messenger astronomy,
as an associated short gamma-ray burst (SGRB) and a radioactive kilonova (KN) were found in broad-band
electromagnetic follow-up campaigns. These observations cement the association between SGRBs
and compact object mergers, as well as providing a well sampled multi-wavelength light curve of
a KN for the first time. Here we compare the optical and near-infrared light curves of this KN, AT2017gfo,
to the counterparts of a sample of nearby (z < 0.5) SGRBs to characterize their diversity in terms
of their brightness distribution. Although at similar epochs AT2017gfo appears fainter than every
SGRB-associated KN claimed so far, we find three bursts (GRBs 050509B, 061201 and 080905A) where,
if the reported redshifts are correct, deep upper limits rule out the presence of a KN similar to AT2017gfo
by several magnitudes. Combined with the properties of previously claimed KNe in SGRBs this suggests
considerable diversity in the properties of KN drawn from compact object mergers, despite the similar
physical conditions that are expected in many NS-NS mergers. This diversity is likely a product
of the merger type (NS-NS versus NS-BH) and the detailed properties of the binary (mass ratio, spins
etc). Ultimately disentangling these properties should be possible through observations of SGRBs
and gravitational wave sources, providing direct measurements of heavy element enrichment throughout
the Universe.
