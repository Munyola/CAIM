To examine the previously claimed fast cooling of the Central Compact Object (CCO) in the Cas A supernova
remnant (SNR), we analyzed two Chandra observations of this CCO, taken in a setup minimizing instrumental
spectral distortions. We fit the two CCO X-ray spectra from 2006 and 2012 with hydrogen and carbon
neutron star atmosphere models. The temperature and flux changes in the 5.5 years between the two
epochs depend on the adopted constraints on the fitting parameters and the uncertainties of the
effective area calibrations. If we allow a change of the equivalent emitting region size, R_Em,
the effective temperature remains essentially the same. If R_Em is held constant, the best-fit
temperature change is negative, but its statistical significance ranges from 0.8sigma to 2.5sigma,
depending on the model. If we assume that the optical depth of the ACIS filter contaminant in 2012
was +/-10% different from its default calibration value, the significance of the temperature drop
becomes 0.8sigma to 3.1sigma, for the carbon atmospheres with constant R_Em. Thus, we do not see
a statistically significant temperature drop in our data, but the involved uncertainties are too
large to firmly exclude the previously reported fast cooling. Our analysis indicate a decrease
of 4%-6% (1.9-2.9sigma significance) for the absorbed flux in the energy range 0.6-6keV between
2006 and 2012, most prominent in the 1.4-1.8 keV energy range. It could be caused by unaccounted changes
of the detector response or contributions from unresolved SNR material along the line of sight to
the CCO.
