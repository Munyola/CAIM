We constrain the slope of the star formation rate ($\log\Psi$) to stellar mass ($\log\mathrm{M_{\star}}$)
relation down to $\log(\mathrm{M_{\star}/M_{\odot}})=8.4$ ($\log(\mathrm{M_{\star}/M_{\odot}})=9.2$)
at $z=0.5$ ($z=2.5$) with a mass-complete sample of 39,106 star-forming galaxies selected from
the 3D-HST photometric catalogs, using deep photometry in the CANDELS fields. For the first time,
we find that the slope is dependent on stellar mass, such that it is steeper at low masses ($\log\mathrm{\Psi}\propto\log\mathrm{M_{\star}}$)
than at high masses ($\log\mathrm{\Psi}\propto(0.3-0.6)\log\mathrm{M_{\star}}$). These
steeper low mass slopes are found for three different star formation indicators: the combination
of the ultraviolet (UV) and infrared (IR), calibrated from a stacking analysis of Spitzer/MIPS
24$\mu$m imaging; $\beta$-corrected UV SFRs; and H$\alpha$ SFRs. The normalization of the sequence
evolves differently in distinct mass regimes as well: for galaxies less massive than $\log(\mathrm{M_{\star}/M_{\odot}})<10$
the specific SFR ($\Psi/\mathrm{M_{\star}}$) is observed to be roughly self-similar with $\Psi/\mathrm{M_{\star}}\propto(1+z)^{1.9}$,
whereas more massive galaxies show a stronger evolution with $\Psi/\mathrm{M_{\star}}\propto(1+z)^{2.2-3.5}$
for $\log(\mathrm{M_{\star}/M_{\odot}})=10.2-11.2$. The fact that we find a steep slope of the
star formation sequence for the lower mass galaxies will help reconcile theoretical galaxy formation
models with the observations. The results of this study support the analytical conclusions of Leja
et al. (2014).
