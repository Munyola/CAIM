Oxygen is the most abundant "metal" element in stars and in the cosmos. But determining oxygen abundances
in stars has proven challenging, because of the shortage of detectable atomic oxygen lines in their
optical spectra as well as observational and theoretical complications with these lines (e.g.,
blends, 3D, non-LTE). Nonetheless, Ting et al. (2017) were recently able to demonstrate that oxygen
abundances can be determined from low-resolution (R$\simeq$2000) optical spectra. Here we investigate
the physical processes that enable such a measurement for cool stars, such as K-giants. We show that
the strongest spectral diagnostics of oxygen come from the CNO atomic-molecular network, but are
manifested in spectral features that do not involve oxygen. In the outer atmosphere layers most
of the carbon is locked up in CO, and changes to the oxygen abundance directly affect the abundances
of all other carbon-bearing molecules, thereby changing the strength of CH, CN, and C$_2$ features
across the optical spectrum. In deeper atmosphere layers most of the carbon is in atomic form, and
any change in the oxygen abundance has little effect on the other carbon-bearing molecules. The
key physical effect enabling such oxygen abundance measurements is that spectral features in the
optical arise from both the CO-dominant and the atomic carbon-dominant regions, providing non-degenerate
constraints on both C and O. Beyond the case at hand, the results show that physically sound abundances
measurements need not be limited to those elements that have observable lines themselves.
