We derive a self-similar description for the 2D streamline topology and flow structure of an axi-symmetric,
thermally driven wind originating from a disc in which the density is a power law function of radius.
Our scale-free solution is strictly only valid in the absence of gravity or centrifugal support;
comparison with 2D hydrodynamic simulations of winds from Keplerian discs however demonstrates
that the scale-free solution is a good approximation also in the outer regions of such discs, and
can provide a reasonable description even for launch radii well within the gravitational radius
of the flow. Although other authors have considered the flow properties along streamlines whose
geometry has been specified in advance, this is the first isothermal calculation in which the flow
geometry and variation of flow variables along streamlines is determined self-consistently.
It is found that the flow trajectory is very sensitive to the power-law index of radial density variation
in the disc: the steeper the density gradient, the stronger is the curvature of streamlines close
to the flow base that is required in order to maintain momentum balance perpendicular to the flow.
Steeper disc density profiles are also associated with more rapid acceleration, and a faster fall-off
of density, with height above the disc plane. The derivation of a set of simple governing equations
for the flow structure of thermal winds from the outer regions of power law discs offers the possibility
of deriving flow observables without having to resort to hydrodynamical simulation.
