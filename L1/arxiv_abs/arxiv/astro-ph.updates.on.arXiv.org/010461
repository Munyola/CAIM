X-ray Flashes (XRFs), binary-driven hypernovae (BdHNe) are long GRB subclasses with progenitor
a CO$_{\rm core}$, undergoing a supernova (SN) explosion and hypercritically accreting in a tight
binary system onto a companion neutron star (NS) or black hole (BH). In XRFs the NS does not reach by
accretion the critical mass and no BH is formed. In BdHNe I, with shorter binary periods, the NS gravitationally
collapses and leads to a new born BH. In BdHNe II the accretion on an already formed BH leads to a more
massive BH. We assume that the GeV emission observed by \textit{Fermi}-LAT originates from the
rotational energy of the BH. Consequently, we verify that, as expected, in XRFs no GeV emission is
observed. In $16$ BdHNe I and $5$ BdHNe II, within the boresight angle of LAT, the integrated GeV emission
allows to estimate the initial mass and spin of the BH. In the remaining $27$ sources in the plane of
the binary system no GeV emission occurs, hampered by the presence of the HN ejecta. From the ratio,
$21/48$, we infer a new asymmetric morphology for the BdHNe reminiscent of the one observed in active
galactic nuclei (AGN): the GeV emission occurs within a cone of half-opening angle $\approx 60^{\circ}$
from the normal to the orbital plane of the binary progenitor. The transparency condition requires
a Lorentz factor $\Gamma \sim 1500$ on the source of GeV emission. The GeV luminosity in the rest-frame
of the source follows a universal power-law with index of $-1.20 \pm 0.04$, allowing to estimate
the spin-down rate of the BH
