Many debris disks seen in scattered light have shapes that imply their dust grains trace highly eccentric,
apsidally aligned orbits. Apsidal alignment is surprising, especially for dust. Even when born
from an apse-aligned ring of parent bodies, dust grains have their periastra dispersed in all directions
by stellar radiation pressure. The periastra cannot be re-oriented by planets within the short
dust lifetimes at the bottom of the collisional cascade. We propose that what re-aligns dust orbits
is drag exerted by second-generation gas. Gas is largely immune to radiation pressure, and when
released by photodesorption or collisions within an eccentric ring of parent bodies should occupy
a similarly eccentric, apse-aligned ring. Dust grains launched onto misaligned orbits cross the
eccentric gas ring supersonically and can become dragged into alignment within collisional lifetimes.
The resultant dust configurations, viewed nearly but not exactly edge-on, with periastra pointing
away from the observer, appear moth-like, with kinked wings and even doubled pairs of wings, explaining
otherwise mysterious features in HD 61005 ("The Moth") and HD 32297, including their central bulbs
when we account for strong forward scattering from irregularly shaped particles. Around these
systems we predict gas at Kuiper-belt-like distances to move on highly elliptical streamlines
that owe their elongation, ultimately, to highly eccentric planets. Unresolved issues and an alternative
explanation for apsidal alignment are outlined.
