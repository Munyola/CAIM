Resonant relaxation has been discussed as an efficient process that changes the angular momenta
of stars orbiting around a central supermassive black hole due to the fluctuating gravitational
field of the stellar cluster. Other spherical stellar systems, such as globular clusters, exhibit
a restricted form of this effect where enhanced relaxation rate only occurs in the directions of
the angular momentum vectors, but not in their magnitudes; this is called vector resonant relaxation
(VRR). To explore this effect, we performed a large set of direct N-body simulations, with up to 512k
particles and ~500 dynamical times. Contrasting our simulations with Spitzer-style Monte Carlo
simulations, that by design only exhibit 2-body relaxation, we show that the temporal behavior
of the angular momentum vectors in $N$-body simulations cannot be explained by 2-body relaxation
alone. VRR operates efficiently in globular clusters with $N>10^4$. The fact that VRR operates
in globular clusters may open way to use powerful tools in statistical physics for their description.
In particular, since the distribution of orbital planes relaxes much more rapidly than the distribution
of the magnitude of angular momentum and the radial action, the relaxation process reaches an internal
statistical equilibrium in the corresponding part of phase space while the whole cluster is generally
out of equilibrium, in a state of quenched disorder. We point out the need to include effects of VRR
in Monte Carlo simulations of globular clusters.
