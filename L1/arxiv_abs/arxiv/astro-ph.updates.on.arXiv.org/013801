We present revised stellar properties for 172 K2 target stars that were identified as possible hosts
of transiting planets during Campaigns 1-17. Using medium-resolution near-infrared spectra
acquired with the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility/SpeX and Palomar/TripleSpec, we found that
86 of our targets were bona fide cool dwarfs, 74 were hotter dwarfs, and 12 were giants. Combining
our spectroscopic metallicities with Gaia parallaxes and archival photometry, we derived photometric
stellar parameters and compared them to our spectroscopic estimates. Although our spectroscopic
and photometric radius and temperature estimates are consistent, our photometric mass estimates
are systematically 0.11 solar masses (34%) higher than our spectroscopic mass estimates for the
least massive stars (photometric mass estimates < 0.4 solar masses). Adopting the photometric
parameters and comparing our results to parameters reported in the Ecliptic Plane Input Catalog,
our revised stellar radii are 0.15 solar radii (40%) larger and our revised stellar effective temperatures
are roughly 65K cooler. Correctly determining the properties of K2 target stars is essential for
characterizing any associated planet candidates, estimating the planet search sensitivity,
and calculating planet occurrence rates. Even though Gaia parallaxes have increased the power
of photometric surveys, spectroscopic characterization remains essential for determining stellar
metallicities and investigating correlations between stellar metallicity and planetary properties.
