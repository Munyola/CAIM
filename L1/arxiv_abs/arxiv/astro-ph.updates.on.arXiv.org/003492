The nature of possible evolutionary pathways between various types of dwarf galaxies is still not
fully understood. Blue compact dwarf galaxies (BCDs) provide a unique window into dwarf galaxy
formation and evolution and are often thought of as an evolutionary stage between different classes
of dwarf galaxies. In this study we use deep optical and near-infrared observations of the underlying
hosts of BCDs in order to study the structural differences between different types of dwarf galaxies.
When compared with dwarf irregular galaxies of similar luminosities, we find that the underlying
hosts of BCDs have significantly more concentrated light distributions, with smaller scale lengths
and brighter central surface brightnesses. We demonstrate here that the underlying hosts of BCDs
are distinct from the broad continuum of typical dwarf irregular galaxies, and that it is unlikely
that most dwarf irregular galaxies can transform into a BCD or vice versa. Furthermore, we find that
the starburst in a BCD only brightens it on average by ~0.8 mag (factor of two), in agreement with other
studies. It appears that a BCD is a long-lived and distinct type of dwarf galaxy that exhibits an exceptionally
concentrated matter distribution. We suggest that it is this compact mass distribution that enables
the strong star formation events that characterize this class of dwarf galaxy, that the compactness
of the underlying host can be used as a distinguishing parameter between BCDs and other dwarf galaxies,
and that it can also be used to identify BCDs which are not currently experiencing an intense starburst
event.
