We attempt to understand the planes of satellite galaxies orbiting the Milky Way (MW) and M31 in the
context of Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND), which implies a close MW-M31 flyby ${\sim 8}$ Gyr
ago. Using the timing argument, we obtain MW-M31 trajectories consistent with cosmological initial
conditions and present observations. We adjust the present M31 proper motion within its uncertainty
in order to simulate a range of orbital geometries and closest approach distances. Treating the
MW and M31 as point masses, we follow the trajectories of surrounding test particle disks, thereby
mapping out the tidal debris distribution. Around each galaxy, the resulting tidal debris tends
to cluster around a particular orbital pole. We find some models in which these preferred spin vectors
align fairly well with those of the corresponding observed satellite planes. The radial distributions
of material in the simulated satellite planes are similar to what we observe. Around the MW, our best-fitting
model yields a significant fraction (0.22) of counter-rotating material, perhaps explaining
why Sculptor counter-rotates within the MW satellite plane. In contrast, our model yields no counter-rotating
material around M31. This is testable with proper motions of M31 satellites. In our best model the
MW disk is thickened by the flyby 7.65 Gyr ago to a root mean square height of 0.75 kpc. This is similar
to the observed age and thickness of the Galactic thick disk. Thus, the MW thick disk may have formed
together with the MW and M31 satellite planes during a past MW-M31 flyby.
