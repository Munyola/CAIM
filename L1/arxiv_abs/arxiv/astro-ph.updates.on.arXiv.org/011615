Prior to the detection of black holes (BHs) via the gravitational waves (GWs) they generate at merger,
the presence of BHs was inferred in X-ray binaries, mostly via dynamical measurements, with measured
masses in the range between $\sim 5-20~M_\odot$. The LIGO discovery of the first BHs via GWs was surprising
in that the two BHs that merged had masses of 35.6 and 28.6 $M_\odot$, which are both above the range
inferred from X-ray binaries. With 10 binary BH detections to date, it has become apparent that,
while the two distributions are not disjoint, they are most certainly distinct. In this Letter,
we suggest that the reason for the apparent dichotomy is due to a predominance of different formation
channels: isolated binary evolution for X-ray binaries, and dynamical exchanges in dense star
clusters for the LIGO BHs. We show, via timescale arguments, that BHs in high-masss X-ray binaries
are preferentially seen when they have lower mass accretors. We then perform high-resolution N-body
simulations of a cluster of isolated BHs with a range of initial mass spectra, and show that BH binaries
are preferentially formed by the most massive BHs, and additionally that these tend to be the tightest
binaries (hence with shorter merger timescales). We also perform a simulation with neutron stars
(NSs) in addition to BHs, more abundant by a factor of 5, and show that the formation of NS-BH binaries
is $< 1\%$ that of BH-BH binaries, hence making the dynamical formation of NS-BH systems much less
likely than that of binary BHs.
