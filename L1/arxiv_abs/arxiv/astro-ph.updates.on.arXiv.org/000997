High-energy particles were recorded by near-Earth spacecraft and ground-based neutron monitors
(NMs) on 2012 May 17. This event was the first ground level enhancement (GLE) of solar cycle 24. In
this study, we try to identify the acceleration source(s) of solar energetic particles by combining
in situ particle measurements from the WIND/3DP, GOES 13, and solar cosmic rays registered by several
NMs, as well as remote-sensing solar observations from SDO/AIA, SOHO/LASCO, and RHESSI. We derive
the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) path length (1.25 +/- 0.05 AU) and solar particle release
time (01:29 +/- 00:01 UT) of the first arriving electrons by using their velocity dispersion and
taking into account contamination effects. We found that the electron impulsive injection phase,
indicated by the dramatic change in the spectral index, is consistent with flare non-thermal emission
and type III radio bursts. Based on the potential field source surface concept, modeling of the open-field
lines rooted in the active region has been performed to provide escape channels for flare-accelerated
electrons.Meanwhile, relativistic protons are found to be released 10 minutes later than the electrons,
assuming their scatter-free travel along the same IMF path length. Combining multi-wavelength
imaging data of the prominence eruption and coronal mass ejection (CME), we obtain evidence that
GLE protons, with an estimated kinetic energy of 1.12 GeV, are probably accelerated by the CME-driven
shock when it travels to 3.07 solar radii. The time-of-maximum spectrum of protons is typical for
shock wave acceleration.
