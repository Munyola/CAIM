We present photometric and spectroscopic analysis of the peculiar core-collapse SN 2013gc. The
light curve shows an early maximum followed by a fast decline and a phase of almost constant luminosity.
At 200 days from maximum, a brightening of 1 mag is observed in all bands, followed by a steep linear
luminosity decline after 300 d. From archival images taken between 1.5 and 2.5 years before the explosion,
we found that a weak source is visible at the supernova location, with mag 20. The early supernova
spectra show Balmer lines, with a narrow (560 km/s) P-Cygni absorption superimposed on a broad (3400
km/s) component, typical of type IIn events. Through a comparison of colour curves, absolute light
curves and spectra of SN 2013gc with a sample of supernovae IIn, we conclude that SN 2013gc is a member
of the so-called type IId subgroup (Benetti 2000). The complex profile of the Halpha line suggests
a composite circumstellar medium geometry, with a combination of lower velocity, spherically
symmetric gas and a more rapidly expanding bilobed feature. This distribution of the circumstellar
medium has been likely formed through major mass-loss events, that we directly observed from 3 years
before the explosion of SN 2013gc. The modest luminosity of SN 2013gc at all phases, the very small
amount of ejected 56Ni (of the order of 10^-3 M_sun), the major pre-supernova stellar activity and
the lack of prominent [O I] lines in the late-time spectra support a fall-back core-collapse scenario
for the massive progenitor of SN 2013gc.
