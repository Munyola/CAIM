We have obtained a deep, simultaneous observation of the bright, nearby Seyfert galaxy IC 4329A
with Suzaku and NuSTAR. Through a detailed spectral analysis, we are able to robustly separate the
continuum, absorption and distant reflection components in the spectrum. The absorbing column
is found to be modest at $N_H = 6 \times 10^{21}$ cm$^2$, and does not introduce any significant curvature
in the Fe K band. We are able to place a strong constraint on the presence of a broadened Fe K{\alpha}
line: $E = 6.46^{+0.08}_{-0.07}$ keV rest frame with ${\sigma} = 0.33^{+0.08}_{-0.07}$ keV and
$EW = 34^{+8}_{-7}$ eV, though we are not able to constrain any of the parameters of a relativistic
reflection model. These results highlight the range in broad Fe K{\alpha} line strengths observed
in nearby, bright AGN (roughly an order of magnitude), and imply a corresponding range in the physical
properties of the inner accretion disk in these sources. We have also updated our previously reported
measurement of the high-energy cutoff of the hard X-ray emission using both observatories rather
than just NuSTAR alone: $E_{cut} = 186 \pm 14$ keV. This high-energy cutoff acts as a proxy for the
temperature of the coronal electron plasma, enabling us to further separate this parameter from
the optical depth of the plasma and to update our results for these parameters as well. We derive $kT
= 50^{+6}_{-3}$ keV with ${\tau} = 2.34^{+0.16}_{-0.11}$ using a spherical geometry, $kT = 61 \pm
1$ keV with ${\tau} = 0.68 \pm 0.02$ for a slab geometry, with both having an equivalent goodness-of-fit.
