Mid-infrared properties are reported of the west hot spot of the radio galaxy Pictor A with the Wide-field
Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE). The mid-infrared counterpart to the hot spot, WISE J051926.26-454554.1,
is listed in the AllWISE source catalog. The source was detected in all the four WISE photometric
bands. A comparison between the WISE and radio images reinforces the physical association of the
\wise\ source to the hot spot. The WISE flux density of the source was carefully evaluated. A close
investigation of the multi-wavelength synchrotron spectral energy distribution from the object
reveals a mid-infrared excess at the wavelength of $\lambda=22$ $\mu$m with a statistical significance
of $4.8 \sigma$ over the simple power-law extrapolation from the synchrotron radio spectrum. The
excess is reinforced by single and double cutoff power-law modeling of the radio-to-optical spectral
energy distribution. The synchrotron cutoff frequency of the main and excess components was evaluated
as $7.1 \times 10^{14}$ Hz and $5.5 \times 10^{13}$ Hz, respectively. From the cutoff frequency,
the magnetic field of the emission region was constrained as a function of the region size. In order
to interpret the excess component, an electron population different from the main one dominating
the observed radio spectrum is necessary. The excess emission is proposed to originate in a sub structure
within the hot spot, in which the magnetic field is by a factor of a few stronger than that in the minimum
energy condition. The relation of the mid-infrared excess to the X-ray emission is briefly discussed.
