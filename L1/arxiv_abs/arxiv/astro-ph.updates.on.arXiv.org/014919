Many warm Jupiters (WJs) have substantial eccentricities, which are linked to their formation
and migration histories. This paper explores eccentricity excitation of WJs due to planet-planet
scattering, beginning with 3-4 planets in unstable orbits, with the innermost planet placed in
the range (0.1 - 1)AU. Such a setup is consistent with either in-situ formation or arrival at sub-AU
orbits due to disk migration. Most previous N-body experiments have focused on "cold" Jupiters
at several AU, where scattering results in planet ejections, efficiently exciting the eccentricities
of surviving planets. In contrast, scattering at sub-AU distances results in a mixture of collisions
and ejections, and the final eccentricities of surviving planets are unclear. We conduct scattering
experiments for a range of planet masses and initial spacings, including the effect of general relativistic
apsidal precession, and systematically catalogue the scattering outcomes and properties of surviving
planets. A comparable number of one-planet and two-planet systems are produced. Two-planet systems
arise exclusively through planet-planet collisions, and tend to have low eccentricities/mutual
inclinations and compact configurations. One-planet systems arise through a combination of ejections
and collisions, resulting in higher eccentricities. The observed eccentricity distribution
of solitary WJs (lacking detection of a giant planet companion) is consistent with roughly 60% of
the systems having undergone in-situ scattering, and the remaining experiencing a quiescent history.
