We present a new statistical tool, called the triangle correlation function, inspired by the earlier
work of Obreschkow et al. (2013). It is derived from the 3-point correlation function (3-PCF) and
aims to probe the characteristic scale of ionised regions during the Epoch of Reionisation (EoR)
from 21cm interferometric observations. Unlike most works, which focus on power spectrum, i.e.
amplitude information, our statistic is based on the information we can extract from the phases
of the Fourier transform of the ionisation field. In this perspective, it may benefit from the well-known
interferometric concept of closure phases. We find that this statistical estimator performs very
well on simple ionisation fields. For example, with well-defined fully ionised disks, there is
a peaking scale, which we can relate to the radius of the actual ionised bubbles through a simple linear
relation. We also explore its robustness when observational effects such as angular resolution
and noise from the instrument are considered. The triangle correlation function also gives satisfying
results on fields generated by more elaborate simulations such as 21CMFAST. Although the variety
of sources and ionised morphologies in the early stages of the process make the interpretation of
results more challenging, the nature of the signal can tell us about the stage of reionisation. Finally,
and in contrast to other bubble size distribution algorithms, the triangle correlation function
can resolve two different characteristic scales in a given map.
