To investigate the role of bars in the chemical evolution of isolated disc galaxies, we performed
a series of 39 gas dynamical simulations of isolated barred and unbarred galaxies with various masses,
initial gas fractions, and AGN feedback models. The presence of a bar drives a substantial amount
of gas toward the central region of the galaxy. In the most massive galaxies, this results in a violent
starburst, followed by a drop in star formation resulting from gas exhaustion. The time delay between
Type Ia and Type II supernovae explosions means that barred galaxies experience a rapid increase
in [O/H] in the central region, and a much more gradual increase in [Fe/H]. In unbarred galaxies,
star formation proceeds at a slow and steady rate, and oxygen and iron are produced at steady rates
which are similar except for a time offset. Comparing the abundance ratios in barred and unbarred
galaxies with the same central stellar mass $M_*$, we find in barred galaxies an enhancement of 0.07
dex in [O/H], 0.05 dex in [Fe/H], and 0.05 dex in [O/Fe]. The [O/H] enhancement is in excellent agreement
with observations from the SDSS. The initial gas fraction has very little effect on the abundance
ratios in barred and unbarred galaxies, unless the galaxies experience a starburst. We considered
AGN-host galaxies located near the bottom of the AGN regime, $M_*>3\times10^{10}M_\odot$, where
AGN feedback dominates over supernovae feedback. We found that the impact of AGN feedback on the
central abundances is marginal.
