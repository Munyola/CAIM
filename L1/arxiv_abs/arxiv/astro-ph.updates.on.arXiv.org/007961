In this paper, we report our multiwavelength observations of the vertical oscillation of a coronal
cavity on 2011 March 16. The elliptical cavity with an underlying horn-like quiescent prominence
was observed by the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on board the \textit{Solar Dynamics Observatory}
(\textit{SDO}). The width and height of the cavity are 150$\arcsec$ and 240$\arcsec$, and the centroid
of cavity is 128$\arcsec$ above the solar surface. At $\sim$17:50 UT, a C3.8 two-ribbon flare took
place in active region 11169 close to the solar western limb. Meanwhile, a partial halo coronal mass
ejection (CME) erupted and propagated at a linear speed of $\sim$682 km s$^{-1}$. Associated with
the eruption, a coronal extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) wave was generated and propagated in the northeast
direction at a speed of $\sim$120 km s$^{-1}$. Once the EUV wave arrived at the cavity from the top,
it pushed the large-scale overlying magnetic field lines downward before bouncing back. At the
same time, the cavity started to oscillate coherently in the vertical direction and lasted for $\sim$2
cycles before disappearing. The amplitude, period, and damping time are 2.4$-$3.5 Mm, 29$-$37
minutes, and 26$-$78 minutes, respectively. The vertical oscillation of the cavity is explained
by a global standing MHD wave of fast kink mode. To estimate the magnetic field strength of the cavity,
we use two independent methods of prominence seismology. It is found that the magnetic field strength
is only a few Gauss and less than 10 G.
