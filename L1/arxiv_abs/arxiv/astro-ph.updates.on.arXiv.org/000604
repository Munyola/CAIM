Observational studies show that there is a strong link between the formation and evolution of galaxies
and the growth of supermassive black holes (SMBH) at their centers. However, the underlying physics
of this observed relation is poorly understood. In order to study the effects of X-ray radiation
on the surroundings of the black hole, we implement X-ray Dominated Region (XDR) physics into Enzo
and use the radiation transport module Moray to calculate the radiative transfer for a polychromatic
spectrum. In this work, we investigate the effects of X-ray irradiation, produced by a central massive
black hole (MBH) with a mass of M = 5x10^4 M_(solar), on ambient gas with solar and zero metallicity.
We find that in the solar metallicity case, due to high opacity of the metals, the energy deposition
rate in the central region (< 20 pc) is high and hence the temperatures in the center are on the order
of 10^(5-7) K. Moreover, due to the cooling ability and high intrinsic opacity of solar metallicity
gas, column densities of 10^(24) cm^(-2) are reached at a radius of 20 pc from the MBH. These column
densities are about 3 orders of magnitudes higher than in the zero metallicity case. Furthermore,
in the zero metallicity case an X-ray induced H II region is formed already after 5.8 Myr. This causes
a significant outflow of gas (~8x10^6 M_(solar) from the central region, with the gas reaching outflow
velocities up to ~100 km s^(-1). At later times, ~23 Myr after we insert the MBH, we find that the solar
metallicity case also develops an X-ray induced H II region, but delayed by ~17 Myr.
