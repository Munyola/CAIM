Proto-planetary disc surveys conducted with ALMA are measuring disc radii in multiple star forming
regions. The disc radius is a fundamental quantity to diagnose whether discs undergo viscous spreading,
discriminating between viscosity or angular momentum removal by winds as drivers of disc evolution.
Observationally, however, the sub-mm continuum emission is dominated by the dust, which also drifts
inwards, complicating the picture. In this paper we investigate, using theoretical models of dust
grain growth and radial drift, how the radii of dusty viscous proto-planetary discs evolve with
time. Despite the existence of a sharp outer edge in the dust distribution, we find that the radius
enclosing most of the dust $\textit{mass}$ increases with time, closely following the evolution
of the gas radius. This behaviour arises because, although dust initially grows and drifts rapidly
onto the star, the residual dust retained on Myr timescales is relatively well coupled to the gas.
Observing the expansion of the dust disc requires using definitions based on high fractions of the
disc $\textit{flux}$ (e.g. 95 per cent) and very long integrations with ALMA, because the dust grains
in the outer part of the disc are small and have a low sub-mm opacity. We show that existing surveys
lack the sensitivity to detect viscous spreading. The disc radii they measure do not trace the mass
radius or the sharp outer edge in the dust distribution, but the outer limit of where the grains have
significant sub-mm opacity. We predict that these observed radii should shrink with time.
