A pulsar wind is a relativistic outflow dominated by Poynting energy at its base. Based on the standard
ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) model of pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe) with the ordered magnetic
field, the observed slow expansion $v_{\rm PWN} \ll c$ requires the wind to be dominated by kinetic
energy at the upstream of its termination shock, which conflicts with the pulsar wind theory ($\sigma$-problem).
In this paper, we extend the standard model of PWNe by phenomenologically taking into account conversion
of the ordered to turbulent magnetic field and dissipation of the turbulent magnetic field. Disordering
of the magnetic structure is inferred from the recent three-dimensional relativistic ideal MHD
simulations, while magnetic dissipation is a non-ideal MHD effect requiring a finite resistivity.
We apply this model to the Crab Nebula and find that the conversion effect is important for the flow
deceleration, while the dissipation effect is not. Even for Poynting-dominated pulsar wind, we
obtain the Crab Nebula's $v_{\rm PWN}$ by adopting a finite conversion time-scale of $\sim 0.3$
yr. Magnetic dissipation primarily affects the synchrotron radiation properties. Any values
of the pulsar wind magnetization $\sigma_{\rm w}$ are allowed within the present model of the PWN
dynamics alone, and even a small termination shock radius of $\ll 0.1$ pc reproduces the observed
dynamical features of the Crab Nebula. In order to establish a high-$\sigma_{\rm w}$ model of PWNe,
it is important to extend the present model by taking into account the broadband spectrum and its
spacial profiles.
