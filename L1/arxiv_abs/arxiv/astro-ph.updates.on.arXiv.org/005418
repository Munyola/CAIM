Secondary CMB polarization is induced by the late-time scattering of CMB photons by free electrons
on our past light cone. This polarized Sunyaev Zel'dovich (pSZ) effect is sensitive to the electrons'
locally observed CMB quadrupole, which is sourced primarily by long wavelength inhomogeneities.
By combining the remote quadrupoles measured by free electrons throughout the Universe after reionization,
the pSZ effect allows us to obtain additional information about large scale modes beyond what can
be learned from our own last scattering surface. Here we determine the power of pSZ tomography, in
which the pSZ effect is cross-correlated with the density field binned at several redshifts, to
provide information about the long wavelength Universe. The signal we explore here is a power asymmetry
in the cross-correlation between $E$ or $B$ mode CMB polarization and the density field. We compare
this to the cosmic variance limited noise: the random chance to get a power asymmetry in the absence
of a large scale quadrupole field. By computing the necessary transfer functions and cross-correlations,
we compute the signal-to-noise ratio attainable by idealized next generation CMB experiments
and galaxy surveys. We find that a signal-to-noise ratio of $\sim 1-10$ is in principle attainable
over a significant range of power multipoles, with the strongest signal coming from the first multipoles
in the lowest redshift bins. These results prompt further assessment of realistically measuring
the pSZ signal and the potential impact for constraining cosmology on large scales.
