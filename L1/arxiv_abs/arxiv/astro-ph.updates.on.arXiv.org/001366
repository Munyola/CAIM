We analyze the hydrostatic effect of AGN radiation pressure on optically thick gas in the host galaxy.
We show that in luminous AGN, the radiation pressure likely confines the ionized layer of the illuminated
gas. Radiation pressure confinement (RPC) has two main implications. First, the gas density near
the ionization front is 7x10^4 L_{i,45} r_{50}^{-2} cm^{-3}, where L_{i,45} is the ionizing luminosity
in units of 10^45 erg/s and r_{50} is the distance of the gas from the nucleus in units of 50 pc. Second,
as shown by Dopita et al., the solution of the ionization structure within each slab is unique, independent
of the ambient pressure. We show that the RPC density vs. distance relation is observed over a dynamical
range of ~10^4 in distance, from sub-pc to kpc from the nucleus, and a range of ~10^8 in gas density,
from 10^3 to 10^11 cm^{-3}. This relation implies that the radiative force of luminous AGN can compress
giant molecular clouds in the host galaxy, and possibly affect the star formation rate. The unique
ionization structure in RPC includes a highly ionized X-ray emitting surface, an intermediate
layer which emits coronal lines, and a lower ionization inner layer which emits optical lines. This
structure can explain the observed overlap of the extended X-ray and optical narrow line emission
in nearby AGN. We further support RPC by comparing the predicted ratios of the narrow lines strength
and narrow line widths with available observations. We suggest a new method, based on the narrow
line widths, to estimate the black hole mass of low luminosity AGN.
