A strong outburst in the X-ray continuum and a change of its Seyfert spectral type was detected in
HE 1136-2304 in 2014. The spectral type changed from nearly Seyfert 2 type (1.95) to Seyfert 1.5 type
in comparison to previous observations taken ten to twenty years before. In a subsequent variability
campaign we wanted to investigate whether this outburst was a single event or whether the variability
pattern following the outburst was similar to those seen in other variable Seyfert galaxies. In
addition to a SALT spectral variability campaign, we carried out optical continuum as well as X-ray
and UV (Swift) monitoring studies from 2014 to 2017. HE 1136-2304 strongly varied on timescales
of days to months from 2014 to 2017. No systematic trends were found in the variability behavior following
the outburst in 2014. A general decrease in flux would have been expected for a tidal disruption event.
This could not be confirmed. More likely the flux variations are connected to irregular fluctuations
in the accretion rate. The strongest variability amplitudes have been found in the X-ray regime:
HE 1136-2304 varied by a factor of eight during 2015. The amplitudes of the continuum variability
(from the UV to the optical) systematically decreased with wavelength following a power law F_var
= a ${\times}$ {\lambda}^-c with c = 0.84. There is a trend that the B-band continuum shows a delay
of three light days with respect to the variable X-ray flux. The Seyfert type 1.5 did not change despite
the strong continuum variations for the period between 2014 and 2017.
