Jupiter and Saturn formed early, before the gas disk dispersed. The presence of gap-opening planets
affects the dynamics of the gas and embedded solids, and halts the inward drift of grains above a certain
size. A drift barrier can explain the absence of calcium-aluminium-rich inclusions (CAIs) in chondrites
originating from parent bodies that accreted in the inner Solar System. Employing an interdisciplinary
approach, we use a $\mu$-X-Ray-fluorescence scanner to search for large CAIs and a scanning electron
microscope to search for small CAIs in the ordinary chondrite NWA 5697. We carry out long-term, two-dimensional
simulations including gas, dust, and planets to characterize the transport of grains within the
viscous $\alpha$-disk framework exploring the scenarios of a stand-alone Jupiter, Jupiter and
Saturn in situ, or in a 3:2 resonance. In each case, we find a critical grain size above which drift
is halted as a function of the physical conditions in the disk. From the laboratory search we find
four CAIs with a largest size of $\approx$200$\,\mu$m. Combining models and data, we provide an
estimate for the upper limit of the $\alpha$-viscosity and the surface density at the location of
Jupiter, using reasonable assumptions about the stellar accretion rate during inward transport
of CAIs, and assuming angular momentum transport to happen exclusively through viscous effects.
Moreover, we find that the compound gap structure in the presence of Saturn in a 3:2 resonance favors
inward transport of grains larger than CAIs currently detected in ordinary chondrites.
