Despite deflections by Galactic and extragalactic magnetic fields, the distribution of ultra-high
energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) over the celestial sphere remains a most promising observable for the
identification of their sources. Thanks to a large number of detected events over the past years,
a large-scale anisotropy at energies above 8 EeV has been identified, and there are also indications
from the Telescope Array and Pierre Auger Collaborations of deviations from isotropy at intermediate
angular scales (about 20 degrees) at the highest energies. In this contribution, we map the flux
of UHECRs over the full sky at energies beyond each of two major features in the UHECR spectrum -- the
ankle and the flux suppression --, and we derive limits for anisotropy on different angular scales
in the two energy regimes. In particular, full-sky coverage enables constraints on low-order multipole
moments without assumptions about the strength of higher-order multipoles. Following previous
efforts from the two Collaborations, we build full-sky maps accounting for the relative exposure
of the arrays and differences in the energy normalizations. The procedure relies on cross-calibrating
the UHECR fluxes reconstructed in the declination band around the celestial equator covered by
both observatories. We present full-sky maps at energies above 10 EeV and 50 EeV, using the largest
datasets shared across UHECR collaborations to date. We report on anisotropy searches exploiting
full-sky coverage and discuss possible constraints on the distribution of UHECR sources.
