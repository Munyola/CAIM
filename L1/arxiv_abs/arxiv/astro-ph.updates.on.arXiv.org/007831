We present one of the most precise emission spectra of an exoplanet observed so far. We combine five
secondary eclipses of the hot Jupiter WASP-18 b (Tday=2900K) that we secured between 1.1 and 1.7
micron with the WFC3 instrument aboard the Hubble Space Telescope. Our extracted spectrum (S/N=50,
R=40) does not exhibit clearly identifiable molecular features but is poorly matched by a blackbody
spectrum. We complement this data with previously published Spitzer/IRAC observations of this
target and interpret the combined spectrum by computing a grid of self-consistent, 1D forward models,
varying the composition and energy budget. At these high temperatures, we find there are important
contributions to the overall opacity from H- ions, as well as the removal of major molecules by thermal
dissociation (including water), and thermal ionization of metals. These effects were omitted
in previous spectral retrievals for very hot gas giants, and we argue that they must be included to
properly interpret the spectra of these objects. We infer a new metallicity and C/O ratio for WASP-18
b, and find them well constrained to be solar ([M/H]=-0.01 (0.35), C/O<0.85 at 3 sigma confidence
level), unlike previous work but in line with expectations for giant planets. The best fitting self-consistent
temperature-pressure profiles are inverted, resulting in an emission feature at 4.5 micron seen
in the Spitzer photometry. These results further strengthen the evidence that the family of very
hot gas giant exoplanets commonly exhibit thermal inversions.
