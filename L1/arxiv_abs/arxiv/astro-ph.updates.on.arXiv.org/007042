We present 1.3 millimeter observations of the debris disk surrounding the HR 8799 multi-planet
system from the Submillimeter Array to complement archival ALMA observations that spatially filtered
away the bulk of the emission. The image morphology at $3.8$ arcsecond (150 AU) resolution indicates
an optically thin circumstellar belt, which we associate with a population of dust-producing planetesimals
within the debris disk. The interferometric visibilities are fit well by an axisymmetric radial
power-law model characterized by a broad width, $\Delta R/R\gtrsim 1$. The belt inclination and
orientation parameters are consistent with the planet orbital parameters within the mutual uncertainties.
The models constrain the radial location of the inner edge of the belt to $R_\text{in}= 104_{-12}^{+8}$
AU. In a simple scenario where the chaotic zone of the outermost planet b truncates the planetesimal
distribution, this inner edge location translates into a constraint on the planet~b mass of $M_\text{pl}
= 5.8_{-3.1}^{+7.9}$ M$_{\rm Jup}$. This mass estimate is consistent with infrared observations
of the planet luminosity and standard hot-start evolutionary models, with the uncertainties allowing
for a range of initial conditions. We also present new 9 millimeter observations of the debris disk
from the Very Large Array and determine a millimeter spectral index of $2.41\pm0.17$. This value
is typical of debris disks and indicates a power-law index of the grain size distribution $q=3.27\pm0.10$,
close to predictions for a classical collisional cascade.
