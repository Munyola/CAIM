We determine the response of a uniformly rotating star to tidal perturbations due to a companion.
General periodic orbits and parabolic flybys are considered. We evaluate energy and angular momentum
exchange rates as a sum of contributions from normal modes allowing for dissipative processes.
We consider the case when the response is dominated by the contribution of an identifiable regular
spectrum of low frequency modes, such as gravity modes and evaluate it in the limit of very weak dissipation.
Our formalism may be applied both to Sun-like stars with radiative cores and convective envelopes
and to more massive stars with convective cores and radiative envelopes. We provide general expressions
for transfer of energy and angular momentum valid for an orbit with any eccentricity. Detailed calculations
are made for Sun-like stars in the slow rotation regime where centrifugal distortion is neglected
in the equilibrium and the traditional approximation is made for the normal modes. We use both a WKBJ
procedure and direct numerical evaluation which are found to be in good agreement for regimes of
interest. Finally we use our formalism to determine the evolution time scales for an object, in an
orbit of small eccentricity, around a Sun-like star in which the tidal response is assumed to occur.
Systems with either no rotation or synchronous rotation are considered. Only rotationally modified
gravity modes are taken into account under the assumption that wave dissipation occurs close to
the stellar centre.
