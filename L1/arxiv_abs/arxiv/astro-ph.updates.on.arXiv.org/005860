Planets and brown dwarfs in close orbits will interact with their host stars, as soon as the stars
evolve to become red giants. However, the outcome of those interactions is still unclear. Recently,
several brown dwarfs have been discovered orbiting hot subdwarf stars at very short orbital periods
of 0.065 - 0.096 d. More than 8\% of the close hot subdwarf binaries might have sub-stellar companions.
This shows that such companions can significantly affect late stellar evolution and that sdB binaries
are ideal objects to study this influence. Thirty-eight new eclipsing sdB binary systems with cool
low-mass companions and periods from 0.05 to 0.5 d were discovered based on their light curves by
the OGLE project. In the recently published catalog of eclipsing binaries in the Galactic bulge,
we discovered 75 more systems. We want to use this unique and homogeneously selected sample to derive
the mass distribution of the companions, constrain the fraction of sub-stellar companions and
determine the minimum mass needed to strip off the red-giant envelope. We are especially interested
in testing models that predict hot Jupiter planets as possible companions. Therefore, we started
the EREBOS (Eclipsing Reflection Effect Binaries from the OGLE Survey) project, which aims at analyzing
those new HW Vir systems based on a spectroscopic and photometric follow up. For this we were granted
an ESO Large Program for ESO-VLT/FORS2. Here we give an update on the current status of the project
and present some preliminary results.
