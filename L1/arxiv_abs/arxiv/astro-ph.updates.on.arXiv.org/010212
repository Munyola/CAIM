The conditions and evolution of protoplanetary disks in multiple systems can be considerably different
from those around single stars, which may have important consequences for planet formation. We
present Very Large Array (VLA) 8.8 mm (34 GHz) and 5 cm (6 GHz) observations of the quadruple system
HD 98800, which consists of two spectroscopic binary systems (Aa-Ab, Ba-Bb). The Ba-Bb pair is surrounded
by a circumbinary disk, usually assumed to be a debris disk given its $\sim$10 Myr age and lack of near
infrared excess. The VLA 8.8 mm observations resolve the disk size (5-5.5 au) and its inner cavity
($\approx$3 au) for the first time, making it one of the smallest disks known. Its small size, large
fractional luminosity, and millimeter spectral index consistent with blackbody emission support
the idea that HD 98800 B is a massive, optically thick ring which may still retain significant amounts
of gas. The disk detection at 5 cm is compatible with free-free emission from photoionized material.
The diskless HD 98800 A component is also detected, showing partial polarization at 5 cm compatible
with non-thermal chromospheric activity. We propose that tidal torques from Ba-Bb and A-B have
stopped the viscous evolution of the inner and outer disk radii, and the disk is evolving via mass
loss through photoevaporative winds. This scenario can explain the properties and longevity of
HD 98800 B as well as the lack of a disk around HD 98800 A, suggesting that planet formation could have
more time to proceed in multiple systems than around single stars in certain system configurations.
