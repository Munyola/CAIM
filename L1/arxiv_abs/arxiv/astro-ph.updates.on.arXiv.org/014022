The morphology of thin stellar streams can be used to test the nature of dark matter. It is therefore
crucial to extend searches for globular cluster streams to other galaxies than the Milky Way. In
this paper, we investigate the current and future prospects of detecting globular cluster streams
in external galaxies in resolved stars (e.g. with WFIRST) and using integrated light (e.g. with
HSC, LSST and Euclid). In particular, we inject mock-streams to data from the PAndAS M31 survey,
and produce simulated M31 backgrounds mimicking what WFIRST will observe in M31. Additionally,
we estimate the distance limit to which globular cluster streams will be observable. Our results
demonstrate that for a 1 hour (1000 sec.) exposure, using conservative estimates, WFIRST should
detect globular cluster streams in resolved stars in galaxies out to distances of ~3.5 Mpc (~2 Mpc).
This volume contains 199 (122) galaxies of which >90% are dwarfs. With integrated light, thin streams
can be resolved out to ~100 Mpc with HSC and LSST and to ~600 Mpc with WFIRST and Euclid. The low surface
brightness of the streams (typically >30 mag/arcsec$^2$), however, will make them difficult to
detect, unless the streams originate from very young clusters. We emphasize that if the external
galaxies do not host spiral arms or galactic bars, gaps in their stellar streams provide an ideal
test case for evidence of interactions with dark matter subhalos. Furthermore, obtaining a large
samples of thin stellar streams can help constrain the orbital structure and hence the potentials
of external halos.
