We describe the Pan-STARRS Moving Object Processing System (MOPS), a modern software package that
produces automatic asteroid discoveries and identifications from catalogs of transient detections
from next-generation astronomical survey telescopes. MOPS achieves > 99.5% efficiency in
producing orbits from a synthetic but realistic population of asteroids whose measurements were
simulated for a Pan-STARRS4-class telescope. Additionally, using a non-physical grid population,
we demonstrate that MOPS can detect populations of currently unknown objects such as interstellar
asteroids. MOPS has been adapted successfully to the prototype Pan-STARRS1 telescope despite
differences in expected false detection rates, fill-factor loss and relatively sparse observing
cadence compared to a hypothetical Pan-STARRS4 telescope and survey. MOPS remains >99.5% efficient
at detecting objects on a single night but drops to 80% efficiency at producing orbits for objects
detected on multiple nights. This loss is primarily due to configurable MOPS processing limits
that are not yet tuned for the Pan-STARRS1 mission. The core MOPS software package is the product
of more than 15 person-years of software development and incorporates countless additional years
of effort in third-party software to perform lower-level functions such as spatial searching or
orbit determination. We describe the high-level design of MOPS and essential subcomponents, the
suitability of MOPS for other survey programs, and suggest a road map for future MOPS development.
