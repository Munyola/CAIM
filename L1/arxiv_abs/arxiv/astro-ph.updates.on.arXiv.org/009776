We present polarimetric data of CW Tau and DG Tau, two well-known Class II disk/jet systems, obtained
with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array at 870 $\mu$m and 0."2 average resolution.
In CW Tau, the total and polarized emission are both smooth and symmetric, with polarization angles
almost parallel to the minor axis of the projected disk. In contrast, DG Tau displays a structured
polarized emission, with an elongated brighter region in the disk's near side and a belt-like feature
beyond about 0."3 from the source. At the same time the total intensity is spatially smooth, with
no features. The polarization pattern, almost parallel to the minor axis in the inner region, becomes
azimuthal in the outer belt, possibly because of a drop in optical depth. The polarization fraction
has average values of 1.2% in CW Tau and 0.4% in DG Tau. Our results are consistent with polarization
from self-scattering of the dust thermal emission. Under this hypothesis, the maximum size of the
grains contributing to polarization is in the range 100 - 150 $\mu$m for CW Tau and 50 - 70 $\mu$m for
DG Tau. The polarization maps combined with dust opacity estimates indicate that these grains are
distributed in a geometrically thin layer in CW Tau, representing a settling in the disk midplane.
Meanwhile, such settling is not yet apparent for DG Tau. These results advocate polarization studies
as a fundamental complement to total emission observations, in investigations of the structure
and the evolution of protoplanetary disks.
