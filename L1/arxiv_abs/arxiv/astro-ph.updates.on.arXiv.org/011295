Most studies of mass transfer in binary systems assume circular orbits at the onset of Roche-lobe
overflow. However, there are theoretical and observational indications that mass transfer could
occur in eccentric orbits. In particular, eccentricity could be produced via sudden mass loss and
velocity kicks during supernova explosions, or Lidov-Kozai (LK) oscillations in hierarchical
triple systems, or, more generally, secular evolution in multiple-star systems. However, current
analytic models of eccentric mass transfer are faced with the problem that they are only well defined
in the limit of very high eccentricities, and break down for less eccentric and circular orbits.
This provides a major obstacle to implementing such models in binary and higher-order population
synthesis codes, which are useful tools for studying the long-term evolution of a large number of
systems. Here, we present a new analytic model to describe the secular orbital evolution of binaries
undergoing conservative mass transfer. The main improvement of our model is that the mass transfer
rate is a smoothly-varying function of orbital phase, rather than a delta function centered at periapsis.
Consequently, our model is in principle valid for any eccentricity, thereby overcoming the main
limitation of previous works. We implement our model in an easy-to-use and publicly available code
which can be used as a basis for implementations of our model into population synthesis codes. We
investigate the implications of our model in a number of applications with circular and eccentric
binaries, and triples undergoing LK oscillations.
