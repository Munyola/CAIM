HD76431 is a slow rotating post-HB star that shows an underabundance of helium by 0.5 dex relative
to the solar value. These observational facts suggest that atomic diffusion could be active in its
atmosphere. We have used the MMT and Bok spectra to estimate the atmospheric parameters of the target
star using the model atmospheres and synthetic spectra calculated with TLUSTY and SYNSPEC. The
derived values of the effective temperature, surface gravity, helium abundance are consistent
with those obtained by Ramspeck et al. (2001b). It appears that NLTE effect are not important for
HD76431. We have used Stokes I spectra from ESPaDOnS at CFHT to perform an abundance analysis and
a search for observational evidence of vertical stratification of the abundance of certain elements.
The results of our abundance analysis are in good agreement with previously published data with
respect to average abundances. Our numerical simulations show that carbon and nitrogen reveal
signatures of vertical abundance stratification in the atmosphere of HD76431. It appears that
the carbon abundance increases toward the deeper atmospheric layers. Nitrogen also shows a similar
behaviour, but in deeper atmospheric layers we obtain a significant dispersion for the estimates
of its abundance. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of vertical abundance stratification
of metals in a post-HB star and up to now it is the hottest star to show such stratification features.
We also report the detection of two SiIII and one TiIII emission lines in the spectra of HD76431 that
were not detected in previous studies.
