An asteroid pair consists of two unbound objects with almost identical heliocentric orbital elements
that were formed when a single "rubble pile" asteroid failed to remain bound against an increasing
rotation rate. Models suggest that the pairs' progenitors gained the fast rotation due to the YORP
effect. Since it was shown that the spin axis vector can be aligned by the YORP effect, such a behavior
should be seen on asteroid pairs, if they were indeed formed by the described mechanism. Alternatively,
if the pairs were formed by a collision, the spin axes should have a random direction and small or young
bodies might have a tumbling rotation. Here I apply the lightcurve inversion method on self-obtained
photometric data, in order to derive the rotation axis vectors and shape models of the asteroid pairs
2110, 3749, 5026, 6070, 7343 and 44612. Three asteroids resulted with polar-directed spin axes
and three objects with ambiguous results. In addition, the secondary member 44612 presents the
same sense of rotation as its primary member 2110, and its spin is not tumbling. Finally, I use a rotational
fission model, based on the assumption of an angular momentum conservation, and match it to the measured
spin, shape, and mass ratio parameters in order to constrain the density of the primary members in
the pairs. Using this method, low density values that are expected from a "rubble pile" are derived.
All these results lead to the conclusion that the disruption of these asteroid pairs was most likely
the outcome of the YORP effect that spun-up "rubble pile" asteroids.
