We investigate the color-magnitude diagram (CMD) of cluster galaxies in the hierarchical $\Lambda$-CDM
cosmological scenario using both single stellar populations and simple galaxy models. First,
we analyze the effect of bursts and mergers and companion chemical pollution and rejuvenation of
the stellar content on the integrated light emitted by galaxies. The dispersion of the galaxy magnitudes
and colors on the $M_V-(B-V)$ plane is mainly due to mixing of ages and metallicities of the stellar
populations, with mergers weighting more than bursts of similar mass fractions. The analysis is
made using the Monte-Carlo technique applied to ideal model galaxies reduced to single stellar
populations with galaxy-size mass to evaluate mass, age and metallicity of each object. We show
that separately determining the contributions by bursts and mergers leads to a better understanding
of observed properties of CMD of cluster galaxies. Then we repeat the analysis using suitable chemo-photometric
models of galaxies whose mass is derived from the cosmological predictions of the galaxy content
of typical clusters. Using the halo mass function and the Monte-Carlo technique, we derive the formation
redshift of each galaxy and its photometric history. These are used to simulate the CMD of the cluster
galaxies. The main conclusion is that most massive galaxies have acquired the red color they show
today in very early epochs and remained the same ever since. The simulations nicely reproduce the
Red Sequence, the Green Valley and the Blue Cloud, the three main regions of the CMD in which galaxies
crowd.
