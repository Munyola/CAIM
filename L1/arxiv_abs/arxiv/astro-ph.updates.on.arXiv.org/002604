We present optical and near-infrared (NIR) photometry for three gamma-ray burst supernovae (GRB-SNe):
GRB 120729A, GRB 130215A / SN 2013ez and GRB 130831A / SN 2013fu. In the case of GRB 130215A / SN 2013ez,
we also present optical spectroscopy at t-t0=16.1 d, which covers rest-frame 3000-6250 Angstroms.
Based on Fe II (5169) and Si (II) (6355), our spectrum indicates an unusually low expansion velocity
of 4000-6350 km/s, the lowest ever measured for a GRB-SN. Additionally, we determined the brightness
and shape of each accompanying SN relative to a template supernova (SN 1998bw), which were used to
estimate the amount of nickel produced via nucleosynthesis during each explosion. We find that
our derived nickel masses are typical of other GRB-SNe, and greater than those of SNe Ibc that are
not associated with GRBs. For GRB 130831A / SN 2013fu, we use our well-sampled R-band light curve
(LC) to estimate the amount of ejecta mass and the kinetic energy of the SN, finding that these too
are similar to other GRB-SNe. For GRB 130215A, we take advantage of contemporaneous optical/NIR
observations to construct an optical/NIR bolometric LC of the afterglow. We fit the bolometric
LC with the millisecond magnetar model of Zhang & Meszaros (2001), which considers dipole radiation
as a source of energy injection to the forward shock powering the optical/NIR afterglow. Using this
model we derive an initial spin period of P=12 ms and a magnetic field of B=1.1 x 10^15 G, which are commensurate
with those found for proposed magnetar central engines of other long-duration GRBs.
