Stretching a length reaching 10 pc projected in the plane of sky, the radio jet associated with Herbig-Haro
objects 80 and 81 (HH 80-81) is known as the largest and best collimated protostellar jet in our Galaxy.
The nature of the molecular outflow associated with this extraordinary jet remains an unsolved
question which is of great interests to our understanding of the relationship between jets and outflows
in high-mass star formation. Here we present Atacama Pathfinder EXperiment CO(6-5) and (7-6),
James Clerk Maxwell Telescope CO(3-2), Caltech Submillimeter Observatory CO(2-1), and Submillimeter
Array CO and $^{13}$CO(2-1) mapping observations of the outflow. We report on the detection of a
two-component outflow consisting of a collimated component along the jet path and a wide-angle
component with an opening angle of about $30^{\circ}$. The gas velocity structure suggests that
each of the two components traces part of a primary wind. From LVG calculations of the CO lines, the
outflowing gas has a temperature around 88 K, indicating that the gas is being heated by shocks. Based
on the CO(6-5) data, the outflow mass is estimated to be a few $M_{\odot}$, which is dominated by the
wide-angle component. A comparison between the HH 80-81 outflow and other well shaped massive outflows
suggests that the opening angle of massive outflows continues to increase over time. Therefore,
the mass loss process in the formation of early-B stars seems to be similar to that in low-mass star
formation, except that a jet component would disappear as the central source evolves to an ultracompact
HII region.
