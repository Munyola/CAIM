Measurement of cosmic shear using weak gravitational lensing is a challenging task that involves
a number of complicated procedures. We study in detail the systematic errors in measurement of weak
lensing Minkowski Functionals (MFs). Specifically, we focus on systematics associated with galaxy
shape measurement, photometric redshift errors, and shear calibration correction. We first generate
mock weak lensing catalogues that directly incorporate the actual observational characteristics
of the Canada-France-Hawaii Lensing Survey (CFHTLenS). We then perform the Fisher analysis using
the large set of mock catalogues for various cosmological models. We find that the statistical error
associated with the observational effects degrades the cosmological parameter constraints by
a factor of a few. Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) survey with the sky coverage of ~1400 deg2 will constrain
the dark energy equation of state parameter with an error of Delta w_0 ~ 0.25 by the lensing MFs alone,
but biases induced by the systematics can be comparable to the 1-sigma error. We conclude that the
lensing MFs are powerful statistics beyond the two-point statistics, only if well calibrated measurement
of both the redshifts and the shapes of source galaxies is performed. Finally, we analyse the CFHTLenS
data to explore the ability of the MFs to break degeneracies between a few cosmological parameters.
Using a combined analysis of the MFs and the shear correlation function, we derive the matter density
Omega_m0= 0.256+0.054-0.046.
