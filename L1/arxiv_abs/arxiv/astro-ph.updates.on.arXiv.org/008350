We use ALMA and JVLA observations of the galaxy cluster Cl J1449+0856 at z=1.99, in order to study
how dust-obscured star-formation, ISM content and AGN activity are linked to environment and galaxy
interactions during the crucial phase of high-z cluster assembly. We present detections of multiple
transitions of $^{12}$CO, as well as dust continuum emission detections from 11 galaxies in the
core of Cl J1449+0856. We measure the gas excitation properties, star-formation rates, gas consumption
timescales and gas-to-stellar mass ratios for the galaxies. We find evidence for a large fraction
of galaxies with highly-excited molecular gas, contributing $>$50% to the total SFR in the cluster
core. We compare these results with expectations for field galaxies, and conclude that environmental
influences have strongly enhanced the fraction of excited galaxies in this cluster. We find a dearth
of molecular gas in the galaxies' gas reservoirs, implying a high star-formation efficiency (SFE)
in the cluster core, and find short gas depletion timescales $\tau$<0.1-0.4 Gyrs for all galaxies.
Interestingly, we do not see evidence for increased specific star-formation rates (sSFRs) in the
cluster galaxies, despite their high SFEs and gas excitations. We find evidence for a large number
of mergers in the cluster core, contributing a large fraction of the core's total star-formation
compared with expectations in the field. We conclude that the environmental impact on the galaxy
excitations is linked to the high rate of galaxy mergers, interactions and active galactic nuclei
in the cluster core.
