(abridged) We use observations of interstellar absorption features, such as atomic and molecular
lines as well as diffuse interstellar bands (DIBs), towards SN2008fp to study the physical properties
of extra-galactic diffuse interstellar clouds in the host galaxy, ESO428-G14. The properties
of the intervening dust are investigated via spectropolarimetry. The spectra of SN2008fp reveal
a complex of diffuse atomic clouds at radial velocities in line with the systematic velocities of
the host galaxy (~1700 km/s). A translucent (A_V ~ 1.5 mag) cloud is detected at a heliocentric velocity
of 1770 km/s This cold dense cloud is rich in dense atomic gas tracers, molecules, as well as diffuse
interstellar bands. We have detected both C2 and C3 for the first time in a galaxy beyond the Local
Group. The CN (0,0) band line ratios are used to derive an in-situ measurement of the cosmic background
radiation temperature in an external galaxy; this gives an excitation temperature of T = 2.9 +- 0.3
K. The interstellar polarization law deviates significantly from what is observed in the Galaxy,
indicating substantial differences in the composition or size distribution of dust grains in the
SN2008fp host galaxy. C2 is used to probe the cold diffuse ISM density and temperature. The lack of
variability in the extra-galactic absorption line profiles over a period of one month implies that
the absorbing material is not circumstellar and thus not affected directly by the SN event. Also
it shows that there are no significant density variation in the small-scale structure of the molecular
cloud down to 100 AU.
