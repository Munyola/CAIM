Open clusters have long been used to gain insights into the structure, composition, and evolution
of the Galaxy. With the large amount of stellar data available for many clusters in the Gaia era, new
techniques must be developed for analyzing open clusters, as visual inspection of cluster color-magnitude
diagrams is no longer feasible. An automatic tool will be required to analyze large samples of open
clusters. We seek to develop an automatic isochrone-fitting procedure to consistently determine
cluster membership and the fundamental cluster parameters. Our cluster characterization pipeline
first determined cluster membership with precise astrometry, primarily from TGAS and HSOY. With
initial cluster members established, isochrones were fitted, using a chi-squared minimization,
to the cluster photometry in order to determine cluster mean distances, ages, and reddening. Cluster
membership was also refined based on the stellar photometry. We used multiband photometry, which
includes ASCC-2.5 BV, 2MASS JHK_s, Gaia G band. We present parameter estimates for all 24 clusters
closer than 333 pc as determined by the Catalogue of Open Cluster Data and the Milky Way Star Clusters
catalog. We find that our parameters are consistent to those in the Milky Way Star Clusters catalog.
We demonstrate that it is feasible to develop an automated pipeline that determines cluster parameters
and membership reliably. After additional modifications, our pipeline will be able to use Gaia
DR2 as input, leading to better cluster memberships and more accurate cluster parameters for a much
larger number of clusters.
