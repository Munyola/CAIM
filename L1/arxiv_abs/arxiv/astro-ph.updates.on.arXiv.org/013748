In this work, we characterise the contributions from both ongoing star formation and the ambient
radiation field in Local Group galaxy M33, as well as estimate the scale of the local dust-energy
balance (i.e. the scale at which the dust is re-emitting starlight generated in that same region)
in this galaxy through high-resolution radiative transfer (RT) modelling, with defined stellar
and dust geometries. We have characterised the spectral energy distribution (SED) of M33 from UV
to sub-mm wavelengths, at a spatial scale of 100 pc. We constructed input maps of the various stellar
and dust geometries for use in the RT modelling. By modifying our dust mix (fewer very small carbon
grains and a lower silicate-to-carbon ratio as compared to the Milky Way), we can much better fit
the sub-mm dust continuum. Using this new dust composition, we find that we are able to well reproduce
the observed SED of M33 using our adopted model. In terms of stellar attenuation by dust, we find a
reasonably strong, broad UV bump, as well as significant systematic differences in the amount of
dust attenuation when compared to standard SED modelling. We also find discrepancies in the residuals
of the spiral arms versus the diffuse interstellar medium (ISM), indicating a difference in properties
between these two regimes. The dust emission is dominated by heating due to the young stellar populations
at all wavelengths ($\sim$80% at 10 $\mu$m to $\sim$50% at 1 mm). We find that the local dust-energy
balance is restored at spatial scales greater than around 1.5 kpc.
