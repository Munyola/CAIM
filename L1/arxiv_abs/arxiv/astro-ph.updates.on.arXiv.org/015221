If the progenitor of GW170817 harbored a pulsar, then a Poynting flux dominated bow-shock cavity
would have been expected to form around the traveling binary. The characteristic size of this evacuated
region depends strongly on the spin-down evolution of the pulsar companion, which in turn depends
on the merging timescale of the system. If this evacuated region is able to grow to a sufficiently
large scale, then the deceleration of the jet, and thus the onset of the afterglow, would be noticeably
delayed. The first detection of afterglow emission, which was uncovered 9.2 days after the $\gamma$-ray
burst trigger, can thus be used to constrain the size of a pre-existing pulsar-wind cavity. We use
this information, together with a model of the jet to place limits on the presence of a pulsar in GW170817
and discuss the derived constraints in the context of the observed double neutron star binary population.
We find that the majority of Galactic systems that are close enough to merge within a Hubble time would
have carved a discernibly large pulsar-wind cavity, inconsistent with the onset timescale of the
X-ray afterglow of GW170817. Conversely, the recently detected system J1913+1102, which host
a low-luminosity pulsar, provides a congruous Milky Way analog of GW170817's progenitor model.
This study highlights the potential of the proposed observational test for gaining insight into
the origin of double neutron star binaries, in particular if the properties of Galactic systems
are representative of the overall merging population.
