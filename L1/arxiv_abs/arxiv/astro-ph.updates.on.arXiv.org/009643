Black hole-neutron star (BHNS) binaries are amongst promising candidates for the joint detection
of electromagnetic (EM) signals with gravitational waves (GWs) and are expected to be detected
in the near future. Here we study the effect of the BHNS binary parameters on the merger ejecta properties
and associated EM signals. We show that the remnant disk and the unbound ejecta masses are essentially
unaffected by the BH mass distribution and that they gradually increase with the BH spin magnitude
and for softer NS equation of state (EoS), provided the NS disrupts outside the BH event horizon.
The amount of r-process elements synthesised in BHNS mergers is estimated to be a factor of $\sim
10^{2}-10^{4}$ smaller than BNS mergers, due to the smaller dynamical ejecta and merger rates.
We estimate the EM luminosities and the light curves for the early- and late-time emissions from
the ultra-relativistic jet, sub-relativistic dynamical ejecta and wind, and the mildly-relativistic
cocoon for typical ejecta parameters. We then evaluate the low-latency EM follow-up rates of the
GW triggers in terms of the GW detection rate $\dot{N}_{GW}$ for current telescope sensitivities
and typical BHNS binary parameters to find that most of the EM counterparts are detectable for high
BH spin, small BH mass and softer NS EoS when NS disruption is significant. Based on the relative detection
rates for given binary parameters, we find the ease of EM follow-up to be: macronova $\gtrsim$ ejecta
afterglow $>$ jet prompt $\approx$ cocoon prompt $>$ cocoon afterglow $>$ jet afterglow $>>$ wind
afterglow.
