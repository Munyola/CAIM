Efficient estimators of Fourier-space statistics for large number of objects rely on Fast Fourier
Transforms (FFTs), which are affected by aliasing from unresolved small scale modes due to the finite
FFT grid. Aliasing takes the form of a sum over images, each of them corresponding to the Fourier content
displaced by increasing multiples of the sampling frequency of the grid. These spurious contributions
limit the accuracy in the estimation of Fourier-space statistics, and are typically ameliorated
by simultaneously increasing grid size and discarding high-frequency modes. This results in inefficient
estimates for e.g. the power spectrum when desired systematic biases are well under per-cent level.
We show that using interlaced grids removes odd images, which include the dominant contribution
to aliasing. In addition, we discuss the choice of interpolation kernel used to define density perturbations
on the FFT grid and demonstrate that using higher-order interpolation kernels than the standard
Cloud in Cell algorithm results in significant reduction of the remaining images. We show that combining
fourth-order interpolation with interlacing gives very accurate Fourier amplitudes and phases
of density perturbations. This results in power spectrum and bispectrum estimates that have systematic
biases below 0.01% all the way to the Nyquist frequency of the grid, thus maximizing the use of unbiased
Fourier coefficients for a given grid size and greatly reducing systematics for applications to
large cosmological datasets.
