Visinelli and Gondolo (2015, hereafter VG15) derived analytic expressions for the evolution of
the dark matter temperature in a generic cosmological model. They then calculated the dark matter
kinetic decoupling temperature $T_{\mathrm{kd}}$ and compared their results to the Gelmini and
Gondolo (2008, hereafter GG08) calculation of $T_{\mathrm{kd}}$ in an early matter-dominated
era (EMDE), which occurs when the Universe is dominated by either a decaying oscillating scalar
field or a semistable massive particle before Big Bang nucleosynthesis. VG15 found that dark matter
decouples at a lower temperature in an EMDE than it would in a radiation-dominated era, while GG08
found that dark matter decouples at a higher temperature in an EMDE than it would in a radiation-dominated
era. VG15 attributed this discrepancy to the presence of a matching constant that ensures that the
dark matter temperature is continuous during the transition from the EMDE to the subsequent radiation-dominated
era and concluded that the GG08 result is incorrect. We show that the disparity is due to the fact that
VG15 compared $T_\mathrm{kd}$ in an EMDE to the decoupling temperature in a radiation-dominated
universe that would result in the same dark matter temperature at late times. Since decoupling during
an EMDE leaves the dark matter colder than it would be if it decoupled during radiation domination,
this temperature is much higher than $T_\mathrm{kd}$ in a standard thermal history, which is indeed
lower than $T_{\mathrm{kd}}$ in an EMDE, as stated by GG08.
