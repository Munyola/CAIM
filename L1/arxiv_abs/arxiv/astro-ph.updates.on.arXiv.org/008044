A decade of study has established that the molecular gas properties of star-forming galaxies follow
coherent scaling relations out to z~3, suggesting remarkable regularity of the interplay between
molecular gas, star formation, and stellar growth. Passive galaxies, however, are expected to
be gas-poor and therefore faint, and thus little is known about molecular gas in passive galaxies
beyond the local universe. Here we present deep Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array
(ALMA) observations of CO(2-1) emission in 8 massive (Mstar ~ 10^11 Msol) galaxies at z~0.7 selected
to lie a factor of 3-10 below the star-forming sequence at this redshift, drawn from the Large Early
Galaxy Astrophysics Census (LEGA-C) survey. We significantly detect half the sample, finding
molecular gas fractions <~0.1. We show that the molecular and stellar rotational axes are broadly
consistent, arguing that the molecular gas was not accreted after the galaxies became quiescent.
We find that scaling relations extrapolated from the star-forming population over-predict both
the gas fraction and gas depletion time for passive objects, suggesting the existence of either
a break or large increase in scatter in these relations at low specific star formation rate. Finally,
we show that the gas fractions of the passive galaxies we have observed at intermediate redshifts
are naturally consistent with evolution into local massive early-type galaxies by continued low-level
star formation, with no need for further gas accretion or dynamical stabilization of the gas reservoirs
in the intervening 6 billion years.
