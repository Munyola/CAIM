The bright Nova Cygni 1975 is a rare nova on a magnetic white dwarf (WD). Later it was found to be an asynchronous
polar, now called V1500 Cyg. Our multisite photometric campaign occurring 40 years post eruption
covered 26-nights (2015-2017). The reflection effect from the heated donor has decreased, but
still dominates the op- tical radiation with an amplitude ~1^m.5. The 0^m.3 residual reveals cyclotron
emission and ellipsoidal variations. Mean brightness modulation from night-to-night is used
to measure the 9.6-d spin-orbit beat period that is due to changing accretion geometry including
magnetic pole-switching of the flow. By subtracting the orbital and beat frequencies, spin-phase
dependent light curves are obtained. The amplitude and profile of the WD spin light curves track
the cyclotron emitting accretion regions on the WD and they vary systematically with beat phase.
A weak intermittent signal at 0.137613-d is likely the spin period, which is 1.73(1) min shorter
than the orbital period. The O-C diagram of light curve maxima displays phase jumps every one-half
beat period, a characteristic of asynchronous polars. The first jump we interpret as pole switching
between regions separated by 180 deg. Then the spot drifts during ~0.1 beat phase before undergoing
a second phase jump between spots separated by less than 180 deg. We trace the cooling of the still
hot WD as revealed by the irradiated companion. The post nova evolution and spin-orbit asynchronism
of V1500 Cyg continues to be a powerful laboratory for accretion flows onto magnetic white dwarfs.
