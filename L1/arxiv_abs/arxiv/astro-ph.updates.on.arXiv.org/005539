Using the Very Large Array, we have investigated a non-thermal radio filament (NTF) recently found
very near the Galactic black hole and its radio counterpart, SgrA*. While this NTF -- the Sgr A West
Filament (SgrAWF) -- shares many characteristics with the population of NTFs occupying the central
few hundred parsecs of the Galaxy, the SgrAWF has the distinction of having an orientation and sky
location that suggest an intimate physical connection to SgrA*. We present 3.3 and 5.5 cm images
constructed using an innovative methodology that yields a very high dynamic range, providing an
unprecedentedly clear picture of the SgrAWF. While the physical association of the SgrAWF with
SgrA* is not unambiguous, the images decidedly evoke this interesting possibility. Assuming that
the SgrAWF bears a physical relationship to SgrA*, we examine the potential implications. One is
that SgrA* is a source of relativistic particles constrained to diffuse along ordered local field
lines. The relativistic particles could also be fed into the local field by a collimated outflow
from SgrA*, perhaps driven by the Poynting flux accompanying the black hole spin in the presence
of a magnetic field threading the event horizon. Second, we consider the possibility that the SgrAWF
is the manifestation of a low-mass-density cosmic string that has become anchored to the black hole.
The simplest form of these hypotheses would predict that the filament be bi-directional, whereas
the SgrAWF is only seen on one side of SgrA*, perhaps because of the dynamics of the local medium.
