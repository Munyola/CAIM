The most important aspects of a dynamical system are its stability and the factors which affects
the stability property. This paper presents the analysis of the effects of albedo and disc on the
zero velocity curves, existence of equilibrium points and on their linear stability in a generalized
restricted three body problem that consists of motion of an infinitesimal mass under the uniform
gravity field of radiating-oblate primary, oblate secondary and a disc, which is rotating about
the common center of the mass of the system. A significant effect of albedo and disc are observed on
the zero velocity curves, positions of equilibrium points and on the stability region. Linear stability
analysis of collinear equilibrium points is performed with respect to mass ratio $\mu$ and albedo
parameter of secondary, separately and it is found that these are unstable in both the cases. On the
other hand, non-collinear equilibrium point is stable in a certain range of mass ratio. After analyzing
individual as well as combined effect of radiation pressure force of the primary, albedo of secondary,
oblateness of both the massive bodies and the disc, it is found that these perturbations play a significant
on the motion of infinitesimal mass in the vicinity of equilibrium points. These results may be help
to analyze more generalized problem of few bodies under the influence of different kind of perturbations
such as P-R drag, solar wind drag etc. Present study is limited to the regular symmetric disc which
will extend later.
