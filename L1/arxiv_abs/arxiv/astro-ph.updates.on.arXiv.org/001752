We have determined astrometric positions for 15 WISE-discovered late-type brown dwarfs (6 T8-9
and 9 Y dwarfs) using the Keck II telescope, the Spitzer Space Telescope, and the Hubble Space Telescope.
Combining data from 8 to 20 epochs we derive parallactic and proper motions for these objects which
put the majority within 15 parsecs. For ages greater than a few Gyr, as suggested from kinematic considerations,
we find masses of 10-30 M$_{Jup}$ based on standard models for the evolution of low mass objects with
a range of mass estimates for individual objects depending on the model in question. Three of the
coolest objects have effective temperatures $\sim$ 350 K and inferred masses of 10-15 M$_{Jup}$.
Our parallactic distances confirm earlier photometric estimates (Kirkpatrick et al. 2012) and
direct measurements (Marsh et al. 2013, Beichman et al. 2013, Dupuy and Krauss 2013) and suggest
that the number of objects with masses below about 15 M$_{Jup}$ must be flat or declining relative
to higher mass objects. The masses of the coldest Y dwarfs may be similar to those inferred for recently
imaged planet-mass companions to nearby young stars. Objects in this mass range, which appear to
be rare in both the interstellar and proto-planetary environments, may both have formed via gravitational
fragmentation: the brown dwarfs in interstellar clouds and companion objects in a protoplanetary
disk. In both cases, however, the fact that objects in this mass range are relatively infrequent,
suggests that this mechanism must be inefficient in both environments.
