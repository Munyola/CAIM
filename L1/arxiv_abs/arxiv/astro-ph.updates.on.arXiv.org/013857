Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and eruptive flares (EFs) are the most energetic explosions in the
solar system. Their underlying origin is the free energy that builds up slowly in the sheared magnetic
field of a filament channel. We report the first end-to-end numerical simulation of a CME/EF, from
zero-free-energy initial state through filament-channel formation to violent eruption, driven
solely by the magnetic-helicity condensation process. Helicity is the topological measure of
linkages between magnetic flux systems, and is conserved in the corona, building up inexorably
until it is ejected into interplanetary space. Numerous investigations have demonstrated that
helicity injected by small-scale vortical motions, such as those observed in the photosphere,
undergoes an inverse cascade from small scales to large, `condensing' at magnetic-polarity boundaries.
Our new results verify that this process forms a filament channel within a compact bipolar region
embedded in a background dipole field, and show for the first time that a fast CME eventually occurs
via the magnetic-breakout mechanism. We further show that the trigger for explosive eruption is
reconnection onset in the flare current sheet that develops above the polarity inversion line:
this reconnection forms flare loops below the sheet and a CME flux rope above, and initiates high-speed
outward flow of the CME. Our findings have important implications for magnetic self-organization
and explosive behavior in solar and other astrophysical plasmas, and for understanding and predicting
explosive solar activity.
