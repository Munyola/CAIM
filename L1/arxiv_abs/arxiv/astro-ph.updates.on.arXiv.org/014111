Spin can have significant effects on the electromagnetic transients accompanying binary neutron
star mergers. The measurement of spin can provide important information about binary formation
channels. In the absence of a strong neutron star spin prior, the degeneracy of spin with other parameters
leads to significant uncertainties in their estimation, in particular limiting the power of gravitational
waves to place tight constraints on the nuclear equation of state. Thus detailed studies of highly
spinning neutron star mergers are essential to understand all aspects of multimessenger observation
of such events. We perform a systematic investigation of the impact of neutron star spin---considering
dimensionless spin values up to $a_{\rm NS}=0.33$---on the merger of equal mass, quasicircular
binary neutron stars using fully general-relativistic simulations. We find that the peak frequency
of the post-merger gravitational wave signal is only weakly influenced by the neutron star spin,
with cases where the spin is aligned (anti-aligned) with the orbital angular momentum giving slightly
lower (higher) values compared to the irrotational case. We find that the one-arm instability arises
in a number of cases, with some dependence on spin. Spin has a pronounced impact on the mass, velocity,
and angular distribution of the dynamical ejecta, and the mass of the disk that remains outside the
merger remnant. We discuss the implications of these findings on anticipated electromagnetic
signals, and on constraints that have been placed on the equation of state based on multimessenger
observations of GW170817.
