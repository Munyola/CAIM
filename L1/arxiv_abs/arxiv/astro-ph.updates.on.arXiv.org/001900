The first generation of stars produces a background of Lyman-Werner (LW) radiation which can photo-dissociate
molecular hydrogen, increasing the mass of dark matter halos required to host star formation. Previous
studies have determined the critical mass required for efficient molecular cooling with a constant
LW background. However, the true background is expected to increase rapidly at early times. Neglecting
this evolution could underestimate star formation in small halos that may have started to cool in
the past when the LW intensity was much lower. Background evolution is a large source of uncertainty
in pre-reionization predictions of the cosmological 21cm signal, which can be observed with future
radio telescopes. To address this, we perform zero-dimentional one-zone calculations that follow
the density, chemical abundances, and temperature of gas in the central regions of dark matter halos,
including hierarchical growth and an evolving LW background. We begin by studying the physics of
halos subjected to a background that increases exponentially with redshift. We find that when the
intensity increases more slowly than $J_{\rm LW}(z) \propto 10^{-z/5}$, cooling in the past is
a relatively small effect. We then self-consistently compute the cosmological LW background over
$z=15-50$ and find that cooling in the past due to an evolving background has a modest impact. Finally,
we compare these results to three-dimensional hydrodynamical cosmological simulations with
varying LW histories. While only a small number of halos were simulated, the results are consistent
with our one-zone calculations.
