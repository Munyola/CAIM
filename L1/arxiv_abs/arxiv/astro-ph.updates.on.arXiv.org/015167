Heating of virialized gas by streaming cosmic rays (CRs) may be energetically important in galaxy
halos, groups and clusters. We present a linear thermal stability analysis of plasmas heated by
streaming CRs. We separately treat equilibria with and without background gradients, and with
and without gravity. We include both CR streaming and diffusion along the magnetic-field direction.
Thermal stability depends strongly on the ratio of CR pressure to gas pressure, which determines
whether modes are isobaric or isochoric. Modes with $\mathbf{k \cdot B }\neq 0$ are strongly affected
by CR diffusion. When the streaming time is shorter than the CR diffusion time, thermally unstable
modes (with $\mathbf{k \cdot B }\neq 0$) are waves propagating at a speed $\propto$ the Alfv\'en
speed. Halo gas in photoionization equilibrium is thermally stable independent of CR pressure,
while gas in collisional ionization equilibrium is unstable for physically realistic parameters.
In gravitationally stratified plasmas, the oscillation frequency of thermally overstable modes
can be higher in the presence of CR streaming than the buoyancy/free-fall frequency. This may modify
the critical $t_{\rm cool}/t_{\rm ff}$ at which multiphase gas is present. The criterion for convective
instability of a stratified, CR-heated medium can be written in the familiar Schwarzschild form
$d s_{\rm eff} / d z < 0$, where $s_{\rm eff}$ is an effective entropy involving the gas and CR pressures.
We discuss the implications of our results for the thermal evolution and multiphase structure of
galaxy halos, groups and clusters.
