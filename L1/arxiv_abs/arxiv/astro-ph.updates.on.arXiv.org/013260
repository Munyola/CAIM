In keeping with the Luxembourg government's initiative to support the future use of space resources,
ASIME 2018 was held in Belval, Luxembourg on April 16-17, 2018. The goal of ASIME 2018: Asteroid Intersections
with Mine Engineering, was to focus on asteroid composition for advancing the asteroid in-space
resource utilisation domain. What do we know about asteroid composition from remote-sensing observations?
What are the potential caveats in the interpretation of Earth-based spectral observations? What
are the next steps to improve our knowledge on asteroid composition by means of ground-based and
space-based observations and asteroid rendez-vous and sample return missions? How can asteroid
mining companies use this knowledge? ASIME 2018 was a two-day workshop of almost 70 scientists and
engineers in the context of the engineering needs of space missions with in-space asteroid utilisation.
The 21 Questions from the asteroid mining companies were sorted into the four asteroid science themes:
1) Potential Targets, 2) Asteroid-Meteorite Links, 3) In-Situ Measurements and 4) Laboratory
Measurements. The Answers to those Questions were provided by the scientists with their conference
presentations and collected by A. Graps or edited directly into an open-access collaborative Google
document or inserted by A. Graps using additional reference materials. During the ASIME 2018, first
day and second day Wrap-Ups, the answers to the questions were discussed further. New readers to
the asteroid mining topic may find the Conversation boxes and the Mission Design discussions especially
interesting.
