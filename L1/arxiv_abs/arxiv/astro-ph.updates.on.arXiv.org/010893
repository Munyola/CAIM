PKS 0438$-$436 at a redshift of $z=2.856$ has been previously recognized as possessing perhaps
the most luminous known synchrotron jet. Little is known about this source since the maximum elevation
above the horizon is low for the Very Large Array (VLA). We present the first VLA radio image that detects
the radio lobes. We use both the 151 MHz luminosity, as a surrogate for the isotropic radio lobe luminosity,
and the lobe flux density from the radio image to estimate a long term, time averaged, jet power, $\overline{Q}
=1.5\pm 0.7 \times 10^{47} \rm{ergs~s^{-1}}$. We analyze two deep optical spectra with strong
broad emission lines and estimate the thermal bolometric luminosity of the accretion flow, $L_{\rm{bol}}
= 6.7 \pm 3.0 \times 10^{46} \rm{ergs~s^{-1}}$. The ratio, $\overline{Q}/L_{\rm{bol}} = 3.3 \pm
2.6 $, is at the limit of this empirical metric of jet dominance seen in radio loud quasars and this
is the most luminous accretion flow to have this limiting behavior. Despite being a very luminous
blazar, it previously had no $\gamma$-ray detections (EGRET, AGILE or FERMI) until December 11
- 13 2016 (54 hours) when FERMI detected a flare that we analyze here. The isotropic apparent luminosity
from 100 MeV - 100 GeV rivals the most luminous detected blazar flares (averaged over 18 hours), $\sim
5-6 \times 10^{49} \rm{ergs~s^{-1}}$. The $\gamma$-ray luminosity varies over time by two orders
of magnitude, highlighting the extreme role of Doppler abberation and geometric alignment in producing
the inverse Compton emission.
