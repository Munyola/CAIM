We perform a study of stellar flares for the 24,809 stars observed with 2 minute cadence during the
first two months of the TESS mission. Flares may erode exoplanets' atmospheres and impact their
habitability, but might also trigger the genesis of life around small stars. TESS provides a new
sample of bright dwarf stars in our galactic neighborhood, collecting data for thousands of M-dwarfs
that might host habitable exoplanets. Here, we use an automated search for flares accompanied by
visual inspection. Then, our public allesfitter code robustly selects the appropriate model for
potentially complex flares via Bayesian evidence. We identify 763 flaring stars, 632 of which are
M-dwarfs. Among 3247 flares in total, the largest superflare increased the stellar brightness
by a factor of 15.7. Bolometric flare energies range from 10^31 to 10^38.7 erg, with a median of 10^32.8
erg. Furthermore, we study the flare rate and energy as a function of stellar type and rotation period.
We solidify past findings that fast rotating M-dwarfs are the most likely to flare, and that their
flare amplitude is independent of the rotation period. Finally, we link our results to criteria
for prebiotic chemistry, atmospheric loss through coronal mass ejections, and ozone sterilization.
Four of our flaring M-dwarfs host exoplanet candidates alerted on by TESS, for which we discuss how
these effects can impact life. With upcoming TESS data releases, our flare analysis can be expanded
to almost all bright small stars, aiding in defining criteria for exoplanet habitability.
