We present here our shape analysis method for a sample of 76 Galactic HII regions from MAGPIS 1.4 GHz
data. The main goal is to determine whether physical properties and initial conditions of massive
star cluster formation is linked to the shape of the regions. We outline a systematic procedure for
extracting region shapes and perform hierarchical clustering on the shape data. We identified
six groups that categorise HII regions by common morphologies. We confirmed the validity of these
groupings by bootstrap re-sampling and the ordinance technique multidimensional scaling. We
then investigated associations between physical parameters and the assigned groups. Location
is mostly independent of group, with a small preference for regions of similar longitudes to share
common morphologies. The shapes are homogeneously distributed across Galactocentric distance
and latitude. One group contains regions that are all younger than 0.5 Myr and ionised by low- to intermediate-mass
sources. Those in another group are all driven by intermediate- to high-mass sources. One group
was distinctly separated from the other five and contained regions at the surface brightness detection
limit for the survey. We find that our hierarchical procedure is most sensitive to the spatial sampling
resolution used, which is determined for each region from its distance. We discuss how these errors
can be further quantified and reduced in future work by utilising synthetic observations from numerical
simulations of HII regions. We also outline how this shape analysis has further applications to
other diffuse astronomical objects.
