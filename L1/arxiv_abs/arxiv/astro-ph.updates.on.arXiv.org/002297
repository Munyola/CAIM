I present a comparison between published dynamical (ATLAS3D) and spectroscopic (Conroy &
van Dokkum) constraints on the stellar initial mass function (IMF) in early-type galaxies, using
the 34 galaxies in common between the two works. Both studies infer an average IMF mass factor $\alpha$
(the stellar mass relative to a Kroupa-IMF population of similar age and metallicity) greater than
unity, i.e. both methods favour an IMF which is heavier than that of the Milky Way, on average over
the sample. However, on a galaxy-by-galaxy basis, there is no correlation between $\alpha$ inferred
from the two approaches. I investigate how the two estimates of $\alpha$ are correlated systematically
with the galaxy velocity dispersion, $\sigma$, and with the Mg/Fe abundance ratio. The spectroscopic
method, based on the strengths of metal absorption lines, yields a correlation only with metal abundance
ratios: at fixed Mg/Fe, there is no residual correlation with $\sigma$. The dynamical method, applied
to exactly the same galaxy sample, yields the opposite result: the IMF variation correlates only
with dynamics, with no residual correlation with Mg/Fe after controlling for $\sigma$. Hence although
both methods indicate a heavy IMF on average in ellipticals, they lead to incompatible results for
the systematic trends, when applied to the same set of galaxies. Although other explanations are
possible, the sense of the disagreement suggests that one (or both) of the methods has not accounted
fully for the main confounding factors, i.e. element abundance ratios or dark matter contributions.
