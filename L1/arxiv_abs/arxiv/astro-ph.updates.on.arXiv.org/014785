Primordial black hole (PBH) formation is a more generic phenomenon than was once thought. The dynamics
of a scalar field in inflationary universe can produce PBHs under mild assumptions regarding the
scalar potential. In the early universe, light scalar fields develop large expectation values
during inflation and subsequently relax to the minimum of the effective potential at a later time.
During the relaxation process, an initially homogeneous scalar condensate can fragment into lumps
via an instability similar to the gravitational (Jeans) instability, where the scalar self-interactions,
rather than gravity, play the leading role. The fragmentation of the scalar field into lumps (e.g.
Q-balls or oscillons) creates matter composed of relatively few heavy "particles", whose distribution
is subject to significant fluctuations unconstrained by comic microwave background (CMB) observations
and unrelated to the large-scale structure. If this matter component comes to temporarily dominate
the energy density before the scalar lumps decay, PBHs can be efficiently produced during the temporary
matter-dominated era. We develop a general analytic framework for description of PBH formation
in this class of models. We highlight the differences between the scalar fragmentation scenario
and other commonly considered PBH formation models. Given the existence of the Higgs field and the
preponderance of scalar fields within supersymmetric and other models of new physics, PBHs constitute
an appealing and plausible candidate for dark matter.
