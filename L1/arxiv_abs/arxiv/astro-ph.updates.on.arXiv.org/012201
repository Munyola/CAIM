In this work we study the structure of neutron stars under the effect of a poloidal magnetic field
and determine the limiting highest magnetic field intensity which still allows a satisfactory
description of magnetic neutron stars in the spherical symmetry regime. We describe different
compositions of stars (nucleonic, hyperonic, and hybrid), using three state-of-the-art relativistic
mean field models for the microscopic description of matter, which are in agreement with experimental
and observational data. The structure of stars is described by the general relativistic solution
of both Einstein's field equations assuming a spherical symmetry, and Einstein-Maxwell's field
equations assuming an axi-symmetric deformation. We find a limiting magnetic moment of the order
of $2\times 10^{31}$Am$^2$, which corresponds to magnetic fields of the order of 10$^{16}$ G at
the surface, and $ \sim 10^{17}$ G at the centre of the star, above which the deformation due to the
magnetic field is not negligible. We show that the intensity of the magnetic field developed in the
star depends on the EoS, and, for a given baryonic mass and fixed magnetic moment, larger fields are
attained with softer EoS. We also show that the appearance of exotic degrees of freedom, such as hyperons
or a quark core, is disfavored in the presence of a very strong magnetic field. As a consequence, a
highly magnetized nucleonic star may suffer an internal conversion due to the decay of the magnetic
field, which could be accompanied by a sudden cooling of the star or a gamma ray burst.
