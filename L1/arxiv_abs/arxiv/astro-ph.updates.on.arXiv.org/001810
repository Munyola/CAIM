We present refined color-color selection criteria for identifying Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars using
available mid infrared (MIR) photometry from WISE in combination with near infrared (NIR) photometry
from 2MASS. Using a sample of spectrally classified objects, we find that WR stars are well distinguished
from the field stellar population in the (W1-W2) vs. (J-Ks) color-color diagram, and further distinguished
from other emission line objects such as Planetary Nebulae, Be, and Cataclysmic variable stars
using a combination of NIR and MIR color constraints. As proof of concept we applied the color constraints
to a photometric sample in the Galactic plane, located WR star candidates, and present five new spectrally
confirmed and classified WC (1) and WN (4) stars. Analysis of the 0.8-5.0 micron spectral data for
a subset of known, bright WC and WN stars shows that emission lines (primarily He I) extend into the
3.0 - 5.0 micron spectral region, although their strength is greatly diminished compared to the
0.8-2.5 micron region. The WR population stands out relative to background field stars at NIR and
MIR colors due to an excess continuum contribution, likely caused by free-free scattering in dense
winds. Mean photometric properties of known WRs are presented and imply that reddened late-type
WN and WC sources are easier to detect than earlier-type sources at larger Galactic radii. WISE W3
and W4 images of 10 Wolf Rayet stars show evidence of circumstellar shells linked to mass ejections
from strong stellar winds.
