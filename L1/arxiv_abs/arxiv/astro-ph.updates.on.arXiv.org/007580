With the advent of more and deeper sky surveys, the discovery of interstellar small objects entering
into the Solar System has been finally possible. In October 19, 2017, using observations of the Pan-STARRS
survey, a fast moving object, now officially named 1I/2017 U1 ('Oumuamua), was discovered in a heliocentric
unbound trajectory suggesting an interstellar origin. Assessing the provenance of interstellar
small objects is key for understanding their distribution, spatial density and the processes responsible
for their ejection from planetary systems. However, their peculiar trajectories place a limit
on the number of observations available to determine a precise orbit. As a result, when its position
is propagated $\sim 10^5-10^6$ years backward in time, small errors in orbital elements become
large uncertainties in position in the interstellar space. In this paper we present a general method
for assigning probabilities to nearby stars of being the parent system of an observed interstellar
object. We describe the method in detail and apply it for assessing the origin of 'Oumuamua. A preliminary
list of potential progenitors and their corresponding probabilities is provided. In the future,
when further information about the object and/or the nearby stars be refined, the probabilities
computed with our method can be updated. We provide all the data and codes we developed for this purpose
in the form of an open source {\tt C/C++/Python package}, {\bf\tt iWander} which is publicly available
