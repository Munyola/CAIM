Locating the sources of ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) still remains a difficult puzzle
for modern astrophysics. A major hurdle in the search for the sources is the fact that UHECRs are deflected
by the Galactic magnetic field (GMF). Current knowledge of the GMF is limited, as most experimental
measurements track line-of-sight--integrated quantities that are used to obtain best-fit parameters
for global models including a large random component. The advent, however, of the Gaia era, with
measurements of $\sim 10^9$ stellar parallaxes, in combination with upcoming large polarimetric
surveys, such as PASIPHAE, will allow, for the first time, a 3D measurement of the GMF, which can then
be used for a meaningful correction of the UHECR trajectories through the Galaxy. In the present
work, we examine how the effectiveness of such a correction depends on the uncertainty of magnetic
field measurements. To that end, we simulate attempts to reconstruct the trajectory of the cosmic
ray by using hypothetical measurements of the GMF, based on values received from two recently updated
GMF models. To simulate the uncertainty of a 3D measurement, random errors to these values are introduced
separately for the plane-of-the-sky (POS) magnitude, the line-of-sight (LOS) magnitude and the
POS direction. Our results show that an effective correction is in many cases achievable without
need for extreme measurement precision. The effectiveness of the correction is heavily dependent
on the particle rigidity and arrival direction and can vary significantly depending on the GMF model
used.
