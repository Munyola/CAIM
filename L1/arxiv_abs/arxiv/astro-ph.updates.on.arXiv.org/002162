This paper studies the distribution of characteristic multipliers, the stability of orbits, periodic
orbits, the structure of submanifolds, the phase diagram, bifurcations and chaotic motions in
the potential field of rotating highly irregular-shaped celestial bodies. The topological structure
of submanifolds for the orbits in the potential field of a rotating highly irregular-shaped celestial
body(hereafter irregular body for short) is discovered that it can be classified into 34 different
cases, including 6 ordinary cases, 3 collisional cases, 3 degenerate real saddle cases, 7 periodic
cases, 7 period-doubling cases, 1 periodic and collisional case, 1 periodic and degenerate real
saddle case, 1 period-doubling and collisional case, 1 period-doubling and degenerate real saddle
case as well as 4 periodic and period-doubling cases. It is found that the different distribution
of characteristic multipliers fixes the structure of submanifolds, the types of orbits, the dynamical
behavior and the phase diagram of the motion. Classifications and properties for each case are presented.
Morever, tangent bifurcations, period-doubling bifurcations, Neimark-Sacker bifurcations
as well as real saddle bifurcations of periodic orbits in the potential field of an irregular body
are new discovered. Submanifolds appear to be Mobius strips and Klein bottle when the period-doubling
bifurcation occurs. The theory developed here is applied for the asteroids 216 Kleopatra, 6489
Golevka and the comet 1P/Halley to find the dynamical behaviour around these irregular-shaped
bodies.
