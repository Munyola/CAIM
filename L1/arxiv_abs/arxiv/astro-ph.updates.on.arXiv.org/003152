In a previous paper we compared the SEDs of a sample of 808 K+A galaxies from the FUV to the MIR to the
predictions of the spectrum synthesis models explicitly using AGB components. Here we use the new
AGB-light models from C. Maraston (including less fuel for the later stages of stellar evolution
and improved calibrations) to address the discrepancies between our observations and the AGB-heavy
models used in our previous paper, which over-predict the infrared fluxes of post-starburst galaxies
by an order of magnitude. The new models yield a much better fit to the data, especially in the near-IR,
compared to previous realizations where AGB stars caused a large excess in the H and K bands. We { also
compare the predictions of the M2013 models to those with BC03 and find that both reproduce the observations
equally well. } We still find a significant discrepancy with { both sets of models} in the Y and J bands,
which however is probably due to the spectral features of AGB stars. We also find that { both the M2013
and the BC03 models} still over-predict the observed fluxes in the UV bands, even invoking extinction
laws that are stronger in these bands. While there may be some simple explanations for this discrepancy,
we find that further progress requires new observations and better modelling. Excess mid-infrared
emission longward of 5$\mu$m is well modelled by a $T_{dust}=300^oK$ Black-Body, which may arise
from dust emission from the circumstellar envelopes of Oxygen rich M stars (expected for a metal-rich
population of AGB stars).
