GRB afterglow jets have been notoriously difficult to resolve numerically using 2D hydrodynamical
simulations due to high outflow Lorentz factors. By performing simulations in a boosted frame,
it is possible to calculate light curves from numerically computed flows in sufficient detail to
accurately quantify the shape of the jet break and the post-break steepening of the light curve.
We study jet breaks for jets with opening angles of theta_0 = 0.05, 0.1 and 0.2 radians decelerating
in a constant density medium, observed at angles (theta_obs) ranging from on-axis to the jet edge.
We present a single set of scale-invariant functions describing the time evolution of synchrotron
spectral break frequencies and peak flux, depending only on theta_0 and theta_obs, sufficient
to reconstruct light curves for arbitrary explosion energy, circumburst density and synchrotron
slope p. We compare our light curves to fit functions using sharp breaks and smooth transitions and
confirm that the measured jet break time can be delayed due to theta_obs. We find that the difference
in temporal indices across the jet break is larger than theoretically anticipated leading to post-break
slopes of roughly 0.25 - 1.3 p, sufficiently steep to not easily reconcile with post-break slopes
measured for the Swift sample, suggesting that most Swift GRBs do not explode in homogeneous media
or that jet breaks are hidden by additional physics such as prolonged energy injection or viewing
angle effects. Light curves and spectral break and peak flux evolution functions will be made publicly
