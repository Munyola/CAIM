The Time Inference with MUSE in Extragalactic Rings (TIMER) project is a survey with the VLT-MUSE
integral-field spectrograph of 24 nearby barred galaxies with prominent central structures (e.g.,
nuclear rings or inner discs). The main goals of the project are: (i) estimating the cosmic epoch
when discs of galaxies settle, leading to the formation of bars; (ii) testing the hypothesis whereby
discs in more massive galaxies are assembled first; and (iii) characterising the history of external
gas accretion in disc galaxies. We present details on the sample selection, observations, data
reduction, and derivation of high-level data products, including stellar kinematics, ages and
metallicities. We also derive star formation histories and physical properties and kinematics
of ionised gas. We illustrate how this dataset can be used for a plethora of scientific applications,
e.g., stellar feedback, outflows, nuclear and primary bars, stellar migration and chemical enrichment,
and the gaseous and stellar dynamics of nuclear spiral arms, barlenses, box/peanuts and bulges.
Amongst our first results - based on a few selected galaxies -, we show that the dynamics of nuclear
rings and inner discs is consistent with the picture in which they are formed by bars, that the central
few hundred parsecs in massive disc galaxies tend to show a pronounced peak in stellar metallicity,
and that nuclear rings can efficiently prevent star formation in this region. Finally, we present
evidence that star-bursting nuclear rings can be fed with low-metallicity gas from low-mass companions.
