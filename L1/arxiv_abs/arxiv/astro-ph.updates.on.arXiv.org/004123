We study the mean absorption spectrum of the Damped Lyman alpha population at $z\sim 2.6$ by stacking
normalized, rest-frame shifted spectra of $\sim 27\,000$ DLAs from the DR12 of BOSS/SDSS-III.
We measure the equivalent widths of 50 individual metal absorption lines in 5 intervals of DLA hydrogen
column density, 5 intervals of DLA redshift, and overall mean equivalent widths for an additional
13 absorption features from groups of strongly blended lines. The mean equivalent width of low-ionization
lines increases with $N_{\rm HI}$, whereas for high-ionization lines the increase is much weaker.
The mean metal line equivalent widths decrease by a factor $\sim 1.1-1.5$ from $z\sim2.1$ to $z \sim
3.5$, with small or no differences between low- and high-ionization species. We develop a theoretical
model, inspired by the presence of multiple absorption components observed in high-resolution
spectra, to infer mean metal column densities from the equivalent widths of partially saturated
metal lines. We apply this model to 14 low-ionization species and to AlIII, SIII, SiIII, CIV, SiIV,
NV and OVI. We use an approximate derivation for separating the equivalent width contributions
of several lines to blended absorption features, and infer mean equivalent widths and column densities
from lines of the additional species NI, ZnII, CII${}^{*}$, FeIII, and SIV. Several of these mean
column densities of metal lines in DLAs are obtained for the first time; their values generally agree
with measurements of individual DLAs from high-resolution, high signal-to-noise ratio spectra
when they are available.
