We present a study of the membership of the Hyades open cluster, derive kinematically-modelled
parallaxes of its members, and study the colour-absolute magnitude diagram of the cluster. We use
Gaia DR1 Tycho-Gaia Astrometric Solution (TGAS) data complemented by Hipparcos-2 data for bright
stars not contained in TGAS. We supplement the astrometric data with radial velocities collected
from a dozen literature sources. By assuming that all cluster members move with the mean cluster
velocity to within the velocity dispersion, we use the observed and the expected motions of the stars
to determine individual cluster membership probabilities. We subsequently derive improved parallaxes
through maximum-likelihood kinematic modelling of the cluster. This method has an iterative component
to deal with 'outliers', caused for instance by double stars or escaping members. Our method extends
an existing method and supports the mixed presence of stars with and without radial velocities.
We find 251 candidate members, 200 of which have a literature radial velocity, and 70 of which are
new candidate members with TGAS astrometry. The cluster is roughly spherical in its centre but significantly
flattened at larger radii. The observed colour-absolute magnitude diagram shows a clear binary
sequence. The kinematically-modelled parallaxes that we derive are a factor ~1.7 / 2.9 more precise
than the TGAS / Hipparcos-2 values and allow to derive an extremely sharp main sequence. This sequence
shows evidence for fine-detailed structure which is elegantly explained by the full spectrum turbulence
model of convection.
