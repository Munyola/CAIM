Neutron stars in X-ray binary systems are fascinating objects that display a wide range of timing
and spectral phenomena in the X-rays. Not only parameters of the neutron stars, like magnetic field
strength and spin period evolve in their active binary phase, the neutron stars also affect the binary
systems and their immediate surroundings in many ways. Here we discuss some aspects of the interactions
of the neutron stars with their environments that are revelaed from their X-ray emission. We discuss
some recent developments involving the process of accretion onto high magnetic field neutron stars:
accretion stream structure and formation, shape of pulse profile and its changes with accretion
torque. Various recent studies of reprocessing of X-rays in the accretion disk surface, vertical
structures of the accretion disk and wind of companion star are also discussed here. The X-ray pulsars
among the binary neutron stars provide excellent handle to make accurate measurement of the orbital
parameters and thus also evolution of the binray orbits that take place over time scale of a fraction
of a million years to tens of millions of years. The orbital period evolution of X-ray binaries have
shown them to be rather complex systems. Orbital evolution of X-ray binaries can also be carried
out from timing of the X-ray eclipses and there have been some surprising results in that direction,
including orbital period glitches in two X-ray binaries and possible detection of the most massive
circum-binary planet around a Low Mass X-ray Binary.
