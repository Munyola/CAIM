Observed planetary debris in white dwarf atmospheres predominately originate from the destruction
of small bodies on highly eccentric ($>0.99$) orbits. Despite their importance, these minor planets
have coupled physical and orbital evolution which has remained largely unexplored. Here, we present
a novel approach for estimating the influence of fast chaotic rotation on the orbital evolution
of high-eccentricity triaxial asteroids, and formally characterize the propagation of their
angular rotation velocities and orbital elements as random time processes. By employing the impulse
approximation, we demonstrate that the violent gravitational interactions during periastron
passages transfer energy between the orbit and asteroid's rotation. If the distribution of spin
impulses were symmetric around zero, then the net result would be a secular decrease of the semimajor
axis and a further increase of the eccentricity. We find evidence, however, that the chaotic rotation
may be self-regulated in such a manner that these effects are reduced or nullified. We discover that
asteroids on highly eccentric orbits can break themselves apart --- in a type of YORP-less rotational
fission --- without actually entering the Roche radius, with potentially significant consequences
for the distribution of debris and energy requirements for gravitational scattering in metal-polluted
white dwarf planetary systems. This mechanism provides a steady stream of material impacting a
white dwarf without rapidly depleting the number of small bodies in the stellar system.
