I discuss feeding and feedback processes observed in the inner few hundred parsecs of nearby active
galaxies using integral field spectroscopy at spatial resolutions of a few to tens of parsecs. Signatures
of feedback include outflows from the nucleus with velocities ranging from 200 to 1000km/s, with
mass outflow rates between 0.5 and a few Msun/yr. Signatures of feeding include the observation
of gas inflows along nuclear spirals and filaments, with velocities ranging from 50 to 100km/s and
mass flow rates from 0.1 to 1 Msun/yr. These rates are 2--3 orders of magnitude larger than the mass
accretion rate to the supermassive black hole (SMBH). These inflows can thus lead, during less than
one activity cycle, to the accumulation of enough gas in the inner few hundred parsecs, to trigger
the formation of new stars, leading to the growth of the galaxy bulge. Young to intermediate age stars
have indeed been found in circumnuclear rings around a number of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). One
of these rings, with ~100pc radius is observed in the Seyfert 2 galaxy NGC1068, and is associated
to an off-centered molecular ring, very similar to that observed in the Milky Way (MW). On the basis
of an evolutionary scenario, we speculate that, in the MW, molecular gas has already accumulated
within the inner ~100 pc and is already triggering the formation of new stars. A possible increase
in the star-formation rate in the region will then be followed, tens of millions of years in the future,
by the triggering of nuclear activity in Sgr A*.
