We examine the statistics of the low-redshift Ly-alpha forest in an adaptive mesh refinement hydrodynamic
cosmological simulation of sufficient volume to include distinct large-scale environments.
We compare our HI column density distribution of absorbers both with recent work and between two
highly-refined regions of our simulation: a large-scale overdensity and a large-scale underdensity
(on scales of approximately 20 Mpc). We recover the average results presented in Kollmeier et al.
(2014) using different simulation methods. We further break down these results as a function of
environment to examine the detailed dependence of absorber statistics on large-scale density.
We find that the slope of the HI column density distribution in the 10$^{12.5}$ $\le$ N$_{HI}$/cm$^{-2}$
$\le$ 10$^{14.5}$ range depends on environment such that the slope becomes steeper for higher environmental
density, and this difference reflects distinct physical conditions of the intergalactic medium
on these scales. We track this difference to the different temperature structures of filaments
in varying environments. Specifically, filaments in the overdensity are hotter and, correspondingly,
are composed of gas with lower HI fractions than those in underdense environments. Our results highlight
that in order to understand the physics driving the HI CDD, we need not only improved accounting of
the sources of ionizing UV photons, but also of the physical conditions of the IGM and how this may
vary as a function of large-scale environment.
