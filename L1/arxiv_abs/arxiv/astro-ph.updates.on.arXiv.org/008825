The relationship between luminosity and mass is of fundamental importance for direct imaging studies
of brown dwarf and planetary companions to stars. In principle this can be inferred from theoretical
mass-luminosity models; however, these relations have not yet been thoroughly calibrated, since
there is a lack of substellar companions for which both the brightness and mass have been directly
measured. One notable exception is GJ 758 B, a brown dwarf companion in a $\sim$20 AU orbit around
a nearby Sun-like star, which has been both directly imaged and dynamically detected through a radial
velocity trend in the primary. This has enabled a mass constraint for GJ 758 B of 42$^{+19}_{-7}$
$M_{\rm Jup}$. Here, we note that Gaia is ideally suited for further constraining the mass of intermediate-separation
companions such as GJ 758 B. A study of the differential proper motion, $\Delta \mu$, with regards
to HIPPARCOS is particularly useful in this context, as it provides a long time baseline for orbital
curvature to occur. By exploiting already determined orbital parameters, we show that the dynamical
mass can be further constrained to $42.4^{+5.6}_{-5.0}\, M_{\rm Jup}$ through the Gaia-HIPPARCOS
$\Delta \mu$ motion. We compare the new dynamical mass estimate with substellar evolutionary models
and confirm previous indications that there is significant tension between the isochronal ages
of the star and companion, with a preferred stellar age of $\leq 5$ Gyr while the companion is only
consistent with very old ages of $\geq 8$ Gyr.
