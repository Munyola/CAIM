We have measured the scintillation properties of 151 young, energetic pulsars with the Parkes radio
telescope and have identified two extreme scattering events (ESEs). Towards PSR J1057-5226 we
discovered a three-year span of strengthened scattering during which the variability in flux density
and the scintillation bandwidth decreased markedly. The transverse size of the scattering region
is ~23 au, and strong flux density enhancement before and after the ESE may arise from refractive
focusing. Long observations reveal scintillation arcs characteristic of interference between
rays scattered at large angles, and the clearest arcs appear during the ESE. The arcs suggest scattering
by a screen 100-200 pc from the earth, perhaps ionized filamentary structure associated with the
boundary of the local bubble(s). Towards PSR J1740-3015 we observed a "double dip" in the measured
flux density similar to ESEs observed towards compact extragalactic radio sources. The observed
shape is consistent with that produced by a many-au scale diverging plasma lens with electron density
~500cm$^{-3}$ . The continuing ESE is at least 1500 d long, making it the longest detected event to
date. These detections, with materially different observational signatures, indicate that well-calibrated
pulsar monitoring is a keen tool for ESE detection and ISM diagnostics. They illustrate the strong
r\^ole au-scale non-Kolmogorov density fluctuations and the local ISM structure play in such events
and are key to understanding both their intrinsic physics and their impact on other phenomena, particularly
fast radio bursts.
