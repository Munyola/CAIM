We study dust attenuation curves of 230,000 individual galaxies in the local universe, ranging
from quiescent to intensely star-forming systems, using GALEX, SDSS, and WISE photometry calibrated
on Herschel-ATLAS. We use a new method of constraining SED fits with infrared luminosity (SED+LIR
fitting), and parameterized attenuation curves determined with the CIGALE SED fitting code. Attenuation
curve slopes and UV bump strengths are reasonably well constrained independently from one another.
We find that $A_{\lambda}/A_V$ attenuation curves exhibit a very wide range of slopes that are on
average as steep as the SMC curve slope. The slope is a strong function of optical opacity. Opaque
galaxies have shallower curves - in agreement with recent radiate transfer models. The dependence
of slopes on the opacity produces an apparent dependence on stellar mass: more massive galaxies
having shallower slopes. Attenuation curves exhibit a wide range of UV bump amplitudes, from none
to MW-like; with an average strength 1/3 of the MW bump. Notably, local analogs of high-redshift
galaxies have an average curve that is somewhat steeper than the SMC curve, with a modest UV bump that
can be to first order ignored, as its effect on the near-UV magnitude is 0.1 mag. Neither the slopes
nor the strengths of the UV bump depend on gas-phase metallicity. Functional forms for attenuation
laws are presented for normal star-forming galaxies, high-z analogs and quiescent galaxies. We
release the catalog of associated SFRs and stellar masses (GSWLC-2).
