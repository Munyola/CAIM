The progenitor systems of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are still under debate. Based on recent hydrodynamics
simulations, non-degenerate companions in the single-degenerate scenario (SDS) should survive
the supernova impact. One way to distinguish between the SDS and the double-degenerate scenario
is to search for the post-impact remnant stars (PIRSs) in SN Ia remnants. Using a technique that combines
multi-dimensional hydrodynamics simulations with one-dimensional stellar evolution simulations,
we have examined the post-impact evolution of helium-rich binary companions in the SDS. It is found
that these helium-rich PIRSs (He PIRSs) dramatically expand and evolve to a luminous phase ($L\sim
10^4 L_\odot$) about 10 years after a supernova explosion. Subsequently, they contract and evolve
to become hot blue-subdwarf-like (sdO-like) stars by releasing gravitational energy, persisting
as sdO-like stars for several million years before evolving to the helium red-giant phase. We therefore
predict that an sdO-like star should be detectable in the central regions of SN Ia remnants within
star-forming regions, if the SN Ia progenitors evolved via the helium-star channel in the SDS. These
He PIRSs are predicted to be rapidly rotating ($v_{\rm rot} \gtrsim 50$ km s$^{-1}$) and to have high
spatial velocities ($v_{\rm linear} \gtrsim 500$ km s$^{-1}$). Furthermore, if supernova remnants
have diffused away and are not recognizable at a later stage, He PIRSs could be an additional source
of single sdO stars and/or hypervelocity stars.
