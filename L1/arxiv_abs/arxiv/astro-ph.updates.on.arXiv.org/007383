We present a vestige of the linear tidal influence on the spin orientations of the constituent galaxies
of the WM sheet discovered in the vicinity of the Virgo cluster and the Local Void. The WM sheet is chosen
as an optimal target since it has a rectangular parallelepiped-like shape whose three sides are
in parallel with the supergalactic Cartesian axes. Determining three probability density functions
of the absolute values of the supergalactic Cartesian components of the spin vectors of the WM sheet
galaxies, we investigate their alignments with the principal directions of the surrounding large-scale
tidal field. When the WM sheet galaxies located in the central region within the distance of $2\,h^{-1}$Mpc
are excluded, the spin vectors of the remaining WM sheet galaxies are found to be weakly aligned,
strongly aligned, and strongly anti-aligned with the minor, intermediate and major principal
directions of the surrounding large-scale tidal field, respectively. To examine whether or not
the origin of the observed alignment tendency from the WM sheet is the linear tidal effect, we infer
the eigenvalues of the linear tidal tensor from the axial ratios of the WM sheet with the help of the
Zel'dovich approximation and conduct a full analytic evaluation of the prediction of the linear
tidal torque model for the three probability density functions. A detailed comparison between
the analytical and the observational results reveals a good quantitative agreement not only in
the behaviors but also in the amplitudes of the three probability density functions.
