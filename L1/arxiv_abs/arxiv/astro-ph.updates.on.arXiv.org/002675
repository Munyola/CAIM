We describe the development of automated emission line detection software for the Fiber Multi-Object
Spectrograph (FMOS), which is a near-infrared spectrograph fed by $400$ fibers from the $0.2$ deg$^2$
prime focus field of view of the Subaru Telescope. The software, FIELD (FMOS software for Image-based
Emission Line Detection), is developed and tested mainly for the FastSound survey, which is targeting
H$\alpha$ emitting galaxies at $z \sim 1.3$ to measure the redshift space distortion as a test of
general relativity beyond $z \sim 1$. The basic algorithm is to calculate the line signal-to-noise
ratio ($S/N$) along the wavelength direction, given by a 2-D convolution of the spectral image and
a detection kernel representing a typical emission line profile. A unique feature of FMOS is its
use of OH airglow suppression masks, requiring the use of flat-field images to suppress noise around
the mask regions. Bad pixels on the detectors and pixels affected by cosmic-rays are efficiently
removed by using the information obtained from the FMOS analysis pipeline. We limit the range of
acceptable line-shape parameters for the detected candidates to further improve the reliability
of line detection. The final performance of line detection is tested using a subset of the FastSound
data; the false detection rate of spurious objects is examined by using inverted frames obtained
by exchanging object and sky frames. The false detection rate is $< 1$\% at $S/N > 5$, allowing
an efficient and objective emission line search for FMOS data at the line flux level of $\gtrsim 1.0
\times 10^{-16}$[erg/cm$^2$/s].
