We describe the afterglows of the long gamma-ray-burst (GRB) 130427A within the context of a binary-driven
hypernova (BdHN). The afterglows originate from the interaction between a newly born neutron star
($\nu$NS), created by an Ic supernova (SN), and a mildly relativistic ejecta of a hypernova (HN).
Such a HN in turn results from the impact of the GRB on the original SN Ic. The mildly relativistic expansion
velocity of the afterglow ($\Gamma \sim 3$) is determined, using our model indipendent approach,
from the thermal emission between $196$~s and $461$~s. The power-law in the optical and X-ray bands
of the afterglow is shown to arise from the synchrotron emission of relativistic electrons in the
expanding magnetized HN ejecta. Two components contribute to the injected energy: the kinetic
energy of the mildly relativistic expanding HN and the rotational energy of the fast rotating highly
magnetized $\nu$NS. We reproduce the afterglow in all wavelengths from the optical ($10^{14}$~Hz)
to the X-ray band ($10^{19}$~Hz) over times from $604$~s to $5.18\times 10^6$~s relative to the
Fermi-GBM trigger. Initially, the emission is dominated by the loss of kinetic energy of the HN component.
After $10^5$~s the emission is dominated by the loss of rotational energy of the $\nu$NS, for which
we adopt an initial rotation period of $2$~ms and a dipole/quadrupole magnetic field of $\lesssim
\! 7\times 10^{12}$~G/$\sim \! 10^{14}$~G. This scenario differs from the traditional ultra-relativistic
treatments of the afterglows. This same approach is being applied to GRB 160625B as well as GRB 090618.
