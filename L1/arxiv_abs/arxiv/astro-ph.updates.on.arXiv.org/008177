We present results from deep observations towards the Cygnus region using 300 hours of very-high-energy
(VHE) $\gamma$-ray data taken with the VERITAS Cherenkov telescope array and over seven years of
high-energy $\gamma$-ray data taken with the Fermi satellite at an energy above 1 GeV. As the brightest
region of diffuse $\gamma$-ray emission in the northern sky, the Cygnus region provides a promising
area to probe the origins of cosmic rays. We report the identification of a potential Fermi-LAT counterpart
to VER J2031+415 (TeV J2032+4130), and resolve the extended VHE source VER J2019+368 into two source
candidates (VER J2018+367* and VER J2020+368*) and characterize their energy spectra. The Fermi-LAT
morphology of 3FGL 2021.0+4031e (the Gamma-Cygni supernova remnant) was examined and a region
of enhanced emission coincident with VER J2019+407 was identified and jointly fit with the VERITAS
data. By modeling 3FGL J2015.6+3709 as two sources, one located at the location of the pulsar wind
nebula CTB 87 and one at the quasar QSO J2015+371, a continuous spectrum from 1 GeV to 10 TeV was extracted
for VER J2016+371 (CTB 87). An additional 71 locations coincident with Fermi-LAT sources and other
potential objects of interest were tested for VHE $\gamma$-ray emission, with no emission detected
and upper limits on the differential flux placed at an average of 2.3% of the Crab Nebula ux. We interpret
these observations in a multiwavelength context and present the most detailed $\gamma$-ray view
of the region to date.
