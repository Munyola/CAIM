How would negative energy density affect a classic Friedmann cosmology? Although never measured
and possibly unphysical, certain realizations of quantum field theories leaves the door open for
such a possibility. In this paper we analyze the evolution of a universe comprising varying amounts
of negative energy forms. Negative energy components have negative normalized energy densities,
$\Omega < 0$. They include negative phantom energy with an equation of state parameter $w<-1$,
negative cosmological constant: $w=-1$, negative domain walls: $w=-2/3$, negative cosmic strings:
$w=-1/3$, negative mass: $w=0$, negative radiation: $w=1/3$ and negative ultralight: $w >
1/3$. Assuming that such energy forms generate pressure like perfect fluids, the attractive or
repulsive nature of negative energy components are reviewed. The Friedmann equation is satisfied
only when negative energy forms are coupled to a greater magnitude of positive energy forms or positive
curvature. We show that the solutions exhibit cyclic evolution with bounces and turnovers.The
future and fate of such universes in terms of curvature, temperature, acceleration, and energy
density are reviewed. The end states are dubbed Big Crunch, Big Void, or Big Rip and further qualified
as "Warped", "Curved", or "Flat", "Hot" versus "Cold", "Accelerating" versus "Decelerating"
versus "Coasting". A universe that ends by contracting to zero energy density is termed "Big Poof."
Which contracting universes "bounce" in expansion and which expanding universes "turnover" into
contraction are also reviewed.
