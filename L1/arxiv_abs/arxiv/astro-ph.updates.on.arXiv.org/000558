We report constraints on primordial non-Gaussianity from the abundance of X-ray detected clusters.
Our analytic prescription for adding non-Gaussianity to the cluster mass function takes into account
moments beyond the skewness, and we demonstrate that those moments should not be ignored in most
analyses of cluster data. We constrain the amplitude of the skewness for two scenarios that have
different overall levels of non-Gaussianity, characterized by how amplitudes of higher cumulants
scale with the skewness. We find that current data can constrain these one-parameter non-Gaussian
models at a useful level, but are not sensitive to adding further details of the corresponding inflation
scenarios. Combining cluster data with Cosmic Microwave Background constraints on the cosmology
and power spectrum amplitude, we find the dimensionless skewness to be 1000*M3=-1+24-28 for one
of our scaling scenarios, and 1000*M3=-4+/-7 for the other. These are the first constraints on non-Gaussianity
from Large Scale Structure that can be usefully applied to any model of primordial non-Gaussianity.
When applied to the standard local ansatz, the constraint corresponds to fNL=-2+47-55. When applied
to a model with a local-shape bispectrum but higher cumulants that are relatively more important,
the amplitude of the local-shape bispectrum is constrained to be fNL=-8+14-13. This sensitivity
implies that cluster counts could be used to distinguish qualitatively different models for the
primordial fluctuations that have identical bispectra. (Abstract Abridged.)
