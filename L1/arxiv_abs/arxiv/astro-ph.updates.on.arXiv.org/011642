The hadronic interaction of cosmic rays with solar atmosphere can produce high energy gamma rays.
The gamma-ray luminosity is correlated both with the flux of primary cosmic rays and the intensity
of the solar magnetic field. The gamma rays below 200 GeV have been observed by $Fermi$ without any
evident energy cutoff. The bright gamma-ray flux above 100 GeV has been detected only during solar
minimum. The only available data in TeV range come from the HAWC observations, however outside the
solar minimum. The ARGO-YBJ dataset has been used to search for sub-TeV/TeV gamma rays from the Sun
during the solar minimum from 2008 to 2010, the same time period covered by the Fermi data. A suitable
model containing the Sun shadow, solar disk emission and inverse-Compton emission has been developed,
and the chi-square minimization method was used to quantitatively estimate the disk gamma-ray
signal. The result shows that no significant gamma-ray signal is detected and upper limits to the
gamma-ray flux at 0.3$-$7 TeV are set at 95\% confidence level. In the low energy range these limits
are consistent with the extrapolation of the Fermi-LAT measurements taken during solar minimum
and are compatible with a softening of the gamma-ray spectrum below 1 TeV. They provide also an experimental
upper bound to any solar disk emission at TeV energies. Models of dark matter annihilation via long-lived
mediators predicting gamma-ray fluxes > $10^{-7}$ GeV $cm^{-2}$ $s^{-1}$ below 1 TeV are ruled
out by the ARGO-YBJ limits.
