The characterization of exoplanetary atmospheres has come of age in the last decade, as astronomical
techniques now allow for albedos, chemical abundances, temperature profiles and maps, rotation
periods and even wind speeds to be measured. Atmospheric dynamics sets the background state of density,
temperature and velocity that determines or influences the spectral and temporal appearance of
an exoplanetary atmosphere. Hot exoplanets are most amenable to these characterization techniques;
in the present review, we focus on highly-irradiated, large exoplanets (the "hot Jupiters"), as
astronomical data begin to confront theoretical questions. We summarize the basic atmospheric
quantities inferred from the astronomical observations. We review the state of the art by addressing
a series of current questions and look towards the future by considering a separate set of exploratory
questions. Attaining the next level of understanding will require a concerted effort of constructing
multi-faceted, multi-wavelength datasets for benchmark objects. Understanding clouds presents
a formidable obstacle, as they introduce degeneracies into the interpretation of spectra, yet
their properties and existence are directly influenced by atmospheric dynamics. Confronting
general circulation models with these multi-faceted, multi-wavelength datasets will help us
understand these and other degeneracies. The coming decade will witness a decisive confrontation
of theory and simulation by the next generation of astronomical data.
