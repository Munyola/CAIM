We have observed the submillimeter continuum condensation SMM4 in Serpens Main using the Atacama
Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) during its Cycle 3 in 1.3 mm continuum, 12CO J=2-1,
SO J_N=6_5-5_4, and C18O J=2-1 lines at angular resolutions of ~0.55" (240 au). The 1.3 mm continuum
emission shows that SMM4 is spatially resolved into two protostars embedded in the same core: SMM4A
showing a high brightness temperature, 18 K, with little extended structure and SMM4B showing a
low brightness temperature, 2 K, with compact and extended structures. Their separation is ~2100
au. Analysis of the continuum visibilities reveals a disk-like structure with a sharp edge at r~240
au in SMM4A, and a compact component with a radius of 56 au in SMM4B. The 12CO emission traces fan-shaped
and collimated outflows associated with SMM4A and SMM4B, respectively. The blue and red lobes of
the SMM4B outflow have different position angles by ~30 deg. Their inclination and bending angles
in the 3D space are estimated at i_b~ 36 deg, i_r~70 deg, and alpha~40 deg, respectively. The SO emission
traces shocked regions, such as cavity walls of outflows and the vicinity of SMM4B. The C18O emission
mainly traces an infalling and rotating envelope around SMM4B. The C18O fractional abundance in
SMM4B is ~50 times smaller than that of the interstellar medium. These results suggest that SMM4A
is more evolved than SMM4B. Our studies in Serpens Main demonstrate that continuum and line observations
at millimeter wavelengths allow us to differentiate evolutionary phases of protostars within
the Class 0 phase.
