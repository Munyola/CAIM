I present a novel mechanism to boost magnetic field amplification of newly born neutron stars in
core collapse supernovae. In this mechanism, that operates in the jittering jets explosion mechanism
and comes on top of the regular magnetic field amplification by turbulence, the accretion of stochastic
angular momentum in core collapse supernovae forms a neutron star with strong initial magnetic
fields but with a slow rotation. The varying angular momentum of the accreted gas, which is unique
to the jittering jets explosion mechanism, exerts a varying azimuthal shear on the magnetic fields
of the accreted mass near the surface of the neutron star. This, I argue, can form an amplifying effect
which I term the stochastic omega (S$\omega$) effect. In the common $\alpha \omega$ dynamo the rotation
has constant direction and value, and hence supplies a constant azimuthal shear, while the convection
has a stochastic behavior. In the S$\omega$ dynamo the stochastic angular momentum is different
from turbulence in that it operates on a large scale, and it is different from a regular rotational
shear in being stochastic. The basic assumption is that because of the varying direction of the angular
momentum axis from one accretion episode to the next, the rotational flow of an accretion episode
stretches the magnetic fields that were amplified in the previous episode. I estimate the amplification
factor of the S$\omega$ dynamo alone to be $\approx 10$. I speculate that the S$\omega$ effect accounts
for a recent finding that many neutron stars are born with strong magnetic fields.
