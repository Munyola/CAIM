We report astrophysical properties of 12 Milky Way open clusters located beyond the circle around
the Sun where the number of catalogued open clusters is thought to be statistically complete. By
using deep optical photometry, we estimated their ages and metallicities on the basis of a maximum
likelihood approach, using cluster members identified from Gaia DR2 data and likelihood procedures.
The studied clusters turned out to be of intermediate-age (0.8 - 4.0 Gyr), with metallicities spanning
the range [Fe/H] ~ -0.5 - +0.1 dex, and distributed within the general observed trend of the Milky
Way disc radial and perpendicular metallicity gradients. As far as we are aware, these are the first
metal abundance estimates derived for these clusters so far. From the constructed stellar density
radial profiles and cluster mass functions we obtained a variety of structural and internal dynamics
evolution parameters. They show that while the innermost cluster regions would seem to be mainly
shaped according to the respective internal dynamics evolutionary stages, the outermost ones
would seem to be slightly more sensitive to the Milky Way tidal field. The nearly coeval studied clusters
are experiencing different levels of two-body relaxation following star evaporation; those at
more advanced stages being more compact objects. Likewise, we found that the more important the
Milky way tides, the larger the Jacobi volume occupied by the clusters, irrespective of their actual
sizes and internal dynamics evolutionary stages.
