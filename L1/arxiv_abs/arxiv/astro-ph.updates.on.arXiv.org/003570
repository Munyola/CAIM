We are conducting a Jansky VLA Ka-band (8 mm and 1 cm) and C-band (4 cm and 6.4 cm) survey of all known
protostars in the Perseus Molecular Cloud, providing resolution down to $\sim$0.06'' and $\sim$0.35"
in Ka-band and C-band, respectively. Here we present first results from this survey that enable
us to examine the source NGC 1333 IRAS2A in unprecedented detail and resolve it into a proto-binary
system separated by 0.621"$\pm$0.006" ($\sim$143 AU) at 8 mm, 1 cm, and 4 cm. These 2 sources (IRAS2A
VLA1 and VLA2) are likely driving the two orthogonal outflows known to originate from IRAS2A. The
brighter source IRAS2A VLA1 is extended perpendicular to its outflow in the VLA data, with a deconvolved
size of 0.055" ($\sim$13 AU), possibly tracing a protostellar disk. The recently reported candidate
companions (IRAS2A MM2 and MM3) are not detected in either our VLA data, CARMA 1.3 mm data, or SMA 850
$\mu$m data. SMA CO ($J=3\rightarrow2$), CARMA CO ($J=2\rightarrow1$), and lower resolution
CARMA CO ($J=1\rightarrow0$) observations are used to examine the outflow origins and the nature
of the candidate companions to IRAS2A VLA1. The CO ($J=3\rightarrow2$) and ($J=2\rightarrow1$)
data show that IRAS2A MM2 is coincident with a bright CO emission spot in the east-west outflow, and
IRAS2A MM3 is within the north-south outflow. In contrast, IRAS2A VLA2 lies at the east-west outflow
symmetry point. We propose that IRAS2A VLA2 is the driving source of the East-West outflow and a true
companion to IRAS2A VLA1, whereas IRAS2A MM2 and MM3 may not be protostellar.
