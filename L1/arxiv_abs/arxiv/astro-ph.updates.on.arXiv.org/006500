We carried out new CO ($J=$1-0, 2-1 and 3-2) observations with NANTEN2 and ASTE in the region of the
twin Galactic mini-starbursts NGC 6334 and NGC 6357. We detected two velocity molecular components
of 12 km s$^{-1}$ velocity separation, which is continuous over 3 degrees along the plane. In NGC
6334 the two components show similar two-peaked intensity distributions toward the young HII regions
and are linked by a bridge feature. In NGC 6357 we found spatially complementary distribution between
the two velocity components as well as a bridge feature in velocity. Based on these results we hypothesize
that the two clouds in the two regions collided with each other in the past few Myr and triggered formation
of the starbursts over $\sim$ 100 pc. We suggest that the formation of the starbursts happened toward
the collisional region of $\sim$ 10-pc extents with initial high molecular column densities. For
NGC 6334 we present a scenario which includes spatial variation of the colliding epoch due to non-uniform
cloud separation. The scenario possibly explains the apparent age difference among the young O
stars in NGC 6334 raging from $10^4$ yrs to $10^6$ yrs; the latest collision happened within $10^5$
yrs toward the youngest stars in NGC 6334 I(N) and I which exhibit molecular outflows without HII
regions. For NGC 6357 the O stars were formed a few Myrs ago, and the cloud dispersal by the O stars is
significant. We conclude that cloud-cloud collision offers a possible explanation of the min-starburst
over a 100-pc scale.
