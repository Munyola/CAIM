We present an analysis of ultraviolet (UV) to near-infrared observations of the fast-declining
Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) 2007on and 2011iv, hosted by the Fornax cluster member NGC 1404. The B-band
light curves of SN 2007on and SN 2011iv are characterised by dm_15(B) decline-rate values of 1.96
mag and 1.77 mag, respectively. Although they have similar decline rates, their peak B- and H-band
magnitudes differ by ~0.60 mag and ~0.35 mag, respectively. After correcting for the luminosity
vs. decline rate and the luminosity vs. colour relations, the peak B-band and H-band light curves
provide distances that differ by ~14% and ~9%, respectively. These findings serve as a cautionary
tale for the use of transitional SNe Ia located in early-type hosts in the quest to measure cosmological
parameters. Interestingly, even though SN 2011iv is brighter and bluer at early times, by three
weeks past maximum and extending over several months, its B-V colour is 0.12 mag redder than that
of SN 2007on. To reconcile this unusual behaviour, we turn to guidance from a suite of spherical one-dimensional
Chandrasekhar-mass delayed-detonation explosion models. In this context, 56Ni production depends
on both the so-called transition density and the central density of the progenitor white dwarf.
To first order, the transition density drives the luminosity-width relation, while the central
density is an important second-order parameter. Within this context, the differences in the B-V
color evolution along the Lira regime suggests the progenitor of SN~2011iv had a higher central
density than SN~2007on.
