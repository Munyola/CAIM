The population of close-in super-Earths, with gas mass fractions of up to 10% represents a challenge
for planet formation theory: how did they avoid runaway gas accretion and collapsing to hot Jupiters
despite their core masses being in the critical range of $M_\mathrm{c} \simeq 10 M_\mathrm{\oplus}$?
Previous three-dimensional (3D) hydrodynamical simulations indicate that atmospheres of low-mass
planets cannot be considered isolated from the protoplanetary disc, contrary to what is assumed
in 1D-evolutionary calculations. This finding is referred to as the recycling hypothesis. In this
Paper we investigate the recycling hypothesis for super-Earth planets, accounting for realistic
3D radiation hydrodynamics. Also, we conduct a direct comparison in terms of the evolution of the
entropy between 1D and 3D geometries. We clearly see that 3D atmospheres maintain higher entropy:
although gas in the atmosphere loses entropy through radiative cooling, the advection of high entropy
gas from the disc into the Bondi/Hill sphere slows down Kelvin-Helmholtz contraction, potentially
arresting envelope growth at a sub-critical gas mass fraction. Recycling, therefore, operates
vigorously, in line with results by previous studies. However, we also identify an "inner core"
-- in size $\approx$ 25% of the Bondi radius -- where streamlines are more circular and entropies
are much lower than in the outer atmosphere. Future studies at higher resolutions are needed to assess
whether this region can become hydrodynamically-isolated on long time-scales.
