We observed a sample of 90 red giant branch (RGB) stars in NGC 2808 using FLAMES/GIRAFFE and the high
resolution grating with the set up HR21. These stars have previous accurate atmospheric parameters
and abundances of light elements. We derived aluminium abundances for them from the strong doublet
Al I 8772-8773 Angstrom as in previous works of our group. In addition, we were able to estimate the
relative CN abundances for 89 of the stars from the strength of a large number of CN features. When
adding self consistent abundances from previous UVES spectra analysed by our team, we gathered
[Al/Fe] ratios for a total of 108 RGB stars in NGC 2808. The full dataset of proton-capture elements
is used to explore in details the five spectroscopically detected discrete components in this globular
cluster. We found that different classes of polluters are required to reproduce the (anti)-correlations
among all proton-capture elements in the populations P2, I1, and I2 with intermediate composition.
This is in agreement with the detection of lithium in lower RGB second generation stars, requiring
at least two kind of polluters. To have chemically homogeneous populations the best subdivision
of our sample is into six components, as derived from statistical cluster analysis. By comparing
different diagrams [element/Fe] vs [element/Fe] we show for the first time that a simple dilution
model is not able to reproduce all the sub-populations in this cluster. Polluters of different masses
are required. NGC 2808 is confirmed to be a tough challenge to any scenario for globular cluster formation.
