The Australia Telescope Compact Array has been used to search for 22-GHz water masers towards the
119 6.7-GHz methanol masers detected in the Methanol Multi-Beam survey between Galactic longitudes
6 and 20 degrees; we find water masers associated with 55 (~46 per cent). Methanol masers with associated
water masers have a higher mean integrated luminosity than those without and there is a general trend
for sources with more luminous 6.7-GHz methanol masers to be associated with more luminous water
maser emission. We have inspected the GLIMPSE three colour images of the regions surrounding the
masers and cross-matched the maser positions with existing catalogues of Extended Green Objects
and Infrared Dark Clouds. We find more Extended Green Objects at sites where both methanol and water
masers are present than at sites with only methanol masers, but no significant difference in the
fraction embedded within Infrared Dark Clouds. Analysis of the 1.1-mm dust emission shows dust
clumps associated with masers that have greater flux densities and higher column densities than
those without. Dust clumps associated with both water and 6.7-GHz methanol masers are generally
the most compact clumps followed by those associated with only methanol then the clumps without
associated maser emission. We conclude that protostars with both methanol and water masers are
often older than those with only methanol, however, we suggest that the evolutionary phase traced
by water masers is not as well defined as for 6.7-GHz methanol masers.
