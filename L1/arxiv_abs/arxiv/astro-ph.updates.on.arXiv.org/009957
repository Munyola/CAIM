The near-infrared background between 0.5 $\mu$m to 2 $\mu$m contains a wealth of information related
to radiative processes in the universe. Infrared background anisotropies encode the redshift-weighted
total emission over cosmic history, including any spatially diffuse and extended contributions.
The anisotropy power spectrum is dominated by undetected galaxies at small angular scales and diffuse
background of Galactic emission at large angular scales. In addition to these known sources, the
infrared background also arises from intra-halo light (IHL) at $z < 3$ associated with tidally-stripped
stars during galaxy mergers. Moreover, it contains information on the very first galaxies from
the epoch of reionization (EoR). The EoR signal has a spectral energy distribution (SED) that goes
to zero near optical wavelengths due to Lyman absorption, while other signals have spectra that
vary smoothly with frequency. Due to differences in SEDs and spatial clustering, these components
may be separated in a multi-wavelength-fluctuation experiment. To study the extent to which EoR
fluctuations can be separated in the presence of IHL, extra-galactic and Galactic foregrounds,
we develop a maximum likelihood technique that incorporates a full covariance matrix among all
the frequencies at different angular scales. We apply this technique to simulated deep imaging
data over a 2$\times$100 deg$^2$ sky area from 0.75 $\mu$m to 5 $\mu$m in 9 bands and find that such
a "frequency tomography" can successfully reconstruct both the amplitude and spectral shape for
representative EoR, IHL and the foreground signals.
