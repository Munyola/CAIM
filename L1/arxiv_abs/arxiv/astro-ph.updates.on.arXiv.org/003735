We analyse modelling techniques for the large-scale structure formed in scalar-tensor theories
of constant Brans-Dicke parameter which match the concordance model background expansion history
and produce a chameleon suppression of the gravitational modification in high-density regions.
Thereby, we use a mass and environment dependent chameleon spherical collapse model, the Sheth-Tormen
halo mass function and linear halo bias, the Navarro-Frenk-White halo density profile, and the
halo model. Furthermore, using the spherical collapse model, we extrapolate a chameleon mass-concentration
scaling relation from a LCDM prescription calibrated to N-body simulations. We also provide constraints
on the model parameters to ensure viability on local scales. We test our description of the halo mass
function and nonlinear matter power spectrum against the respective observables extracted from
large-volume and high-resolution N-body simulations in the limiting case of f(R) gravity, corresponding
to a vanishing Brans-Dicke parameter. We find good agreement between the two; the halo model provides
a good qualitative description of the shape of the relative enhancement of the f(R) matter power
spectrum with respect to LCDM caused by the extra attractive gravitational force but fails to recover
the correct amplitude. Introducing an effective linear power spectrum in the computation of the
two-halo term to account for an underestimation of the chameleon suppression at intermediate scales
in our approach, we accurately reproduce the measurements from the N-body simulations.
