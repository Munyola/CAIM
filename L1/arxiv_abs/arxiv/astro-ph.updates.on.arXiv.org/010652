Number density profiles are computed for the satellites of relatively isolated host galaxies in
the Illustris-1 simulation. The mean total mass density of the hosts is well-fitted by an NFW profile.
The number density profile for the complete satellite sample is inconsistent with NFW and, on scales
< 0.5 r_200, the satellites do not trace the hosts' mass. This differs substantially from previous
results from semi-analytic galaxy formation models. The shape of the satellite number density
profile depends on the luminosities of the hosts and the satellites, and on the host virial mass.
The number density profile for the faintest satellites is well-fitted by an NFW profile, but the
concentration is much less than the mean host mass density. The number density profile for the brightest
satellites exhibits a steep increase in slope for host-satellite distances < 0.1 r_200, in qualitative
agreement with recent observational studies that find a steep increase in the satellite number
density at small host-satellite distances. On scales > 0.1 r_200 the satellites of the faintest
hosts trace the host mass reasonably well. On scales > 0.4 r_200, the satellites of the brightest
hosts do not trace the host mass and the satellite number density increases steeply for host-satellite
distances < 0.1 r_200. The discrepancy between the satellite number density profile and the host
mass density is most pronounced for the most massive systems, with the satellite number density
falling far below that of the mass density on scales < 0.5 r_200.
