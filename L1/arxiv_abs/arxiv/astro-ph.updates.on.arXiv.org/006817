We present an investigation of a coronal cavity observed above the western limb in the coronal red
line Fe X 6374 {\AA} using a telescope of Peking University and in the green line Fe XIV 5303 {\AA} using
a telescope of Yunnan Observatories, Chinese Academy of Sciences during the total solar eclipse
on 2017 August 21. A series of magnetic field models are constructed based on the magnetograms taken
by the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) one week before
the eclipse. The model field lines are then compared with coronal structures seen in images taken
by the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly on board SDO and in our coronal red line images. The best-fit
model consists of a flux rope with a twist angle of 3.1$\pi$, which is consistent with the most probable
value of the total twist angle of interplanetary flux ropes observed at 1 AU. Linear polarization
of the Fe XIII 10747 {\AA} line calculated from this model shows a "lagomorphic" signature that is
also observed by the Coronal Multichannel Polarimeter of the High Altitude Observatory. We also
find a ring-shaped structure in the line-of-sight velocity of Fe XIII 10747 {\AA}, which implies
hot plasma flows along a helical magnetic field structure, in the cavity. These results suggest
that the magnetic structure of the cavity is a highly twisted flux rope, which may erupt eventually.
The temperature structure of the cavity has also been investigated using the intensity ratio of
Fe XIII 10747 {\AA} and Fe X 6374 {\AA}.
