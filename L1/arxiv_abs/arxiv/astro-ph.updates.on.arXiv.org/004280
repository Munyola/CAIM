Wave Dark Matter (WaveDM) has recently gained attention as a viable candidate to account for the
dark matter content of the Universe. In this paper we explore the extent to which dark matter halos
in this model, and under what conditions, are able to reproduce strong lensing systems. First, we
analytically explore the lensing properties of the model -- finding that a pure WaveDM density profile,
a soliton profile, produces a weaker lensing effect than other similar cored profiles. Then we analyze
models with a soliton embedded in an NFW profile, as has been found in numerical simulations of structure
formation. We use a benchmark model with a boson mass of $m_a=10^{-22}{\rm eV}$, for which we see
that there is a bi-modality in the contribution of the external NFW part of the profile, and actually
some of the free parameters associated with it are not well constrained. We find that for configurations
with boson masses $10^{-23}$ -- $10^{-22}{\rm eV}$, a range of masses preferred by dwarf galaxy
kinematics, the soliton profile alone can fit the data but its size is incompatible with the luminous
extent of the lens galaxies. Likewise, boson masses of the order of $10^{-21}{\rm eV}$, which would
be consistent with Lyman-$\alpha$ constraints and consist of more compact soliton configurations,
necessarily require the NFW part in order to reproduce the observed Einstein radii. We then conclude
that lens systems impose a conservative lower bound $m_a > 10^{-24}$ and that the NFW envelope around
the soliton must be present to satisfy the observational requirements.
