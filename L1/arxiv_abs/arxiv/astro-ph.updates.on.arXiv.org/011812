Relativistic outflows are believed to be a common feature of black hole X-ray binaries at the lowest
accretion rates, when they are in their `quiescent' spectral state. However, we still lack a detailed
understanding of how quiescent jet emission varies with time. Here we present 24 years of archival
radio observations (from the Very Large Array and the Very Long Baseline Array) of the black hole
X-ray binary V404 Cygni in quiescence (totalling 150 observations from 1.4 -- 22 GHz). The observed
flux densities follow lognormal distributions with means and standard deviations of (<log f_nu>,
sigma) = (-0.53, 0.19) and (-0.53, 0.30) at 4.9 and 8.4 GHz, respectively (where f_nu is the flux density
in units of mJy). As expected, the average radio spectrum is flat with a mean and standard deviation
of (<alpha_r >, sigma_alpha_r)= (0.02, 0.65) where f_nu \propto nu^alpha_r. We find that radio
flares that increase the flux density by factors of 2 -- 4 over timescales as short as <10 min are commonplace,
and that long-term variations (over 10--4000 day timescales) are consistent with shot noise impulses
that decay to stochastic variations on timescales <10 days (and perhaps as short as tens of minutes
to several hours). We briefly compare the variability characteristics of V404 Cygni to jetted active
galactic nuclei, and we conclude with recommendations on how to account for variability when placing
quiescent black hole X-ray binary candidates with radio luminosities comparable to V404 Cygni
(L_r ~ 1e28 erg/s) onto the radio/X-ray luminosity plane.
