At distances from the active galaxy nucleus (AGN) where the ambient temperature falls below ~1500-1800
K, dust is able to survive. It is thus possible to have a large dusty structure present which surrounds
the AGN. This is the first of two papers aiming at comparing six dusty torus models with available
SEDs, namely Fritz et al. (2006), Nenkova et al. (2008B), Hoenig & Kishimoto (2010), Siebenmorgen
et al. (2015), Stalevski et al. (2016), and Hoenig & Kishimoto (2017). In this first paper we use synthetic
spectra to explore the discrimination between these models and under which circumstances they
allow to restrict the torus parameters, while our second paper analyzes the best model to describe
the mid-infrared spectroscopic data. We have produced synthetic spectra from current instruments:
GTC/CanariCam and Spitzer /IRS and future JWST/MIRI and JWST/NIRSpec instruments. We find that
for a reasonable brightness (F12um > 100mJy) we can actually distinguish among models except for
the two pair of parent models. We show that these models can be distinguished based on the continuum
slopes and the strength of the silicate features. Moreover, their parameters can be constrained
within 15% of error, irrespective of the instrument used, for all the models but Hoenig & Kishimoto
(2017). However, the parameter estimates are ruined when more than 50% of circumnuclear contributors
are included. Therefore, future high spatial resolution spectra as those expected from JWST will
provide enough coverage and spatial resolution to tackle this topic.
