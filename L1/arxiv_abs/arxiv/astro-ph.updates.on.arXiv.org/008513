Context: The $^{15}$N fractionation has been observed to show large variations among astrophysical
sources, depending both on the type of target and on the molecular tracer used. These variations
cannot be reproduced by the current chemical models. Aims: Until now, the $^{14}$N/$^{15}$N ratio
in N$_2$H$^+$ has been accurately measured in only one prestellar source, L1544, where strong levels
of fractionation, with depletion in $^{15}$N, are found ($^{14}$N/$^{15}$N$\: \approx 1000$).
In this paper we extend the sample to three more bona fide prestellar cores, in order to understand
if the antifractionation in N$_2$H$^+$ is a common feature of this kind of sources. Methods: We observed
N$_2$H$^+$,N$^{15}$NH$^+$ and $^{15}$NNH$^+$ in L183, L429 and L694-2 with the IRAM 30m telescope.
We modeled the emission with a non-local radiative transfer code in order to obtain accurate estimates
of the molecular column densities, including the one for the optically thick N$_2$H$^+$. We used
the most recent collisional rate coefficients available, and with these we also re-analysed the
L1544 spectra previously published. Results: The obtained isotopic ratios are in the range $630-770$
and significantly differ with the value, predicted by the most recent chemical models, of $\approx
440$, close to the protosolar value. Our prestellar core sample shows high level of depletion of
$^{15}$N in diazenylium, as previously found in L1544. A revision of the N chemical networks is needed
in order to explain these results.
