Araneiforms are radially converging systems of branching troughs exhibiting fractal properties.
They are found exclusively in the Southern polar regions of Mars and believed to be result of multiple
repetitions of cold CO2 gas jets eruptions. Araneiform troughs get carved by the overpressurized
gas rushing underneath a seasonal ice layer towards a newly created opening. Current work is an attempt
to quantitatively analyze araneiforms patterns and model their formation mechanism. The dendritic
quality of most araneiforms are suggestive that they can be described in terms commonly applied
to terrestrial rivers. We have adapted and for the first time applied to Martian araneiforms qualitative
morphological analysis typically used for terrestrial rivers. We have shown that the large and
well-developed araneiforms (with tributary orders larger than 4) closely follow Horton's law
of tributary orders and have bifurcation ratio that falls well inside the range of terrestrial rivers.
We have implemented a two-dimensional Diffusion-Limited Aggregation (DLA) model that describes
formation of dendrite shapes by mathematical probabilistic means. We compared modeled dendrite
shapes to the araneiform shapes observed in the Martian polar regions and evaluated their similarity
using the morphological analysis of araneiforms. We showed that DLA model can successfully recreate
2D shapes of different observed araneiforms. Modeling the creation of araneiform patterns with
DLA leads to better understanding of seasonal processes that create them.
