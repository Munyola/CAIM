We explore the connection between absorption by neutral gas and extinction by dust in mid-infrared
(IR) selected luminous quasars. We use a sample of 33 quasars at redshifts 0.7 < z < 3 in the 9
deg^2 Bo\"otes multiwavelength survey field that are selected using Spitzer Space Telescope Infrared
Array Camera colors and are well-detected as luminous X-ray sources (with >150 counts) in Chandra
observations. We divide the quasars into dust-obscured and unobscured samples based on their optical
to mid-IR color, and measure the neutral hydrogen column density N_H through fitting of the X-ray
spectra. We find that all subsets of quasars have consistent power law photon indices equal to 1.9
that are uncorrelated with N_H. We classify the quasars as gas-absorbed or gas-unabsorbed if N_H
> 10^22 cm^-2 or N_H < 10^22 cm^-2, respectively. Of 24 dust-unobscured quasars in the sample,
only one shows clear evidence for significant intrinsic N_H, while 22 have column densities consistent
with N_H < 10^22 cm^-2. In contrast, of the nine dust-obscured quasars, six show evidence for
intrinsic gas absorption, and three are consistent with N_H < 10^22 cm^-2. We conclude that dust
extinction in IR-selected quasars is strongly correlated with significant gas absorption as determined
through X-ray spectral fitting. These results suggest that obscuring gas and dust in quasars are
generally co-spatial, and confirm the reliability of simple mid-IR and optical photometric techniques
for separating quasars based on obscuration.
