The orbital motion of non-contact double-lined spectroscopic binaries (SB2), with periods of
a few tens of days to several years, holds unique accurate informations on individual stellar masses,
that only long-term monitoring can unlock. The combination of radial velocity measurements from
high-resolution spectrographs and astrometric measurements from high-precision interferometers
allows the derivation of SB2 components masses down to the percent precision. Since 2010, we observed
a large sample of SB2 with the SOPHIE spectrograph at the Observatoire de Haute-Provence, aiming
at the derivation of orbital elements with sufficient accuracy to obtain masses of components with
relative errors as low as 1$\%$ when the astrometric measurements of the Gaia satellite will be taken
into account. In this paper we present the results from six years of observations of 14 SB2 systems
with periods ranging from 33 to 4185 days. Using the TODMOR algorithm we computed radial velocities
from the spectra, and then derived the orbital elements of these binary systems. The minimum masses
of the 28 stellar components are then obtained with a sample average accuracy of 1.0$\pm$0.2$\,\%$.
Combining the radial velocities with existing interferometric measurements, we derived the masses
of the primary and secondary components of HIP 61100, HIP 95995 and HIP 101382 with relative errors
for components (A,B) of respectively (2.0, 1.7)$\,\%$, (3.7, 3.7)$\,\%$, and (0.2, 0.1)$\,\%$.
Using the Cesam2k stellar evolution code, we could constrain the initial He-abundance, age and
metallicity for HIP 61100 and HIP 95995.
