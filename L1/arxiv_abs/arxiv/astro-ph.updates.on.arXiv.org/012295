Context. AGB stars go through a process of strong mass-loss that involves pulsations of the atmosphere,
which extends to a region where the conditions are adequate for dust grains to form. Radiation pressure
acts on these grains which, coupled to the gas, drive a massive outflow. The details of this process
are not clear, including which molecules are involved in the condensation of dust grains. Aims.
To study the role of the SiO molecule in the process of dust formation and mass-loss in M-type AGB stars.
Methods. Using the IRAM NOEMA interferometer we observed the $^{28}$SiO and $^{29}$SiO $J=3-2$,
$v=0$ emission from the inner circumstellar envelope of the evolved stars IK Tau and IRC+10011.
We computed azimuthally averaged emission profiles to compare the observations to models using
a molecular excitation and ray-tracing code for SiO thermal emission. Results. We observed circular
symmetry in the emission distribution. We also found that the source diameter varies only marginally
with radial velocity, which is not the expected behavior for envelopes expanding at an almost constant
velocity. The adopted density, velocity, and abundance laws, together with the mass-loss rate,
which best fit the observations, give us information on the chemical behavior of the SiO molecule
and its role in the dust formation process. Conclusions. The results indicate that there is a strong
coupling between the depletion of gas phase SiO and gas acceleration in the inner envelope. This
could be explained by the condensation of SiO into dust grains.
