The X-ray transient eclipsing source MXB 1659-298 went in outburst in 1999 and 2015, respectively.
During these two outbursts the source was observed by XMM-Newton, NuSTAR and Swift/XRT. Using these
observations we studied the broadband spectrum of the source to constrain the continuum components
and to verify the presence of a reflection component as recently observed in the X-ray eclipsing
transient source AX J1745.6-2901. We combined the available spectra studying the soft and hard
state of the source in the 0.4-35 keV and 0.45-55 keV energy range, respectively. We find that the
soft state can be modelled with a thermal component associated with the inner accretion disk plus
a Comptonized component. A broad emission line at 6.6 keV and narrow absorption lines associated
with highly ionized ions of oxygen, neon and iron are observed. We obtain a best-fit model using a
smeared reflection component that fits a reflection emission from the innermost region of the system
and adding a component that takes into account the ionized absorber where the narrow absorption
lines forms. The equivalent hydrogen column density associated with the absorber is close to $6
\times 10^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$. On the other hand, the direct continuum emission in the hard state can
be described by a comptonized component with a temperature larger than 150 keV. Also in this state
a reflection component and a ionized absorber are observed. The equivalent hydrogen column density
associated with the absorber is close to $1.3 \times 10^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$.
