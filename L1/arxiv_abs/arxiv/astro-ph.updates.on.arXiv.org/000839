The evolution of chemical elements in a galaxy is linked to its star formation history. Variations
in star formation history are imprinted in the relative abundances of chemical elements produced
in different supernova events and asymptotic giant branch stars. We determine detailed elemental
abundances of s- and r-process elements in stars belonging to Group3 of the Geneva-Copenhagen survey
and compare their chemical composition with Galactic disc stars. The aim is to look for possible
chemical signatures that might give information about the formation history of this kinematic
group of stars, which is suggested to correspond to remnants of disrupted satellites. High-resolution
spectra were obtained with the FIES spectrograph at the Nordic Optical Telescope, La Palma, and
were analysed with a differential model atmosphere method. Comparison stars were observed and
analysed with the same method. Abundances of chemical elements produced mainly by the s-process
are similar to those in the Galactic thin-disc dwarfs of the same metallicity, while abundances
of chemical elements produced predominantly by the r-process are overabundant. The similar elemental
abundances are observed in Galactic thick-disc stars. The chemical composition together with
the kinematic properties and ages of stars in Group3 of the Geneva-Copenhagen survey support a gas-rich
satellite merger scenario as the most likely explanation for the origin. The similar chemical composition
of stars in Group3 and the thick-disc stars might suggest that their formation histories are linked.
