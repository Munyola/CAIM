The detonation of a sub-Chandrasekhar-mass white dwarf (WD) has emerged as one of the most promising
Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) progenitor scenarios. Recent studies have suggested that the rapid transfer
of a very small amount of helium from one WD to another is sufficient to ignite a helium shell detonation
that subsequently triggers a carbon core detonation, yielding a "dynamically-driven double degenerate
double detonation" SN Ia. Because the helium shell that surrounds the core explosion is so minimal,
this scenario approaches the limiting case of a bare C/O WD detonation. Motivated by discrepancies
in previous literature and by a recent need for detailed nucleosynthetic data, we revisit simulations
of naked C/O WD detonations in this paper. We disagree to some extent with the nucleosynthetic results
of previous work on sub-Chandrasekhar-mass bare C/O WD detonations; e.g., we find that a median-brightness
SN Ia is produced by the detonation of a 1.0 Msol WD instead of a more massive and rarer 1.1 Msol WD. The
neutron-rich nucleosynthesis in our simulations agrees broadly with some observational constraints,
although tensions remain with others. There are also discrepancies related to the velocities of
the outer ejecta and light curve shapes, but overall our synthetic light curves and spectra are roughly
consistent with observations. We are hopeful that future multi-dimensional simulations will
resolve these issues and further bolster the dynamically-driven double degenerate double detonation
scenario's potential to explain most SNe Ia.
