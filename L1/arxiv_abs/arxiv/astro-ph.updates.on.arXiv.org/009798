Despite the hypothesized similar face-on viewing angles, the infrared emission of type-1 AGNs
has diverse spectral energy distribution (SED) shapes that deviate substantially from the well-characterized
quasar templates. Motivated by the commonly-seen UV-optical obscuration and the discovery of
parsec-scale mid-IR polar dust emission in some nearby AGNs, we develop semi-empirical SED libraries
for reddened type-1 AGNs built on the quasar intrinsic templates, assuming low-level extinction
caused by an extended distribution of large dust grains. We demonstrate that this model can reproduce
the nuclear UV-to-IR SED and the strong mid-IR polar dust emission of NGC 3783, the type-1 AGN with
the most relevant and robust observational constraints. In addition, we compile 64 low-$z$ Seyfert-1
nuclei with negligible mid-IR star formation contamination and satisfactorily fit the individual
IR SEDs as well as the composite UV to mid-IR composite SEDs. Given the success of these fits, we characterize
the possible infrared SED of AGN polar dust emission and utilize a simple but effective strategy
to infer its prevalence among type-1 AGNs. The SEDs of high-$z$ peculiar AGNs, including the extremely
red quasars, mid-IR warm-excess AGNs, and hot dust-obscured galaxies, can be also reproduced by
our model. These results indicate that the IR SEDs of most AGNs, regardless of redshift or luminosity,
arise from similar circumnuclear torus properties but differ mainly due to the optical depths of
extended obscuring dust components.
