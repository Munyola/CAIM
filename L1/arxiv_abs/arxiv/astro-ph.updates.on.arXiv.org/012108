X-ray reverberation in Active Galactic Nuclei, believed to be the result of the reprocessing of
coronal photons by the underlying accretion disc, has allowed us to probe the properties of the inner-most
regions of the accretion flow and the central black hole. Our current model (KYNREFREV) computes
the time-dependent reflection spectra of the disc as a response to a flash of primary power-law radiation
from a point source corona located on the axis of the black hole accretion disc (lamp-post geometry).
Full relativistic effects are taken into account. The ionization of the disc is set for each radius
according to the amount of the incident primary flux and the density of the accretion disc. We detect
wavy residuals around the best-fit reverberation model time lags at high frequencies. This result
suggests that the simple lamp-post geometry does not fully explain the X-ray source/disc configuration
in Active Galactic Nuclei. There has been a noticeable progress into the development of codes for
extended coronae (Wilkins+16, Chainakun & Young 2017, Taylor & Reynolds 2018a,b). Indeed, the
model from Chainakun & Young 2017, consisting of two axial point sources illuminating an accretion
disc that produce the reverberation lags is able to reproduce the observed time-lag versus frequency
spectra. The goal of this paper is to observationally justify the need for an extended corona in order
to provide (in the near future) with a mathematical formulation of a model for an extended corona
in its simplest form.
