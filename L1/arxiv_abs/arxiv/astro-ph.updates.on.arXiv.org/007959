We present results of our large scale, optical, multi-epoch photometric survey of ~180 square degrees
across the Orion OB1 association, complemented with extensive follow up spectroscopy. We map and
characterize in an uniform way the off-cloud, low-mass, pre-main sequence populations. We report
2064, mostly K and M-type, confirmed T Tauri members. Most (59%) are located in the OB1a subassociation,
27% in OB1b, and 14% within the confines of the A and B molecular clouds. There is significant structure
in the spatial distribution of the young stars. We characterize two new clusterings of T Tauri stars,
HD 35762 and HR 1833 in the OB1a subassociation, and two stellar overdensities in OB1b. There is indication
of two populations of young stars in the OB1b region, located at two different distances, which may
be due to the OB1a subassociation overlapping on front of OB1b. The various groups and regions can
be ordered in an age sequence that agrees with the long standing picture of star formation starting
in Orion OB1a some 10-15 Myr ago. We define a new type of T Tauri star, the C/W class, objects we propose
may be nearing the end of their accretion phase. We detect the observational signature of Li depletion
in young K and M stars with a timescale of 8.5 Myr. The decline of the accretion fraction from ~2 - 10
Myr, implies an accretion e-folding timescale of 2.1 Myr. Finally, the median amplitude of the V-band
variability shows the decline of stellar activity, from accreting Classical T Tauri stars to the
least active field dwarfs.
