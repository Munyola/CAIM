Galaxy formation simulations demonstrate that cosmic-ray (CR) feedback may be important in the
launching of galactic-scale winds. CR protons dominate the bulk of the CR population, yet most observational
constraints of CR feedback come from synchrotron emission of CR electrons. In this paper, we present
an analysis of 105 months of Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope observations of the Small Magellanic
Cloud (SMC), with the aim of exploring CR feedback and transport in an external galaxy. We produce
maps of the 2-300 GeV emission and detect statistically significant, extended emission along the
Bar and the Wing, where active star formation is occurring. Gamma-ray emission is not detected above
13 GeV, and we set stringent upper-limits on the flux above this energy. We find the best fit to the
gamma-ray spectrum is a single-component model with a power-law of index $\Gamma=-2.11\pm0.06\pm0.06$
and an exponential cutoff energy of $E_{\rm c} =13.1\pm5.1\pm1.6$ GeV. We assess the relative contribution
of pulsars and CRs to the emission, and we find that pulsars may produce up to 14$^{+4}_{-2}$% of the
flux above 100 MeV. Thus, we attribute most of the gamma-ray emission (based on its spectrum and morphology)
to CR interactions with the ISM. We show that the gamma-ray emissivity of the SMC is five times smaller
than that of the Milky Way and that the SMC is far below the calorimetric limit, where all CR protons
experience pion losses. We interpret these findings as evidence that CRs are escaping the SMC via
advection and diffusion.
