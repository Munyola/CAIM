In the era of large-scale surveys of stars in the Milky Way, stellar ages are crucial for studying
the evolution of the Galaxy. But determining ages of field stars is notoriously difficult; therefore,
we attempt to determine benchmark ages for the extensively studied Gaia benchmark stars which can
be used for validation purposes. By searching the literature for age estimates from different methods
and deriving new ages based on Bayesian isochrone fitting, we are able to put reliable limits on the
ages of 16 out of the 33 benchmark stars. The giants with well-defined ages are all young, and an expansion
of the sample to include older giants with asteroseismic ages would be beneficial. Some of the stars
have surface parameters inconsistent with isochrones younger than 16 Gyr. Including $\alpha$-enhancement
in the models when relevant resolves some of these cases, but others clearly highlight discrepancies
between the models and observations. We test the impact of atomic diffusion on the age estimates
by fitting to the actual surface metallicity of the models instead of the initial value and find that
the effect is negligible except for a single turn-off star. Finally, we show that our ability to determine
isochrone-based ages for large spectroscopic surveys largely mirrors our ability to determine
ages for these benchmark stars, except for stars with $\log g \gtrsim 4.4$ dex since their location
in the HR diagram is almost age insensitive. Hence, isochrone fitting does not constrain their ages
given the typical uncertainties of spectroscopic stellar parameters.
