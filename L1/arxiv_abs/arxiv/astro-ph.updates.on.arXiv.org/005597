It is well known that solar filaments are features in the solar atmosphere which show a hemispheric
preference in their chirality. The hemispheric preference is such that the dextral chirality dominates
in the northern hemisphere while the sinistral chirality dominates in the southern. Determining
the strength and cyclic variation of the degree of this hemispheric preference, however, is challenging
and tedious and thus needs to be automated. In this paper, we follow Dr. Pietro Bernasconi's algorithm
(Bernasconi et al. 2005) to detect filament chirality with two parallel channels of application.
The algorithm is applied to H-alpha images by "Advanced Automated Filament Detection and Characterization
Code" (AAFDCC) (Bernasconi et al. 2005) or the algorithm is explained to a human and the human determines
the chirality of the solar filament. We have conducted this exercise on data during the month of August
from years 2000 to 2016 and we found that 83 % of our visually determined filaments follow the hemispheric
chirality preference, while 58 % of automatically determined filaments follow it. Our visually
compiled results have over 90 % agreement with those of Pevtsov et al. (2003), yet the visually determined
chiralities of filaments disagree with automated determinations significantly. We find that
the hemispheric preference remained the same between solar cycles 23 and 24 but the preference is
very difficult to determine during the solar minimum of 2008-2010 primarily due to the absence of
filaments.
