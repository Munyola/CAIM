Many statistical properties of X-ray aperiodic variability from accreting compact objects can
be explained by the propagating fluctuations model applied to the accretion disc. The mass accretion
rate fluctuations originate from variability of viscosity, which arises at every radius and causes
local fluctuations of the density. The fluctuations diffuse through the disc and result in local
variability of the mass accretion rate, which modulates the X-ray flux from the inner disc in the
case of black holes, or from the surface in the case of neutron stars. A key role in the theoretical
explanation of fast variability belongs to the description of the diffusion process. The propagation
and evolution of the fluctuations is described by the diffusion equation, which can be solved by
the method of Green functions. We implement Green functions in order to accurately describe the
propagation of fluctuations in the disc. For the first time we consider both forward and backward
propagation. We show that (i) viscous diffusion efficiently suppress variability at time scales
shorter than the viscous time, (ii) local fluctuations of viscosity affect the mass accretion rate
variability both in the inner and the outer parts of accretion disc, (iii) propagating fluctuations
give rise not only to hard time lags as previously shown, but also produce soft lags at high frequency
similar to those routinely attributed to reprocessing, (iv) deviation from the linear rms-flux
relation is predicted for the case of very large initial perturbations. Our model naturally predicts
bumpy power spectra.
