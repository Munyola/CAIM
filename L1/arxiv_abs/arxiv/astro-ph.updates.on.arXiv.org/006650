Anisotropy of gravitational wave (GW) emission results in a net momentum gained by the black hole
(BH) merger product, leading to a recoil velocity up to $\sim10^3\text{ km s}^{-1}$, which may kick
it out of a globular cluster (GC). We estimate GW kick retention fractions of merger products assuming
different models for BH spin magnitude and orientation. We check how they depend on BH-BH merger
time and properties of the cluster. We analyze the implications of GW kick retention fractions on
intermediate massive BH (IMBH) formation by repeated mergers in a GC. We also calculate final spin
of the merger product, and investigate how it correlates with other parameters: effective spin
of the binary and gravitational kick velocity. We used data from MOCCA (MOnte Carlo Cluster simulAtor)
GC simulations to get a realistic sample of BH-BH mergers, assigned each BH spin value according
to a studied model, and calculated recoil velocity and final spin based on most recent theoretical
formulas. We discovered that for physically motivated models, GW kick retention fractions are
about $30\%$ and display small dependence on assumptions about spin, but are much more prone to cluster
properties. In particular, we discovered a strong dependence of GW kick retention fractions on
cluster density. We also show that GW kick retention fractions are high in final life stages of the
cluster, but low at the beginning. Finally, we derive formulas connecting final spin with effective
spin for primordial binaries, and with maximal effective spin for dynamical binaries.
