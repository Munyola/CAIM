Most protostars have luminosities that are fainter than expected from steady accretion over the
protostellar lifetime. The solution to this problem may lie in episodic mass accretion -- prolonged
periods of very low accretion punctuated by short bursts of rapid accretion. However, the timescale
and amplitude for variability at the protostellar phase is almost entirely unconstrained. In "A
JCMT/SCUBA-2 Transient Survey of Protostars in Nearby Star Forming Regions", we are monitoring
monthly with SCUBA-2 the sub-mm emission in eight fields within nearby (<500 pc) star forming regions
to measure the accretion variability of protostars. The total survey area of ~1.6 sq.deg. includes
~105 peaks with peaks brighter than 0.5 Jy/beam (43 associated with embedded protostars or disks)
and 237 peaks of 0.125-0.5 Jy/beam (50 with embedded protostars or disks). Each field has enough
bright peaks for flux calibration relative to other peaks in the same field, which improves upon
the nominal flux calibration uncertainties of sub-mm observations to reach a precision of ~2-3%
rms, and also provides quantified confidence in any measured variability. The timescales and amplitudes
of any sub-mm variation will then be converted into variations in accretion rate and subsequently
used to infer the physical causes of the variability. This survey is the first dedicated survey for
sub-mm variability and complements other transient surveys at optical and near-IR wavelengths,
which are not sensitive to accretion variability of deeply embedded protostars.
