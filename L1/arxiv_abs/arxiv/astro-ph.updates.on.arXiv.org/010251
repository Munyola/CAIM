We present high spatial resolution, integral field spectrograph (IFS) observations of the nearby
LINER (low ionization nuclear emission line region) galaxy NGC 404 at 1.25 $\mu$m (J band) and 2.2
$\mu$m (K band) near-infrared wavelengths. Although NGC 404 is thought to host an intermediate
mass black hole at its center, it has been unclear whether accretion onto the black hole or another
mechanism such as shock excitation drives its LINER emission at optical/near-infrared wavelengths.
We use the OSIRIS IFS at Keck Observatory behind laser guide star adaptive optics to map the strength
and kinematics of [FeII], H$_2$, and hydrogen recombination lines at spatial resolutions of 1 pc
across the central 30 pc of the galaxy. The H$_2$ gas is in a central rotating disk and ratios of multiple
H$_2$ lines indicate that the molecular gas is thermally excited, with some contribution from UV
fluorescence. The [FeII] emission is more extended and diffuse than the molecular gas and has a different
kinematic structure that reaches higher velocities/dispersions. We also map the strength of the
CO stellar absorption feature and constrain the dominant age of the nuclear stellar population
to $\sim$1 Gyr. Finally, we find regions across the nucleus of NGC 404 with [FeII]/Pa$\beta$ line
ratios up to 6.5, $\sim$2.5 times higher than the ratio measured from spatially-integrated spectra.
From these high line ratios, we conclude that shocks are the dominate physical mechanism exciting
NGC 404's LINER emission and argue that a possible source of this shock excitation is a supernova
remnant.
