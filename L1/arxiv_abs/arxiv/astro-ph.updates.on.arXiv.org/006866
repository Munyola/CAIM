Planck Galactic Cold Clumps (PGCCs) possibly represent the early stages of star formation. To understand
better the properties of PGCCs, we studied 16 PGCCs in the L1495 cloud with molecular lines and continuum
data from Herschel, JCMT/SCUBA-2 and the PMO 13.7 m telescope. Thirty dense cores were identified
in 16 PGCCs from 2-D Gaussian fitting. The dense cores have dust temperatures of $T_{\rm d}$ = 11-14
K, and H$_{2}$ column densities of $N_{\rm H_{2}}$ = 0.36-2.5$\times10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$. We found
that not all PGCCs contain prestellar objects. In general, the dense cores in PGCCs are usually at
their earliest evolutionary stages. All the dense cores have non-thermal velocity dispersions
larger than the thermal velocity dispersions from molecular line data, suggesting that the dense
cores may be turbulence-dominated. We have calculated the virial parameter $\alpha$ and found
that 14 of the dense cores have $\alpha$ $<$ 2, while 16 of the dense cores have $\alpha$ $>$ 2. This
suggests that some of the dense cores are not bound in the absence of external pressure and magnetic
fields. The column density profiles of dense cores were fitted. The sizes of the flat regions and
core radii decrease with the evolution of dense cores. CO depletion was found to occur in all the dense
cores, but is more significant in prestellar core candidates than in protostellar or starless cores.
The protostellar cores inside the PGCCs are still at a very early evolutionary stage, sharing similar
physical and chemical properties with the prestellar core candidates.
