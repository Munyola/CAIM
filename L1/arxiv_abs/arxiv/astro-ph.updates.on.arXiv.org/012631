Over the past century, major advances in astronomy and astrophysics have been largely driven by
improvements in instrumentation and data collection. With the amassing of high quality data from
new telescopes, and especially with the advent of deep and large astronomical surveys, it is becoming
clear that future advances will also rely heavily on how those data are analyzed and interpreted.
New methodologies derived from advances in statistics, computer science, and machine learning
are beginning to be employed in sophisticated investigations that are not only bringing forth new
discoveries, but are placing them on a solid footing. Progress in wide-field sky surveys, interferometric
imaging, precision cosmology, exoplanet detection and characterization, and many subfields
of stellar, Galactic and extragalactic astronomy, has resulted in complex data analysis challenges
that must be solved to perform scientific inference. Research in astrostatistics and astroinformatics
will be necessary to develop the state-of-the-art methodology needed in astronomy. Overcoming
these challenges requires dedicated, interdisciplinary research. We recommend: (1) increasing
funding for interdisciplinary projects in astrostatistics and astroinformatics; (2) dedicating
space and time at conferences for interdisciplinary research and promotion; (3) developing sustainable
funding for long-term astrostatisics appointments; and (4) funding infrastructure development
for data archives and archive support, state-of-the-art algorithms, and efficient computing.
