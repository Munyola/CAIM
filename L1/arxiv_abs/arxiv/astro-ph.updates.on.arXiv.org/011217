The SPARC sample consists of 175 nearby galaxies with modern surface photometry at $3.6\,\mu m$
and high quality rotation curves. The sample has been constructed to span very wide ranges in surface
brightness, luminosity, rotation velocity and Hubble type, thereby forming a representative
sample on galaxies in the nearby Universe. To date, the SPARC sample is the largest collection of
galaxies with both high-quality rotation curves and NIR surface photometry. The neo-MOND model
used here to analyse the SPARC sample recognizably conforms to the general pattern of the classical
MOND algorithm, with the primary difference that, whereas the classical MOND model is purely phenomonological,
the neo-MOND model is a special case of a general theory motivated by the ideas of Leibniz and Mach
(not discussed here). The consequent results can be broadly summarized by the statement that dynamical
mass (computed from neo-MOND fits to SPARC rotation curves) tracks photometric mass (estimated
from SPARC surface photometry) with high fidelity in a statistically perfect way. Finally, it is
shown that a generalized baryonic Tully-Fisher relation arises directly from the neo-MOND model
itself, whilst the classical relation and Freeman's Law arise together in a highly related fashion
via a special case of the model. We are able to show that rotation curves conforming to the requirements
of this special case are plentiful in three large additional samples comprising $\approx 2400$
rotation curves in total and are proportionately present in the much smaller SPARC sample.
