The fundamental plane of black hole activity is an empirical relationship between the OIII/X-ray
luminosity depicting the accretion power, the radio luminosity as a probe of the instantaneous
jet power and the mass of the black hole. For the first time, we use the 1.4 GHz FIRST radio luminosities
on the optical fundamental plane, to investigate whether or not FIRST fluxes can trace nuclear activity.
We use a SDSS-FIRST cross-correlated sample of 10149 active galaxies and analyse their positioning
on the optical fundamental plane. We focus on various reasons that can cause the discrepancy between
the observed FIRST radio fluxes and the theoretically expected core radio fluxes, and show that
that FIRST fluxes are heavily contaminated by non-nuclear, extended components and other environmental
factors. We show that the subsample of 'compact sources', which should have negligible lobe contribution,
statistically follow the fundamental plane when corrected for relativistic beaming, while all
the other sources lie above the plane. The sample of LINERs, which should have negligible lobe and
beaming contribution, also follow the fundamental plane. A combined fit of the low-luminosity
AGN and the X-ray binaries, with the LINERs, results in the relation log L$_R$ = 0.77 log L$_{OIII}$
+ 0.69 log M. Assuming that the original fundamental plane relation is correct, we conclude that
1.4 GHz FIRST fluxes do not trace the pure 'core' jet and instantaneous nuclear activity in the AGN,
and one needs to be careful while using it on the fundamental plane of black hole activity.
