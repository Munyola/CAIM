We present new analytic theory and radiative transfer computations for the atomic to molecular
(HI-to-H2) transitions, and the build-up of atomic-hydrogen (HI) gas columns, in optically thick
interstellar clouds, irradiated by far-ultraviolet photodissociating radiation fields. We
derive analytic expressions for the total HI column densities for (1D) planar slabs, for beamed
or isotropic radiation fields, from the weak- to strong-field limits, for gradual or sharp atomic
to molecular transitions, and for arbitrary metallicity. Our expressions may be used to evaluate
the HI column densities as functions of the radiation field intensity and the H2-dust-limited dissociation
flux, the hydrogen gas density, and the metallicity-dependent H2 formation rate-coefficient
and far-UV dust-grain absorption cross-section. We make the distinction between "HI-dust" and
"H2-dust" opacity, and we present computations for the "universal H2-dust-limited effective
dissociation bandwidth". We validate our analytic formulae with Meudon PDR code computations
for the HI-to-H2 density profiles, and total HI column densities. We show that our general 1D formulae
predict HI columns and H2 mass fractions that are essentially identical to those found in more complicated
(and approximate) spherical (shell/core) models. We apply our theory to compute H2 mass fractions
and star-formation thresholds for individual clouds in self-regulated galaxy disks, for a wide
range of metallicities. Our formulae for the HI columns and H2 mass fractions may be incorporated
into hydrodynamics simulations for galaxy evolution.
