Supermassive stars (SMSs) with mass $\sim10^{5}~\rm{M}_{\odot}$ are promising candidates for
the origin of supermassive black holes observed at redshift $\gtrsim6$. They are supposed to form
as a result of rapid accretion of primordial gas, although it can be obstructed by the time variation
caused by circum-stellar disc fragmentation due to gravitational instability. To assess the occurrence
of fragmentation, we study the structure of marginally gravitationally unstable accretion discs,
by using a steady one-dimensional thin disc model with detailed treatment of chemical and thermal
processes. Motivated by two SMS formation scenarios, i.e., those with strong ultraviolet radiation
background or with large velocity difference between the baryon and the dark matter, we consider
two types of flows, i.e., atomic and molecular flows, respectively, for a wide range of the central
stellar mass $10-10^5~\rm{M}_{\odot}$ and the accretion rate $10^{-3}-1~\rm{M}_{\odot}~\rm{yr}^{-1}$.
In the case of a mostly atomic gas flowing to the disc outer boundary, the fragmentation condition
is expressed as the accretion rate being higher than the critical value of $10^{-1}~\rm{M}_{\odot}~\rm{yr}^{-1}$
regardless of the central stellar mass. On the other hand, in the case of molecular flows, there is
a critical disc radius outside of which the disc becomes unstable. Those conditions appears to be
marginally satisfied according to numerical simulations, suggesting that disc fragmentation
can be common during SMS formation.
