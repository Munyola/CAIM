We present Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) observations of the CO (2$-$1) line emission towards
three far-infrared luminous quasars at $z\sim6$: SDSS J231038.88$+$185519.7 and SDSS J012958.51$-$003539.7
with $\sim0\farcs6$ resolution and SDSS J205406.42$-$000514.8 with $\sim2\farcs1$ resolution.
All three sources are detected in the CO (2$-$1) line emission -- one source is marginally resolved,
and the other two appear as point sources. Measurements of the CO (2$-$1) line emission allow us to
calculate the molecular gas mass even without a CO excitation model. The inferred molecular gas
masses are (0.8$-$4.3) $\times$ 10$^{10}$ $M_{\odot}$. The widths and redshifts derived from
the CO (2$-$1) line are consistent with previous CO (6$-$5) and [\ion{C}{2}] measurements. We also
report continuum measurements using the Herschel for SDSS J231038.88$+$185519.7 and SDSS J012958.51$-$003539.7,
and for SDSS J231038.88+185519.7, data obtained at $\sim140$ and $\sim300$ GHz using the Atacama
Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). In the case of SDSS J231038.88+185519.7, we present
a detailed analysis of the spectral energy distribution and derive the dust temperature ($\sim40$
K), the dust mass ($\sim10^{9}$ $M_{\odot}$), the far-infrared luminosity (8$-$1000 $\mu$m;
$\sim10^{13}$ $ L_{\odot}$) and the star formation rate (2400$-$2700 $M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$).
Finally, an analysis of the photo-dissociation regions associated with the three high redshift
quasars indicates that the interstellar medium in these sources has similar properties to local
starburst galaxies.
