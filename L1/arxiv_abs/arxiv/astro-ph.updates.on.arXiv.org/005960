We present a continuum radiative transfer model grid for fitting observed spectral energy distributions
(SEDs) of massive protostars. The model grid is based on the paradigm of core accretion theory for
massive star formation with pre-assembled gravitationally-bound cores as initial conditions.
In particular, following the Turbulent Core Model, initial core properties are set primarily by
their mass and the pressure of their ambient clump. We then model the evolution of the protostar and
its surround structures in a self-consistent way. The model grid contains about 9000 SEDs with 4
free parameters: initial core mass, the mean surface density of the environment, the protostellar
mass, and the inclination. The model grid is used to fit observed SEDs via chi^2 minimization, with
the foreground extinction additionally estimated. We demonstrate the fitting process and results
using the example of massive protostar G35.20- 0.74. Compared with other SED model grids currently
used for massive star formation studies, in our model grid, the properties of the protostar and its
surrounding structures are more physically connected, which reduces the dimensionality of the
parameter spaces and the total number of models. This excludes possible fitting of models that are
physically unrealistic or that are not internally self-consistent in the context of the Turbulent
Core Model. Thus, this model grid serves not only as a fitting tool to estimate properties of massive
protostars, but also as a test of core accretion theory. The SED model grid is publicly released with
this paper.
