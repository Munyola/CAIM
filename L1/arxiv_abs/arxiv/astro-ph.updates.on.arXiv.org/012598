Space-based direct imaging missions (HabEx, LUVOIR) would observe reflected light from exoplanets
in the habitable zones of Sun-like stars. The ultimate---but not sole---goal of these concept missions
is to characterize such planets. Knowing an exoplanet's orbit would help two-fold: (i) its semi-major
axis informs whether the planet might harbour surface liquid water, making it a priority target;
and (ii) predicting the planet's future location would tell us where and when to look. The science
yields of HabEx and LUVOIR depend on the number, cadence, and precision of observations required
to establish a planet's orbit. We produce mock observations using realistic distributions for
the six Keplerian orbital parameters, experimenting with both Beta and uniform eccentricity distributions,
and accounting for imperfect astrometry ($\sigma$ = 3.5 mas) and obscuration due to the inner working
angle of a high-contrast imaging system (IWA = 31 mas). Using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods, we
fit the orbital parameters, and retrieve their average precisions and accuracies as functions
of cadence, number of epochs, and distance to target. Given the time at which it was acquired, each
image provides two data: the $x$ and $y$ position of the planet with respect to its star. Parameter
retrieval based on one or two images is formally under-constrained; yet the semi-major axis posterior
can be obtained semi-analytically. For a planet at 1 AU around a star at a distance of 10 pc, three epochs
constrain the semi-major axis to within $\lesssim$5\%, if each image is taken at least 90 days apart.
