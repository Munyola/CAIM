We present detailed analyses of oxygen K absorption in the interstellar medium (ISM) using four
high-resolution Chandra spectra towards the X-ray low-mass binary XTE J1817-330. The 11-25 A broadband
is described with a simple absorption model that takes into account the pileup effect and results
in an estimate of the hydrogen column density. The oxygen K-edge region (21-25 A) is fitted with the
physical warmabs model, which is based on a photoionization model grid generated with the xstar
code with the most up-to-date atomic database. This approach allows a benchmark of the atomic data
which involves wavelength shifts of both the K lines and photoionization cross sections in order
to fit the observed spectra accurately. As a result we obtain: a column density of N(H)=1.38+/-0.01\times
10^21 cm^-2; ionization parameter of log(xi)=-2.70+/-0.023; oxygen abundance of A(O)= 0.689^{+0.015}_{-0.010};
and ionization fractions of OI/O = 0.911, OII/O = 0.077, and OIII/O = 0.012 that are in good agreement
with previous studies. Since the oxygen abundance in warmabs is given relative to the solar standard
of Grevesse et al. (1998), a rescaling with the revision by Asplund et al. (2009) yields A(O)=0.952^{+0.020}_{-0.013},
a value close to solar that reinforces the new standard. We identify several atomic absorption lines
Kalpha, Kbeta, and Kgamma in OI and OII; and Kalpha in OIII, OVI, and OVII - last two probably residing
in the neighborhood of the source rather than in the ISM. This is the first firm detection of oxygen
K resonances with principal quantum numbers n>2 associated to ISM cold absorption.
