The Habitable Exoplanet Imaging Mission (HabEx) concept requires an optical coronagraph that
provides deep starlight suppression over a broad spectral bandwidth, high throughput for point
sources at small angular separation, and insensitivity to temporally-varying, low-order aberrations.
Vortex coronagraphs are a promising solution that perform optimally on off-axis, monolithic telescopes
and may also be designed for segmented telescopes with minor losses in performance. We describe
the key advantages of vortex coronagraphs on off-axis telescopes: 1) Unwanted diffraction due
to aberrations is passively rejected in several low-order Zernike modes relaxing the wavefront
stability requirements for imaging Earth-like planets from <10 to >100 pm rms. 2) Stars with angular
diameters >0.1 $\lambda/D$ may be sufficiently suppressed. 3) The absolute planet throughput
is >10%, even for unfavorable telescope architectures. 4) Broadband solutions ($\Delta\lambda/\lambda>0.1$)
are readily available for both monolithic and segmented apertures. The latter make use of grayscale
apodizers in an upstream pupil plane to provide suppression of diffracted light from amplitude
discontinuities in the telescope pupil without inducing additional stroke on the deformable mirrors.
We set wavefront stability requirements on the telescope, based on a stellar irradiance threshold
set at an angular separation of 3$\pm$0.5 $\lambda/D$ from the star, and discuss how some requirements
may be relaxed by trading robustness to aberrations for planet throughput.
