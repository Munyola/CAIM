In our quest to identify the progenitors of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), we first update the nucleosynthesis
yields both for Chandrasekhar (Ch) and sub-Ch mass white dwarfs (WDs), for a wide range of metallicity,
with our two-dimensional hydrodynamical code and the latest nuclear reaction rates. We then include
the yields in our galactic chemical evolution code to predict the evolution of elemental abundances
in the solar neighborhood and dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxies. In the observations of the solar
neighborhood stars, Mn shows an opposite trend to alpha elements, showing an increase toward higher
metallicities, which is very well reproduced by deflagration-detonation transition of Ch-mass
WDs, but never by double detonations of sub-Ch-mass WDs alone. The problem of Ch-mass SNe Ia was the
Ni over-production at high metallicities. However, we found that Ni yields of Ch-mass SNe Ia are
much lower with the solar-scaled initial composition than in previous works, which keeps the predicted
Ni abundance within the observational scatter. From the evolutionary trends of elemental abundances
in the solar neighborhood, we conclude that the contribution of sub-Ch-mass SNe Ia is up to 25%. In
dSph galaxies, however, the contribution of sub-Ch-mass SNe Ia seems to be higher than in the solar
neighborhood. In dSphs, sub-Ch-mass SNe Ia cause a decrease of [(alpha, Cr, Mn, Ni)/Fe], while so-called
SNe Iax can increase Mn and Ni abundances if they are pure deflagrations. Future observations of
dSph stars will provide more stringent constraints on the progenitor systems and explosion mechanism
of SNe Ia.
