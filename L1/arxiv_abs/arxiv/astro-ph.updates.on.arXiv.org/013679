We investigate how the stellar and gas-phase He abundances evolve as functions of time within three
simulated star-forming disc galaxies, characterised by different star formation histories.
We make use of a cosmological chemodynamical simulation for galaxy formation and evolution, which
includes star formation, as well as energy and chemical enrichment feedback from asymptotic giant
branch stars, core-collapse supernovae, and Type Ia supernovae. The predicted relations between
the He mass fraction, $Y$, and the metallicity, $Z$, in the interstellar medium of our simulated
disc galaxies depend on the past galaxy star formation history. In particular, we find that $dY/dZ$
is not constant and evolves as a function of time, depending on the specific chemical element that
we choose to trace $Z$, with $dY/dX_{\text{O}}$ and $dY/dX_{\text{C}}$ increasing as functions
of time, and $dY/dX_{\text{N}}$ decreasing as a function of time. Interestingly, $dY/dX_{\text{C+N}}$
evolves very weakly, being always in the range $\approx[6.4,6.6]$. We predict negative radial
gradients for the gas-phase He abundances in our simulated disc galaxies, due to the galaxy inside-out
growth as a function of time, which gives rise to longer chemical enrichment time scales in the outer
galaxy regions, where we find lower average values for $Y$ and $Z$. In order to calibrate the $Y$-$Z$
relation to assume in stellar models, we conclude that C, N, and C+N are better proxies for the metallicity
than O, because they show steeper and less scattered relations in the interstellar medium at any
epoch of the galaxy evolution.
