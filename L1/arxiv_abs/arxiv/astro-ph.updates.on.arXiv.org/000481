The effective interactions of dark matter with photons are fairly restricted. Yet both direct detection
as well as monochromatic gamma ray signatures depend sensitively on the presence of such interactions.
For a Dirac fermion, electromagnetic dipoles are possible, but are very constrained. For Majorana
fermions, no such terms are allowed. We consider signals of an effective theory with a Majorana dark
matter particle and its couplings to photons. In the presence of a nearby excited state, there is
the possibility of a magnetic dipole transition (Magnetic inelastic Dark Matter or MiDM), which
yields both direct and indirect detection signals, and, intriguingly, yields essentially the
same size over a wide range of dipole strengths. Absent an excited state, the leading interaction
of WIMPs is similar to the Rayleigh scattering of low energy photons from neutral atoms, which may
be captured by an effective operator of dimension 7 of the form $\bar{\chi}\chi F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu}$.
While it can be thought of as a phase of the Magnetic inelastic Dark Matter scenario where the excited
state is much heavier than the ground state, it can arise from other theories as well. We study the
resulting phenomenology of this scenario: gamma ray lines from the annihilation of WIMPs; nuclear
recoils in direct detection; and direct production of the WIMP pair in high-energy colliders. Considering
recent evidence in particular for a 130 GeV line from the galactic center, we discuss the detection
prospects at upcoming experiments.
