X-ray and Gamma-ray polarization measurements of the prompt emission of Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs)
are believed to be an important tool to test the various models of GRBs. Although there are some reports
of hard X-ray polarization measurements of the prompt emission of GRBs, the number of measurements
are small to provide statistically significant inputs to the GRB models due to the extreme difficulty
of measuring them and quantifying their significance. CZTI onboard AstroSat is primarily an X-ray
spectroscopic instrument but works as a wide angle GRB monitor due to the increasing transparency
of the CZTI support structure. It also has experimentally verified polar- ization measurement
capability in the 100 - 300 keV energy range and thus provides a unique opportunity to attempt spectro-polarimetric
studies of GRBs. Here we present the polarization data for the brightest 11 GRBs detected by CZTI
during the first year of operation. Most of the GRBs show clear polarization signatures with more
than 3 sigma detection significance for 4 GRBs and ~2.5 sigma significance for another 3 GRBs. We
could place meaningful upper limits for the remaining 4 GRBs. We provide the details of the various
tests performed to validate the polarization measurements. While it is difficult to differentiate
the various emission models with the current sample of polarization measurements, CZTI in its minimum
lifetime of five years is expected to provide a large sample of polarization measurements which
would lead to a better understanding of the prompt emission.
