The high-precision data available from the Kepler satellite allows us to venture in the study of
the complex outer convective envelopes of solar-type stars. We use a seismic diagnostic, specialized
for investigating the outer layers of solar-type stars, to infer the impact of the ionization processes
on the oscillation spectrum, for a sample of Kepler stars. These stars, of spectral type F, cover
all of the observational seismic domain of the acoustic oscillation spectrum in solar-type stars.
They also cover the range between a cool F-dwarf (\sim 6000 K) and a hotter F-star (\sim 6400 K). Our
study reveals the existence of two relevant ionization regions. One of these regions, which is located
closer to the surface of the star, is commonly associated with the second ionization of helium, although
other chemical species also contribute to ionization. The second region, located deeper in the
envelope, is linked with the ionization of heavy elements. Specifically, in this study, we analyze
the elements carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, neon, and iron. Both regions can be related to the K electronic
shell. We show that, while for cooler stars like the Sun, the influence of this second region on the
oscillation frequencies is small; in hotter stars, its influence becomes comparable to the influence
of the region of the second ionization of helium. This can guide us in the study of the outer layers
of F-stars, specifically with the understanding of phenomena related to rotation and magnetic
activity in these stars.
