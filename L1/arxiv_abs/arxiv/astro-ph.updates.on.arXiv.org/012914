With the recent data from the first year of the Dark Energy Survey (DES Y1), we attempt to probe whether
there is new physics beyond the standard cosmology and to reconcile the $\sigma_8$ tension between
the DES Y1 and Planck datasets in four alternative cosmological models. Combining the galaxy clustering
and weak gravitational lensing data from the DES Y1 with other cosmological observations including
cosmic microwave background radiation, baryon acoustic oscillations, Type Ia supernovae (SNe
Ia) and Planck lensing, we find that: (i) For the running scalar spectral index model, we obtain a
positive running $n_{run}=0.0208\pm 0.0070$ at the $1\sigma$ confidence level, which is approximately
$3\sigma$ larger than zero running from the prediction of standard cosmology; (ii) For the interacting
dark energy model, we have an updated constraint on the modified matter expansion rate $\epsilon=-0.00004\pm
0.00031$, which indicates that there is no hint of interaction between dark matter and dark energy
in the dark sector of the universe; (iii) For the viscous dark energy model, up to now, the strictest
constraint on the bulk viscosity coefficient $\eta<0.00152$ at the $2\sigma$ confidence level
is obtained; (iv) For the dynamical dark energy model, our constraint on the typical parameter $\beta=-0.04\pm0.12$
implies that there is still no evidence of dynamical dark energy. Meanwhile, we find the $\sigma_8$
tension can be effectively alleviated in the above four alternatives by constraining them with
the DES Y1 and Planck datasets separately.
