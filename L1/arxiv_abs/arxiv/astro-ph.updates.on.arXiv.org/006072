The planetary nebula (PN) PB 8 around a [WN/WC]-hybrid central star is one of PNe with moderate abundance
discrepancy factors (ADFs ~ 2-3), which could be an indication of a tiny fraction of metal-rich inclusions
embedded in the nebula (bi-abundance). In this work, we have constructed photoionization models
to reproduce the optical and infrared observations of the PN PB 8 using a non-LTE stellar model atmosphere
ionizing source. A chemically homogeneous model initially used cannot predict the optical recombination
lines (ORLs). However, a bi-abundance model provides a better fit to most of the observed ORLs from
N and O ions. The metal-rich inclusions in the bi-abundance model occupy 5.6 percent of the total
volume of the nebula, and are roughly 1.7 times cooler and denser than the mean values of the surrounding
nebula. The N/H and O/H abundance ratios in the metal-rich inclusions are ~ 1.0 and 1.7 dex larger
than the diffuse warm nebula, respectively. To reproduce the Spitzer spectral energy distribution
of PB 8, dust grains with a dust-to-gas ratio of 0.01 (by mass) were also included. It is found that
the presence of metal-rich inclusions can explain the heavy element ORLs, while a dual-dust chemistry
with different grain species and discrete grain sizes likely produces the infrared continuum of
this PN. This study demonstrates that the bi-abundance hypothesis, which was examined in a few PNe
with large abundance discrepancies (ADFs > 10), could also be applied to those typical PNe with moderate
abundance discrepancies.
