Global extreme ultraviolet (EUV) waves are spectacular traveling disturbances in the solar corona
associated with energetic eruptions such as coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and flares. Over the
past 15 years, observations from three generations of space-borne EUV telescopes have shaped our
understanding of this phenomenon and at the same time led to controversy about its physical nature.
Since its launch in 2010, the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory
(SDO) has observed more than 210 global EUV waves in exquisite detail, thanks to its high spatio-temporal
resolution and full-disk, wide-temperature coverage. A combination of statistical analysis
of this large sample, 30 some detailed case studies, and data-driven MHD modeling, has been leading
their physical interpretations to a convergence, favoring a bimodal composition of an outer, fast-mode
magnetosonic wave component and an inner, non-wave CME component. Adding to this multifaceted
picture, AIA has also discovered new EUV wave and wave-like phenomena associated with various eruptions,
including quasi-periodic fast propagating (QFP) wave trains, magnetic Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities
(KHI) in the corona and associated nonlinear waves, and a variety of mini EUV waves. Seismological
applications using such waves are now being actively pursued, especially for the global corona.
We review such advances in EUV wave research focusing on recent SDO/AIA observations, their seismological
applications, related data analysis techniques, and numerical and analytical models.
