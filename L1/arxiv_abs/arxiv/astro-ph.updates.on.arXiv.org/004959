This paper is concerned with algorithms for calibration of direction dependent effects (DDE) in
aperture synthesis radio telescopes (ASRT). After correction of Direction Independent Effects
(DIE) using self-calibration, imaging performance can be limited by the imprecise knowledge of
the forward gain of the elements in the array. In general, the forward gain pattern is directionally
dependent and varies with time due to a number of reasons. Some factors, such as rotation of the primary
beam with Parallactic Angle for Azimuth-Elevation mount antennas are known a priori. Some, such
as antenna pointing errors and structural deformation/projection effects for aperture-array
elements cannot be measured {\em a priori}. Thus, in addition to algorithms to correct for DD effects
known a priori, algorithms to solve for DD gains are required for high dynamic range imaging. Here,
we discuss a mathematical framework for antenna-based DDE calibration algorithms and show that
this framework leads to computationally efficient optimal algorithms which scale well in a parallel
computing environment. As an example of an antenna-based DD calibration algorithm, we demonstrate
the Pointing SelfCal algorithm to solve for the antenna pointing errors. Our analysis show that
the sensitivity of modern ASRT is sufficient to solve for antenna pointing errors and other DD effects.
We also discuss the use of the Pointing SelfCal algorithm in real-time calibration systems and extensions
for antenna Shape SelfCal algorithm for real-time tracking and corrections for pointing offsets
and changes in antenna shape.
