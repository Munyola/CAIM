We investigate the abiotic production of oxygen and its photochemical byproduct ozone through
water vapor photolysis in moist atmospheres of temperate terrestrial exoplanets. The amount of
water vapor available for photolysis in the middle atmosphere of a planet can be limited by an atmospheric
cold-trap, the formation of which largely depends on the amount of non-condensable gases. We study
this effect using a photochemical model coupled to a 1D radiative-convective equilibrium model
in atmospheres with N2, CO2 and H2O as the main constituents. We find that in atmospheres with a low
N2 inventory, water vapor mixing ratios in the middle atmosphere can be over two orders of magnitude
higher compared to atmospheres with an Earth-like N2 inventory. Without a strong surface sink,
the non-condensable oxygen can build up rapidly, drying out the upper atmosphere. With a moderate
surface sink, the planet can approach a steady state with significant oxygen mixing ratios in which
oxygen production is balanced by surface uptake. We use a radiative transfer model to study the spectroscopic
fingerprint of these atmospheres in transit observations. Spectral signatures of abiotic oxygen
and ozone can be of comparable magnitude as in spectra of Earth seen as an exoplanet. Middle atmospheric
water vapor is unlikely to be a usable indicator of the abiotic origin of oxygen because of the influence
of oxygen on the water vapor distribution. This suggests that atmospheric oxygen and ozone cannot
be used as binary bioindicators and their interpretation will likely require atmospheric and planetary
models.
