Exoplanets sufficiently close to their host star can in principle couple electrodynamically to
the star. This process is known as electrodynamic star-planet interaction (SPI). The expected
emission associated with this coupling is however difficult to observe due to the bright intrinsic
stellar emission. Identification of time-variability in the stellar lightcurve is one of the most
promising approaches to identify SPI. In this work we therefore systematically investigate various
mechanisms and their associated periods, which generate time-variability to aid the search for
SPI. We find that the synodic and half the synodic rotation periods of the stars as measured in the
rest frames of the orbiting exoplanets are basic periods occurring in SPI. We apply our findings
to the example of TRAPPIST-1 with its seven close-in planets for which we investigate the possibility
of SPI and the associated time-variabilities. We show that especially TRAPPIST-1b and c, are very
likely subject to sub-Alfv\'{e}nic interaction, a necessary condition for SPI. Both planets are
therefore expected to generate Alfv\'{e}n wings, which can couple to the star. The associated Poynting
fluxes are on the order of $10^{11}$ to $10^{15}$ W and thus can hardly be the direct source of currently
observable time-variability from TRAPPIST-1. However these Poynting fluxes might trigger flares
on the star. We find correlations between the observed flares and the expected planetary induced
signals, which could be due to SPI but our findings are not conclusive and warrant further observations
and modelling.
