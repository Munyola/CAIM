Many recent models consider the structure of individual interstellar medium (ISM) clouds as a way
to explain observations of large parts of galaxies. To compare such models to observations, one
must understand how to translate between surface densities observed averaging over large (~kpc)
scales and surface densities on the scale of individual clouds (~pc scale), which are treated by
models. We define a "clumping factor" that captures this translation as the ratio of the mass-weighted
surface density, which is often the quantity of physical interest, to the area-weighted surface
density, which is observed. We use high spatial resolution (sub-kpc) maps of CO and HI emission from
nearby galaxies to measure the clumping factor of both atomic and molecular gas. The molecular and
atomic ISM exhibit dramatically different degrees of clumping. As a result, the ratio H2/HI measured
at ~kpc resolution cannot be trivially interpreted as a cloud-scale ratio of surface densities.
HI emission appears very smooth, with a clumping factor of only ~1.3. Based on the scarce and heterogeneous
high resolution data available, CO emission is far more clumped with a widely variable clumping
factor, median ~7 for our heterogeneous data. Our measurements do not provide evidence for a universal
mass-weighted surface density of molecular gas, but also cannot conclusively rule out such a scenario.
We suggest that a more sophisticated treatment of molecular ISM structure, one informed by high
spatial resolution CO maps, is needed to link cloud-scale models to kpc-scale observations of galaxies.
