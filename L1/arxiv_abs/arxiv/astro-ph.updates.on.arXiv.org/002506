Due to their long mean free path, X-rays are expected to have an important impact on cosmic reionization
by heating and ionizing the IGM on large scales, especially after simulations have suggested that
Population III stars may form in pairs at redshifts as high as 20 - 30. We use the Pop III distribution
and evolution from a self-consistent cosmological radiation hydrodynamics simulation of the
formation of the first galaxies and a simple Pop III X-ray binaries model to estimate their X-ray
output in a high density region larger than 100 comoving (Mpc)$^3$. We then combine three different
methods --- ray tracing, a one-zone model, and X-ray background modeling --- to investigate the
X-ray propagation, intensity distribution, and long term effects on the IGM thermal and ionization
state. The efficiency and morphology of photo-heating and photo-ionization are dependent on the
photon energies. The sub-keV X-rays only impact the IGM near the sources while the keV photons contribute
significantly to the X-ray background and heat and ionize the IGM smoothly. The X-rays just below
1 keV are most efficient in heating and ionizing the IGM. We find that the IGM might be heated to over
100 K by $z=10$ and the high density source region might reach 10$^4$ K, limited by atomic hydrogen
cooling. This may be important for predicting the 21-cm neutral hydrogen signals. But, on the other
hand, the free electrons from X-ray ionizations are not enough to contribute significantly to the
optical depth of CMB to the Thomson scattering.
