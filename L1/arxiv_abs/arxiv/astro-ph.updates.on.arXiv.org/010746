We present new measurements of the quasar luminosity function (LF) at $z \sim 6$, over an unprecedentedly
wide range of the rest-frame ultraviolet luminosity $M_{1450}$ from $-30$ to $-22$ mag. This is
the fifth in a series of publications from the Subaru High-$z$ Exploration of Low-Luminosity Quasars
(SHELLQs) project, which exploits the deep multi-band imaging data produced by the Hyper Suprime-Cam
(HSC) Subaru Strategic Program survey. The LF was calculated with a complete sample of 110 quasars
at $5.7 \le z \le 6.5$, which includes 48 SHELLQs quasars discovered over 650 deg$^2$, and 63 brighter
quasars discovered by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and the Canada-France-Hawaii Quasar Survey
(including one overlapping object). This is the largest sample of $z \sim 6$ quasars with a well-defined
selection function constructed to date, and has allowed us to detect significant flattening of
the LF at its faint end. A double power-law function fit to the sample yields a faint-end slope $\alpha
= -1.23^{+0.44}_{-0.34}$, a bright-end slope $\beta = -2.73^{+0.23}_{-0.31}$, a break magnitude
$M_{1450}^* = -24.90^{+0.75}_{-0.90}$, and a characteristic space density $\Phi^* = 10.9^{+10.0}_{-6.8}$
Gpc$^{-3}$ mag$^{-1}$. Integrating this best-fit model over the range $-18 < M_{1450} < -30$ mag,
quasars emit ionizing photons at the rate of $\dot{n}_{\rm ion} = 10^{48.8 \pm 0.1}$ s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-3}$
at $z = 6.0$. This is less than 10 % of the critical rate necessary to keep the intergalactic medium
ionized, which indicates that quasars are not a major contributor to cosmic reionization.
