To probe the initial conditions for high-mass star and cluster formation, we investigate the properties
of dense filaments within the infrared dark cloud G035.39-00.33 (IRDC G035.39) in a combined Very
Large Array (VLA) and the Green Bank Telescope (GBT) mosaic tracing the NH3 (1,1) and (2,2) emission
down to 0.08 pc scales. Using agglomerative hierarchical clustering on multiple line-of-sight
velocity component fitting results, we identify seven extended velocity-coherent components
in our data, likely representing spatially coherent physical structures, some exhibiting complex
gas motions. The velocity gradient magnitude distribution peaks at its mode of 0.35 km/s/pc and
has a long tail extending into higher values of 1.5 - 2 km/s/pc, and is generally consistent with those
found toward the same cloud in other molecular tracers and with the values found towards nearby low-mass
dense cloud cores at the same scales. Contrary to observational and theoretical expectations,
we find the non-thermal ammonia line widths to be systematically narrower (by about 20%) than those
of N2H+ (1-0) line transition observed with similar resolution. If the observed ordered velocity
gradients represent the core envelope solid-body rotation, we estimate the specific angular momentum
to be about 2 x 10^21 cm^2/s, similar to the low-mass star-forming cores. Together with the previous
finding of subsonic motions in G035.39, our results demonstrate high levels of similarity between
kinematics of a high-mass star-forming IRDC and the low-mass star formation regime.
