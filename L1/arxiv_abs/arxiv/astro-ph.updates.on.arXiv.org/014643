We present a detailed multi-wavelength characterization of the multi-ring disk of HD 169142. We
report new ALMA observations at 3 mm and analyze them together with archival 0.89 and 1.3 mm data.
Our observations resolve three out of the four rings in the disk previously seen in high-resolution
ALMA data. A simple parametric model is used to estimate the radial profile of the dust optical depth,
temperature, density, and particle size distribution. We find that the multiple ring features
of the disk are produced by annular accumulations of large particles, probably associated with
gas pressure bumps. Our model indicates that the maximum dust grain size in the rings is $\sim1$ cm,
with slightly flatter power-law size distributions than the ISM-like size distribution ($p\sim3.5$)
found in the gaps. In particular, the inner ring ($\sim26$ au) is associated with a strong and narrow
buildup of dust particles that could harbor the necessary conditions to trigger the streaming instability.
According to our analysis, the snowlines of the most important volatiles do not coincide with the
observed substructures. We explore different ring formation mechanisms and find that planet-disk
interactions are the most likely scenario to explain the main features of HD 169142. Overall, our
multi-wavelength analysis provides some of the first unambiguous evidence of the presence of radial
dust traps in the rings of HD 169142. A similar analysis in a larger sample of disks could provide key
insights on the impact that disk substructures have on the dust evolution and planet formation processes.
