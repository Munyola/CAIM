The transport of charged energetic particles in the presence of strong intermittent heliospheric
turbulence is computationally analyzed based on known properties of the interplanetary magnetic
field and solar wind plasma at 1 Astronomical Unit (AU). The turbulence is assumed to be static, composite,
and quasi-three-dimensional with a varying energy distribution between a one-dimensional Alfv\'enic
(slab) and a structured two-dimensional component. The spatial fluctuations of the turbulent
magnetic field are modeled either as homogeneous with a Gaussian probability distribution function
(PDF), or as intermittent on large and small scales with a q-Gaussian PDF. Simulations showed that
energetic particle diffusion coefficients both parallel and perpendicular to the background
magnetic field are significantly affected by intermittency in the turbulence. This effect is especially
strong for parallel transport where for large-scale intermittency results show an extended phase
of subdiffusive parallel transport during which cross-field transport diffusion dominates.
The effects of intermittency are found to depend on particle rigidity and the fraction of slab energy
in the turbulence, yielding a perpendicular to parallel mean free path ratio close to 1 for large-scale
intermittency. Investigation of higher order transport moments (kurtosis) indicates that non-Gaussian
statistical properties of the intermittent turbulent magnetic field are present in the parallel
transport, especially for low rigidity particles at all times.
