Due to our ignorance of the equation of state (EOS) beyond nuclear density, there is still no unique
theoretical model for neutron stars (NSs). It is therefore surprising that universal EOS-independent
relations connecting different physical quantities of neutron stars can exist. Lau et al. [ApJ,
714, 1234 (2010)] found that the frequency of the $f$-mode oscillation, the mass, and the moment
of inertia are connected by universal relations. More recently, Yagi and Yunes [Science, 341, 365
(2013)] discovered the I-Love-Q universal relations among the mass, the moment of inertia, the
Love number, and the quadrupole moment. In this paper, we study these universal relations in the
Eddington-inspired Born-Infeld (EiBI) gravity. This theory differs from general relativity
(GR) significantly only at high densities due to the nonlinear coupling between matter and gravity.
It thus provides us an ideal case to test how robust the universal relations of NSs are with respect
to the change of the gravity theory. Thanks to the apparent EOS formulation of EiBI gravity developed
recently by Delsate and Steinhoff [Phys. Rev. Lett., 109, 021101 (2012)], we are able to study the
universal relations in EiBI gravity using the same techniques as those in GR. We find that the universal
relations in EiBI gravity are essentially the same as those in GR. Our work shows that, within the
currently viable coupling constant, there exists at least one modified gravity theory that is indistinguishable
from GR in view of the unexpected universal relations.
