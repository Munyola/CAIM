The intrinsic strength of the Ly$\alpha$ line in young, star-forming systems makes it a special
tool for studying high-redshift galaxies. However, interpreting observations remains challenging
due to the complex radiative transfer involved. Here, we combine state-of-the-art hydrodynamical
simulations of 'Alth{\ae}a', a prototypical Lyman Break Galaxy (LBG, stellar mass $M_{\star}$$\simeq$
$10^{10}{\rm M}_{\odot})$ at $z=7.2$, with detailed radiative transfer computations of dust/continuum,
C[II] 158 $\mu$m, and Ly$\alpha$ to clarify the relation between the galaxy properties and its Ly$\alpha$
emission. Alth{\ae}a exhibits low ($f_\alpha< 1$\%) Ly$\alpha$ escape fractions and Equivalent
Widths, EW $\lesssim 6$ Angstrom for the simulated lines of sight, with a large scatter. The correlation
between escape fraction and inclination is weak, as a result of the rather chaotic structure of high-redshift
galaxies. Low $f_\alpha$ values persist even if we artificially remove neutral gas around star
forming regions to mimick the presence of HII regions. The high attenuation is primarily caused
by dust clumps co-located with young stellar clusters. We can turn Alth{\ae}a into a Lyman Alpha
Emitter (LAE) only if we artificially remove dust from the clumps, yielding EWs up to $22$ Angstrom.
Our study suggests that the LBG-LAE duty-cycle required by recent clustering measurements poses
the challenging problem of a dynamically changing dust attenuation. Finally, we find an anti-correlation
between the magnitude of Ly$\alpha$-C[II] line velocity shift and Ly$\alpha$ luminosity.
