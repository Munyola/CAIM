Fragmentation of spiral arms can drive the formation of giant clumps and induce intense star formation
in disc galaxies. Based on the spiral-arm instability analysis of our Paper I, we present linear
perturbation theory of dynamical instability of self-gravitating spiral arms of magnetised gas,
focusing on the effect of toroidal magnetic fields. Spiral arms can be destabilised by the toroidal
fields which cancel Coriolis force. We find that there can be two instability modes: magneto-Jeans
instability and oscillating growing mode. The latter is a necessary instability condition. Our
analysis can be applied to multi-component systems that consist of gas and stars. To test our analysis,
we perform ideal magneto-hydrodynamics simulations of isolated disc galaxies and examine the
simulation results. Our analysis can characterise dynamical instability leading arms to fragment
and to form clumps in cases of strong and weak magnetic fields. In moderate magnetic fields, however,
spiral arms are often stable in non-linear regimes and do not fragment although our linear analysis
predicts instability. Using our analytic model, we estimate a typical mass of clumps forming from
spiral-arm fragmentation to be consistent with observed giant clumps $\sim10^{7-8}~{\rm M_\odot}$.
Furthermore, we find that, although the magnetic destabilisation can cause low-density spiral
arms to fragment, the estimated mass of resultant clumps is almost independent from strength of
magnetic fields since marginal instability occurs at long wavelengths which compensate the low
densities of magnetically destabilised arms.
