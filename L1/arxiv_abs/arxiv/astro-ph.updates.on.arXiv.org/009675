Precise stellar ages from asteroseismology have become available and can help setting stronger
constraints on the evolution of the Galactic disc components. Recently, asteroseismology has
confirmed a clear age difference in the solar annulus between two distinct sequences in the [$\alpha$/Fe]
versus [Fe/H] abundance ratios relation: the high-$\alpha$ and low-$\alpha$ stellar populations.
We aim at reproducing these new data with chemical evolution models including different assumptions
for the history and number of accretion events. We tested two different approaches: a revised version
of the `two-infall' model where the high-$\alpha$ phase forms by a fast gas accretion episode and
the low-$\alpha$ sequence follows later from a slower gas infall rate, and the parallel formation
scenario where the two disc sequences form coevally and independently. The revised `two-infall'
model including uncertainties in age and metallicity is capable of reproducing: i) the [$\alpha$/Fe]
vs. [Fe/H] abundance relation at different Galactic epochs, ii) the age$-$metallicity relation
and the time evolution [$\alpha$/Fe]; iii) the age distribution of the high-$\alpha$ and low-$\alpha$
stellar populations, iv) the metallicity distribution function. The parallel approach is not
capable of properly reproduce the stellar age distribution, in particular at old ages. In conclusion,
the best chemical evolution model is the revised `two-infall' one, where a consistent delay of $\sim$4.3
Gyr in the beginning of the second gas accretion episode is a crucial assumption to reproduce stellar
abundances and ages.
