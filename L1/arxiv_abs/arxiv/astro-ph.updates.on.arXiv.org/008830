Tomographic wave-front reconstruction is the main computational bottleneck to realize real-time
correction for turbulence-induced wave-front aberrations in future laser-assisted tomographic
adaptive-optics (AO) systems for ground-based Giant Segmented Mirror Telescopes (GSMT), because
of its unprecedented number of degrees of freedom, $N$, i.e. the number of measurements from wave-front
sensors (WFS). In this paper, we provide an efficient implementation of the minimum-mean-square
error (MMSE) tomographic wave-front reconstruction mainly useful for some classes of AO systems
not requiring a multi-conjugation, such as laser-tomographic AO (LTAO), multi-object AO (MOAO)
and ground-layer AO (GLAO) systems, but also applicable to multi-conjugate AO (MCAO) systems.
This work expands that by R. Conan [ProcSPIE, 9148, 91480R (2014)] to the multi-wave-front, tomographic
case using natural and laser guide stars. The new implementation exploits the Toeplitz structure
of covariance matrices used in a MMSE reconstructor, which leads to an overall $O(N\log N)$ real-time
complexity compared to $O(N^2)$ of the original implementation using straight vector-matrix
multiplication. We show that the Toeplitz-based algorithm leads to 60\,nm rms wave-front error
improvement for the European Extremely Large Telescope Laser-Tomography AO system over a well-known
sparse-based tomographic reconstruction, but the number of iterations required for suitable
performance is still beyond what a real-time system can accommodate to keep up with the time-varying
turbulence
