We combine data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and the Galaxy Evolution Explorer to simultaneously
analyze optical spectra and ultraviolet photometry of 231643 galaxies with the STARLIGHT spectral
synthesis code using state-of-the-art stellar population models. We present a new method to estimate
GALEX photometry in the SDSS spectroscopic aperture, which proves quite reliable if applied to
large samples. In agreement with previous experiments with CALIFA, we find that adding UV constraints
leads to a moderate increase on the fraction of $\sim 10^7$ - $10^8$ yr populations and a concomitant
decrease of younger and older components, yielding slightly older luminosity weighted mean stellar
ages. These changes are most relevant in the low-mass end of the blue cloud. An increase in dust attenuation
is observed for galaxies dominated by young stars. We investigate the contribution of different
stellar populations to the fraction of light in GALEX and SDSS bands across the UV-optical color-magnitude
diagram. As an example application, we use this $\lambda$ dependence to highlight differences
between retired galaxies with and without emission lines. In agreement with an independent study
by Herpich et al., we find that the former show an excess of intermediate age populations when compared
to the later. Finally, we test the suitability of two different prescription for dust, finding that
our dataset is best fitted using the attenuation law of starburst galaxies. However, results for
the Milky Way extinction curve improve with decreasing $\tau_V$, especially for edge-on galaxies.
