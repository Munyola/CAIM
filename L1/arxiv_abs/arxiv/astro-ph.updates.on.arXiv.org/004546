Previous studies on the rotation of Sun-like stars revealed that the rotational rates of young stars
converge towards a well-defined evolution that follows a power-law decay. It seems, however, that
some binary stars do not obey this relation, often by displaying enhanced rotational rates and activity.
In the Solar Twin Planet Search program we observed several solar twin binaries, and found a multiplicity
fraction of $42\% \pm 6\%$ in the whole sample; moreover, at least three of these binaries (HIP 19911,
HIP 67620 and HIP 103983) clearly exhibit the aforementioned anomalies. We investigated the configuration
of the binaries in the program, and discovered new companions for HIP 6407, HIP 54582, HIP 62039 and
HIP 30037, of which the latter is orbited by a $0.06$ M$_\odot$ brown dwarf in a 1-month long orbit.
We report the orbital parameters of the systems with well-sampled orbits and, in addition, the lower
limits of parameters for the companions that only display a curvature in their radial velocities.
For the linear trend binaries, we report an estimate of the masses of their companions when their
observed separation is available, and a minimum mass otherwise. We conclude that solar twin binaries
with low-mass stellar companions at moderate orbital periods do not display signs of a distinct
rotational evolution when compared to single stars. We confirm that the three peculiar stars are
double-lined binaries, and that their companions are polluting their spectra, which explains
the observed anomalies.
