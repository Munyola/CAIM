We have performed an initial stage conceptual design study for the Deep Interior Scanning CubeSat
(DISCUS), a tandem 6U CubeSat carrying a bistatic radar as main payload. DISCUS will be operated
either as an independent mission or accompanying a larger one. It is designed to determine the internal
macroporosity of a 260-600 m diameter Near Earth Asteroid (NEA) from a few kilometers distance.
The main goal will be to achieve a global penetration with a low-frequency signal as well as to analyze
the scattering strength for various different penetration depths and measurement positions.
Moreover, the measurements will be inverted through a computed radar tomography (CRT) approach.
The scientific data provided by DISCUS would bring more knowledge of the internal configuration
of rubble pile asteroids and their collisional evolution in the Solar System. It would also advance
the design of future asteroid deflection concepts. We aim at a single-unit (1U) radar design equipped
with a half-wavelength dipole antenna. The radar will utilize a stepped-frequency modulation
technique the baseline of which was developed for ESA's technology projects GINGER and PIRA. The
radar measurements will be used for CRT and shape reconstruction. The CubeSat will also be equipped
with an optical camera system and laser altimeter to sup- port navigation and shape reconstruction.
We provide the details of the measurement methods to be applied along with the requirements derived
of the known characteristics of rubble pile asteroids.
