We select 947 star-forming galaxies from SDSS-DR7 with [O~{\sc iii}]$\lambda$4363 emission lines
detected at a signal-to-noise {ratio }larger than 5$\sigma$. Their electron temperatures and
direct oxygen abundances are {then }determined. {W}e compare the results from different methods.
$t_2${, the} electron temperature in {the }low ionization region{,} estimated from $t_3${, that}
in {the }high ionization region{,} {is} compared {using} three analysis relations between $t_2-t_3${.
These} show obvious differences, which result in some different ionic oxygen abundances. The results
of $t_3$, $t_2$, {$\rm O^{++}$/$\rm H^+$} and {$\rm O^{+}$/$\rm H^+$} derived by using methods
from IRAF and literature are also compared. The ionic abundances $\rm O^{++}$/$\rm H^+$ {are} higher
than $\rm O^{+}$/$\rm H^+$ for most cases. The{ different} oxygen abundances derived from $T_{\rm
e}$ and the strong-line ratios show {a }clear discrepancy, which is more obvious following increasing
stellar mass and strong-line ratio $R_{23}$. The sample{ of} galaxies from SDSS {with} detected
[O~{\sc iii}]$\lambda$4363 have lower metallicites and higher {star formation rates}, {so} they
may not be typical representatives of the whole{ population of} galaxies. Adopting data objects
from {Andrews \& Martini}, {Liang et al.} and {Lee et al.} data, we derive new relations of stellar
mass and metallicity for star-forming galaxies in a much wider stellar mass range: from $10^6\,M_\odot$
to $10^{11}\,M_\odot$.
