We analyzed V-band photometry of the Be star {\omega} CMa, obtained during the last four decades,
during which the star went through four complete cycles of disc formation and dissipation. The data
were simulated by hydrodynamic models based on a time-dependent implementation of the viscous
decretion disc (VDD) paradigm, in which a disc around a fast-spinning Be star is formed by material
ejected by the star and driven to progressively larger orbits by means of viscous torques. Our simulations
offer a good description of the photometric variability during phases of disc formation and dissipation,
which suggests that the VDD model adequately describes the structural evolution of the disc. Furthermore,
our analysis allowed us to determine the viscosity parameter {\alpha}, as well as the net mass and
angular momentum (AM) loss rates. We find that {\alpha} is variable, ranging from 0.1 to 1.0, not
only from cycle to cycle but also within a given cycle. Additionally, build-up phases usually have
larger values of {\alpha} than the dissipation phases. Furthermore, during dissipation the outward
AM flux is not necessarily zero, meaning that {\omega} CMa does not experience a true quiescence
but, instead, switches between a high to a low AM loss rate during which the disc quickly assumes an
overall lower density but never zero. We confront the average AM loss rate with predictions from
stellar evolution models for fast-rotating stars, and find that our measurements are smaller by
more than one order of magnitude.
