Bailey & Basu (2014) show analysis of density and mass-to-flux ratio maps for simulations with
either an ionisation profile which takes into account photoionisation (step-like profile) or
a cosmic ray only ionisation profile. We extend this study to analyse the effect of these ionisation
profiles on velocity structures, kinematics, and synthetic spectra. Clump regions are found to
occur at the convergence of two flows with a low velocity region and velocity direction transition
occurring at the junction. Models with evident substructure show that core formation occurs on
the periphery of these velocity valleys. Analysis of synthetic spectra reveals the presence of
large non-thermal components within low-density gas, especially for models with the step-like
ionisation profile. All cores show small, sub-thermal relative motions compared to background
gas. Large deviations within this analysis are due to the line of sight intersecting low- and high-density
regions across the velocity switch transition. Positive deviations correspond to a foreground
core moving away from the observer while negative deviations correspond to a background core moving
toward the observer. Comparison of velocities resulting from different ionisation profiles suggest
that high ionisation fractions yield supersonic velocities, up to two times the sound speed, while
regions with low ionisation fractions tend to be subsonic or mildly supersonic. This suggests that
the transition to coherence within cores could be a transition between high and low ionisation fractions
within the gas.
