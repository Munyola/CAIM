We describe the construction and characterization of the 280 GHz bolometric focal plane units (FPUs)
to be deployed on the second flight of the balloon-borne SPIDER instrument. These FPUs are vital
to SPIDER's primary science goal of detecting or placing an upper limit on the amplitude of the primordial
gravitational wave signature in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) by constraining the B-mode
contamination in the CMB from Galactic dust emission. Each 280 GHz focal plane contains a 16 x 16 grid
of corrugated silicon feedhorns coupled to an array of aluminum-manganese transition-edge sensor
(TES) bolometers fabricated on 150 mm diameter substrates. In total, the three 280 GHz FPUs contain
1,530 polarization sensitive bolometers (765 spatial pixels) optimized for the low loading environment
in flight and read out by time-division SQUID multiplexing. In this paper we describe the mechanical,
thermal, and magnetic shielding architecture of the focal planes and present cryogenic measurements
which characterize yield and the uniformity of several bolometer parameters. The assembled FPUs
have high yields, with one array as high as 95% including defects from wiring and readout. We demonstrate
high uniformity in device parameters, finding the median saturation power for each TES array to
be ~3 pW at 300 mK with a less than 6% variation across each array at one standard deviation. These focal
planes will be deployed alongside the 95 and 150 GHz telescopes in the SPIDER-2 instrument, slated
to fly from McMurdo Station in Antarctica in December 2018.
