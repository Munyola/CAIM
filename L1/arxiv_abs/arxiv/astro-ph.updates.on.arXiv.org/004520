We report mid-UV (MUV) observations taken with HST/WFC3, Swift/UVOT and GALEX/NUV of the transitional
millisecond pulsars XSS J12270-4859 and PSR J1023+0038 during their radio pulsar states. Both
systems were detected in our images and showed MUV variability. At similar orbital phases, the MUV
luminosities of both pulsars are comparable. This suggests that the emission processes involved
in both objects are similar. We estimated limits on the mass ratio, companion's temperature, inclination,
and distance to XSS J12270-4859 by using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm to fit published folded
optical light curves. Using the resulting parameters, we modeled MUV light curves in our HST filters.
The resulting models failed to fit our MUV observations. Fixing the mass ratio of XSS J12270-4859
to the value reported in other studies, we obtained a distance of ~3.2 kpc. This is larger than the
one derived from radio measurements (~1.4 kpc). Assuming a uniform prior for the mass ratio, the
distance is similar to that from radio measurements. However, it requires an undermassive companion
(~0.01 M_sun). We conclude that a direct heating model alone can not fully explain the observations
in optical and MUV. Therefore, an additional radiation source is needed. The source could be an intrabinary
shock which contributes to the MUV flux and likely to the optical one as well. During the radio pulsar
state, the MUV orbital variations of PSR J1023+0038 detected with GALEX, suggests the presence
of an asymmetric intrabinary shock.
