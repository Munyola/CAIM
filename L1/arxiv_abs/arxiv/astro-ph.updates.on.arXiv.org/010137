The core-accretion model predicts that planetary cores as massive as super-Earths undergo runaway
gas accretion to become gas giants. However, the exoplanet census revealed the prevalence of super-Earths
close to their host stars, which should have avoided runaway gas accretion. In fact, mass-radius
relationships of transiting planets suggest that some close-in super-Earths possess H$_2$/He
atmospheres of ~ 0.1-10% by mass. Previous studies indicated that properties of a disk gas such as
metallicity and the inflow/outflow cycle of a disk gas around a super-Earth can regulate accumulation
of a H$_2$/He atmosphere onto itself. In this paper, we propose a new mechanism that radial mass accretion
in a disk can limit the gas accretion onto super-Earth cores. Recent magneto-hydrodynamic simulations
found that magnetically driven disk winds can drive a rapid gas flow near the disk surface. Such a
rapid gas flow may slip out of a planetary core and regulate gas supply to an accreting gas onto the
core. We performed N-body simulations for formation of super-Earths with accretion of atmospheres
in a viscous accretion disk including effects of wind-driven accretion. We found that even super-Earth
cores can avoid triggering runaway gas accretion if the inflow of a disk gas toward the cores is limited
by viscous accretion. Our model predicts that super-Earths having H$_2$/He atmosphere of ~ 0.1-10
wt % form within $\lesssim$ 1 au of the central star, whereas gas giants are born in the outer region.
This mechanism can explain the radial dependence of observed giant planets beyond the solar system.
