Recent observations have suggested that the CIII]$\lambda1907/1909$ emission lines could be
alternative diagnostic lines for galaxies in the reionization epoch. We use the F128N narrowband
filter on the Hubble Space Telescope's ($\it{HST}$) Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) to search for CIII]
emission in a sample of five galaxies at z = 5.7 in the Subaru Deep Field and the Subaru/XMM-Newton
Deep Field. Using the F128N narrowband imaging, together with the broadband imaging, we do not detect
CIII] emission for the five galaxies with $J_{\rm{AB}}$ ranging from 24.10 -- 27.00 in our sample.
For the brightest galaxy J132416.13+274411.6 in our sample (z = 5.70, $J_{\rm{AB}} = 24.10$), which
has a significantly higher signal to noise, we report a CIII] flux of $3.34\pm1.81 \times 10^{-18}$
$\mathrm{erg\ s^{-1}\ cm^{-2}}$, which places a stringent 3-$\rm\sigma$ upper limit of $5.43\times
10^{-18}$ $\mathrm{erg\ s^{-1}\ cm^{-2}}$ on CIII] flux and 6.57 \AA\ on the CIII] equivalent width.
Using the stacked image, we put a 3-$\rm\sigma$ upper limit on the mean CIII] flux of $\mathrm{2.55\times10^{-18}\
erg\ s^{-1}\ cm^{-2}}$, and a 3-$\rm\sigma$ upper limit on the mean CIII] equivalent width of 4.20
{\AA} for this sample of galaxies at z = 5.70. Combined with strong CIII] detection reported among
high-z galaxies in the literature, our observations suggest that the equivalent widths of CIII]
from galaxies at z $>$ 5.70 exhibit a wide range of distribution. Our strong limits on CIII] emission
could be used as a guide for future observations in the reionization epoch.
