X-ray Hybrid CMOS Detectors (HCDs) have advantages over X-ray CCDs due to their higher readout rate
abilities, flexible readout, inherent radiation hardness, and low power, which make them more
suitable for the next generation large area X-ray telescope missions. The Penn State high energy
astronomy laboratory has been working on the development and characterization of HCDs in collaboration
with Teledyne Imaging Sensors (TIS). We characterized an H2RG detector with a Cryo-SIDECAR readout
and controller, and we find an improved energy resolution of ~2.7 % at 5.9 keV and read noise of ~6.5
e-. This detector was successfully flown on NASA's first water recovery sounding rocket flight
on April 4th, 2018. We have also been developing several new HCDs with potential applications for
future X-ray astronomy missions. We are characterizing the performance of small-pixel HCDs (12.5
{\mu}m pitch), which are important for the development of a next-generation high-resolution imager
with HCDs. We also characterized a 64 x 64 pixel prototype Speedster-EXD detector that uses comparators
in each pixel to read out only those pixels having detectable signal, thereby providing an order
of magnitude improvement in the effective readout rate. HCDs can also be utilized as a large FOV instrument
to study the prompt and afterglow emissions of GRBs and detect black hole transients. In this context,
we are characterizing a Lobster-HCD system for future CubeSat experiments. This paper briefly
presents these new developments and experimental results.
