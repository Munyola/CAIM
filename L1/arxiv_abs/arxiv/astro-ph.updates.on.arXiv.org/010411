We present a multi-wavelength observational study of IRAS 17008-4040 and IRAS 17009-4042 to probe
the star-formation (SF) mechanisms operational in both the sites. Each IRAS site is embedded within
a massive ATLASGAL 870 micron clump (~2430 - 2900 M_sun), and several parsec-scale filaments at
160 micron are radially directed toward these clumps (at T_d ~ 25 - 32 K). The analysis of the Spitzer
and VVV photometric data depicts a group of infrared-excess sources toward both the clumps, suggesting
the ongoing SF activities. In each IRAS site, high-resolution GMRT radio maps at 0.61 and 1.28 GHz
confirm the presence of H II regions, which are powered by B-type stars. In the site IRAS 17008-4040,
a previously known O-star candidate without an H II region is identified as an infrared counterpart
of the 6.7 GHz methanol maser emission (i.e. IRcmme). Based on the VLT/NACO adaptive-optics L' image
(resolution ~ 0.1 arcsec), the source IRcmme is resolved into two objects (i.e. IRcmme1 and IRcmme2)
within a scale of 900 AU that are found to be associated with the ALMA core G345.50M. IRcmme1 is characterized
as the main accreting HMPO candidate before the onset of an ultracompact H II region. In the site IRAS
17009-4042, the 1.28 GHz map has resolved two radio sources that were previously reported as a single
radio peak. Altogether, in each IRAS site, the junction of the filaments (i.e. massive clump) is
investigated with the cluster of infrared-excess sources and the ongoing massive SF. These evidences
are consistent with the "hub-filament" systems as proposed by Myers (2009).
