We study the dynamics of low-lying cool loop systems for three datasets as observed by the Interface
Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS). Radiances, Doppler shifts and line widths are investigated
in and around observed cool loop systems using various spectral lines formed between the photosphere
and transition region (TR). Footpoints of the loop threads are either dominated by blueshifts or
redshifts. The co-spatial variation of velocity above the blue-shifted footpoints of various
loop threads shows a transition from very small upflow velocities ranging from (-1 to +1) km/s in
the Mg\,{\sc ii} k line (2796.20~\AA; formation temperature: log (T/K) = 4.0) to the high upflow
velocities from (-10 to -20) km/s in Si\,{\sc iv}. Thus, the transition of the plasma flows from red-shift
(downflows) to the blue-shift (upflows) is observed above the footpoints of these loop systems
in the spectral line C\,{\sc ii} (1334.53~\AA; \log (T/K) = 4.3) lying between Mg\,{\sc ii} k and
Si\,{\sc iv} (1402.77~\AA; log (T / K) = 4.8). This flow inversion is consistently observed in all
three sets of the observational data. The other footpoint of loop system always remains red-shifted
indicating downflowing plasma. The multi-spectral line analysis in the present paper provides
a detailed scenario of the plasma flows inversions in cool loop systems leading to the mass transport
and their formation. The impulsive energy release due to small-scale reconnection above loop footpoint
seems to be the most likely cause for sudden initiation of the plasma flows evident at TR temperatures.
