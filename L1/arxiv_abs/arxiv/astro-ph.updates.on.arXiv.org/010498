There are many candidate sites of the r-process: core-collapse supernovae (including rare magnetorotational
core-collapse supernovae), neutron star mergers, and neutron star/black hole mergers. The chemical
enrichment of galaxies---specifically dwarf galaxies---helps distinguish between these sources
based on the continual build-up of r-process elements. This technique can distinguish between
the r-process candidate sites by the clearest observational difference---how quickly these events
occur after the stars are created. The existence of several nearby dwarf galaxies allows us to measure
robust chemical abundances for galaxies with different star formation histories. Dwarf galaxies
are especially useful because simple chemical evolution models can be used to determine the sources
of r-process material. We have measured the r-process element barium with Keck/DEIMOS medium-resolution
spectroscopy. We present the largest sample of barium abundances (almost 250 stars) in dwarf galaxies
ever assembled. We measure [Ba/Fe] as a function of [Fe/H] in this sample and compare with existing
[alpha/Fe] measurements. We have found that a large contribution of barium needs to occur at more
delayed timescales than core-collapse supernovae in order to explain our observed abundances,
namely the significantly more positive trend of the r-process component of [Ba/Fe] vs. [Fe/H] seen
for [Fe/H] <~ -1.6 when compared to the [Mg/Fe] vs. [Fe/H] trend. We conclude that neutron star mergers
are the most likely source of r-process enrichment in dwarf galaxies at early times.
