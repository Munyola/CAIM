We report the discovery of a compact multi-planet system orbiting the relatively nearby (78pc)
and bright ($K=8.9$) K-star, EPIC248435473 (K2-XXX). We identify up to six possible planets orbiting
EPIC248435473 with estimated periods of P$_b$ = 0.66, P$_{.02}$ = 6.1, P$_c$ = 7.8, P$_d$ = 14.7,
P$_e$ = 19.5, and P$_{.06}$ = 56.7 days and radii of R$_P$ = 3.3 R$_{\oplus}$, 0.646 R$_{\oplus}$,
0.705 R$_{\oplus}$, 2.93 R$_{\oplus}$, 2.73 R$_{\oplus}$, and 0.90 R$_{\oplus}$, respectively.
We are able to confirm the planetary nature of two of these planets (d & e) from analyzing their transit
timing variations ($m_d= 8.9_{-3.8}^{+5.7} M_\oplus$ and $m_e=14.3_{-5.0}^{+6.4} M_\oplus$),
confidently validate the planetary nature of two other planets (b & c), and classify the last two
as planetary candidates (EPIC248435473.02 & .06). From a simultaneous fit of all 6 possible planets,
we find that EPIC248435473 b's orbit has an inclination of 75.32$^{\circ}$ while the other five
planets have inclinations of 87--90$^{\circ}$. This observed mutual misalignment may indicate
that EPIC248435473 b formed differently from the other planets in the system. The brightness of
the host star and the relatively large size of the sub-Neptune sized planets d and e make them well-suited
for atmospheric characterization efforts with facilities like the Hubble Space Telescope and
upcoming James Webb Space Telescope. We also identify an 8.5-day transiting planet candidate orbiting
EPIC248435395, a co-moving companion to EPIC248435473.
