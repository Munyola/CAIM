Outflows and rotation are two ubiquitous kinematic features in the gas kinematics of galaxies.
Here we introduce a semi-analytic model to quantify how rotating outflows impact the morphology
of the Lyman-$\alpha$ emission line. The model is contrasted against Monte Carlo radiative transfer
simulations of outflowing gas with additional solid body rotation. We explore a range of neutral
Hydrogen optical depth of $10^5 \leq \tau_{\mathrm{H}} \leq10^7$, rotational velocity $0 \leq
v_{\mathrm{rot}}/\mathrm{km\ s}^{-1} \leq 100$ and outflow velocity $0\leq v_{\mathrm{out}}/\mathrm{km\
s}^{-1} \leq 50$. We find three consequences of rotation. First, it introduces a dependency with
viewing angle; second it broadens the line and third it increases the flux at the line's center. For
all viewing angles, the semi-analytic model reproduces the radiative transfer results for the
line width and flux change at the line's center within a $7\%$ and $50\%$ precision for an optical
depth of $\tau_{\mathrm{H}}=10^5$, respectively, and within $2\%$ and $1\%$ for an optical depth
of $\tau_{\mathrm{H}}=10^7$. Using this model we also show that the peaks of integrated spectra
taken from opposite sides of an edge-on rotating gas distribution should have a separation of $\frac{1}{2}v_{\mathrm{rot}}$.
The semi-analytic model presented here is a convenient tool to introduce rotational kinematics
as a post-processing step of idealized Monte Carlo simulations; it provides a framework to interpret
\lya spectra in systems where rotation is expected or directly measured through kinematic maps.
