The plasma emission process, which is the mechanism for solar type II and type III radio bursts phenomena,
is studied by means of particle-in-cell and weak turbulence simulation methods. By plasma emission,
it is meant as a loose description of a series of processes, starting from the solar flare associated
electron beam exciting Langmuir and ion-acoustic turbulence, and subsequent partial conversion
of beam energy into the radiation energy by nonlinear processes. Particle-in-cell (PIC) simulation
is rigorous but the method is computationally intense, and it is difficult to diagnose the results.
Numerical solution of equations of weak turbulence (WT) theory, termed WT simulation, on the other
hand, is efficient and naturally lends itself to diagnostics since various terms in the equation
can be turned on or off. Nevertheless, WT theory is based upon a number of assumptions. It is, therefore,
desirable to compare the two methods, which is carried out for the first time in the present paper
with numerical solutions of the complete set of equations of the WT theory and with two-dimensional
electromagnetic PIC simulation. Upon making quantitative comparisons it is found that WT theory
is largely valid, although some discrepancies are also found. The present study also indicates
that it requires large computational resources in order to accurately simulate the radiation emission
processes, especially for low electron beam speeds. Findings from the present paper thus imply
that both methods may be useful for the study of solar radio emissions as they are complementary.
