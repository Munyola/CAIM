We present the asteroseismic study of the early red-giant star KIC 4448777, complementing and integrating
a previous work (Di Mauro et al. 2016), aimed at characterizing the dynamics of its interior by analyzing
the overall set of data collected by the {\it Kepler} satellite during the four years of its first
nominal mission. We adopted the Bayesian inference code DIAMOND (Corsaro \& De Ridder 2014) for
the peak bagging analysis and asteroseismic splitting inversion methods to derive the internal
rotational profile of the star. The detection of new splittings of mixed modes, more concentrated
in the very inner part of the helium core, allowed us to reconstruct the angular velocity profile
deeper into the interior of the star and to disentangle the details better than in Paper I: the helium
core rotates almost rigidly about 6 times faster than the convective envelope, while part of the
hydrogen shell seems to rotate at a constant velocity about 1.15 times lower than the He core. In particular,
we studied the internal shear layer between the fast-rotating radiative interior and the slow convective
zone and we found that it lies partially inside the hydrogen shell above $r \simeq 0.05R$ and extends
across the core-envelope boundary. Finally, we theoretically explored the possibility for the
future to sound the convective envelope in the red-giant stars and we concluded that the inversion
of a set of splittings with only low-harmonic degree $l\leq 3$, even supposing a very large number
of modes, will not allow to resolve the rotational profile of this region in detail.
