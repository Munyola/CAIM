Acting as powerful gravitational lenses, the strong lensing galaxy clusters of the deep {\it Hubble}
Frontier Fields (HFF) program permit access to lower-luminosity galaxies lying at higher redshifts
than hitherto possible. We analyzed the HFF to measure the volume density of Lyman-break galaxies
at $z > 4.75$ by identifying a complete and reliable sample up to $z \simeq 10$. A marked deficit of
such galaxies was uncovered in the highly magnified regions of the clusters relative to their outskirts,
implying that the magnification of the sky area dominates over additional faint galaxies magnified
above the flux limit. This negative magnification bias is consistent with a slow rollover at the
faint end of the UV luminosity function, and indicates a preference for Bose-Einstein condensate
dark matter with a light boson mass of $m_\mathrm{B} \simeq 10^{-22} \, \mathrm{eV}$ over standard
cold dark matter. We emphasize that measuring the magnification bias requires no correction for
multiply lensed images (with typically three or more images per source), whereas directly reconstructing
the luminosity function will lead to an overestimate unless such images can be exhaustively matched
up, especially at the faint end that is accessible only in the strongly lensed regions. In addition,
we detected a distinctive downward transition in galaxy number density at $z \gtrsim 8$, which may
be linked to the relatively late reionization reported by {\it Planck}. Our results suggests that
{\it JWST} will likely peer into an "abyss" with essentially no galaxies detected in deep NIR imaging
at $z > 10$.
