The motions of gas and stars in the nuclei of nearby large galaxies have demonstrated that massive
black holes are common and that their masses strongly correlate with the stellar velocity dispersion
$\sigma_{\star}$ of the bulge. This correlation suggests that massive black holes and galaxies
influence each other's growth. Dynamical measurements are less reliable when the sphere of influence
is unresolved, thus it remains unknown whether this correlation exists in galaxies much smaller
than the Milky Way, as well as what fraction of these galaxies have central black holes. Light echoes
from photoionized clouds around accreting black holes, in combination with the velocity of these
clouds, yield a direct mass measurement that circumvents this difficulty. Here we report an exceptionally
low reverberation delay of $83\pm14$ minutes between variability in the accretion disk and high
velocity H$\alpha$ emission from the nucleus of the bulgeless dwarf galaxy NGC~4395. Combined
with the H$\alpha$ line-of-sight velocity dispersion $\sigma_{\rm line}=426\pm1$~km~s$^{-1}$,
this lag determines a mass of about 10,000~$M_{\odot}$ for the black hole. This mass is among the
smallest central black hole masses reported, near the low end of expected masses for heavy "seeds",
and the best direct mass measurement for a galaxy of this size. Despite the lack of a bulge, NGC~4395
is consistent with the $M_{\rm BH} - \sigma_{\star}$ relation when $\sigma_{\star}$ is measured
from the central region. This indicates that the relation need not originate from hierarchical
galaxy assembly nor from black hole feedback.
