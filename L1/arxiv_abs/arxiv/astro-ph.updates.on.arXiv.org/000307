Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) show excess X-ray emission above 10 keV compared with extrapolation
of spectra from lower energies. Risaliti et al. have recently attempted to model the hard X-ray excess
in the type 1.8 AGN NGC 1365, concluding that the hard excess most likely arises from Compton-scattered
reflection of X-rays from an inner accretion disk close to the black hole. Their analysis disfavored
a model in which the hard excess arises from a high column density of circumnuclear gas partially
covering a primary X-ray source, despite such components being required in the NGC 1365 data below
10 keV. Using a Monte Carlo radiative transfer approach, we demonstrate that this conclusion is
invalidated by (i) use of slab absorption models, which have unrealistic transmission spectra
for partial covering gas, (ii) neglect of the effect of Compton scattering on transmitted spectra
and (iii) inadequate modeling of the expected spectrum of scattered X-rays. The scattered spectrum
is geometry dependent and, for high global covering factors, may dominate above 10 keV. We further
show that, in models of circumnuclear gas, the suppression of the observed hard X-ray flux by reprocessing
may be no larger than required by the `light bending' model invoked for inner disk reflection, and
the expected emission line strengths lie within the observed range. We conclude that the time-invariant
`red wing' in X-ray spectra is probably caused by continuum transmitted through and scattered from
circumnuclear gas, not by highly redshifted line emission, and that measurement of black hole spin
is not possible.
