The star-forming efficiency of dense gas is thought to be set within cores by outflow and radiative
feedback. We use magneto-hydrodynamic simulations to investigate the relation between protostellar
outflow evolution, turbulence and star formation efficiency. We model the collapse and evolution
of isolated dense cores for $\gtrsim$ 0.5 Myr including the effects of turbulence, radiation transfer,
and both radiation and outflow feedback from forming protostars. We show that outflows drive and
maintain turbulence in the core environment even with strong initial fields. The star-formation
efficiency decreases with increasing field strength, and the final efficiencies are $15-40$\%.
The Stage 0 lifetime, during which the protostellar mass is less than the dense envelope, increases
proportionally with the initial magnetic field strength and ranges from $\sim 0.1-0.4$ Myr. The
average accretion rate is well-represented by a tapered turbulent core model, which is a function
of the final protostellar mass and is independent of the magnetic field strength. By tagging material
launched in the outflow, we demonstrate that the outflow entrains about $3$ times the actual launched
gas mass, a ratio that remains roughly constant in time regardless of the initial magnetic field
strength. However, turbulent driving increases for stronger fields since momentum is more efficiently
imparted to non-outflow material. The protostellar outflow momentum is highest during the first
0.1 Myr and declines thereafter by a factor of $\gtrsim 10$ as the accretion rate diminishes.
