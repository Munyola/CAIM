The binary system 16 Cygni is key in studies of the planet-star chemical composition connection,
as only one of the stars is known to host a planet. This allows us to better assess the possible influence
of planet interactions on the chemical composition of stars that are born from the same cloud and
thus, should have a similar abundance pattern. In our previous work, we found clear abundance differences
for elements with Z$\leq30$ between both components of this system, and a trend of these abundances
as a function of the condensation temperature (T$_{c}$), which suggests a spectral chemical signature
related to planet formation. In this work we show that our previous findings are still consistent
even if we include more species, like the volatile N and neutron capture elements (Z $>$ 30). We report
a slope with T$_{c}$ of $1.56 \pm 0.24 \times 10^{-5}$ dex K$^{-1}$, that is good agreement with both
our previous work and recent results by Nissen and collaborators. We also performed some tests using
ARES and iSpec to automatic measure the equivalent width and found T$_c$ slopes in reasonable agreement
with our results as well. In addition, we determine abundances for Li and Be by spectral synthesis,
finding that 16 Cyg A is richer not only in Li but also in Be, when compared to its companion. This may
be evidence of planet engulfment, indicating that the T$_{c}$ trend found in this binary system
may be a chemical signature of planet accretion in the A component, rather than a imprint of the giant
planet rocky core formation on 16 Cyg B.
