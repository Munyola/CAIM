We describe the all-sky Planck catalogue of clusters and cluster candidates derived from Sunyaev--Zeldovich
(SZ) effect detections using the first 15.5 months of Planck satellite observations. The catalogue
contains 1227 entries, making it over six times the size of the Planck Early SZ (ESZ) sample and the
largest SZ-selected catalogue to date. It contains 861 confirmed clusters, of which 178 have been
confirmed as clusters, mostly through follow-up observations, and a further 683 are previously-known
clusters. The remaining 366 have the status of cluster candidates, and we divide them into three
classes according to the quality of evidence that they are likely to be true clusters. The Planck
SZ catalogue is the deepest all-sky cluster catalogue, with redshifts up to about one, and spans
the broadest cluster mass range from (0.1 to 1.6) 10^{15}Msun. Confirmation of cluster candidates
through comparison with existing surveys or cluster catalogues is extensively described, as is
the statistical characterization of the catalogue in terms of completeness and statistical reliability.
The outputs of the validation process are provided as additional information. This gives, in particular,
an ensemble of 813 cluster redshifts, and for all these Planck clusters we also include a mass estimated
from a newly-proposed SZ-mass proxy. A refined measure of the SZ Compton parameter for the clusters
with X-ray counter-parts is provided, as is an X-ray flux for all the Planck clusters not previously
detected in X-ray surveys.
