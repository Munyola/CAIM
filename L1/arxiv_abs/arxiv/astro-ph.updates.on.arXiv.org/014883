The spectral components of the prompt emission of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) mainly consist of two
possible origins: synchrotron (non-thermal) and photosphere (thermal). The typically spectral
properties of GRBs can be modeled by a dominant non-thermal component (Band-like function or cutoff
power-law), some of them have an additional thermal component (Planck-like function). In this
paper, in order to study how the thermal components affect the non-thermal spectral parameters,
we focus on eight {\it Fermi}-GBM bursts of which the spectra deviate from a Band-only function,
and the thermal components are significant. We sort them into thermal-sub-dominant Group I (e.g.
GRB 110721A) and thermal-dominant Group II (e.g., GRB 090902B). Several interesting results are
found if assuming the spectral component is totally contributed from the non-thermal component:
(i) the low-energy photon index $\alpha$ becomes harder; (ii) the peak energy $E_{\rm c}$, is significantly
smaller, and lies between the peak temperature of blackbody component and the peak energy of CPL+BB
model; (iii) total flux $F$, is generally the same; (iv) the changes ($\Delta \alpha$ and $\Delta
E_{\rm c}$) are positively correlated with the ratio between the thermal flux and total flux; (v)
parameter relations ($F-\alpha$, $F-E_{\rm c}$ and $E_{\rm c}$-$\alpha$) also changed prominently.
The GRBs in both the groups show the same results. Our analysis indicates that the thermal component
is important, and it markedly affects the spectral parameters, and the consequent physical interpretations.
