We report the discovery of a new relationship between a simple morphological characteristic of
light curves produced by starspots and stellar rotation periods. The characteristic we examine
is whether the light curve exhibits one dip or two during a single rotation. We analyze thousands
of Kepler light curves of main sequence stars from 3200-6200K. Almost all the stars exhibit segments
of their light curve that contain either single or double dip segments (very few have more than two
significant dips per rotation). We define a variable, the "single/double ratio" (SDR) that expresses
the ratio of the time spent in single mode to the time spent in double mode. Unexpectedly, there is
a strong relationship between the SDR and the stellar rotation period, in the sense that longer periods
come with a larger fraction of double segments. Even more unexpectedly, the slopes of the SDR-Period
relations are a clear function of stellar temperature. We also show that the relationships of spot
variability amplitude (R_var) to rotation period have similar levels of scatter, slopes, and dependence
on temperature as the SDR-Period relations. Finally, the median R_var of single segments tends
to be about twice that of double segments in a given light curve. We offer some tentative interpretations
of these new results in terms of starspot coverage and lifetimes. It will be fruitful to look further
into this novel "rotation-activity" relation, and better understand what information these aspects
of light curve morphology bring to our knowledge of stellar magnetic activity.
