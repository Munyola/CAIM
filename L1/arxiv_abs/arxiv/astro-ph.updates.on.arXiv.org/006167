In this paper, the dynamical analysis of the Jovian dust originating from the four Galilean moons
is presented. High accuracy orbital integrations of dust particles are used to determine their
dynamical evolution. A variety of forces are taken into account, including the Lorentz force, solar
radiation pressure, Poynting-Robertson drag, solar gravity, the satellites' gravity, plasma
drag, and gravitational effects due to non-sphericity of Jupiter. More than 20,000 dust particles
from each source moon in the size range from 0.05 micron to 1 cm are simulated over 8,000 (Earth) years
until each dust grain hits a sink (moons, Jupiter, or escape from the system). Configurations of
dust number density in the Jovicentric equatorial inertial frame are calculated and shown. In a
Jovicentric frame rotating with the Sun the dust distributions are found to be asymmetric. For certain
small particle sizes, the dust population is displaced towards the Sun, while for certain larger
sizes, the dust population is displaced away from the Sun. The average lifetime as a function of particle
size for ejecta from each source moon is derived, and two sharp jumps in the average lifetime are analyzed.
Transport of dust between the Galilean moons and to Jupiter is investigated. Most of the orbits for
dust particles from Galilean moons are prograde, while, surprisingly, a small fraction of orbits
are found to become retrograde mainly due to solar radiation pressure and Lorentz force. The distribution
of orbital elements is also analyzed.
