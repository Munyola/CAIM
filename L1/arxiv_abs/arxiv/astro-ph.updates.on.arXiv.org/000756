The Kepler satellite has discovered a number of transiting planets around close binary stars. These
circumbinary systems have highly aligned planetary and binary orbits. In this paper, we explore
how the mutual inclination between the planetary and binary orbits may reflect the physical conditions
of the assembly of protoplanetary disks and the interaction between protostellar binaries and
circumbinary disks. Given the turbulent nature of star-forming molecular clouds, it is possible
that the gas falling onto the outer region of a circumbinary disk and the central protostellar binary
have different axes of rotation. Thus, the newly assembled circumbinary disk can be misaligned
with respect to the binary. However, the gravitational torque from the binary produces a warp and
twist in the disk, and the back-reaction torque tends to align the disk and the binary orbital plane.
We present a new, analytic calculation of this alignment torque, and show that the binary-disk inclination
angle can be reduced appreciably after the binary accretes a few percent of its mass from the disk.
Our calculation suggests that in the absence of other disturbances, circumbinary disks and planets
around close (sub-AU) stellar binaries, for which mass accretion onto the proto-binary is very
likely to have occurred, are expected to be highly aligned with the binary orbits, while disks and
planets around wide binaries can be misaligned. Measurements of the mutual inclinations of circumbinary
planetary systems can provide a clue to the birth environments of such systems.
