We present observations of persistent oscillations of some bright features in the upper-chromosphere/transition-region
above sunspots taken by IRIS SJ 1400 {\AA} and upward propagating quasi-periodic disturbances
along coronal loops rooted in the same region taken by AIA 171 {\AA} passband. The oscillations of
the features are cyclic oscillatory motions without any obvious damping. The amplitudes of the
spatial displacements of the oscillations are about 1 $^{"}$. The apparent velocities of the oscillations
are comparable to the sound speed in the chromosphere, but the upward motions are slightly larger
than that of the downward. The intensity variations can take 24-53% of the background, suggesting
nonlinearity of the oscillations. The FFT power spectra of the oscillations show dominant peak
at a period of about 3 minutes, in consistent with the omnipresent 3 minute oscillations in sunspots.
The amplitudes of the intensity variations of the upward propagating coronal disturbances are
10-15% of the background. The coronal disturbances have a period of about 3 minutes, and propagate
upward along the coronal loops with apparent velocities in a range of 30-80 km/s. We propose a scenario
that the observed transition region oscillations are powered continuously by upward propagating
shocks, and the upward propagating coronal disturbances can be the recurrent plasma flows driven
by shocks or responses of degenerated shocks that become slow magnetic-acoustic waves after heating
the plasma in the coronal loops at their transition-region bases.
