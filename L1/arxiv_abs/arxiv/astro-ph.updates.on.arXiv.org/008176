We present 1,201 galaxies at $0.05<z<0.45$ that host tidal features, detected from the first $\sim\!
200$ deg$^2$ of imaging from the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program (HSC-SSP). All galaxies
in the present sample have spectroscopic observations from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)
spectroscopic campaigns, generating a sample of 21208 galaxies. Of these galaxies, we identify
214 shell systems and 987 stream systems. For 575 of these systems, we are additionally able to measure
the $(g-i)$ colors of the tidal features. We find evidence for star formation in a subset of the streams,
with the exception of streams around massive ellipticals, and find that stream host galaxies span
the full range of stellar masses in our sample. Galaxies which host shells are predominantly red
and massive: we find that observable shells form more frequently around ellipticals than around
disc galaxies of the same stellar mass. Although the majority of the shells in our sample are consistent
with being formed by minor mergers, $15\% \pm 4.4\%$ of shell host galaxies have $(g-i)$ colors as
red as their host galaxy, consistent with being formed by major mergers. These "red shells" are additionally
preferentially aligned with the major axis of the host galaxy, as previously predicted from simulations.
We suggest that although the bulk of the observable shell population originates from fairly minor
mergers, which preferentially form shells that are not aligned with the major axis of the galaxy,
major mergers produce a significant number of observable shells.
