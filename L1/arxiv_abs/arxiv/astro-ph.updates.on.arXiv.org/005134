We present accurate resolved $WISE$ photometry of galaxies in the combined SINGS and KINGFISH sample.
The luminosities in the W3 12$\mu$m and W4 23$\mu$m bands are calibrated to star formation rates
(SFRs) derived using the total infrared luminosity, avoiding UV/optical uncertainties due to
dust extinction corrections. The W3 relation has a 1-$\sigma$ scatter of 0.15 dex over nearly 5 orders
of magnitude in SFR and 12$\mu$m luminosity, and a range in host stellar mass from dwarf (10$^7$ M$_\odot$)
to $\sim3\times$M$_\star$ (10$^{11.5}$ M$_\odot$) galaxies. In the absence of deep silicate
absorption features and powerful active galactic nuclei, we expect this to be a reliable SFR indicator
chiefly due to the broad nature of the W3 band. By contrast the W4 SFR relation shows more scatter (1-$\sigma
=$ 0.18 dex). Both relations show reasonable agreement with radio continuum-derived SFRs and excellent
accordance with so-called "hybrid" H$\alpha + 24 \mu$m and FUV$+$24$\mu$m indicators. Moreover,
the $WISE$ SFR relations appear to be insensitive to the metallicity range in the sample. We also
compare our results with IRAS-selected luminous infrared galaxies, showing that the $WISE$ relations
maintain concordance, but systematically deviate for the most extreme galaxies. Given the all-sky
coverage of $WISE$ and the performance of the W3 band as a SFR indicator, the $L_{12\mu \rm m}$ SFR
relation could be of great use to studies of nearby galaxies and forthcoming large area surveys at
optical and radio wavelengths.
