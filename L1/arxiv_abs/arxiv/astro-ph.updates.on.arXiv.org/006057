We present the first results of a new spectroscopic survey of the cluster Abell 85 targeting 1466
candidate cluster members within the central $\sim$1 deg$^2$ of the cluster and having magnitudes
$m_r < 20.5$ using VIMOS/VLT and HYDRA/WIYN. A total of 520 galaxies are confirmed as either relaxed
cluster members or part of an infalling population. A significant fraction are low mass; the median
stellar mass of the sample is $10^{9.6} M_{\odot} $, and 25% have stellar masses below $10^9 M_{\odot}$
(i.e. 133 dwarf galaxies). We also identify seven active galactic nuclei (AGN), four of which reside
in dwarf host galaxies. We probe the evolution of star formation rates, based on H$\alpha$ emission
and continuum modeling, as a function of both mass and environment. We find that more star forming
galaxies are observed at larger clustercentric distances, while infalling galaxies show evidence
for recently enhanced star forming activity. Main sequence galaxies, defined by their continuum
star formation rates, show different evolutionary behavior based on their mass. At the low mass
end, the galaxies have had their star formation recently quenched, while more massive galaxies
show no significant change. The timescales probed here favor fast quenching mechanisms, such as
ram-pressure stripping. Galaxies within the green valley, defined similarly, do not show evidence
of quenching. Instead, the low mass galaxies maintain their levels of star forming activity, while
the more massive galaxies have experienced a recent burst.
