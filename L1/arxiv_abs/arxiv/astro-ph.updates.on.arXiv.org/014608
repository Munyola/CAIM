For non-spinning, charged (Reissner-Nordstr\"om) black holes, the particles with an opposite
sign of charge with respect to that of the black hole will be pulled into the black hole by the extra
electromagnetic force. Such a hole will be quickly neutralized so that there should not exist significantly
charged, non-spinning black holes in the universe. The case of spinning, charged (Kerr-Newmann)
black holes is more complicated. For a given initial position and initial velocity of the particle,
an oppositely charged particle does not always more easily fall into the black hole than a neutral
particle. The possible existence of a magnetosphere further complicate the picture. One therefore
cannot straightforwardly conclude that a charged spinning black hole will be neutralized. In this
paper, we make the first step to investigate the neutralization of Kerr-Newmann black holes without
introducing a magnetosphere. We track the particle trajectories under the influence of the curved
spacetime and the electromagnetic field carried by the spinning, charged black hole. A statistical
method is used to investigate the neutralization problem. We find a universal dependence of the
falling probability into the black hole on the charge of the test particle, with the oppositely charged
particles having a higher probability of falling. We therefore conclude that charged, spinning
black holes without a magnetosphere should be quickly neutralized, consistent with people's intuition.
The neutralization problem of Kerr-Newmann black holes with a co-rotating force-free magnetosphere
is subject to further studies.
