Magnetic reconnection between open and closed magnetic field in the corona is believed to play a
crucial role in the corona/heliosphere coupling. At large scale, the exchange of open/closed connectivity
is expected to occur in pseudo-streamer structures. However, there is neither clear observational
evidence of how such coupling occurs in pseudo-streamers, nor evidence for how the magnetic reconnection
evolves. Using a newly-developed technique, we enhance the off-limb magnetic fine structures
observed with AIA and identify a pseudo-streamer-like feature located close to the northern coronal
hole. After extrapolating the magnetic field with the PFSS model, we obtain a pseudo-streamer magnetic
topology, null-point related topology bounded by open field. We compare the magnetic configuration
with the UV observations and identify the magnetic structures expected to be involved in the event.
Using an 3D MHD simulation of interchange reconnection, we showed that the evolution of the UV structures
follows the magnetic field dynamics and the UV emitting structures have a pattern very similar to
the plasma emission derived from the simulation. Our results highlight that the exchange between
open and closed in the pseudo-streamer topology related to an observed event occurs at least partially
at the null-point, similarly to the interchange reconnection in a single null-point topology.
However, our results also indicate that the interchange reconnection in pseudo-streamers is a
gradual physical process which opposes to the impulsive reconnection of the solar-jet model.
