Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAHs) and nanoparticles are expected to play an important role
in many astrophysical processes due to its dominant total dust surface area, including gas heating,
chemistry, star formation tracer, and anomalous microwave emission. In dense magnetized molecular
clouds where low-velocity shocks are present, PAHs and nanoparticles are widely believed to originate
from grain shattering due to grain-grain collisions. However, the question is whether these nanoparticles
can survive in the dense and hot shocked regions, and how to constrain the size and abundance of these
tiny particles via observations. In this paper, we show that, due to high gas temperature and supersonic
drift of neutrals relative to charged grains, smallest nanoparticles can be spun-up to extremely
fast rotation by stochastic atom bombardment such that centrifugal force can disrupt non-ideal
nanoparticles of size below $\sim 2$ nm. The proposed disruption mechanism is shown to be more efficient
than sputtering in affecting the lower cutoff of grain size distribution in C-shocks if nanoparticles
have non-ideal tensile strength. We model spinning dust emission from spinning nanoparticles
subject to supersonic drift and rotational disruption. We find that suprathermally rotating nanoparticles
can emit strong microwave radiation and peak frequencies increasing with the drifting velocity.
We suggest a new method to trace nanoparticles and shock velocities in dense regions using microwave
emission from spinning dust.
