A compact device lifted over the ground surface might be used to observe optical radiation of extensive
air showers (EAS). Here we consider spatial and temporal characteristics of Vavilov-Cherenkov
radiation ("Cherenkov light") reflected from the snow surface of Lake Baikal, as registered by
the SPHERE-2 detector. We perform detailed full direct Monte Carlo simulations of EAS development
and present a dedicated highly modular code intended for detector response simulations. Detector
response properties are illustrated by example of several model EAS events. The instrumental acceptance
of the SPHERE-2 detector was calculated for a range of observation conditions. We introduce the
concept of "composite model quantities", calculated for detector responses averaged over photoelectron
count fluctuations, but retaining EAS development fluctuations. The distortions of EAS Cherenkov
light lateral distribution function (LDF) introduced by the SPHERE-2 telescope are understood
by comparing composite model LDF with the corresponding function as would be recorded by an ideal
detector situated at the ground surface. We show that the uncertainty of snow optical properties
does not change our conclusions, and, moreover, that the expected performance of the SPHERE experiment
in the task of cosmic ray mass composition study in the energy region $\sim$10 PeV is comparable with
other contemporary experiments. Finally, we compare the reflected Cherenkov light method with
other experimental techniques and briefly discuss its prospects.
