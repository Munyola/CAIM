Recent simulations of the densest portion of the Corona Borealis supercluster (A2061, A2065, A2067,
and A2089) have shown virtually no possibility of extended gravitationally bound structure without
inter-cluster matter (Pearson & Batuski). In contrast, recent analyses of the dynamics found
that the clusters had significant peculiar velocities towards the supercluster centroid (Batiste
& Batuski). In this paper we present the results of a thorough investigation of the CSC: we determine
redshifts and virial masses for all 8 clusters associated with the CSC; repeat the analysis of Batiste
& Batuski with the inclusion of A2056 and CL1529+29; estimate the mass of the supercluster by
applying the virial theorem on the supercluster scale (e.g. Small et al.), the caustics method (e.g.
Reisenegger et al.), and a new procedure using the spherical collapse model (SCM) with the results
of the dynamical analysis (SCM+FP); and perform a series of simulations to assess the likelihood
of the CSC being a gravitationally bound supercluster. We find that the mass of the CSC is between
0.6 and 12 x 10^{16} h^{-1} M_{sun}. The dynamical analysis, caustics method and the SCM+FP indicate
that the structure is collapsing, with the latter two both indicating a turn around radius of about
12.5 h^{-1} Mpc. Lastly, the simulations show that with a reasonable amount of inter-cluster mass,
there is likely extended bound structure in the CSC. Our results suggest that A2056, A2061, A2065,
A2067, and A2089 form a gravitationally bound supercluster.
