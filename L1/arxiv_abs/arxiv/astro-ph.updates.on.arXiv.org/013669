Observational work have shown that the two brightest satellite galaxies of the Milky Way (MW), the
Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), are rare amongst MW analogues.
It is then interesting to know whether the presence of massive satellite has any effect on the whole
satellite population in MW analogues. In this article, we investigate this problem using a semi-analytical
model combined with the Millennium-II Simulation. MW-analogous galaxies are defined to have similar
stellar mass or dark matter halo mass to the MW. We find that, in the first case, the halo mass is larger
and there are, on average, twice as many satellites in Milky Way analogs if there is a massive satellite
galaxy in the system. This is mainly from the halo formation bias. The difference is smaller if MW
analogues are selected using halo mass. We also find that the satellites distribution is slightly
asymmetric, being more concentrated on the line connecting the central galaxy and the massive satellite
and that, on average, LMC have brought in 14.7 satellite galaxies with $M_{r}<0$ at its accretion,
among which 4.5 satellites are still within a distance of 50kpc from the LMC. Considering other satellites,
we predict that thereare 7.8 satellites with 50kpc of the LMC. By comparing our model with the early
data of Satellites Around Galactic Analogs (SAGA), a survey to observe satellite galaxies around
100 Milky Way analogues, we find that SAGA has more bright satellites and less faint satellites than
our model predictions. A future comparison with the final SAGA data is needed.
