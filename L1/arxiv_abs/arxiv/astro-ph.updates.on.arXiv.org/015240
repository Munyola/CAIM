Collisional growth of dust occurs in all regions of protoplanetary disks with certain materials
dominating between various condensation lines. The sticking properties of the prevalent dust
species depend on the specific temperatures. The inner disk is the realm of silicates spanning a
wide range of temperatures from room temperature up to sublimation beyond $1500\,\mathrm{K}$.
For the first time, we carried out laboratory collision experiments with hot levitated basalt dust
aggregates of $1\, \rm mm$ in size. The aggregates are compact with a filling factor of $0.37 \pm 0.06$.
The constituent grains have a wide size distribution that peaks at about $0.6\,\mu \mathrm{m}$.
Temperatures in the experiments are varied between approximately $600\,\mathrm{K}$ and $1100\,\mathrm{K}$.
Collisions are slow with velocities between $0.002\,\mathrm{m}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ and $0.15\,\mathrm{m}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}$,
i.e., relevant for protoplanetary disks. Aside from variations of the coefficients of restitution
due to varying collision velocities, the experiments show low sticking probability below $900\,\mathrm{K}$
and an increasing sticking probability starting at $900\,\mathrm{K}$. This implies that dust
can grow to larger size in hot regions, which might change planet formation. One scenario is an enhanced
probability for local planetesimal formation. Another scenario is a reduction of planetesimal
formation as larger grains are more readily removed as a consequence of radial drift. However, the
increased growth at high temperatures likely changes planetesimal formation one way or the other.
