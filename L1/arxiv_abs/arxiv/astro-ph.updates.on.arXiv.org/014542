We compile a sample of 341 binary and multiple star systems with the aim of searching for and characterising
Kuiper belt-like debris discs. The sample is assembled by combining several smaller samples studied
in previously published work with targets from two unpublished Herschel surveys. We find that 38
systems show excess emission at 70 or 100 $\mu$m suggestive of a debris disc. While nine of the discs
appear to be unstable to perturbations from their host binary based on a simple analysis of their
inferred radii, we argue that the evidence for genuine instability is not strong, primarily because
of uncertainty in the true disc radii, uncertainty in the boundaries of the unstable regions, and
orbital projection effects. The binary separation distributions of the disc-bearing and disc-free
systems are different at a confidence level of $99.4\%$, indicating that binary separation strongly
influences the presence of detectable levels of debris. No discs are detected for separations between
$\sim$25 and 135 au; this is likely a result of binaries whose separations are comparable with typical
disc radii clearing out their primordial circumstellar or circumbinary material via dynamical
perturbations. The disc detection rate is $19^{+5}_{-3}\%$ for binaries wider than 135 au, similar
to published results for single stars. Only $8^{+2}_{-1}\%$ of systems with separations below
25 au host a detectable disc, which may suggest that planetesimal formation is inhibited in binaries
closer than a few tens of au, similar to the conclusions of studies of known planet-hosting binaries.
