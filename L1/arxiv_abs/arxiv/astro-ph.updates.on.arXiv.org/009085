Assuming a hydrostatic equilibrium in an HI cloud, the joint Poisson's equation was set up and numerically
solved to calculate the expected HI distribution. Unlike previous studies, the cloud was considered
to be non-isothermal, and an {\it iterative} method was employed to iteratively estimate the intrinsic
velocity dispersion profile using the observed second-moment of the HI data. We apply our {\it iterative}
method to a recently discovered dwarf galaxy Leo-T and found that its observed HI distribution does
not comply with the expected one if one assumes no dark matter in it. To model the mass distribution
in Leo-T, we solved the Poisson's equation using a large number of trial pseudo-isothermal dark
matter halos and compare the model HI surface density ($\Sigma_{HI}$) profiles to the observed
one to identify the best dark matter halo parameters. For Leo-T, we found a pseudo-isothermal halo
with core density, $\rho_0 \sim 0.67$ $M_{\odot} \ pc^{-3}$ and core radius, $r_s \sim 37$ parsec
to explain the observation best. The resulting dark matter halo mass within the central 300 pc, $M_{300}$,
found to be $\sim 2.7 \times 10^6$ $M_{\odot}$ which is somewhat lower than earlier findings. We
also found that a set of dark matter halos with similar $M_{300} \sim 3.7 \times 10^6$ $M_{\odot}$
but very different $\rho_0$ and $r_s$ values, can produce equally good $\Sigma_{HI}$ profile within
the observational uncertainties. This, in turn, indicates that the mass of a dark matter halo, rather
than its structure primarily directs the expected HI distribution under hydrostatic equilibrium.
