Based on our previous modeling of AGN feedback in isolated elliptical galaxies (Gan et al. 2014)
using the MACER (Massive AGN Controlled Ellipticals Resolved) code, we extend and improve the model
to include rotation, to limit star formation to regions of high density and low temperature, to facilitate
angular momentum transfer via the Toomre instability in gaseous disks, and to improve the treatment
of hot mode (low accretion rate) AGN feedback. The model galaxy now has an extended dark matter profile
that matches with standard observations, but has a resolution of parsecs in the inner region and
resolves the Bondi radius. We find that the results agree reasonably well with a panoply of observations:
(1) both AGN activity and star formation are primarily in central disks, are bursty and mainly driven
by the Toomre instability; (2)AGN duty cycle agrees well with the Soltan argument, i.e., the AGN
spends most of its lifetime when it is in low luminosity (half of time with $L/L_{Edd}<7\times10^{-5}$),
while emitting most of its energy when it is in high luminosity (half of radiant energy emitted with
$L/L_{Edd}>0.06$); (3) the total star formation is $\sim$ few percents of the initial stellar mass,
occurring in the bursts that would be associated with the observed E+A phenomenon. Most of the star
formation occurs in the circumnuclear disk of a size <1 kpc, which is in agreement with recent observations;
(4) the ISM X-ray luminosity varies within a reasonable range (median $L_{\rm X, ISM}=9.1\times10^{39}$
erg/s) in agreement with observations.
