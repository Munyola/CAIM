We analyze electron flux maps based on RHESSI hard X-ray imaging spectroscopy data for a number of
extended coronal loop flare events. For each event, we determine the variation of the characteristic
loop length $L$ with electron energy $E$, and we fit this observed behavior with models that incorporate
an extended acceleration region and an exterior "propagation" region, and which may include collisional
modification of the accelerated electron spectrum inside the acceleration region. The models
are characterized by two parameters: the plasma density $n$ in, and the longitudinal extent $L_0$
of, the acceleration region. Determination of the best-fit values of these parameters permits
inference of the volume that encompasses the acceleration region and of the total number of particles
within it. It is then straightforward to compute values for the emission filling factor and for the
{\it specific acceleration rate} (electrons s$^{-1}$ per ambient electron above a chosen reference
energy). For the 24 events studied, the range of inferred filling factors is consistent with a value
of unity. The inferred mean value of the specific acceleration rate above $E_0=20$ keV is $\sim10^{-2}$
s$^{-1}$, with a 1$\sigma$ spread of about a half-order-of-magnitude above and below this value.
We compare these values with the predictions of several models, including acceleration by large-scale,
weak (sub-Dreicer) fields, by strong (super-Dreicer) electric fields in a reconnecting current
sheet, and by stochastic acceleration processes.
