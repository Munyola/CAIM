One dimensional versions of cosmological N-body simulations have been shown to share many qualitative
behaviours of the three dimensional problem. They can resolve a large range of time and length scales,
and admit exact numerical integration. We use such models to study how non-linear clustering depends
on initial conditions and cosmology. More specifically, we consider a family of models which, like
the 3D EdS model, lead for power-law initial conditions to self-similar clustering characterized
in the strongly non-linear regime by power-law behaviour of the two point correlation function.
We study how the corresponding exponent \gamma depends on the initial conditions, characterized
by the exponent n of the power spectrum of initial fluctuations, and on a single parameter \kappa
controlling the rate of expansion. The space of initial conditions/cosmology divides very clearly
into two parts: (1) a region in which \gamma depends strongly on both n and \kappa and where it agrees
very well with a simple generalisation of the so-called stable clustering hypothesis in three dimensions,
and (2) a region in which \gamma is more or less independent of both the spectrum and the expansion
of the universe. We explain the observed location of the boundary in (n, \kappa) space dividing the
"stable clustering" region from the "universal" region. We compare and contrast our findings to
results in three dimensions, and discuss in particular the light they may throw on the question of
"universality" of non-linear clustering in this context.
