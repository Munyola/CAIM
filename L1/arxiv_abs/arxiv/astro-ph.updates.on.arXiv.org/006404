We present the results of a global three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamics simulation of an accretion
disk with a rotating, weakly magnetized central star. The disk is threaded by a weak large-scale
poloidal magnetic field, and the central star has no strong stellar magnetosphere initially. Our
simulation investigates the structure of the accretion flows from a turbulent accretion disk onto
the star. The simulation reveals that fast accretion onto the star at high latitudes occurs even
without a stellar magnetosphere. We find that the failed disk wind becomes the fast, high-latitude
accretion as a result of angular momentum exchange like the magneto-rotational instability (MRI)
well above the disk, where the Lorentz force that decelerates the rotational motion of gas can be
comparable to the centrifugal force. Unlike the classical magnetospheric accretion scenario,
fast accretion streams are not guided by magnetic fields of the stellar magnetosphere. Nevertheless,
the accretion velocity reaches the free-fall velocity at the stellar surface due to the efficient
angular momentum loss at a distant place from the star. This study provides a possible explanation
why Herbig Ae/Be stars whose magnetic fields are generally not strong enough to form magnetospheres
also show indications of fast accretion. A magnetically-driven jet is not formed from the disk in
our model. The differential rotation cannot generate sufficiently strong magnetic fields for
the jet acceleration, because the Parker instability interrupts the field amplification.
