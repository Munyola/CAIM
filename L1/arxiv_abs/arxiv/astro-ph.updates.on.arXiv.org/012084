We present new medium resolution, optical long-slit spectra of a sample of 6 UV/optical and 15 X-ray
selected tidal disruption event candidate host galaxies. We measure emission line ratios from
the optical spectra, finding that the large majority of hosts are quiescent galaxies, while those
displaying emission lines are generally consistent with star-formation dominated environments;
only 3 sources show clear evidence of nuclear activity. We measure bulge velocity dispersions using
absorption lines and infer host black hole (BH) masses using the M-$\sigma$ relation. While the
optical and X-ray host BH masses are statistically consistent with coming from the same parent distribution,
the optical host distribution has a visible peak near $M_{\rm BH} \sim 10^6 M_\odot$, whereas the
X-ray host distribution appears flat in $M_{\rm BH}$. We find a subset of X-ray selected candidates
that are hosted in galaxies significantly less luminous (M$_{\rm g}$$\sim$-16) and less massive
(stellar mass$\sim$10$^{8.5-9}$M$_{\odot}$) than those of optical events. Using statistical
tests we find suggestive evidence that, in terms of black hole mass, stellar mass and absolute magnitude,
the hard X-ray hosts differ from the UV/optical and soft X-ray samples. Similar to individual studies,
we find that the emission region size for the X-ray sample is much smaller than the optical emission
region, consistent with a compact accretion disk. We find a typical Eddington ratio of the X-ray
emission is $\sim$0.01, as opposed to the optical events which have L$_{\rm BB}$$\sim$L$_{\rm
Edd}$.
