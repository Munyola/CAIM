We present Atacama Large Millimeter/sub-millimeter Array (ALMA) Cycle 2 observations of the 1.3
mm dust continuum emission of the protoplanetary disc surrounding the T Tauri star Elias 24 with
an angular resolution of $\sim 0.2"$ ($\sim 28$ au). The dust continuum emission map reveals a dark
ring at a radial distance of $0.47"$ ($\sim 65$ au) from the central star, surrounded by a bright ring
at $0.58"$ ($\sim 81$ au). In the outer disc, the radial intensity profile shows two inflection points
at $0.71"$ and $0.87"$ ($\sim 99$ and $121$ au respectively). We perform global three-dimensional
smoothed particle hydrodynamic gas/dust simulations of discs hosting a migrating and accreting
planet. Combining the dust density maps of small and large grains with three dimensional radiative
transfer calculations, we produce synthetic ALMA observations of a variety of disc models in order
to reproduce the gap- and ring-like features observed in Elias 24. We find that the dust emission
across the disc is consistent with the presence of an embedded planet with a mass of $\sim 0.7\, \mathrm{M_{\mathrm{J}}}$
at an orbital radius of $\sim$ 60 au. Our model suggests that the two inflection points in the radial
intensity profile are due to the inward radial motion of large dust grains from the outer disc. The
surface brightness map of our disc model provides a reasonable match to the gap- and ring-like structures
observed in Elias 24, with an average discrepancy of $\sim$ 5% of the observed fluxes around the gap
region.
