Following the first two annual intensity mapping workshops at Stanford in March 2016 and Johns Hopkins
in June 2017, we report on the recent advances in theory, instrumentation and observation that were
presented in these meetings and some of the opportunities and challenges that were identified looking
forward. With preliminary detections of CO, [CII], Lya and low-redshift 21cm, and a host of experiments
set to go online in the next few years, the field is rapidly progressing on all fronts, with great anticipation
for a flood of new exciting results. This current snapshot provides an efficient reference for experts
in related fields and a useful resource for nonspecialists. We begin by introducing the concept
of line-intensity mapping and then discuss the broad array of science goals that will be enabled,
ranging from the history of star formation, reionization and galaxy evolution to measuring baryon
acoustic oscillations at high redshift and constraining theories of dark matter, modified gravity
and dark energy. After reviewing the first detections reported to date, we survey the experimental
landscape, presenting the parameters and capabilities of relevant instruments such as COMAP,
mmIMe, AIM-CO, CCAT-p, TIME, CONCERTO, CHIME, HIRAX, HERA, STARFIRE, MeerKAT/SKA and SPHEREx.
Finally, we describe recent theoretical advances: different approaches to modeling line luminosity
functions, several techniques to separate the desired signal from foregrounds, statistical methods
to analyze the data, and frameworks to generate realistic intensity map simulations.
