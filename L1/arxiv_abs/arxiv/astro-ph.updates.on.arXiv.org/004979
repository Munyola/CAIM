Measurements of strong gravitational lensing jointly with type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) observations
have been used to test the validity of the cosmic distance duality relation (CDDR), $D_L(z)/[(1+z)^2D_A(z)]=\eta=1$,
where $D_L(z)$ and $D_A(z)$ are the luminosity and the angular diameter distances to a given redshift
$z$, respectively. However, several lensing systems lie in the interval $1.4 \leq z \leq 3.6$ i.e.,
beyond the redshift range of current SNe Ia compilations ($z \approx 1.50$), which prevents this
kind of test to be fully explored. In this paper, we circumvent this problem by testing the CDDR considering
observations of strong gravitational lensing along with SNe Ia and { a subsample from} the latest
gamma-ray burst distance modulus data, whose redshift range is $0.033 \leq z \leq 9.3$. { We parameterize
their luminosity distances with a second degree polynomial function and search for possible deviations
from the CDDR validity by using four different $\eta(z)$ functions: $\eta(z)=1+\eta_0z$, $\eta(z)=1+\eta_0z/(1+z)$,
$\eta(z)=(1+z)^{\eta_0}$ and $\eta(z)=1+\eta_0\ln(1+z)$. Unlike previous tests done at redshifts
lower than $1.50$, the likelihood for $\eta_0$ depends strongly on the $\eta(z)$ function considered,
but we find no significant deviation from the CDDR validity ($\eta_0=0$). However, our analyses
also point to the fact that caution is needed when one fits data in higher redshifts to test the CDDR
as well as a better understanding of the mass distribution of lenses also is required for more accurate
results.
