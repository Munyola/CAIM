We directly constrain the non-linear alignment (NLA) model of intrinsic galaxy alignments, analysing
the most representative and complete flux-limited sample of spectroscopic galaxies available
for cosmic shear surveys. We measure the projected galaxy position-intrinsic shear correlations
and the projected galaxy clustering signal using high-resolution imaging from the Kilo Degree
Survey (KiDS) overlapping with the GAMA spectroscopic survey, and data from the Sloan Digital Sky
Survey. Separating samples by colour, we make no significant detection of blue galaxy alignments,
constraining the blue galaxy NLA amplitude $A_{\textrm{IA}}^{\textrm{B}}=0.21^{+0.37}_{-0.36}$
to be consistent with zero. We make robust detections ($\sim9\sigma$) for red galaxies, with $A_{\textrm{IA}}^{\textrm{R}}=3.18^{+0.47}_{-0.46}$,
corresponding to a net radial alignment with the galaxy density field, and we find no evidence for
any scaling of alignments with galaxy luminosity. We provide informative priors for current and
future weak lensing surveys, an improvement over de facto wide priors that allow for unrealistic
levels of intrinsic alignment contamination. For a colour-split cosmic shear analysis of the final
KiDS survey area, we forecast that our priors will improve the constraining power on $S_{8}$ and
the dark energy equation of state $w_{0}$, by up to $62\%$ and $51\%$, respectively. Our results
indicate, however, that the modelling of red/blue-split galaxy alignments may be insufficient
to describe samples with variable central/satellite galaxy fractions.
