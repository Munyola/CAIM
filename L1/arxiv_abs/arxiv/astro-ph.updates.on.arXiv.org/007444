Low-frequency radio continuum observations of edge-on galaxies are ideal to study cosmic-ray
electrons (CREs) in halos via radio synchrotron emission and to measure magnetic field strengths.
We obtained new observations of the edge-on spiral galaxy NGC 891 at 129-163 MHz with the LOw Frequency
ARray (LOFAR) and at 13-18 GHz with the Arcminute Microkelvin Imager (AMI) and combine them with
recent high-resolution Very Large Array (VLA) observations at 1-2 GHz, enabling us to study the
radio continuum emission over two orders of magnitude in frequency. The spectrum of the integrated
nonthermal flux density can be fitted by a power law with a spectral steepening towards higher frequencies
or by a curved polynomial. Spectral flattening at low frequencies due to free-free absorption is
detected in star-forming regions of the disk. The mean magnetic field strength in the halo is 7 +-
2 $\mu$G. The scale heights of the nonthermal halo emission at 146 MHz are larger than those at 1.5
GHz everywhere, with a mean ratio of 1.7 +- 0.3, indicating that spectral ageing of CREs is important
and that diffusive propagation dominates. The halo scale heights at 146 MHz decrease with increasing
magnetic field strengths which is a signature of dominating synchrotron losses of CREs. On the other
hand, the spectral index between 146 MHz and 1.5 GHz linearly steepens from the disk to the halo, indicating
that advection rather than diffusion is the dominating CRE transport process. This issue calls
for refined modelling of CRE propagation.
