We use spherically symmetric hydrodynamic simulations to study the dynamical evolution and internal
structure of superbubbles (SBs) driven by clustered supernovae (SNe), focusing on the effects
of thermal conduction and cooling in the interface between the hot bubble interior and cooled shell.
Our simulations employ an effective diffusivity to account for turbulent mixing from nonlinear
instabilities that are not captured in 1D. The conductive heat flux into the shell is balanced by
a combination of cooling in the interface and evaporation of shell gas into the bubble interior.
This evaporation increases the density, and decreases the temperature, of the SB interior by more
than an order of magnitude relative to simulations without conduction. However, most of the energy
conducted into the interface is immediately lost to cooling, reducing the evaporative mass flux
required to balance conduction. As a result, the evaporation rate is typically a factor of $\sim$3-30
lower than predicted by the classical similarity solution of Weaver et al., which neglects cooling.
Blast waves from the first $\sim$30 SNe remain supersonic until colliding with the shell because
reduced evaporation from the interface lowers the mass they sweep up in the hot interior. Updating
the Weaver solution to include cooling, we construct a new analytic model to predict the cooling
rate, evaporation rate, and temporal evolution of SBs. The cooling rate, and hence the hot gas mass
and momentum delivered by SBs, is set by the ambient ISM density and the efficiency of nonlinear mixing
at the bubble/shell interface.
