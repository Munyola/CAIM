The unprecedented depth and area surveyed by the Subaru Strategic Program with the Hyper Suprime-Cam
(HSC-SSP) have enabled us to construct and publish the largest distant cluster sample out to $z\sim
1$ to date. In this exploratory study of cluster galaxy evolution from $z=1$ to $z=0.3$, we investigate
the stellar mass assembly history of brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs), evolution of stellar mass
and luminosity distributions, stellar mass surface density profile, as well as the population
of radio galaxies. Our analysis is the first high redshift application of the top N richest cluster
selection, which is shown to allow us to trace the cluster galaxy evolution faithfully. Over the
230 deg$^2$ area of the current HSC-SSP footprint, selecting the top 100 clusters in each of the 4
redshift bins allows us to observe the buildup of galaxy population in descendants of clusters whose
$z\approx 1$ mass is about $2\times 10^{14}\,M_\odot$. Our stellar mass is derived from a machine-learning
algorithm, which is found to be unbiased and accurate with respect to the COSMOS data. We find very
mild stellar mass growth in BCGs (about 35% between $z=1$ and 0.3), and no evidence for evolution
in both the total stellar mass-cluster mass correlation and the shape of the stellar mass surface
density profile. We also present the first measurement of the radio luminosity distribution in
clusters out to $z\sim 1$, and show hints of changes in the dominant accretion mode powering the cluster
radio galaxies at $z\sim 0.8$.
