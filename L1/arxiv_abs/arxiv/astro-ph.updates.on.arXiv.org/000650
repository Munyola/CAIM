Multi-band photometric images from ultraviolet and optical to infrared are collected to derive
spatially resolved properties of a nearby Scd type galaxy M 101. With evolutionary stellar population
synthesis models, two-dimensional distributions and radial profiles of age, metallicity, dust
attenuation, and star formation timescale in the form of the Sandage star formation history are
obtained. When fitting with the models, we use the IRX-$A_\mathrm{FUV}$ relation, found to depend
on a second parameter of birth rate b (ratio of present and past-averaged star formation rate), to
constrain the dust attenuation. There are obvious parameter gradients in the disk of M101, which
supports the theory of an "inside-out disk" growth scenario. Two distinct disc regions with different
gradients of age and color are discovered, similar to another late-type galaxy NGC 628. The metallicity
gradient of the stellar content is flatter than that of H {\sc ii} regions. The stellar disk is optically
thicker inside than outside and the global dust attenuation of this galaxy is lower, compared with
galaxies of similar and earlier morphological type. We highlight that a variational star formation
timescale describes the real star formation history of a galaxy. The timescale increases steadily
from the center to the outskirt. We also confirm that the bulge in this galaxy is a disk-like pseudobulge,
whose evolution is likely to be induced by some secular processes of the small bar with relatively
young age, rich metal, and much dust.
