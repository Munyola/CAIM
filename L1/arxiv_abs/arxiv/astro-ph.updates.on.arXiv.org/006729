We have observed and analysed the eclipses of the black widow pulsar J1810+1744 at low radio frequencies.
Using LOw-Frequency ARray (LOFAR) and Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope observations between
2011--2015 we have measured variations in flux density, dispersion measure and scattering around
eclipses. High-time-resolution, simultaneous beamformed and interferometric imaging LOFAR
observations show concurrent disappearance of pulsations and total flux from the source during
the eclipses, with a $3\sigma$ upper limit of 36 mJy ($<10\%$ of the pulsar's averaged out-of-eclipse
flux density). The dispersion measure variations are highly asymmetric, suggesting a tail of material
swept back due to orbital motion. The egress deviations are variable on timescales shorter than
the 3.6 hr orbital period and are indicative of a clumpy medium. Additional pulse broadening detected
during egress is typically $<20\%$ of the pulsar's spin period, showing no evidence of scattering
the pulses beyond detectability in the beamformed data. The eclipses, lasting $\sim13\%$ of the
orbit at 149 MHz, are shown to be frequency-dependent with total duration scaling as $\propto\nu^{-0.41\pm0.03}$.
The results are discussed in the context of the physical parameters of the system, and an examination
of eclipse mechanisms reveals cyclotron-synchrotron absorption as the most likely primary cause,
although non-linear scattering mechanisms cannot be quantitatively ruled out. The inferred mass
loss rate is a similar order-of-magnitude to the mean rate required to fully evaporate the companion
in a Hubble time.
