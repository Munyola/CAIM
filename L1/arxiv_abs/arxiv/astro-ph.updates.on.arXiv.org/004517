We have previously reported on models of low-mass stars in which the presence of inflated radii is
ascribed to magnetic fields which impede the onset of convection (e.g. MacDonald & Mullan [2017a]
and citations therein). Some of our magneto-convection models have been criticized because, when
they were first reported by Mullan & MacDonald (2001), the deep interior fields were found to be very
large (50-100 MG). Such large fields are now known to be untenable. For example, Browning et al. (2016)
used stability arguments to suggest that interior fields in low-mass stars cannot be larger than
~1 MG. Moreover, 3D models of turbulent stellar dynamos suggest that fields generated in low-mass
interiors may be not much stronger than 10-20 kG (Browning 2008). In the present paper, we present
magneto-convective models of inflated low-mass stars in which the interior fields are not permitted
to be stronger than 10 kG. These models are used to fit recently reported data for 6 low-mass stars
in 3 different binaries in which at least one of the component stars exhibits inflated radii. We show
that our 10 kG magneto-convective models can replicate the empirical data for 5 of the stars. In the
case of the sixth star (in the Praesepe cluster), two different solutions have been reported. We
find that one of these solutions (by Gillen et al. 2017) can be fitted well with our model using the
nominal age of Praesepe (800 Myr). However, the second solution (by Kraus et al. 2017) cannot be fitted
unless the star's age is assumed to be much younger (~150 Myr).
