The escape process of particles accelerated at supernova remnant (SNR) shocks is one of the poorly
understood aspects of the shock acceleration theory. Here we adopt a phenomenological approach
to study the particle escape and its impact on the gamma-ray spectrum resulting from hadronic collisions
both inside and outside of a middle-aged SNR. Under the assumption that in the spatial region immediately
outside of the remnant diffusion is suppressed with respect to the average Galactic one, we show
that a significant fraction of particles are still located inside the SNR long time after their nominal
release from the acceleration region. This fact results into a gamma-ray spectrum that resembles
a broken power law, similar to those observed in several middle-aged SNRs. Above the break, the spectral
steepening is determined by the diffusion coefficient outside of the SNR and by the time dependence
of maximum energy. Consequently, the comparison between the model prediction and actual data will
contribute to determining these two quantities, the former being particularly relevant within
the predictions of the gamma-ray emission from the halo of escaping particles around SNRs which
could be detected with future Cherenkov telescope facilities. We also calculate the spectrum of
run-away particles injected into the Galaxy by an individual remnant. Assuming that the acceleration
stops before the SNR enters the snowplow phase, we show that the released spectrum can be a featureless
power law only if the accelerated spectrum has a slope alpha > 4.
