MICADO is the Multi-AO Imaging Camera for Deep Observations, and it will be one of the first light
instruments of the Extremely Large Telescope (ELT). Doing high precision multi-object differential
astrometry behind ELT is particularly effective given the increased flux and small diffraction
limit. Thanks to its robust design with fixed mirrors and a cryogenic environment, MICADO aims to
provide 50 $\mu$as absolute differential astrometry (measure star-to-star distances in absolute
$\mu$as units) over a 53" FoV in the range 1.2-2.5 $\mu$m. Tackling high precision astrometry over
large FoV requires Multi Conjugate Adaptive Optics (MCAO) and an accurate distortion calibration.
The MICADO control scheme relies on the separate calibration of the ELT, MAORY and MICADO systematics
and distortions, to ensure the best disentanglement and correction of all the contributions. From
a system perspective, we are developing an astrometric error budget supported by optical simulations
to assess the impact of the main astrometric errors induced by the telescope and its optical tolerances,
the MCAO distortions and the opto-mechanical errors between internal optics of ELT, MAORY and MICADO.
The development of an overall astrometric error budget will pave the road to an efficient calibration
strategy complementing the design of the MICADO calibration unit. At the focus of this work are a
number of opto-mechanical error terms which have particular relevance for MICADO astrometry applications,
and interface to the MCAO design.
