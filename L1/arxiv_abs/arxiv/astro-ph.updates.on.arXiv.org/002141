The formation processes and the evolutionary stages of high-mass stars are poorly understood compared
to low-mass stars. Large-scale surveys are needed to provide an unbiased census of high column density
sites which can potentially host precursors to high-mass stars. Here we use the ATLASGAL survey
covering 420 sq. degree of the Galactic plane at 870 $\mu$m; and use the MRE-GLC method to identify
the population of embedded sources throughout the inner Galaxy. We identify in total 10861 compact
sub-millimeter sources with fluxes above 5 sigma. Completeness tests show that our catalogue is
97% complete above 5 sigma and >99% complete above 7$\sigma$. We correlate this sample with mid-infrared
point source catalogues (MSX at 21.3 $\mu$m and WISE at 22 $\mu$m) and determine a lower limit of ~33%
that are associated with embedded protostellar objects. We note that the proportion of clumps associated
with mid-infrared sources increases with increasing flux density, achieving a rather constant
fraction of ~75% of all clumps with fluxes over 5 Jy/beam being associated with star-formation.
Examining the source counts as a function of Galactic longitude we are able to identify the most prominent
star forming regions in the Galaxy. From the fraction of the likely massive quiescent clumps (~25%)
we estimate a formation time-scale of ~7.5+/-2.5 $\times$ 10$^4$yr for the deeply embedded phase
before the emergence of luminous YSOs. Such a short duration for the formation of high-mass stars
in massive clumps clearly proves that the earliest phases have to be dynamic with supersonic motions.
