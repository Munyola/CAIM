The recently discovered resonant drag instability (RDI) of dust streaming in protoplanetary disc
is considered as the mode coupling of subsonic gas-dust mixture perturbations. This mode coupling
is coalescence of two modes with nearly equal phase velocities: inertial wave (IW) having positive
energy and a streaming dust wave (SDW) having negative energy as measured in the frame of gas environment
being at rest in vertical hydrostatic equilibrium. SDW is a trivial mode produced by the bulk streaming
of dust, which transports perturbations of dust density. In this way, settling combined with radial
drift of the dust makes possible coupling of SDW with IW and the onset of the instability. In accordance
with the concept of the mode coupling, RDI growth rate is proportional to the square root of the coupling
term of the dispersion equation, which itself is proportional to mass fraction of dust, $f\ll 1$.
This clarifies why RDI growth rate $\propto f^{1/2}$. When SDW has positive energy, its resonance
with IW provides an avoided crossing instead of the mode coupling. In the high wavenumber limit RDI
with unbounded growth rate $\propto f^{1/3}$ is explained by the triple mode coupling, which is
coupling of SDW with two IW. It coexists with a new quasi-resonant instability accompanied by bonding
of two oppositely propagating low-frequency IW. The mode coupling does not exist for dust streaming
only radially in a disc. In this case RDI is provided by the obscured mechanism associated with the
inertia of solids.
