We have carried out optical observations of the north-eastern part of the supernova remnant IC 443
using the CFHT imaging spectrograph SITELLE. The observations consist of three multispectral
cubes covering an 11$^{\prime}$ $\times$11$^{\prime}$ area allowing the investigation of both
the spatial and spectral variation of 9 emission lines : [OII] $\lambda\lambda$3726+3729, [OIII]
$\lambda\lambda$4959,5007, H$\beta$, H$\alpha$, [NII] $\lambda\lambda$6548,6583 and [SII]
$\lambda\lambda$6716,6731. Extinction measurement from the H$\alpha$ / H$\beta$ ratio shows
significant variation across the observed region with E(B-V) = 0.8-1.1. Electron density measurements
using [SII] lines indicate densities ranging from 100 up to 2500 cm$^{-3}$. Models computed with
the shock modelling code MAPPINGS are presented and compared with the observations. A combination
of complete shock model and truncated ones are required in order to explain the observed spectrum.
The shock velocities found in IC 443 are between 20 and 150 km/s with 75 km/s being the most prominent
velocity. The pre-shock number density varies from 20 to 60 cm$^{-3}$. A single set of abundances
close to solar values combined with varying shock parameters (shock velocity, pre-shock density
and shock age) are sufficient to explain to great variation of lines intensities observed in IC 443.
Despite the relatively modest spectral resolution of the data (R$\sim 1500$ at H$\alpha$), we clearly
separate the red and blue velocity components of the expanding nebula, which show significant morphological
differences.
