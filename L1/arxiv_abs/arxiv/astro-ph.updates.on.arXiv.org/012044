We study the properties of rotating accretion flows onto supermassive black holes (SMBHs) using
axisymmetric two-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations with radiative cooling and BH feedback.
The simulations resolve the accretion dynamics of gas outside from the BH influence radius through
an inner accretion disk. For lower Bondi accretion rates in units of the Eddington rate ($\dot{M}_{\rm
B}\ll 10^{-3}~\dot{M}_{\rm Edd}$), the BH feeding is suppressed due to turbulent motion by several
orders of magnitudes from the Bondi rate. Thus, the radiative luminosity results in as low as $\sim
10^{-10}-10^{-7}~L_{\rm Edd}$, where $L_{\rm Edd}$ is the Eddington luminosity. For higher rates
of $\dot{M}_{\rm B}> 10^{-3}~\dot{M}_{\rm Edd}$, the optically-thin accreting gas cools via
free-free emission and forms a geometrically-thin disk, which feeds the BH efficiently and increases
the radiative luminosity to $> 10^{-3}~L_{\rm Edd}$. The transitional behavior of accreting BHs
in galactic nuclei from radiatively inefficient phases to cold disk accretion naturally explains
(1) the reason for the offset between the observed luminosities and theoretical predictions for
nearby quiescent SMBHs, and (2) the conditions to fuel gas into the nuclear SMBH. In addition, the
cold disk formed in galactic nuclei tends to be gravitationally unstable and leads to star formation
when the Bondi rate is as high as $ \dot{M}_{\rm B} > 10^{-2}~M_\odot~{\rm yr}^{-1}$. This is a plausible
explanation of the correlation observed between star formation rates and BH feeding rates in Seyfert
galaxies.
