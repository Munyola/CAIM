The relatively nearby spiral galaxy NGC~6946 is one of the most actively star forming galaxies in
the local Universe. Ten supernovae (SNe) have been observed since 1917, and hence NGC6946 surely
contains a large number of supernova remnants (SNRs). Here we report a new optical search for these
SNRs using narrow-band images obtained with the WIYN telescope. We identify 147 emission nebulae
as likely SNRs, based on elevated [SII]:Halpha ratios compared to HII regions. We have obtained
spectra of 102 of these nebulae with Gemini North-GMOS; of these, 89 have [SII]:Halpha ratios greater
than 0.4, the canonical optical criterion for identifying SNRs. There is very little overlap between
our sample and the SNR candidates identified by Lacey et al. (2001) from radio data. Also, very few
of our SNR candidates are known X-ray sources, unlike the situation in some other galaxies such as
M33 and M83. The emission line ratios, e.g., [NII]:Halpha, of the candidates in NGC6946 are typical
of those observed in SNR samples from other galaxies with comparable metallicity. None of the candidates
observed in our low-resolution spectra show evidence of anomalous abundances or significant velocity
broadening. A search for emission at the sites of all the historical SNe in NGC6946 resulted in detections
for only two: SN1980K and SN2004et. Spectra of both show very broad, asymmetric line profiles, consistent
with the interaction between SN ejecta and the progenitor star's circumstellar material, as seen
in late spectra from other core-collapse SNe of similar age.
