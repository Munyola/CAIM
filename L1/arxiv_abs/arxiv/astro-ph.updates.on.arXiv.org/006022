The optically and IR bright, and starlight-scattering, HR 4796A ring-like debris disk is one of
the most (and best) studied exoplanetary debris systems. The presence of a yet-undetected planet
has been inferred (or suggested) from the narrow width and inner/outer truncation radii of its r
= 1.05" (77 au) debris ring. We present new, highly sensitive, Hubble Space Telescope (HST) visible-light
images of the HR 4796A circumstellar debris system and its environment over a very wide range of stellocentric
angles from 0.32" (23 au) to ~ 15" (1100 au). These very high contrast images were obtained with the
Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) using 6-roll PSF-template subtracted coronagraphy
suppressing the primary light of HR 4796A and using three image plane occulters and simultaneously
subtracting the background light from its close angular proximity M2.5V companion. The resulting
images unambiguously reveal the debris ring embedded within a much larger, morphologically complex,
and bi-axially asymmetric exoring scattering structure. These images at visible wavelengths
are sensitive to, and map, the spatial distribution, brightness, and radial surface density of
micron size particles over 5 dex in surface brightness. These particles in the exo-ring environment
may be unbound from the system and interacting with the local ISM. Herein we present a new morphological
and photometric view of the larger than prior seen HR 4796A exoplanetary debris system with sensitivity
to small particles at stellocentric distances an order of magnitude greater than has previously
been observed.
