We present an updated strong-lensing analysis of the massive cluster Abell 370 (A370), continuing
the work first presented in Lagattuta et al. (2017). In this new analysis, we take advantage of the
deeper imaging data from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Frontier Fields program, as well as a large
spectroscopic mosaic obtained with the Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE). Thanks to the
extended coverage of this mosaic, we probe the full 3D distribution of galaxies in the field, giving
us a unique picture of the extended structure of the cluster and its surroundings. Our final catalog
contains 584 redshifts, representing the largest spectroscopic catalog of A370 to date. Constructing
the model, we measure a total mass distribution that is quantitatively similar to our previous work
-- though to ensure a low rms error in the model fit, we invoke a significantly large external shear
term. Using the redshift catalog, we search for other bound groups of galaxies, which may give rise
to a more physical interpretation of this shear. We identify three structures in narrow redshift
ranges along the line of sight, highlighting possible infalling substructures into the main cluster
halo. We also discover additional substructure candidates in low-resolution imaging at larger
projected radii. More spectroscopic coverage of these regions (pushing close to the A370 virial
radius) and more extended, high-resolution imaging will be required to investigate this possibility,
further advancing the analysis of these interesting developments.
