We present a simultaneous analysis of galaxy cluster scaling relations between weak-lensing mass
and multiple cluster observables, across a wide range of wavelengths, that probe both gas and stellar
content. Our new hierarchical Bayesian model simultaneously considers the selection variable
alongside all other observables in order to explicitly model intrinsic property covariance and
account for selection effects. We apply this method to a sample of 41 clusters at $0.15<z<0.30$,
with a well-defined selection criteria based on RASS X-ray luminosity, and observations from Chandra
/ XMM, SZA, Planck, UKIRT, SDSS and Subaru. These clusters have well-constrained weak-lensing
mass measurements based on Subaru / Suprime-Cam observations, which serve as the reference masses
in our model. We present 30 scaling relation parameters for 10 properties. All relations probing
the intracluster gas are slightly shallower than self-similar predictions, in moderate tension
with prior measurements, and the stellar fraction decreases with mass. K-band luminosity has the
lowest intrinsic scatter with a 95th percentile of 0.16, while the lowest scatter gas probe is gas
mass with a fractional intrinsic scatter of $0.16 \pm 0.03$. We find no distinction between the core-excised
X-ray or high-resolution Sunyaev-Zel'dovich relations of clusters of different central entropy,
but find with modest significance that higher entropy clusters have higher stellar fractions than
their lower entropy counterparts. We also report posterior mass estimates from our likelihood
model.
