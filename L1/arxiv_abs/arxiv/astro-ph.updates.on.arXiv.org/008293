The Pulsar Arecibo L-Band Feed Array (PALFA) survey, the most sensitive blind search for radio pulsars
yet conducted, is ongoing at the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico. The vast majority of the 180
pulsars discovered by PALFA have spin periods shorter than 2 seconds. Pulsar surveys may miss long-period
radio pulsars due to the summing of a finite number of harmonic components in conventional Fourier
analyses (typically $\sim$16), or due to the strong effect of red noise at low modulation frequencies.
We address this reduction in sensitivity by using a time-domain search technique: the Fast-Folding
Algorithm (FFA). We designed a program that implements a FFA-based search in the PALFA processing
pipeline, and tested the efficiency of the algorithm by performing tests under both ideal, white
noise conditions, as well as with real PALFA observational data. In the two scenarios, we show that
the time-domain algorithm has the ability to outperform the FFT-based periodicity search implemented
in the survey. We perform simulations to compare the previously reported PALFA sensitivity with
that obtained using our new FFA implementation. These simulations show that for a pulsar having
a pulse duty cycle of roughly 3%, the performance of our FFA pipeline exceeds that of our FFT pipeline
for pulses with DM $\lesssim$ 40 pc cm$^{-3}$ and for periods as short as $\sim$500 ms, and that the
survey sensitivity is improved by at least a factor of two for periods $\gtrsim$ 6 sec. Discoveries
from the implementation of the algorithm in PALFA are also presented in this paper.
