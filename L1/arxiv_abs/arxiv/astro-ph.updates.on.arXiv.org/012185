In the third catalog of active galactic nuclei detected by the Fermi-LAT (3LAC) Clean Sample, there
are 402 blazars candidates of uncertain type (BCU). Due to the limitations of astronomical observation
or intrinsic properties, it is difficult to classify blazars using optical spectroscopy. The potential
classification of BCUs using machine learning algorithms is essential. Based on the 3LAC Clean
Sample, we collect 1420 Fermi blazars with 8 parameters of {\gamma}-ray photon spectral index,
radio flux, flux density, curve significance, the integral photon flux in 100 to 300 MeV, 0.3 to 1
GeV, 10 to 100 GeV and variability index. Here, we apply 4 different supervised machine learning
(SML) algorithms (\emph{Decision trees, Random forests, support vector machines and Mclust Gaussian
finite mixture models}) to evaluate the classification of BCUs based on the direct observational
properties. All the 4 methods can perform exceedingly well with a more accuracy and can effective
forecast the classification of Fermi BCUs. The evaluating results show the results of these methods
(SML) are valid and robust, where, about 1/4 sources are FSRQs and 3/4 are BL Lacs in 400 BCUs, which
are consistent with some other recent results. Although a number of factors influence the accuracy
of SML, the results are stable at a fixed ratio 1:3 between FSRQs and BL Lacs, which suggests that the
SML can provides an effective method to evaluate the potential classification of BCUs. Among the
4 methods, Mclust Gaussian Mixture Modelling has the highest accuracy for our training sample (4/5,
seed=123).
