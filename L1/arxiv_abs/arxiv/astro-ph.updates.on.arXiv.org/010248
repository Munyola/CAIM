We present the most sensitive direct imaging and radial velocity (RV) exploration of $\epsilon$
Eridani to date. $\epsilon$ Eridani is an adolescent planetary system, reminiscent of the early
Solar system. It is surrounded by a prominent and complex debris disk which is likely stirred by one
or several gas giant exoplanets. The discovery of the RV signature of a giant exoplanet was announced
15 years ago, but has met with scrutiny due to possible confusion with stellar noise. We confirm the
planet with a new compilation and analysis of precise RV data spanning 30 years, and combine it with
upper limits from our direct imaging search, the most sensitive ever performed. The deep images
were taken in the Ms band (4.7$\mu$m) with the vortex coronagraph recently installed in W.M. Keck
Observatory's infrared camera NIRC2, which opens a sensitive window for planet searches around
nearby adolescent systems. The RV data and direct imaging upper limit maps were combined in an innovative
joint Bayesian analysis, providing new constraints on the mass and orbital parameters of the elusive
planet. $\epsilon$ Eridani b has a mass of $0.78^{+0.38}_{-0.12}$ $M_{Jup}$ and is orbiting $\epsilon$
Eridani at about $3.48\pm 0.02$ AU with a period of $7.37 \pm 0.07$ years. The eccentricity of $\epsilon$
Eridani b's orbit is $0.07^{+0.06}_{-0.05}$, an order of magnitude smaller than early estimates
and consistent with a circular orbit. We discuss our findings from the standpoint of planet-disk
interactions and prospects for future detection and characterization with the James Webb Space
Telescope.
