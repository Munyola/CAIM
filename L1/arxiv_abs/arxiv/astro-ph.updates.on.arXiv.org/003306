We use integral field spectroscopy to study in detail the Wolf-Rayet (WR) population in NGC 3310,
spatially resolving 18 star-forming knots with typical sizes of 200-300 pc in the disc of the galaxy
hosting a substantial population of WRs. The detected emission in the so-called blue bump is attributed
mainly to late-type nitrogen WRs (WNL), ranging from a few dozens to several hundreds of stars per
region. Our estimated WNL/(WNL+O) ratio is comparable to reported empirical relations once the
extinction-corrected emission is further corrected by the presence of dust grains inside the nebula
that absorb a non-negligible fraction of UV photons. Comparisons of observables with stellar population
models show disagreement by factors larger than 2-3. However, if the effects of interacting binaries
and/or photon leakage are taken into account, observations and predictions tend to converge. We
estimate the binary fraction of the \hii regions hosting WRs to be significant in order to recover
the observed X-ray flux, hence proving that the binary channel can be critical when predicting observables.
We also explore the connection of the environment with the current hypothesis that WRs can be progenitors
to long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). Galaxy interactions, which can trigger strong episodes
of star formation in the central regions, may be a plausible environment where WRs may act as progenitors
of GRBs. Finally, even though the chemical abundance is generally homogeneous, we also find weak
evidence for rapid N pollution by WR stellar winds at scales of ~ 200 pc.
