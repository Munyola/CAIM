Splashback refers to the process of matter that is accreting onto a dark matter halo reaching its
first orbital apocenter and turning around in its orbit. The cluster-centric radius at which this
process occurs, r_sp, defines a halo boundary that is connected to the dynamics of the cluster. A
rapid decline in the halo profile is expected near r_sp. We measure the galaxy number density and
weak lensing mass profiles around redMaPPer galaxy clusters in the first year Dark Energy Survey
(DES) data. For a cluster sample with mean M_200m mass ~2.5 x 10^14 M_sun, we find strong evidence
of a splashback-like steepening of the galaxy density profile and measure r_sp=1.13 +/- 0.07 Mpc/h,
consistent with earlier SDSS measurements of More et al. (2016) and Baxter et al. (2017). Moreover,
our weak lensing measurement demonstrates for the first time the existence of a splashback-like
steepening of the matter profile of galaxy clusters. We measure r_sp=1.34 +/- 0.21 Mpc/h from the
weak lensing data, in good agreement with our galaxy density measurements. For different cluster
and galaxy samples, we find that consistent with LCDM simulations, r_sp scales with R_200m and does
not evolve with redshift over the redshift range of 0.3--0.6. We also find that potential systematic
effects associated with the redMaPPer algorithm may impact the location of r_sp. We discuss progress
needed to understand the systematic uncertainties and fully exploit forthcoming data from DES
and future surveys, emphasizing the importance of more realistic mock catalogs and independent
cluster samples.
