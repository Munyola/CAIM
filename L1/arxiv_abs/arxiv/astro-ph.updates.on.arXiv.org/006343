We report on high-resolution imaging and spectral observations of eruptions of a spiral structure
in the transition region, which were taken with the Interface Region Imaging Spectrometer (IRIS),
the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) and the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI). The eruption
coincided with the appearance of two series of jets, with velocities comparable to the Alfv\'en
speeds in their footpoints. Several pieces of evidence of magnetic braiding in the eruption are
revealed, including localized bright knots, multiple well-separated jet threads, transition
region explosive events and the fact that all these three are falling into the same locations within
the eruptive structures. Through analysis of the extrapolated three-dimensional magnetic field
in the region, we found that the eruptive spiral structure corresponded well to locations of twisted
magnetic flux tubes with varying curl values along their lengths. The eruption occurred where strong
parallel currents, high squashing factors, and large twist numbers were obtained. The electron
number density of the eruptive structure is found to be $\sim3\times10^{12}$ cm$^{-3}$, indicating
that significant amount of mass could be pumped into the corona by the jets. Following the eruption,
the extrapolations revealed a set of seemingly relaxed loops, which were visible in the AIA 94 \AA\
channel indicating temperatures of around 6.3 MK. With these observations, we suggest that magnetic
braiding could be part of the mechanisms explaining the formation of solar eruption and the mass
and energy supplement to the corona.
