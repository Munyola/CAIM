We investigate the alignment of galaxies and haloes relative to cosmic web filaments using the EAGLE
hydrodynamical simulation. We identify filaments by applying the NEXUS+ method to the mass distribution
and the Bisous formalism to the galaxy distribution. Both web finders return similar filamentary
structures that are well aligned and that contain comparable galaxy populations. EAGLE haloes
have an identical spin alignment with filaments as their counterparts in dark matter only simulations:
a complex mass dependent trend with low mass haloes spinning preferentially parallel to and high
mass haloes spinning preferentially perpendicular to filaments. In contrast, galaxy spins do
not show such a spin transition and have a propensity for perpendicular alignments at all masses,
with the degree of alignment being largest for massive galaxies. This result is valid for both NEXUS+
and Bisous filaments. When splitting by morphology, we find that elliptical galaxies show a stronger
orthogonal spin--filament alignment than spiral galaxies of similar mass. The same is true of their
haloes, with the host haloes of elliptical galaxies having a larger degree of orthogonal alignment
than the host haloes of spirals. Due to the misalignment between galaxy shape and spin, galaxy minor
axes are oriented differently with filaments than galaxy spins. We find that the galaxies whose
minor axis is perpendicular to a filament are much better aligned with their host haloes. This suggests
that many of the same physical processes determine both the galaxy--filament and the galaxy--halo
alignments.
