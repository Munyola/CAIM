We present a multi-mission X-ray analysis of a bright (peak observed 0.3-10 keV luminosity of ~ 6x10^{40}
erg s^{-1}), but relatively highly absorbed ULX in the edge-on spiral galaxy NGC 5907. The ULX is
spectrally hard in X-rays (Gamma ~ 1.2-1.7, when fitted with an absorbed power-law), and has a previously-reported
hard spectral break consistent with it being in the ultraluminous accretion state. It is also relatively
highly absorbed for a ULX, with a column of ~ 0.4-0.9x10^{22} atom cm^{-2} in addition to the line-of-sight
column in our Galaxy. Although its X-ray spectra are well represented by accretion disc models,
its variability characteristics argue against this interpretation. The ULX spectra instead appear
dominated by a cool, optically-thick Comptonising corona. We discuss how the measured 9 per cent
rms variability and a hardening of the spectrum as its flux diminishes might be reconciled with the
effects of a very massive, radiatively-driven wind, and subtle changes in the corona respectively.
We speculate that the cool disc-like spectral component thought to be produced by the wind in other
ULXs may be missing from the observed spectrum due to a combination of a low temperature (~ 0.1 keV),
and the high column to the ULX. We find no evidence, other than its extreme X-ray luminosity, for the
presence of an intermediate mass black hole (~ 10^2 - 10^4 Msun) in this object. Rather, the observations
can be consistently explained by a massive (greater than ~ 20 Msun) stellar remnant black hole in
a super-Eddington accretion state.
