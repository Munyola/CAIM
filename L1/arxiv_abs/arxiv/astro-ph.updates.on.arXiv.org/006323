Accretion discs are generally warped. If a warp in a disc is too large, the disc can `break' apart into
two or more distinct planes, with only tenuous connections between them. Further if an initially
planar disc is subject to a strong differential precession, then it can be torn apart into discrete
annuli that precess effectively independently. In previous investigations, torque-balance
formulae have been used to predict where and when the disc breaks into distinct parts. In this work,
focusing on discs with Keplerian rotation and where the shearing motions driving the radial communication
of the warp are damped locally by turbulence (the `diffusive' regime), we investigate the stability
of warped discs to determine the precise criterion for an isolated warped disc to break. We find and
solve the dispersion relation, which in general yields three roots. We provide a comprehensive
analysis of this viscous-warp instability and the emergent growth rates and their dependence on
disc parameters. The physics of the instability can be understood as a combination of (1) a term which
would generally encapsulate the classical Lightman-Eardley instability in planar discs (given
by $\partial(\nu\Sigma)/\partial\Sigma < 0$) but is here modified by the warp to include $\partial(\nu_1|\psi|)/\partial|\psi|
< 0$ and (2) a similar condition acting on the diffusion of the warp amplitude given in simplified
form by $\partial(\nu_2|\psi|)/\partial|\psi| < 0$. We discuss our findings in the context of
discs with an imposed precession, and comment on the implications for different astrophysical
systems.
