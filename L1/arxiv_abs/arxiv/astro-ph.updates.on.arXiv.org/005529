Recent studies on the temperatures of red supergiants (RSGs) in the local universe provide us with
an excellent observational constraint on RSG models. We calibrate the mixing length parameter
by comparing model predictions with the empirical RSG temperatures in Small and Large Magellanic
Clouds, Milky Way, and M31, which are inferred from the TiO band and the spectral energy distribution
(SED). Although our RSG models are computed with the MESA code, our result may be applied to other
stellar evolution codes, including the BEC and TWIN codes. We find evidence that the mixing length
increases with increasing metallicity for both cases where the TiO and SED temperatures of RSGs
are used for the calibration. Together with the recent finding of a similar correlation in low-mass
red giants by Tayar et al, this implies that the metallicity dependence of the mixing length is a universal
feature in post-main sequence stars of both low and high masses. Our result implies that typical
Type IIP supernova (SN IIP) progenitors with initial masses of $\sim 10 - 16~M_\odot$ have a radius
range of $400 R_\odot \lesssim R \lesssim 800 R_\odot$ regardless of metallicity. As an auxiliary
result of this study, we find that the hydrogen-rich envelope mass of SN IIP progenitors for a given
initial mass is predicted to be largely independent of metallicity if the Ledoux criterion with
slow semiconvection is adopted, while the Schwarzschild models predict systematically more massive
hydrogen-rich envelopes for lower metallicity.
