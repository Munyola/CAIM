Context: The study of chemical abundance patterns in globular clusters is of key importance to constrain
the different candidates for intra-cluster pollution of light elements. Aims: We aim at deriving
accurate abundances for a large range of elements in the globular cluster 47 Tucanae (NGC 104) to
add new constraints to the pollution scenarios for this particular cluster, expanding the range
of previously derived element abundances. Methods: Using tailored 1D LTE atmospheric models together
with a combination of equivalent width measurements, LTE, and NLTE synthesis we derive stellar
parameters and element abundances from high-resolution, high signal-to-noise spectra of 13 red
giant stars near the tip of the RGB. Results: We derive abundances of a total 27 elements (O, Na, Mg,
Al, Si, Ca, Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Y, Zr, Mo, Ru, Ba, La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Eu, Dy). Departures
from LTE were taken into account for Na, Al and Ba. We find a mean [Fe/H] = $-0.78\pm0.07$ and $[\alpha/{\rm
Fe}]=0.34\pm0.03$ in good agreement with previous studies. The remaining elements show good agreement
with the literature, but the inclusion of NLTE for Al has a significant impact on the behaviour of
this key element. Conclusions: We confirm the presence of an Na-O anti-correlation in 47 Tucanae
found by several other works. Our NLTE analysis of Al shifts the [Al/Fe] to lower values, indicating
that this may be overestimated in earlier works. No evidence for an intrinsic variation is found
in any of the remaining elements.
