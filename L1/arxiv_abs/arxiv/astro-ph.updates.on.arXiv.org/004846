We present a comprehensive study of the relations between gas kinematics, metallicity, and stellar
mass in a sample of 82 GRB-selected galaxies using absorption and emission methods. We find the velocity
widths of both emission and absorption profiles to be a proxy of stellar mass. We also investigate
the velocity-metallicity correlation and its evolution with redshift and find the correlation
derived from emission lines to have a significantly smaller scatter compared to that found using
absorption lines. Using 33 GRB hosts with measured stellar mass and metallicitiy, we study the mass-metallicity
relation for GRB host galaxies in a stellar mass range of $10^{8.2} M_{\odot}$ to $10^{11.1} M_{\odot}$
and a redshift range of $ z\sim 0.3-3.4$. The GRB-selected galaxies appear to track the mass-metallicity
relation of star forming galaxies but with an offset of 0.15 towards lower metallicities. This offset
is comparable with the average error-bar on the metallicity measurements of the GRB sample and also
the scatter on the MZ relation of the general population. It is hard to decide whether this relatively
small offset is due to systematic effects or the intrinsic nature of GRB hosts. We also investigate
the possibility of using absorption-line metallicity measurements of GRB hosts to study the mass-metallicity
relation at high redshifts. Our analysis shows that the metallicity measurements from absorption
methods can significantly differ from emission metallicities and assuming identical measurements
from the two methods may result in erroneous conclusions.
