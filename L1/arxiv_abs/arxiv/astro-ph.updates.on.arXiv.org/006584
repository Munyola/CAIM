Eruptive variables are young stars that show episodic variations of brightness: EXors/FUors variations
are commonly associated with enhanced accretion outbursts occurring at intermittent cadence
of months/years (EXors) and decades/centuries (FUors). Variations that can be ascribed to a variable
extinction along their line of sight are instead classified as UXors. We aim at investigating the
long-term photometric behaviour of three sources classified as eruptive variables. We present
data from the archival plates of the Asiago Observatory relative to the fields where the targets
are located. For the sake of completeness we have also analysed the Harvard plates of the same regions
that cover a much longer historical period, albeit at a lower sensitivity, however we are only able
to provide upper limits. A total of 273 Asiago plates were investigated, providing a total of more
than 200 magnitudes for the three stars, which cover a period of about 34 yr between 1958 and 1991.
We have compared our data with more recently collected literature data. Our plates analysis of V2492
Cyg provides historical upper limits that seem not to be compatible with the level of the activity
monitored during the last decade. Therefore, recently observed accretion phenomena could be associated
with the outbursting episodes, more than repetitive obscuration. While a pure extinction does
not seem the only mechanism responsible for the ASASSN-15qi fluctuations, it can account quite
reasonably for the recent V350 Cep variations.
