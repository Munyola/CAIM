We quantify the quenching impact of the group environment using the spectroscopic survey GAMA to
z=0.2. The fraction of quiescent galaxies (red fraction), whether in groups or isolated, increases
with both stellar mass and large-scale (5 Mpc) density. At fixed stellar mass and density, the red
fraction of satellites and group centrals is higher than that of isolated galaxies, supporting
the idea of "group quenching" rather than satellite quenching. The quenching efficiency with respect
to isolated galaxies (a formalism that flattens out the effect of both stellar mass and density)
is an increasing function of central color, group stellar mass, and density for satellites of red
centrals only, inducing "galactic conformity" : the quenching efficiency is on average higher
for satellites of red centrals than of blue centrals. However most of the conformity signal originates
from the most massive groups, which reside in the densest environments around the reddest centrals.
The star-formation of blue satellites around red centrals in rich/massive groups is also slightly
suppressed compared to blue field galaxies of the same mass. In the range of group stellar mass that
red and blue centrals have in common, some amount of conformity persists at fixed group stellar mass,
independent of density. However, assuming a color-dependent halo-to-stellar-mass ratio, whereby
red central galaxies inhabit significantly more massive halos than blue ones of the same stellar
mass, we find that conformity disappears entirely at fixed halo mass.
