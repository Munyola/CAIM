The launch of the Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR) heralded a new era of sensitive
high energy X-ray spectroscopy for X-ray binaries (XRBs). In this paper we show how multiple physical
parameters can be measured from the accretion disk spectrum when the high-energy side of the disk
spectrum can be measured precisely using NuSTAR. This immediately makes two exciting developments
possible. If the mass and distance of the source are known, the continuum fitting method can be used
to calculate the spin and inner disk inclination independently of the iron line fitting method.
If the mass and distance are unknown, the two methods can be combined to constrain these values to
a narrow region of parameter space. In this paper we perform extensive simulations to establish
the reliability of these techniques. We find that with high quality spectra, spin and inclination
can indeed be simultaneously measured using the disk spectrum. These measurements are much more
precise at higher spin values, where the relativistic effects are stronger. The inclusion of a soft
X-ray snapshot observation alongside the NuSTAR data significantly improves the reliability,
particularly for lower temperature disks, as it gives a greatly improved measurement of the disk
peak. High signal to noise data are not necessary for this, as measuring the peak temperature is relatively
easy. We discuss the impact of systematic effects on this technique, and the implications of our
results such as robust measurements of accretion disk warps and XRB mass surveys.
