Constraining the sub-galactic matter-power spectrum on 1-10 kpc scales would make it possible
to distinguish between the concordance $\Lambda$CDM model and various alternative dark-matter
models due to the significantly different levels of predicted mass structure. Here, we demonstrate
a novel approach to observationally constrain the population of overall law-mass density fluctuations
in the inner regions of massive elliptical lens galaxies, based on the power spectrum of the associated
surface-brightness perturbations observable in highly magnified galaxy-scale Einstein rings
and gravitational arcs. The application of our method to the SLACS lens system SDSS J0252+0039 results
in the following limits (at the 99 per cent confidence level) on the dimensionless convergence-power
spectrum (and the associated standard deviation in aperture mass): $\Delta^{2}_{\delta\kappa}<1$
($\sigma_{AM}< 0.8 \times 10^8 M_\odot$) on 0.5-kpc scale, $\Delta^{2}_{\delta\kappa}<0.1$
($\sigma_{AM}< 1 \times 10^8 M_\odot$) on 1-kpc scale and $\Delta^{2}_{\delta\kappa}<0.01$
($\sigma_{AM}< 3 \times 10^8 M_\odot$) on 3-kpc scale. The estimated effect of CDM sub-haloes lies
considerably below these first observational upper-limit constraints on the level of inhomogeneities
in the projected total mass distribution of galactic haloes. Future analysis for a larger sample
of galaxy-galaxy strong lens systems will narrow down these constraints and rule out all cosmological
models predicting a significantly larger level of clumpiness on these critical sub-galactic scales.
