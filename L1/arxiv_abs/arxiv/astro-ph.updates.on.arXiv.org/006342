Solar eruptions are the main driver of space-weather disturbances at the Earth. Extreme events
are of particular interest, not only because of the scientific challenges they pose, but also because
of their possible societal consequences. Here we present a magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulation
of the 14 July 2000 Bastille Day eruption, which produced a very strong geomagnetic storm. After
constructing a thermodynamic MHD model of the corona and solar wind, we insert a magnetically stable
flux rope along the polarity inversion line of the eruption's source region and initiate the eruption
by boundary flows. More than 10^33 ergs of magnetic energy are released in the eruption within a few
minutes, driving a flare, an EUV wave, and a coronal mass ejection (CME) that travels in the outer
corona at about 1500 km/s, close to the observed speed. We then propagate the CME to Earth, using a
heliospheric MHD code. Our simulation thus provides the opportunity to test how well in situ observations
of extreme events are matched if the eruption is initiated from a stable magnetic-equilibrium state.
We find that the flux-rope center is very similar in character to the observed magnetic cloud, but
arrives about 8.5 hours later and about 15 degrees too far to the North, with field strengths that
are too weak by a factor of about 1.6. The front of the flux rope is highly distorted, exhibiting localized
magnetic-field concentrations as it passes 1 AU. We discuss these properties with regard to the
development of space-weather predictions based on MHD simulations of solar eruptions.
