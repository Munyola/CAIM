So far the masses of about 50 active galactic nuclei have been measured through the reverberation
mapping technique (RM). Most measurements have been performed for objects of moderate luminosity
and redshift, based on H$\beta$, which is also used to calibrate the scaling relation which allows
single-epoch (SE) mass determination based on AGN luminosity and the width of different emission
lines. The SE mass obtained from CIV$(1549 {\rm\AA})$ line shows a large spread around mean values,
due to complex structure and gas dynamics of the relevant emission region. Direct RM measures of
CIV exist for only 6 AGNs of low luminosity and redshift, and only one luminous quasar (Kaspi et al
2007). We have collected since 2003 photometric and spectroscopic observations of PG1247+267,
the most luminous quasar ever analyzed for RM. We provide light curves for the continuum and for CIV$(1549
{\rm\AA})$ and CIII]$(1909{\rm\AA})$, and measures of the reverberation time lags based on the
SPEAR method (Zu et al. 2011). The sizes of the line emission regions are in a ratio $R_{CIII]}/R_{CIV}\sim
2$, similar to the case of Seyfert galaxies, indicating for the first time a similar ionization stratification
in a luminous quasar and low luminosity nuclei. Due to relatively small broad line region size and
relatively narrow line widths, we estimate a small mass and an anomalously high Eddington ratio.
We discuss the possibility that either the shape of the emission region or an amplification of the
luminosity caused by gravitational lensing may be in part responsible of the result.
