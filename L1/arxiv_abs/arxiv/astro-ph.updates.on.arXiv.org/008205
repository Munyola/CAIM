The young shell-type supernova remnant (SNR) RX J1713.7-3946 has been studied as a suitable target
to test the SNR paradigm for the origin of Galactic cosmic rays. We present a spatially resolved spectroscopy
of the nonthermal X-ray emission in RX J1713.7-3946 with Chandra. In order to obtain X-ray properties
of the filamentary structures and their surrounding regions, we divide the southeastern (SE),
southwestern (SW), and northwestern (NW) parts of the SNR into subregions on the typical order of
several 10" and extract spectra from each subregion. Their photon indices are significantly different
among the subregions with a range of 1.8 < {\Gamma} < 3. In the SE part, the clear filaments are harder
({\Gamma} ~ 2.0) than the surrounding regions. This is a common feature often observed in young SNRs
and naturally interpreted as a consequence of synchrotron cooling. On the other hand, the bright
filamentary regions do not necessarily coincide with the hardest regions in the SW and NW parts.
We also find the SW filamentary region is rather relatively soft ({\Gamma} ~ 2.7). In addition, we
find that hard regions with photon indices of 2.0-2.2 exist around the bright emission although
they lie in the downstream region and does not appear to be the blast wave shock front. Both two aforementioned
characteristic regions in SW are located close to peaks of the interstellar gas. We discuss possible
origins of the spatial variation of the photon indices, paying particular attention to the shock-cloud
interactions.
