We present VIDE, the Void IDentification and Examination toolkit, an open-source Python/C++ code
for finding cosmic voids in galaxy redshift surveys and N-body simulations, characterizing their
properties, and providing a platform for more detailed analysis. At its core, VIDE uses a substantially
enhanced version of ZOBOV (Neyinck 2008) to calculate a Voronoi tessellation for estimating the
density field and a performing a watershed transform to construct voids. Additionally, VIDE provides
significant functionality for both pre- and post-processing: for example, vide can work with volume-
or magnitude-limited galaxy samples with arbitrary survey geometries, or dark matter particles
or halo catalogs in a variety of common formats. It can also randomly subsample inputs and includes
a Halo Occupation Distribution model for constructing mock galaxy populations. VIDE uses the watershed
levels to place voids in a hierarchical tree, outputs a summary of void properties in plain ASCII,
and provides a Python API to perform many analysis tasks, such as loading and manipulating void catalogs
and particle members, filtering, plotting, computing clustering statistics, stacking, comparing
catalogs, and fitting density profiles. While centered around ZOBOV, the toolkit is designed to
be as modular as possible and accommodate other void finders. VIDE has been in development for several
years and has already been used to produce a wealth of results, which we summarize in this work to highlight
the capabilities of the toolkit. VIDE is publicly available at this http URL public and this http
