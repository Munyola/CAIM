We present a statistical study of the redshift evolution of the cluster galaxy population over a
wide redshift range from 0.1 to 1.1, using $\sim 1900$ optically-selected CAMIRA clusters from
$\sim 232$~deg$^2$ of the Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) Wide S16A data. Our stacking technique with a
statistical background subtraction reveals color-magnitude diagrams of red-sequence and blue
cluster galaxies down to faint magnitudes of $m_z\sim 24$. We find that the linear relation of red-sequence
galaxies in the color-magnitude diagram extends down to the faintest magnitudes we explore with
a small intrinsic scatter $\sigma_{\rm int}(g-r)<0.1$. The scatter does not evolve significantly
with redshift. The stacked color-magnitude diagrams are used to define red and blue galaxies in
clusters for studying their radial number density profiles without resorting to photometric redshifts
of individual galaxies. We find that red galaxies are significantly more concentrated toward cluster
centers and blue galaxies dominate the outskirt of clusters. We explore the fraction of red galaxies
in clusters as a function of redshift, and find that the red fraction decreases with increasing distances
from cluster centers. The red fraction exhibits a moderate decrease with increasing redshift.
The radial number density profiles of cluster member galaxies are also used to infer the location
of the steepest slope in the three dimensional galaxy density profiles. For a fixed threshold in
richness, we find little redshift evolution in this location.
