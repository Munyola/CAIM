Growing interests in the chemical feature of r-process elements among nearby disk stars represented
by the [Eu/Fe] vs. [Fe/H] diagram have sprouted since it can assess the origin of r-process elements
through the comparison with theoretical models, including a test as to if neutron star mergers can
be the major site of r-process nucleosynthesis. On the other hand, recent studies reveal that local
chemistry is strongly coupled with the dynamics of Galactic disk, which predicts that stars radially
move on the disk where the observed elemental feature is different at various Galactocentric distances.
Here, we show that radial migration of stars across the Galactic disk plays a crucial role in shaping
the r-process abundance feature in the solar vicinity. In this proposed scenario, we highlight
the importance of migration from the outer disk where [r-process/Fe] of some old stars is predicted
to be enhanced to the level beyond the expectation from the observed Galactic Fe and Eu radial gradient,
which results in a large span of [r-process/Fe] among nearby disk stars. The variation in the [r-process/Fe]
ratio seen across the Galactic disk as well as in dwarf galaxies may be an outcome of different stellar
initial mass functions which change the occurrence frequency between supernovae leaving behind
neutron stars and ones ending with black holes. Here we propose that enhancement in [Eu/Fe] is attributed
to the initial mass function lacking high-mass stars such as > 25 solar masses in the scheme for which
neutron star mergers are a major source of r-process elements.
