We present the first VLBI observations of a Galactic water maser (in Chepeus A) made with a very long
baseline interferometric array involving the RadioAstron Earth-orbiting satellite station
as one of its elements. We detected two distinct components at -16.9 and 0.6 km/s with a fringe spacing
of 66 microarcseconds. In total power, the 0.6 km/s component appears to be a single Gaussian component
of strength 580 Jy and width of 0.7 km/s. Single-telescope monitoring showed that its lifetime was
only 8~months. The absence of a Zeeman pattern implies the longitudinal magnetic field component
is weaker than 120 mG. The space-Earth cross power spectrum shows two unresolved components smaller
than 15 microarcseconds, corresponding to a linear scale of 1.6 x 10^11 cm, about the diameter of
the Sun, for a distance of 700 pc, separated by 0.54 km/s in velocity and by 160 +/-35 microarcseconds
in angle. This is the smallest angular structure ever observed in a Galactic maser. The brightness
temperatures are greater than 2 x 10^14K, and the line widths are 0.5 km/s. Most of the flux (about
87%) is contained in a halo of angular size of 400 +/- 150 microarcseconds. This structure is associated
with the compact HII region HW3diii. We have probably picked up the most prominent peaks in the angular
size range of our interferometer. We discuss three dynamical models: (1) Keplerian motion around
a central object, (2) two chance overlapping clouds, and (3) vortices caused by flow around an obstacle
(i.e., von Karman vortex street) with Strouhal number of about~0.3.
