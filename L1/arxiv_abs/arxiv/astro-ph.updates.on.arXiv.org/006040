We present a study of the relative orientation between the plane-of-the-sky magnetic field and
the filamentary structures hosting the Planck Galactic Cold Clumps. In our analysis, the magnetic
field angles are obtained from the sub-millimeter linear polarization measurements by the Planck
satellite. We use an improved version of the Rolling Hough Transform method to detect the filamentary
structures in the Planck data. We separate the polarization angles in the filaments and their background
using the assumption of a linear contribution of both components to the observed Stokes Q and U parameters
in optically thin media. After geometrically separating the clump and filament contributions
to the signal, we observe a tendency for perpendicular alignment of the matter with the magnetic
field in the clumps located in high-density environments. The filaments without the clump contribution
exhibit mostly parallel alignment with the filament magnetic field orientation. We find that the
filamentary structures embedded in dense environments do not show any particular preferential
alignment whereas those embedded in low-density environments are mostly aligned with the background
magnetic field orientation. However, the filamentary structures that are sufficiently denser
than their surrounding exhibit a tendency to be perpendicular to the background magnetic field.
We also find that in dense environments the magnetic fields in the background and in the filamentary
structures are less likely to be aligned with each other.
