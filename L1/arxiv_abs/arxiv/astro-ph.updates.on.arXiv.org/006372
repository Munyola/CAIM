We present time-series $BVI$ photometry for the Galactic globular cluster NGC 6402 (M14). The data
consists of $\sim$137 images per filter, obtained using the 0.9m and 1.0m SMARTS telescopes at the
Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory. The images were obtained during two observing runs in
2006-2007. The image-subtraction package ISIS, along with DAOPHOT II/ALLFRAME, were used to perform
crowded-field photometry and search for variable stars. We identified 130 variables, 8 of which
are new discoveries. The variable star population is comprised of 56 ab-type RR Lyrae stars, 54 c-type
RR Lyrae, 6 type II Cepheids, 1 W UMa star, 1 detached eclipsing binary, and 12 long-period variables.
We provide Fourier decomposition parameters for the RR Lyrae, and discuss the physical parameters
and photometric metallicity derived therefrom. The M14 distance modulus is also discussed, based
on different approaches for the calibration of the absolute magnitudes of RR Lyrae stars. The possible
presence of second-overtone RR Lyrae in M14 is critically addressed, with our results arguing against
this possibility. By considering all of the RR Lyrae stars as members of the cluster, we derive $\langle
P_{ab}\rangle = 0.589$ d. This, together with the position of the RR Lyrae stars of both Bailey types
in the period-amplitude diagram, suggests an Oosterhoff-intermediate classification for the
cluster. Such an intermediate Oosterhoff type is much more commonly found in nearby extragalactic
systems, and we critically discuss several other possible indications that may point to an extragalactic
origin for this cluster.
