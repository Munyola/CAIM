We carried out an imaging survey for extrasolar planets around stars in the Pleiades (125 Myr, 135
pc) in the $H$ and $K_{S}$ bands using HiCIAO combined with the adaptive optics, AO188, on the Subaru
telescope. We found 13 companion candidates fainter than 14.5 mag in the $H$ band around 9 stars.
Five of these 13 were confirmed to be background stars by measurement of their proper motion. One
was not found in the second epoch observation, and thus was not a background or companion object.
One had multi-epoch image, but the precision of its proper motion was not sufficient to conclude
whether it was background object. Four other candidates are waiting for second epoch observations
to determine their proper motion. Finally, the remaining 2 were confirmed to be 60 $M_{J}$ brown
dwarf companions orbiting around HD 23514 (G0) and HII 1348 (K5) respectively, as had been reported
in previous studies. In our observations, the average detection limit for a point source was 20.3
mag in the $H$ band beyond 1''.5 from the central star. On the basis of this detection limit, we calculated
the detection efficiency to be 90% for a planet with 6 to 12 Jovian masses and a semi-major axis of 50--1000
AU. For this we extrapolated the distribution of planet mass and semi-major axis derived from RV
observations and adopted the planet evolution model of Baraffe et al. (2003). As there was no detection
of a planet, we estimated the frequency of such planets to be less than 17.9% ($2\sigma$) around one
star of the Pleiades cluster.
