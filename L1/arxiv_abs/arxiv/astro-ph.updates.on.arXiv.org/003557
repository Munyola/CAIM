We present archival Spitzer photometry and spectroscopy, and Herschel photometry, of the peculiar
"Green Valley" elliptical galaxy NGC~3226. The galaxy, which contains a low-luminosity AGN, forms
a pair with NGC~3227, and is shown to lie in a complex web of stellar and HI filaments. Imaging at 8 and
16$\mu$m reveals a curved plume structure 3 kpc in extent, embedded within the core of the galaxy,
and coincident with the termination of a 30 kpc-long HI tail. In-situ star formation associated
with the IR plume is identified from narrow-band HST imaging. The end of the IR-plume coincides with
a warm molecular hydrogen disk and dusty ring, containing 0.7-1.1 $\times$ 10$^7$ M$_{\odot}$
detected within the central kpc. Sensitive upper limits to the detection of cold molecular gas may
indicate that a large fraction of the H$_2$ is in a warm state. Photometry, derived from the UV to the
far-IR, shows evidence for a low star formation rate of $\sim$0.04 M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ averaged
over the last 100 Myrs. A mid-IR component to the Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) contributes
$\sim$20$\%$ of the IR luminosity of the galaxy, and is consistent with emission associated with
the AGN. The current measured star formation rate is insufficient to explain NGC3226's global UV-optical
"green" colors via the resurgence of star formation in a "red and dead" galaxy. This form of "cold
accretion" from a tidal stream would appear to be an inefficient way to rejuvenate early-type galaxies,
and may actually inhibit star formation.
