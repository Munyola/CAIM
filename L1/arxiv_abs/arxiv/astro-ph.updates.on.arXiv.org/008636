We report the serendipitous discovery of a dusty, starbursting galaxy at $z=5.667$ (hereafter
called CRLE) in close physical association with the "normal" main-sequence galaxy HZ10 at $z=5.654$.
CRLE was identified by detection of [CII], [NII] and CO(2-1) line emission, making it the highest
redshift, most luminous starburst in the COSMOS field. This massive, dusty galaxy appears to be
forming stars at a rate of at least 1500$\,M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ in a compact region only $\sim3$ kpc
in diameter. The dynamical and dust emission properties of CRLE suggest an ongoing merger driving
the starburst, in a potentially intermediate stage relative to other known dusty galaxies at the
same epoch. The ratio of [CII] to [NII] may suggest that an important ($\sim15\%$) contribution
to the [CII] emission comes from a diffuse ionized gas component, which could be more extended than
the dense, starbursting gas. CRLE appears to be located in a significant galaxy overdensity at the
same redshift, potentially associated with a large-scale cosmic structure recently identified
in a Lyman Alpha Emitter survey. This overdensity suggests that CRLE and HZ10 reside in a protocluster
environment, offering the tantalizing opportunity to study the effect of a massive starburst on
protocluster star formation. Our findings support the interpretation that a significant fraction
of the earliest galaxy formation may occur from the inside out, within the central regions of the
most massive halos, while rapidly evolving into the massive galaxy clusters observed in the local
Universe.
