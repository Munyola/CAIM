To elucidate the flare trigger mechanism, we have analyzed several flare events which were observed
by Hinode/Solar Optical Telescope (SOT), in our previous study. Because of the limitation of SOT
field of view, however, only four events in the Hinode data sets have been utilizable. Therefore,
increasing the number of events is required for evaluating the flare trigger models. We investigated
the applicability of data obtained by the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) to increase the data
sample for a statistical analysis of the flare trigger process. SDO regularly observes the full
disk of the sun and all flares although its spatial resolution is lower than that of Hinode. We investigated
the M6.6 flare which occurred on 13 February 2011 and compared the analyzed data of SDO with the results
of our previous study using Hinode/SOT data. Filter and vector magnetograms obtained by the Helioseismic
and Magnetic Imager (HMI) and filtergrams from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) 1600A were
employed. From the comparison of small-scale magnetic configurations and chromospheric emission
prior to the flare onset, we confirmed that the trigger region is detectable with the SDO data. We
also measured the magnetic shear angles of the active region and the azimuth and strength of the flare-trigger
field. The results were consistent with our previous study. We concluded that statistical studies
of the flare trigger process are feasible with SDO as well as Hinode data. We also investigated the
temporal evolution of the magnetic field before the flare onset with SDO.
