We present Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array radio observations of the long GRB 161219B ($z=0.147$)
spanning $1-37$ GHz. The data exhibit unusual behavior, including sharp spectral peaks and minutes-timescale
large amplitude variability centered at $20$ GHz and spanning the full frequency range. We attribute
this behavior to scattering of the radio emission by the turbulent ionized Galactic interstellar
medium (ISM), including both diffractive and refractive scintillation. However, the scintillation
is much stronger than predicted by a model of the Galactic electron density distribution (NE2001);
from the measured variability timescale and decorrelation bandwidth we infer a scattering measure
of $SM\approx 3.8\times 10^{-3}$ kpc m$^{-20/3}$ ($15$ times larger than predicted in NE2001)
and a scattering screen distance of $d_{\rm scr}\approx 0.6$ kpc. We infer an emission region size
of $\theta_s \approx 2$ $\mu$as ($\approx 2\times 10^{16}$ cm) at $\approx4$ days, and find that
prior to 8 days the source size is an order of magnitude smaller than model predictions for a uniformly
illuminated disk or limb-brightened ring, indicating a slightly off-axis viewing angle or significant
substructure in the emission region. Simultaneous multi-hour broadband radio observations of
future GRB afterglows will allow us to characterize the scintillation more completely, and hence
to probe the observer viewing angle, the evolution of the jet Lorentz factor, the structure of the
afterglow emission regions, and ISM turbulence at high Galactic latitudes.
