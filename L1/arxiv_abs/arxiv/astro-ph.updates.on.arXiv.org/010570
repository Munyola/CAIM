We revisit the process of grain alignment by Radiative Torques (RATs) and focus on constraining
magnetic susceptibility of grains via observations. We discuss the possibility of observational
testing of the magnetic properties of grains as the alignment changes from being in respect to the
magnetic field to being in respect to the radiation direction. This opens both a possibility of constraining
the uncertain parameters of the RATs theory and providing a new way of measuring magnetic fields
in interstellar medium and circumstellar regions. We provide a detailed discussion of the precession
induced both by the magnetic field and the anisotropic radiation and revisit a number of key processes
related to magnetic response of the grains. We consider various effects that increase the rate of
magnetic relaxation both in silicate and carbonaceous grains. In particular, we identify physical
processes that enhance the internal relaxation in wobbling grains. We show that these processes
significantly change the dynamics of grains in the presence of the RATs. In the paper we consider
the alignment of grains with a variety of magnetic responses, from the carbonaceous grains with
reduced magnetic moments and silicate grains with larger magnetic moment to the superparamagnetic
grains for which the magnetic moments are significantly larger. Finally, we apply our analysis
for observed grain alignment in special environment and obtain stringent constraints on the enhanced
magnetic properties of dust grains in the cloud near supernovae, in cometary coma, and protoplanetary
disks.
