We examined the structure near the solar limb in TRACE images of the continuum and in the 1600 and 171
A bands as well as in SDO images in the continuum (from HMI) and all AIA bands. The images in different
wavelength bands were carefully coaligned by using the position of Mercury for TRACE and Venus for
SDO during their transit in front of the solar disk in 1999 and 2012 respectively. Chromospheric
absorbing structures in the TRACE 171 A band are best visible 7" above the white light limb, very close
to the inner limb, defined as the inflection point of the rising part of the center-to-limb intensity
variation. They are correlated with, but are not identical to spicules in emission, seen in the 1600
A band. Similar results were obtained from AIA and SOT images. Tall spicules in 304 A are not associated
with any absorption in the higher temperature bands. Performing azimuthal averaging of the intensity
over 15 degree sectors near the N, S, E and W limbs, we measured the height of the limb and of the peak
intensity in all AIA bands. We found that the inner limb height in the transition region AIA bands
increases with wavelength, consistent with a bound-free origin of the absorption from neutral
H and He. From that we computed the column density and the density of neutral hydrogen as a function
of height. We estimated a height of (2300 $\pm$ 500)km for the base of the transition region. Finally,
we measured the scale height of the AIA emission of the corona and associated it with the temperature;
we deduced a value of (1.24 $\pm$ 0.25) 10$^6$ K for the polar corona.
