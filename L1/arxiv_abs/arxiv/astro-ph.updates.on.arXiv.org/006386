The architecture of exoplanetary systems is relatively well known inward to 1 AU thanks to indirect
techniques, which have allowed characterization of thousands of exoplanet orbits, masses and
sometimes radii. The next step is the characterization of exoplanet atmospheres at long period,
which requires direct imaging capability. While the characterization of a handful of young giant
planets is feasible with dedicated instruments like SPHERE/VLT, GPI/Gemini, SCExAO/Subaru and
soon with the coronagraphic capabilities aboard JWST, the spectroscopic study of mature giant
planets and lower mass planets (Neptune-like, Super Earths) requires the achievement of better
coronagraphic performance. While space-based coronagraph on WFIRST-AFTA might start this study
at low spectroscopic resolution, dedicated projects on large space telescope and on the ELT will
be required for a more complete spectroscopic study of these faint planets. To prepare these future
instruments, we developed a high contrast imaging bench called THD, then THD2 for the upgraded version
using multi-DM configuration. The THD2 bench is designed to test and compare coronagraphs as well
as focal plane wavefront sensors and wavefront control techniques. It can simulate the beam provided
by a space telescope and soon the first stage of adaptive optics behind a ground-based telescope.
In this article, we describe in details the THD2 bench and give the results of a recent comparison
study of the chromatic behavior for several coronagraph on the THD2.
