We present a radio and X-ray study of PKS 1353-341, the brightest cluster galaxy radio source at the
center of a recent Chandra-discovered X-ray cluster. Our multi-frequency VLA images reveal an
edge-brightened (FR-II), double-lobed structure with total ~50 kpc extent and 1.5 GHz power of
$1.2\times10^{25}$ W Hz$^{-1}$, separated from the bright, arcsecond-scale core. We reanalyzed
the Chandra data and found the X-ray emitting AGN is offset by ~9 kpc from a compact X-ray cool-core
with temperature, $kT=3.1\pm0.5$ keV, and a radius of ~22 kpc, surrounded by a hotter $kT=6.3\pm0.7$
keV gas out to ~50 kpc. The offset suggests sloshing inside the cool-core induced by a minor merger
or a past outburst of the AGN that produced the large-scale radio lobes. The comparable spatial scales
of the lobes with the interface between the different temperature X-ray plasma indicate the lobes
are actively heating the outer layers of what is now a remnant compact cool-core. Our dual-frequency
VLBA images reveal substructure in the central radio source, consisting of a radio core with double-sided
pc-scale jets pointing toward the kpc-scale structures. The northern jet is detected only at 8.4
GHz, indicating its emission is behind an absorbing torus or disk. We also measured faster apparent
motions in the southern jet up to $1.9\pm1.1c$ than in the northern jet ($0.8\pm0.5c$). While the
VLBA observations indicate the southern jet is aligned slightly closer to our line of sight, the
asymmetries are overall modest and imply minimal projection effects in the large-scale radio structures.
