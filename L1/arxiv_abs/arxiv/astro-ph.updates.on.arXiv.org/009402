Self-organization properties of sustained magnetized plasma are applied to selected solar data
to understand solar magnetic fields. Torsional oscillations are speed-up and slow-down bands
of the azimuthal flow that correlate with the solar cycle, and they imply the existence of a symmetric
solar dynamo with a measured polar flux of 3x10^14 Wb. It is shown that the solar dynamo is thin (~0.1
Mm gradient scale size) and powerful (~10^23 W). These properties are found from the amplitude of
the torsional oscillations and the relationship of their velocity contours to solar magnetograms
supports the result. The dynamo has enough power to heat the chromosphere and to power the corona
and the solar wind. The dynamo also causes a rigid rotation of the heliosphere out to at least the corona
and the relationship of the rotation of the corona to solar magnetograms supports this result as
well. The thin solar dynamo sustains a thin stable minimum energy state that seems to be covering
most of the solar surface just below the photosphere. The magnetic field lines of the minimum energy
state should be parallel to the solar surface and rotate with distance from the surface with 2{\pi}
radians of rotation in ~1 Mm Resistive diffusion helps to push the magnetic fields to the surface
and the global magnetic structure (GMS) seems to lose {\pi} radians every 11 years, causing the observed
180 degree flipping of the solar magnetic field. The thin sheets of magnetized plasma in solar prominences
may be the lost thin sheets of the GMS. For completeness, the formation of sunspots, CMEs and flares
is discussed.
