We report Gemini-South GMOS observations of the exoplanet system WASP-29 during primary transit
as a test case for differential spectrophotometry. We use the multi-object spectrograph to observe
the target star and a comparison star simultaneously to produce multiple light curves at varying
wavelengths. The 'white' light curve and fifteen 'spectral' light curves are analysed to refine
the system parameters and produce a transmission spectrum from 515 to 720nm. All light curves exhibit
time-correlated noise, which we model using a variety of techniques. These include a simple noise
rescaling, a Gaussian process model, and a wavelet based method. These methods all produce consistent
results, although with different uncertainties. The precision of the transmission spectrum is
improved by subtracting a common signal from all the spectral light curves, reaching a typical precision
of ~1x10^-4 in transit depth. The transmission spectrum is free of spectral features, and given
the non-detection of a pressure broadened Na feature, we can rule out the presence of a Na rich atmosphere
free of clouds or hazes, although we cannot rule out a narrow Na core. This indicates that Na is not
present in the atmosphere, and/or that clouds/hazes play a significant role in the atmosphere and
mask the broad wings of the Na feature, although the former is a more likely explanation given WASP-29b's
equilibrium temperature of ~970 K, at which Na can form various compounds. We also briefly discuss
the use of Gaussian process and wavelet methods to account for time correlated noise in transit light
curves.
