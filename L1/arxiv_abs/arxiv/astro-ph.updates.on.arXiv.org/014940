The detection of GW170817 is revolutionizing many areas of astrophysics with the joint observation
of gravitational waves and electromagnetic emissions. These multi-messenger events provide
a new approach to determine the Hubble constant, thus, they are a promising candidate for mitigating
the tension between measurements of Type Ia supernovae via the local distance ladder and the Cosmic
Microwave Background. In addition to the "standard siren" provided by the gravitational-wave
measurement, the kilonova itself has characteristics that allow to improve existing measurements
or to perform yet another, independent measurement of the Hubble constant without gravitational-wave
information. Here, we employ standardization techniques borrowed from the type-Ia community
and apply them to kilonovae, not using any information from the gravitational-wave signal. We use
two versions of this technique, one derived from direct observables measured from the lightcurve,
and the other based on inferred ejecta parameters, e.g., mass, velocity, and composition. According
to these techniques, we obtain constraints of $D = 31^{+17}_{-11}$ Mpc or $D = 36^{+9}_{-7}$ Mpc
(median and symmetric 68% credible interval) for the distance of GW170817 for the measured and inferred
analysis respectively. These lead to Hubble Constant measurements of $H_0 = 109^{+49}_{-35}$
km $\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ $\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ and $H_0 = 85^{+21}_{-16}$ km $\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ $\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$.
We show in this way that the kilonova measurement is competitive with the gravitational-wave measurements
as an independent constraint on $H_0$.
