In a recent paper (Gond\'an et al. 2018), we determined the measurement accuracy of physical parameters
for eccentric, precessing, non-spinning, inspiraling, stellar-mass BH-BH binaries for the upcoming
second-generation LIGO/VIRGO/KAGRA detector network at design sensitivity using the Fisher
matrix method. Here we extend that study to a wide range of binary masses including NS-NS, NS-BH,
and BH-BH binaries with BH masses up to $110 \, M_{\odot}$. The measurement error of eccentricity
$e_{10 \,\rm Hz}$ at a GW frequency of $10 \, {\rm Hz}$ is in the range $(10^{-4}-10^{-3}) \times (D_L/
100\,\rm Mpc)$ for NS-NS, NS-BH, and BH-BH binaries at a luminosity distance of $D_L$ if $e_{10 \,\rm
Hz} \gtrsim 0.1 $. For events with masses and distances similar to the detected ten GW transients,
we show that nonzero orbital eccentricities may be detected if $0.081 \lesssim e_{10 \,\rm Hz}$.
Consequently, the LIGO/VIRGO/KAGRA detector network at design sensitivity will have the capability
to distinguish between eccentric waveforms and circular waveforms. In comparison to circular
inspirals, we find that the chirp mass measurement precision can improve by up to a factor of $\sim
20$ and $\sim 50-100$ for NS-NS and NS-BH binaries with BH companion masses $\lesssim 40 \, M_{\odot}$,
respectively, the identification of eccentric sources may give information on their astrophysical
origin; it would indicate merging binaries in triple or higher multiplicity systems or dynamically
formed binaries in dense stellar systems such as globular clusters or galactic nuclei.
