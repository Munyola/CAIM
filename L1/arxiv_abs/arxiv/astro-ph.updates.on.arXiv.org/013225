Early type galaxies (ETGs) frequently show emission from warm ionized gas. These Low Ionization
Emission Regions (LIERs) were originally attributed to a central, low-luminosity active galactic
nuclei. However, the recent discovery of spatially-extended LIER emission suggests ionization
by both a central source and an extended component that follows a stellar-like radial distribution.
For passively-evolving galaxies with old stellar populations, hot post-Asymptotic Giant Branch
(AGB) stars are the only viable extended source of ionizing photons. In this work, we present the
first prediction of LIER-like emission from post-AGB stars that is based on fully self-consistent
stellar evolution and photoionization models. We show that models where post-AGB stars are the
dominant source of ionizing photons reproduce the nebular emission signatures observed in ETGs,
including LIER-like emission line ratios in standard optical diagnostic diagrams and H$\alpha$
equivalent widths of order 0.1-3 angstroms. We test the sensitivity of LIER-like emission to the
details of post-AGB models, including the mass loss efficiency and convective mixing efficiency,
and show that line strengths are relatively insensitive to post-AGB timescale variations. Finally,
we examine the UV-optical colors of the models and the stellar populations responsible for the UV-excess
observed in some ETGs. We find that allowing as little as 3% of the HB population to be uniformly distributed
to very hot temperatures (30,000 K) produces realistic UV colors for old, quiescent ETGs.
