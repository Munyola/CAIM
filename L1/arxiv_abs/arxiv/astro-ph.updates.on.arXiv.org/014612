Theoretical studies suggest that a giant planet around the young star MWC 758 could be responsible
for driving the spiral features in its circumstellar disk. Here, we present a deep imaging campaign
with the Large Binocular Telescope with the primary goal of imaging the predicted planet. We present
images of the disk in two epochs in the $L^{\prime}$ filter (3.8 $\mu m$) and a third epoch in the $M^{\prime}$
filter (4.8 $\mu m$). The two prominent spiral arms are detected in each observation, which constitute
the first images of the disk at $M^\prime$, and the deepest yet in $L^\prime$ ($\Delta L^\prime=$12.1
exterior to the disk at 5$\sigma$ significance). We report the detection of a S/N$\sim$3.9 source
near the end of the Sourthern arm, and, from the source's detection at a consistent position and brightness
during multiple epochs, we establish a $\sim$90% confidence-level that the source is of astrophysical
origin. We discuss the possibilities that this feature may be a) an unresolved disk feature, and
b) a giant planet responsible for the spiral arms, with several arguments pointing in favor of the
latter scenario. We present additional detection limits on companions exterior to the spiral arms,
which suggest that a $\lesssim$4 M$_{Jup}$ planet exterior to the spiral arms could have escaped
detection. Finally, we do not detect the companion candidate interior to the spiral arms reported
recently by Reggiani et al. (2018), although forward modelling suggests that such a source would
have likely been detected.
