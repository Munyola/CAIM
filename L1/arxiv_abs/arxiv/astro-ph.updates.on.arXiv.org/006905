Spiral density waves dominate several facets of accretion disc dynamics --- planet-disc interactions
and gravitational instability (GI) most prominently. Though they have been examined thoroughly
in two-dimensional simulations, their vertical structures in the non-linear regime are somewhat
unexplored. This neglect is unwarranted given that any strong vertical motions associated with
these waves could profoundly impact dust dynamics, dust sedimentation, planet formation, and
the emissivity of the disc surface. In this paper we combine linear calculations and shearing box
simulations in order to investigate the vertical structure of spiral waves for various polytropic
stratifications and wave amplitudes. For sub-adiabatic profiles we find that spiral waves develop
a pair of counter-rotating poloidal rolls. Particularly strong in the nonlinear regime, these
vortical structures issue from the baroclinicity supported by the background vertical entropy
gradient. They are also intimately connected to the disk's g-modes which appear to interact nonlinearly
with the density waves. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the poloidal rolls are ubiquitous in gravitoturbulence,
emerging in the vicinity of GI spiral wakes, and potentially transporting grains off the disk midplane.
Other than hindering sedimentation and planet formation, this phenomena may bear on observations
of the disk's scattered infrared luminosity. The vortical features could also impact on the turbulent
dynamo operating in young protoplanetary discs subject to GI, or possibly even galactic discs.
