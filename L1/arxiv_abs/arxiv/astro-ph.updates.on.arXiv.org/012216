Comets are thought to have information about the formation process of our solar system. Recently,
detailed information about comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko has been found by a spacecraft mission
Rosetta. It is remarkable that its tensile strength was estimated. In this paper, we measure and
formulate the tensile strength of porous dust aggregates using numerical simulations, motivated
by porous dust aggregation model of planetesimal formation. We perform three-dimensional numerical
simulations using a monomer interaction model with periodic boundary condition. We stretch out
a dust aggregate with a various initial volume filling factor between $10^{-2}$ and 0.5. We find
that the tensile stress takes the maximum value at the time when the volume filling factor decreases
to about a half of the initial value. The maximum stress is defined to be the tensile strength. We take
an average of the results with 10 different initial shapes to smooth out the effects of initial shapes
of aggregates. Finally, we numerically obtain the relation between the tensile strength and the
initial volume filling factor of dust aggregates. We also use a simple semi-analytical model and
successfully reproduce the numerical results, which enables us to apply to a wide parameter range
and different materials. The obtained relation is consistent with previous experiments and numerical
simulations about silicate dust aggregates. We estimate that the monomer radius of comet 67P has
to be about 3.3--220 $\mathrm{\mu m}$ to reproduce its tensile strength using our model.
