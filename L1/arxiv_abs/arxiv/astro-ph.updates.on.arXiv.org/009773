Hard X-ray (HXR) sources are frequently observed near the top of solar flare loops, and the emission
is widely ascribed to bremsstrahlung. We here revisit an alternative scenario which stresses the
importance of inverse Compton processes and the Kelvin- Helmholtz instability (KHI) proposed
by Fang et al. (2016). This scenario adds a novel ingredient to the standard flare model, where evaporation
flows from flare-impacted chromospheric foot-points interact with each other near the loop top
and produce turbulence via KHI. The turbulence can act as a trapping region and as an efficient accelerator
to provide energetic electrons, which scatter soft X-ray (SXR) photons to HXR photons via the inverse
Compton mechanism. This paper focuses on the trigger of the KHI and the resulting turbulence in this
new scenario. We perform a parameter survey to investigate the necessary ingredients to obtain
KHI through interaction of chromospheric evaporation flows. When turbulence is produced in the
loop apex, an index of -5/3 can be found in the spectra of velocity and magnetic field fluctuations.
The KHI development and the generation of turbulence are controlled by the amount of energy deposited
in the chromospheric foot-points and the time scale of its energy deposition, but typical values
for M class flares show the KHI development routinely. Asymmetry of energy deposition determines
the location where the turbulence is produced, and the synthesized SXR light curve shows a clear
periodic signal related to the sloshing motion of the vortex pattern created by the KHI.
