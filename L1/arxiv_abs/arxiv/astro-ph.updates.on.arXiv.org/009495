EGB6 is an extended, faint old planetary nebula (PN) with an enigmatic nucleus. The central star
(PG0950+139) is a hot DAOZ-type white dwarf (WD). An unresolved, compact emission knot was discovered
to be located 0.166" away from the WD and it was shown to be centered around a dust-enshrouded low-luminosity
star. It was argued that the dust disk and evaporated gas (photoionized by the hot WD) around the companion
are remnants of a disk formed by wind material captured from the WD progenitor when it was an asymptotic
giant branch (AGB) star. In this paper, we assess the hot WD to determine its atmospheric and stellar
parameters. We performed a model-atmosphere analysis of ultraviolet (UV) and optical spectra.
We found Teff = 105,000 +/- 5000 K, log g = 7.4 +/- 0.4, and a solar helium abundance (He = 0.25 +/- 0.1,
mass fraction). We measured the abundances of ten more species (C, N, O, F, Si, P, S, Ar, Fe, Ni) and
found essentially solar abundance values, indicating that radiation-driven wind mass-loss,
with a theoretical rate of log(dot-M/M_sun/yr) = -11.0 (+1.1)(-0.8) prevents the gravitational
separation of elements in the photosphere. The WD has a mass of M/M_sun = 0.58 (+0.12)(-0.04) and
its post-AGB age (log(t_evol/yr) = 3.60 (+1.26)(-0.09)) is compatible with the PN kinematical
age of log(t_PN}/yr) = 4.2. In addition, we examined the UV spectrum of the hot nucleus of a similar
object with a compact emission region, TOL26 (PN G298.0+34.8), and found that it is a slightly cooler
DAOZ WD (Teff about 85,000 K), but this WD shows signatures of gravitational settling of heavy elements.
