We investigate a progenitor mass distribution of core-collapse supernova remnants (CCSNRs) in
our Galaxy and the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds, for the first time. We count the number of CCSNRs
in three mass ranges divided by the zero-age main-sequence mass, $M_{\rm ZAMS}$; A: $M_{\rm ZAMS}
< 15\ {\rm M}_\odot$, B: $15\ {\rm M}_\odot < M_{\rm ZAMS} < 22.5\ {\rm M}_\odot$, C: $M_{\rm ZAMS}
> 22.5\ {\rm M}_\odot$. Simple compilation of progenitor masses in the literature yields a progenitor
mass distribution of $f_{\rm A}: f_{\rm B}: f_{\rm C} =0.24:0.28:0.48$, where $f$ is the number
fraction of the progenitors. The distribution is inconsistent with any standard initial mass functions.
We notice, however, that previous mass estimates are subject to large systematic uncertainties
because most of the relative abundances (X/Si) are not really good probe for the progenitor masses.
Instead, we propose to rely only on the Fe/Si ratio which is sensitive to the CO core mass ($M_{\rm
COcore}$) and $M_{\rm ZAMS}$. Comparing Fe/Si ratios in SNRs in the literature with the newest theoretical
model, we estimate 33 $M_{\rm COcore}$ and $M_{\rm ZAMS}$, leading to a revised progenitor mass
distribution of $f_{\rm A}: f_{\rm B}: f_{\rm C} = 0.47: 0.32 : 0.21$. This is consistent with the
standard Salpeter initial mass function. However, the relation between $M_{\rm COcore}$ and $M_{\rm
ZAMS}$ could be affected by binary evolution, which is not taken into account in this study and should
be considered in the future work to derive a better progenitor mass distribution estimate.
