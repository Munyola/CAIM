Using the Renaissance suite of simulations we examine the emergence of pristine atomic cooling
haloes that are both metal-free and star-free in the early Universe. The absence of metals prevents
catastrophic cooling, suppresses fragmentation, and may allow for the formation of massive black
hole seeds. Here we report on the abundance of pristine atomic cooling haloes found and on the specific
physical conditions that allow for the formation of these direct-collapse-black-hole (DCBH)
haloes. In total in our simulations we find that 79 DCBH haloes form before a redshift of 11.6. We find
that the formation of pristine atomic haloes is driven by the rapid assembly of the atomic cooling
haloes with mergers, both minor and/or major, prior to reaching the atomic cooling limit a requirement.
However, the ability of assembling haloes to remain free of (external) metal enrichment is equally
important and underlines the necessity of following the transport of metals in such simulations.
The candidate DCBH hosting haloes we find, have been exposed to mean Lyman-Werner radiation fields
of J$_{LW}$ $\sim$ 1 J$_{21}$ and typically lie at least 10 kpc (physical) from the nearest massive
galaxy. Growth rates of the haloes reach values of greater than 10$^7$ M$_{\odot}$ per unit redshift,
leading to significant dynamical heating and the suppression of efficient cooling until the halo
crosses the atomic cooling threshold. Finally, we also find five synchronised halo candidates
where pairs of pristine atomic cooling haloes emerge that are both spatially and temporally synchronised.
