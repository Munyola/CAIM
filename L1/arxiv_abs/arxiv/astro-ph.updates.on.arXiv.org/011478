We investigate the role that planet detection order plays in the Kepler planet detection pipeline.
The Kepler pipeline typically detects planets in order of descending signal strength (MES). We
find that the detectability of transits experiences an additional $5.5\%$ and $15.9\%$ efficiency
loss, for periods $<200$ days and $>200$ days respectively, when detected after the strongest signal
transit in a multiple-planet system. We provide a method for determining the transit probability
for multiple-planet systems by marginalizing over the empirical Kepler dataset. Furthermore,
because detection efficiency appears to be a function of detection order, we discuss the sorting
statistics that affect the radius and period distributions of each detection order. Our occurrence
rate dataset includes radius measurement updates from the California Kepler Survey (CKS), Gaia
DR2, and asteroseismology. Our population model is consistent with the results of Burke et al. (2015),
but now includes an improved estimate of the multiplicity distribution. From our obtained model
parameters, we find that only $4.0\pm4.6\%$ of solar-like GK dwarfs harbor one planet. This excess
is smaller than prior studies and can be well modeled with a modified Poisson distribution, suggesting
that the Kepler Dichotomy can be accounted for by including the effects of multiplicity on detection
efficiency. Using our modified Poisson model we expect the average number of planets is $5.86\pm0.18$
planets per GK dwarf within the radius and period parameter space of Kepler.
