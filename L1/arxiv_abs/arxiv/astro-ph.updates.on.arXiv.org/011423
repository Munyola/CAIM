We investigate the conditions at which high-mode magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves propagating
in a spinning solar macrospicule can become unstable with respect to the Kelvin--Helmholtz instability
(KHI). We consider the macrospicule as a weakly twisted cylindrical magnetic flux tube moving along
and rotating around its axis. Our study is based on the dispersion relation (in complex variable)
of MHD waves obtained from the linearized MHD equations of incompressible plasma for the macrospicule
and cool (zero beta) plasma for its environment. That dispersion equation is solved numerically
at appropriate input parameters to find out an instability region/window that accommodates suitable
unstable wavelengths of the order of macro\-spicule's width. It is established that a $m = 52$ MHD
mode propagating in a macro\-spicule with width of $6$~Mm, axial velocity of $75$~km\,s$^{-1}$
and rotating one of $40$~km\,s$^{-1}$ can become unstable against KHI with instability growth
times of $2.2$ and $0.57$~min at $3$ and $5$~Mm unstable wavelengths, respectively. These growth
times are much shorter than the macrospicule lifetime of around $15$~min. An increase/decease
in the width of the jet would change the KHI growth times remaining more or less of the same order when
are evaluated at wavelengths equal to the width/radius of the macrospicule. It is worth noticing
that the excited MHD modes are supper-Alfv\'enic waves. A change in the background magnetic field
can lead to another MHD mode number $m$ that ensures the required instability window.
