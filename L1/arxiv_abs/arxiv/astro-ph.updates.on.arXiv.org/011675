The large Integral Field Spectroscopy (IFS) surveys have allowed the classification of ionizing
sources of emission lines on sub-kpc scales. In this work, we define two non-parametric parameters,
quiescence (f$_{q}$) and its concentration (c$_{q}$), to quantify the strength and the spatial
distribution of the quenched areas, respectively, traced by the LI(N)ER regions with low EW(H$\alpha$).
With these two measurements, we classify MaNGA galaxies into inside-out and outside-in quenching
types according to their locations on the f$_{q}$ vs. c$_{q}$ plane and we measure the fraction of
inside-out (outside-in) quenching galaxies as a function of halo mass. We find that the fraction
of galaxies showing inside-out quenching increases with halo mass, irrespective of stellar mass
or galaxy type (satellites vs. centrals). In addition, high stellar mass galaxies exhibit a greater
fraction of inside-out quenching compared to low stellar mass ones in all environments. In contrast,
the fraction of outside-in quenching does not depend on halo mass. Our results suggest that morphological
quenching may be responsible for the inside-out quenching seen in all environments. On the other
hand, the flat dependence of the outside-in quenching on halo mass could be a mixed result of ram-pressure
stripping and galaxy mergers. Nevertheless, at a given environment and stellar mass, the fraction
of inside-out quenching is systematically greater than that of outside-in quenching, suggesting
that inside-out quenching is the dominant quenching mode in all environments.
