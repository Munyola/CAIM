The habitable zone (HZ) is the circumstellar region where standing bodies of liquid water could
exist on the surface of a rocky planet. Conventional definitions assume that CO2 and H2O are the only
greenhouse gases. The outer edge of this classical N2-CO2-H2O HZ extends out to nearly 1.7 AU in our
solar system, beyond which condensation and scattering by CO2 outstrip its greenhouse capacity.
We use a single column radiative-convective climate model to assess the greenhouse effect of CH4
(10 to about 100,000 ppm) on the classical habitable zone (N2-CO2-H2O) for main-sequence stars
with stellar temperatures between 2,600 to 10,000 K (about A3 to M8). Assuming N2-CO2-H2O atmospheres,
previous studies have shown that cooler stars more effectively heat terrestrial planets. However,
we find that the addition of CH4 produces net greenhouse warming (tens of degrees) in planets orbiting
stars hotter than a mid-K (about 4500K), whereas a prominent anti-greenhouse effect is noted for
planets around cooler stars. We show that 10% CH4 can increase the width of the classical HZ of the
hottest stars (TEFF = 10,000 K) by over 20%. In contrast, the CH4 anti-greenhouse can shrink the HZ
for the coolest stars (TEFF = 2,600 K) by a similar percentage. We find that dense CO2-CH4 atmospheres
near the outer edge of hotter stars may suggest inhabitance, highlighting the importance of including
secondary greenhouse gases in alternative definitions of the HZ. We parameterize the limits of
this N2-CO2-H2O-CH4 habitable zone and discuss implications in the search for extraterrestrial
life.
