From 1988 to 2016, several stellar occultations have been observed to characterize Pluto's atmosphere
and its evolution (Meza et al, 2019). From each stellar occultation, an accurate astrometric position
of Pluto at the observation epoch is derived. These positions mainly depend on the position of the
occulted star and the precision of the timing. We present Pluto's astrometric positions derived
from 19 occultations from 1988 to 2016 (11 from Meza et al. (2019) and 8 from other publications).
Using Gaia DR2 for the positions of the occulted stars, the accuracy of these positions is estimated
to 2-10~milliarcsec depending on the observation circumstances. From these astrometric positions,
we derive an updated ephemeris of Pluto's system barycentre using the NIMA code (Desmars et al.,
2015). The astrometric positions are derived by fitting the occultation's light curves by a model
of Pluto's atmosphere. The fits provide the observed position of the body's centre for a reference
star position. Other publications usually provide circumstances of the occultation such as the
coordinates of the stations, the timing, and the impact parameter (i.e. the closest distance between
the station and the centre of the shadow). From these parameters, we use a procedure based on the Bessel
method to derive an astrometric position. We derive accurate Pluto's astrometric positions from
1988 to 2016. These positions are used to refine the orbit of Pluto'system barycentre providing
an ephemeris, accurate to the milliarcsec level, over the period 2000-2020, allowing better predictions
for future stellar occultations.
