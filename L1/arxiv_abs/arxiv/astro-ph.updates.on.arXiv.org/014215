We present a hydro-dynamical simulation at sub-parsec and few solar mass resolution of a merger
between two gas-rich dwarf galaxies. Our simulation includes a detailed model for the multi-phase
interstellar medium (ISM) and is able to follow the entire formation history of spatially resolved
star clusters, including feedback from individual massive stars. Shortly after the merger we find
a population of $\sim 900$ stellar clusters with masses above $10^{2.5}\; \rm{M_\odot}$ and a cluster
mass function (CMF), which is well fitted with a power-law with a slope of $\alpha=-1.70\pm0.08$.
We describe here in detail the formation of the three most massive clusters (M$_{*} \gtrsim 10^5$
M$_\odot$), which populate the high-mass end of the CMF. The simulated clusters form rapidly on
a timescale of $6$-$8$ Myr in converging flows of dense gas. The embedded merger phase has extremely
high star formation rate surface densities of $\Sigma_\mathrm{SFR}>10\; \mathrm{M}_\odot\;
\mathrm{yr}^{-1}\; \mathrm{kpc}^{-2}$ and thermal gas pressures in excess of $P_{\rm th}\sim10^7
\; \mathrm{k}_{\rm B}\;(\rm K\;\mathrm{cm}^{-3})^{-1}$. The formation process is terminated
by rapid gas expulsion driven by the first generation of supernovae, after which the cluster centers
relax and both their structure and kinematics become indistinguishable from observed local globular
clusters. The simulation presented here provides a general model for the formation of metal-poor
globular clusters in chemically unevolved starbursting environments of low-mass dwarf galaxies,
which are common at high redshifts.
