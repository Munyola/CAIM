We present a new technique to quantify the light contribution coming from the faint high redshift
($z\sim6$) galaxies below the detection threshold of imaging data, set conventionally at S/N=4.5.
We illustrate the technique with an application to Hubble Space Telescope Advanced Camera for Surveys
images in the F775W and F850LP filters of the Ultra Deep Field parallel field NICP12. The aim of this
analysis is to extend by a few magnitudes the faint end of the luminosity function at $z\sim6$. After
masking all the detected sources in the field we apply a Fast Fourier Transform to obtain the spatial
power spectrum of the background signal. The power spectrum permits us to separate the background
noise signal, the residuals due to the data reduction of the wide field, and the overall signal produced
by faint galaxies. The ratio of the signal in the i_775 and z_850 bands is used to estimate the contribution
of the faint i-dropout objects. We rely on extensive Monte Carlo simulations to characterize various
sources of uncertainty and quantify the number of faint i-dropout galaxies in the field. The analysis
allows us to put constraints on the luminosity function at $z\sim6$ down to z_850= 30 mag, 2.5 mag
fainter than with standard techniques on the same data. The data are consistent with a faint end slope
of the luminosity function of $\alpha = -1.9$. Assuming a specific set of values for the clumping
factor, escape fraction, and spectral energy distribution, we find that the $z\sim6$ undetected
galaxies down to z_850=30 mag could have driven cosmic reionization.
