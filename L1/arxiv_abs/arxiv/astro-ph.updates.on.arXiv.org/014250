We present a study on the prospects of observing carbon, sulfur, and other lower abundance elements
(namely Al, Ca, Ti and Ni) present in the interstellar medium using future X-ray instruments. We
focus in particular on the detection and characterization of interstellar dust along the lines
of sight. We compare the simulated data with different sets of dust aggregates, either obtained
from past literature or measured by us using the SOLEIL-LUCIA synchrotron beamline. Extinction
by interstellar grains induces modulations of a given photolelectric edge, which can be in principle
traced back to the chemistry of the absorbing grains. We simulated data of instruments with characteristics
of resolution and sensitivity of the current Athena, XRISM and Arcus concepts. In the relatively
near future, the depletion and abundances of the elements under study will be determined with confidence.
In the case of carbon and sulfur, the characterization of the chemistry of the absorbing dust will
be also determined, depending on the dominant compound. For aluminum and calcium, despite the large
depletion in the interstellar medium and the prominent dust absorption, in many cases the edge feature
may not be changing significantly with the change of chemistry in the Al$^-$ or Ca$^-$ bearing compounds.
The exinction signature of large grains may be detected and modeled, allowing a test on different
grain size distributions for these elements. The low cosmic abundance of Ti and Ni will not allow
us a detailed study of the edge features.
