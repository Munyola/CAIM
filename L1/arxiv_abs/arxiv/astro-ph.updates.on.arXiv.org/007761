Wide-field surveys for transiting planets, such as the NASA Kepler and TESS missions, are usually
conducted without knowing which stars have binary companions. Unresolved and unrecognized binaries
give rise to systematic errors in planet occurrence rates, including misclassified planets and
mistakes in completeness corrections. The individual errors can have different signs, making
it difficult to anticipate the net effect on inferred occurrence rates. Here we use simplified models
of signal-to-noise limited transit surveys to try and clarify the situation. We derive a formula
for the apparent occurrence rate density measured by an observer who falsely assumes all stars are
single. The formula depends on the binary fraction; the mass function of the secondary stars; and
the true occurrence of planets around primaries, secondaries, and single stars. It also takes into
account the Malmquist bias by which binaries are over-represented in flux-limited samples. Application
of the formula to an idealized Kepler-like survey shows that for planets larger than 2 $R_\oplus$,
the net systematic error is of order 5%. In particular, unrecognized binaries are unlikely to be
the reason for the apparent discrepancies between hot Jupiter occurrence rates measured in different
surveys. For smaller planets the errors are potentially larger: the occurrence of Earth-sized
planets could be overestimated by as much as 50%. We also show that whenever high-resolution imaging
reveals a transit host star to be a binary, the planet is usually more likely to orbit the primary star
than the secondary star.
