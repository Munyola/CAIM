We explore the utility of narrow band X-ray surface photometry as a tool for making fully Bayesian,
hydrostatic mass measurements of clusters of galaxies, groups and early-type galaxies. We demonstrate
that it is sufficient to measure the surface photometry with the Chandra X-ray observatory in only
three (rest frame) bands (0.5--0.9 keV, 0.9--2.0 keV and 2.0--7.0 keV) in order to constrain the
temperature, density and abundance of the hot interstellar medium (ISM). Adopting parametrized
models for the mass distribution and radial entropy profile and assuming spherical symmetry, we
show that the constraints on the mass and thermodynamic properties of the ISM that are obtained by
fitting data from all three bands simultaneously are comparable to those obtained by fitting similar
models to the temperature and density profiles derived from spatially resolved spectroscopy,
as is typically done. We demonstrate that the constraints can be significantly tightened when exploiting
a recently derived, empirical relationship between the gas fraction and the entropy profile at
large scales, eliminating arbitrary extrapolations at large radii. This "Scaled Adiabatic Model"
(ScAM) is well suited to modest signal-to-noise data, and we show that accurate, precise measurements
of the global system properties are inferred when employing it to fit data from even very shallow,
snapshot X-ray observations. The well-defined asymptotic behaviour of the model also makes it
ideally suited for use in Sunyaev-Zeldovich studies of galaxy clusters.
