We present new isochrone fits to colour-magnitude diagrams of the Galactic globular cluster NGC
5904 (M5). We utilise 29 photometric bands from the ultraviolet to mid-infrared by use of the data
from the {\it Hubble Space Telescope}, {\it Gaia} DR2, {\it Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer},
Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), and other photometric data. In our isochrone fitting we use the
PAdova and TRieste Stellar Evolution Code, the MESA Isochrones and Stellar Tracks, the Dartmouth
Stellar Evolution Program, and a Bag of Stellar Tracks and Isochrones both for the solar-scaled
and enhanced He and $\alpha$ abundances with a metallicity about [Fe/H]$=-1.33$ adopted from the
literature. All tools provide us with estimates of the distance, age, and extinction law to the cluster.
The best-fit distance, true distance modulus, and age are $7.4\pm0.3$ kpc, $14.34\pm0.09$ mag,
and $12.15\pm1.00$ Gyr, respectively. The derived distance agrees with the literature, including
the {\it Gaia} DR2 parallax with its known global zero-point correction. All the data and models,
except some UV and SDSS data, agree with the extinction law of Cardelli-Clayton-Mathis with $R_\mathrm{V}=3.60\pm0.05$
and $A_\mathrm{V}=0.20\pm0.02$ mag. This extinction is twice as high as generally accepted due
to a rather high extinction between 625 and 2000 nm. An offset of the model colours instead of the high
extinction in this range is a less likely, yet possible explanation of the discovered large deviations
of the isochrones from the data.
