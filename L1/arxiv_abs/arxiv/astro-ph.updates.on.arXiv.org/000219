We present millimeter molecular-line complemented by optical observations, along with a reanalysis
of archival centimeter HI and continuum data, to infer the global dynamics and determine where dense
molecular gas and massive stars preferentially form in the circumnuclear starburst ring of the
barred-spiral galaxy NGC 7552. We find diffuse molecular gas in a pair of dust lanes each running
along the large-scale galactic bar, as well as in the circumnuclear starburst ring. We do not detect
dense molecular gas in the dust lanes, but find such gas concentrated in two knots where the dust lanes
make contact with the circumnuclear starburst ring. When convolved to the same angular resolution
as the images in dense gas, the radio continuum emission of the circumnuclear starburst ring also
exhibits two knots, each lying downstream of an adjacent knot in dense gas. The results agree qualitatively
with the idea that massive stars form from dense gas at the contact points, where diffuse gas is channeled
into the ring along the dust lanes, and later explode as supernovae downstream of the contact points.
Based on the inferred rotation curve, however, the propagation time between the respective pairs
of dense gas and centimeter continuum knots is about an order of magnitude shorter than the lifetimes
of OB stars. We discuss possible reasons of this discrepancy, and conclude that either the initial
mass function is top-heavy or massive stars in the ring do not form exclusively at the contact points
where dense molecular gas is concentrated.
