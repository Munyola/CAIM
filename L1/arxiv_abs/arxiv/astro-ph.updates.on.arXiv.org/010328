The Epoch of Reionization (EoR) is an uncharted era in our Universe's history during which the birth
of the first stars and galaxies led to the ionization of neutral hydrogen in the intergalactic medium.
There are many experiments investigating the EoR by tracing the 21cm line of neutral hydrogen. Because
this signal is very faint and difficult to isolate, it is crucial to develop analysis techniques
that maximize sensitivity and suppress contaminants in data. It is also imperative to understand
the trade-offs between different analysis methods and their effects on power spectrum estimates.
Specifically, with a statistical power spectrum detection in HERA's foreseeable future, it has
become increasingly important to understand how certain analysis choices can lead to the loss of
the EoR signal. In this paper, we focus on signal loss associated with power spectrum estimation.
We describe the origin of this loss using both toy models and data taken by the 64-element configuration
of the Donald C. Backer Precision Array for Probing the Epoch of Reionization (PAPER). In particular,
we highlight how detailed investigations of signal loss have led to a revised, higher 21cm power
spectrum upper limit from PAPER-64. Additionally, we summarize errors associated with power spectrum
error estimation that were previously unaccounted for. We focus on a subset of PAPER-64 data in this
paper; revised power spectrum limits from the PAPER experiment are presented in a forthcoming paper
by Kolopanis et al. (in prep.) and supersede results from previously published PAPER analyses.
