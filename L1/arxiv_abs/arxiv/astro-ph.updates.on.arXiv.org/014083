We performed simulations of a large number of so-called very faint X-ray transient sources from
surveys obtained using the X-ray telescope aboard the Neil Gehrels \emph{Swift} Observatory on
two Galactic globular clusters, and the Galactic Center. We calculated the ratio between the duty
cycle we input in our simulations and the one we measure after the simulations. We found that fluctuations
in outburst duration and recurrence times affect our estimation of the duty cycle more than non detected
outbursts. This biases our measures to overestimate the simulated duty cycle of sources. Moreover,
we determined that compact surveys are necessary to detect outbursts with short duration because
they could fall in gaps between observations, if such gaps are longer than their duration. On the
other hand, long surveys are necessary to detect sources with low duty cycle because the smallest
duty cycle a survey can observe is given by the ratio between the shortest outburst duration and the
total length of the survey. If one has a limited amount of observing time, these two effects are competing,
and a compromise is required which is set by the goals of the proposed survey. We have also performed
simulations with several artificial survey strategies in order to evaluate the optimal observing
campaign aimed at detecting transients as well as at having the most accurate estimates of the duty
cycle. As expected, the best campaign would be a regular and dense monitoring that extends for a very
long period. The closest real example of such a dataset is the monitoring of the Galactic Centre.
