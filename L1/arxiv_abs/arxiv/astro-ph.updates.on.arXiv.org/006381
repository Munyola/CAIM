We present the detection and follow-up observations of planetary candidates around low-mass stars
observed by the K2 mission. Based on light-curve analysis, adaptive-optics imaging, and optical
spectroscopy at low and high resolution (including radial velocity measurements), we validate
16 planets around 12 low-mass stars observed during K2 campaigns 5-10. Among the 16 planets, 12 are
newly validated, with orbital periods ranging from 0.96-33 days. For one of the planets (K2-151b)
we present ground-based transit photometry, allowing us to refine the ephemerides. Combining
our K2 M-dwarf planets together with the validated or confirmed planets found previously, we investigate
the dependence of planet radius $R_p$ on stellar insolation and metallicity [Fe/H]. We confirm
that for periods $P\lesssim 2$ days, planets with a radius $R_p\gtrsim 2\,R_\oplus$ are less common
than planets with a radius between 1-2$\,R_\oplus$. We also see a hint of the "radius valley" between
1.5 and 2$\,R_\oplus$ that has been seen for close-in planets around FGK stars. These features in
the radius/period distribution could be attributed to photoevaporation of planetary envelopes
by high-energy photons from the host star, as they have for FGK stars. For the M dwarfs, though, the
features are not as well defined, and we cannot rule out other explanations such as atmospheric loss
from internal planetary heat sources, or truncation of the protoplanetary disk. There also appears
to be a relation between planet size and metallicity: those few planets larger than about 3 $R_\oplus$
are found around the most metal-rich M dwarfs.
