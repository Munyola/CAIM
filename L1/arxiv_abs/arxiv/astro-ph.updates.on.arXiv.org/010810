We study the faint stellar halo of isolated central galaxies, by stacking galaxy images in the HSC
survey and accounting for the residual sky background sampled with random points. The surface brightness
profiles in HSC $r$-band are measured up to 120 kpc from the galaxy center for a wide range of galaxy
stellar mass ($9.2<\log_{10}M_\ast/M_\odot<11.4$), and down to a surface brightness of about
32.8 $\mathrm{mag}/\mathrm{arcsec}^2$, with an indication of signals to even larger scales and
fainter magnitudes. Failing to account for the outer stellar halo below the noise level of individual
images will lead to underestimates of the total luminosity by $\leq 20\%$. Splitting galaxies according
to the concentration parameter of their light distributions, we find that the surface brightness
profiles of low concentration galaxies drop faster between 20 kpc and 100 kpc and are more extended
beyond 100 kpc than those of high concentration galaxies. The profiles of low concentration galaxies
persist out to the average halo virial radius. Albeit the large galaxy-to-galaxy scatter, we find
a strong self-similarity of the stellar halo profiles. They show unified forms once the projected
distance is scaled by the halo virial radius. The colour of the stellar halo is redder in the center
and bluer outside, with high concentration galaxies having redder and flatter colour profiles.
Such a colour gradient persists to about 80 kpc for galaxies more massive than $10^{10.2}M_\odot$,
whereas for galaxies with $9.2<\log_{10}M_\ast/M_\odot<10.2$, the gradient is consistent with
being flat between 10 kpc and 30 kpc.
