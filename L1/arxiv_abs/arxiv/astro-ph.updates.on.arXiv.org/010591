We examine new and pre-existing wide-field, continuum-corrected, narrowband images in H$_2$
1-0 S(1) and Br$\gamma$ of three regions of massive star formation: IC 1396, Cygnus OB2, and Carina.
These regions contain a variety of globules, pillars, and sheets, so we can quantify how the spatial
profiles of emission lines behave in photodissociation regions (PDRs) that differ in their radiation
fields and geometries. We have measured 450 spatial profiles of H$_2$ and Br$\gamma$ along interfaces
between HII regions and PDRs. Br$\gamma$ traces photoevaporative flows from the PDRs, and this
emission declines more rapidly with distance as the radius of curvature of the interface decreases,
in agreement with models. As noted previously, H$_2$ emission peaks deeper into the cloud relative
to Br$\gamma$, where the molecular gas absorbs far-UV radiation from nearby O-stars. Although
PDRs in IC 1396, Cygnus OB2, and Carina experience orders of magnitude different levels of ionizing
flux and have markedly differing geometries, all the PDRs have spatial offsets between Br$\gamma$
and H$_2$ on the order of $10^{17}$cm. There is a weak negative correlation between the offset size
and the intensity of ionizing radiation and a positive correlation with the radius of curvature
of the cloud. We can reproduce both the size of the offsets and the dependencies of the offsets on these
other variables with simple photoevaporative flow models. Both Br$\gamma$ and H$_2$ 1-0 S(1) will
undoubtedly be targeted in future JWST observations of PDRs, so this work can serve as a guide to interpreting
these images.
