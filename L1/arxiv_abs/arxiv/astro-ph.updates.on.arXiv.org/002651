Using the spectroscopic New York University Value-Added Galaxy Catalogue and the photometric
photo-z catalogues of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7, we have explored the satellite
distribution around ~1000 massive (M_star > 2x10^11 M_sun) visually classified elliptical
galaxies down to a satellite mass ratio of 1:400 (i.e. 5x10^8 < M_sat < 2x10^11 M_sun). Our
host galaxies were selected to be representative of a mass complete sample. The satellites of these
galaxies were searched within a projected radial distance of 100 kpc to their hosts. We have found
that only 20-23 per cent of the massive ellipticals have at least a satellite down to a mass ratio 1:10.
This number increases to 45-52 per cent if we explore satellites down to 1:100 and is $>$60-70
per cent if we go further down to 1:400. The average projected radial distance of the satellites to
their hosts is ~59 kpc (which can be decreased at least down to 50 kpc if we account for incompleteness
effects). The number of satellites per galaxy host only increases very mildly at decreasing the
satellite mass. The fraction of mass which is contained in the satellites down to a mass ratio of 1:400
is 8 per cent of the total mass contained by the hosts. Satellites with a mass ratio from 1:2 to 1:5 (with
~28 per cent of the total mass of the satellites) are the main contributor to the total satellite mass.
If the satellites eventually infall into the host galaxies, the merger channel will be largely dominated
by satellites with a mass ratio down to 1:10 (as these objects have 68 per cent of the total mass in satellites).
