In a survey of archived ultraviolet spectra of 100 stars recorded by the echelle spectrograph of
the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), we measure
the strengths of the weak absorption features of O I, Ge II and Kr I in the interstellar medium. Our
objective is to undertake an investigation that goes beyond earlier abundance studies to see how
these elements are influenced independently by three different environmental properties: (1)
values of a generalized atomic depletion factor $F_*$ due to condensations onto dust grains (revealed
here by the abundances of Mg and Mn relative to H), (2) the fraction of H atoms in the form of molecular
hydrogen, $f({\rm H}_2)$, and (3) the ambient intensity $I$ of ultraviolet starlight relative
to an average value in our part of the Galaxy $I_0$. As expected, the gas-phase abundances of all three
elements exhibit negative partial correlations with $F_*$. The abundances of free O atoms show
significant positive partial correlations with log $f({\rm H}_2)$ and $\log (I/I_0)$, while Ge
and Kr exhibit negative partial correlations with $\log (I/I_0)$ at marginal levels of significance.
After correcting for these trends, the abundances of O relative to H show no significant variations
with location, except for the already-known radial gradient of light-element abundances in the
Milky Way. A comparison of Ge and O abundances revealed no significant regional enhancements or
deficiencies of neutron-capture elements relative to alpha-process ones.
