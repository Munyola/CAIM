GRB 190114C is the first gamma-ray burst detected at Very High Energies (VHE, i.e. >300 GeV) by the
MAGIC Cherenkov telescope. The analysis of the emission detected by the Fermi satellite at lower
energies, in the 10 keV -- 100 GeV energy range, up to ~ 50 seconds (i.e.~before the MAGIC detection)
can hold precious information. We analyse the spectral evolution of the emission of GRB 190114C
as detected by the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor (GBM) in the 10 keV -- 40 MeV energy range up to ~60
sec. The first 4 seconds of the burst feature a typical prompt emission spectrum, which can be fitted
by a smoothly broken power-law function with typical parameters. Starting on ~4 seconds post-trigger,
we find an additional non-thermal component, which can be fit by a power-law, which rises and decays
quickly. The 10 keV -- 40 MeV flux of the power-law component peaks at ~ 6 seconds reaching the value
of 1.7e-5 erg cm-2 s-1. The time when it peaks coincides with the peak of the emission detected by the
Large Area Telescope (LAT) on board Fermi. The power-law spectral slope that we find in the GBM data
is remarkably similar to that of the LAT spectrum and the GBM+LAT spectral energy distribution is
consistent with a single component. This suggests that the LAT emission and the power-law component
that we find in the GBM data belong to the same emission component, which we interpret as due to the
afterglow of the burst. The onset time allows us to estimate the initial jet bulk Lorentz factor Gamma_0
to be around 500, depending on the assumed circum-burst density.
