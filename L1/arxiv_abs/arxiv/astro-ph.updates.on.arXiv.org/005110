Most of fast radio bursts (FRB) do not show evidence for repetition, and such non-repeating FRBs
may be produced at the time of a merger of binary neutron stars (BNS), provided that the BNS merger
rate is close to the high end of the currently possible range. However, the merger environment is
polluted by dynamical ejecta, which may prohibit the radio signal to propagate. We examine this
by using a general-relativistic simulation of a BNS merger, and show that the ejecta appears about
1 ms after the rotation speed of the merged star becomes the maximum. Therefore there is a time window
in which an FRB signal can reach outside, and the short duration of non-repeating FRBs can be explained
by screening after ejecta formation. A fraction of BNS mergers may leave a rapidly rotating and stable
neutron star, and such objects may be the origin of repeating FRBs like FRB 121102. We show that a merger
remnant would appear as a repeating FRB in a time scale of about 1-10 yrs, and expected properties
are consistent with the observations of FRB 121102. We construct an FRB rate evolution model including
these two populations of repeating and non-repeating FRBs from BNS mergers, and show that the detection
rate of repeating FRBs relative to non-repeating ones rapidly increases with improving search
sensitivity. This may explain that the only repeating FRB 121102 was discovered by the most sensitive
FRB search with Arecibo. Several predictions are made, including appearance of a repeating FRB
1-10 years after a BNS merger that is localized by gravitational wave and subsequent electromagnetic
radiation.
