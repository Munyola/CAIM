The magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) of protoplanetary disks are strongly subject to the non-ideal
MHD effects arising from the low ionization fraction of the disk gas. A strong electric field induced
by gas motions can heat ionized gas particles and can thereby affect the ionization balance in the
disks. Our previous studies revealed that in dusty protoplanetary disks, the Ohmic conductivity
decreases with increasing electric field strength until the electrical breakdown of the disk gas
occurs. In this study, we extend our previous work to more general cases where both electric and magnetic
fields affect the motion of plasma particles, allowing us to study the impacts of plasma heating
on all non-ideal MHD effects: Ohmic, Hall, and ambipolar diffusion. We find that the upper limit
on the electric current we previously derived applies even in the presence of magnetic fields. Although
the Hall and ambipolar resistivities can either increase or decrease with electric field strength
depending on the abundance of charged dust grains, the Ohmic resistivity always increases with
electric field strength. An order-of-magnitude estimate suggests that a large-scale electric
current generated by gas motions in the inner part of protoplanetary disks could exceed the upper
limit. This implies that MHD motions of the inner disk, such as the motion driven by the Hall-shear
instability, could either get suppressed or trigger electrical breakdown (lightning discharge).
This may have important implications for gas accretion and chondrule formation in the inner part
of protoplanetary disks.
