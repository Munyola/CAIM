We present solutions of force-free pulsar magnetospheres coupled with a uniform external magnetic
field aligned with the dipole magnetic moment of the pulsar. The inclusion of the uniform magnetic
field has the following consequences: The equatorial current sheet is truncated to a finite length,
the fraction of field lines that are open increases, and the open field lines are confined within
a cylindrical surface instead of becoming radial. A strong external magnetic field antiparallel
to the dipole allows for solutions where the pulsar magnetic field is fully enclosed within an ellipsoidal
surface. Configurations of fully enclosed or confined magnetospheres may appear in a double neutron
star (DNS) where one of the components is a slowly rotating, strongly magnetised pulsar and the other
a weakly magnetised millisecond pulsar. Depending on the geometry, twisted field lines from the
millisecond pulsar could form an asymmetric wind. More dramatic consequences could appear closer
to merger: there, the neutron star with the weaker magnetic field may undergo a stage where it alternates
between an open and a fully enclosed magnetosphere releasing up $10^{38}$erg. Under favourable
combinations of magnetic fields DNSs can spend up to 10$^3$ yr in the coupled phase, implying a Galactic
population of $0.02$ systems. Potential observational signatures of this interaction are discussed
including the possibility of powering recurring Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs). We also note that the
magnetic interaction cannot have any significant effect on the spin evolution of the two pulsars.
