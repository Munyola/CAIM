Recently, we presented a general model for the light curves of chromospherically active stars,
where the observed light curve is interference of two real constant period light curves of long-lived
starspots. In this first paper, we make six specific questions which undermine this argument, because
it contradicts the current widely held views about the stellar surface differential rotation and
the starspots. Our aim is to answer these six questions. We present evidence that the long-lived
starspots of our general model have already been detected in the earlier surface imaging studies.
The Lomb-Scargle power spectrum method analysis of the real and the simulated data of FK Com reveals
that this method fails to detect the two real constant period light curves of our general model. If
our model is valid, this method gives incompatible period, amplitude and minimum epoch estimates
telling nothing about the real periods, the real amplitudes and the real minimum epochs of the two
real light curves. This would mean that all earlier one-dimensional period analyses of the light
curves of chromospherically active stars have given spurious results which have been widely and
uncritically accepted since the discovery of the starspots in the year 1947. However, we arrive
at a dead end, because we can not solve the real light curves of FK Com. In our second paper, we solve
these real light curves with a new two-dimensional period finding method, prove the validity of
our general model, and answer all six questions made in this first paper.
