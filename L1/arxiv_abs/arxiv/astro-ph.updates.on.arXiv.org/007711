We implement a state-of-the-art treatment of the processes affecting the production and Interstellar
Medium (ISM) evolution of carbonaceous and silicate dust grains within SPH simulations. We trace
the dust grain size distribution by means of a two-size approximation. We test our method on zoom-in
simulations of four massive ($M_{200} \geq 3 \times 10^{14} M_{\odot}$) galaxy clusters. We predict
that during the early stages of assembly of the cluster at $z \gtrsim 3$, where the star formation
activity is at its maximum in our simulations, the proto-cluster regions are rich of dusty gas. Compared
to the case in which only dust production in stellar ejecta is active, if we include processes occurring
in the cold ISM,the dust content is enhanced by a factor $2-3$. However, the dust properties in this
stage turn out to be significantly different than those observationally derived for the {\it average}
Milky Way dust, and commonly adopted in calculations of dust reprocessing. We show that these differences
may have a strong impact on the predicted spectral energy distributions. At low redshift in star
forming regions our model reproduces reasonably well the trend of dust abundances over metallicity
as observed in local galaxies. However we under-produce by a factor of 2 to 3 the total dust content
of clusters estimated observationally at low redshift, $z \lesssim 0.5$ using IRAS, Planck and
Herschel satellites data. This discrepancy can be solved by decreasing the efficiency of sputtering
which erodes dust grains in the hot Intracluster Medium (ICM).
