We have compiled the most complete census of High-Mass X-ray Binaries (HMXBs) in the Small Magellanic
Cloud with the aim to investigate the formation efficiency of young accreting binaries in its low
metallicity environment. In total, we use 127 X-ray sources with detections in our \chandra X-ray
Visionary Program (XVP), supplemented by 14 additional (likely and confirmed) HMXBs identified
by \cite{2016A&A...586A..81H} that fall within the XVP area, but are not either detected in our
survey (9 sources) or matched with any XVP source that has at least one OB counterpart in the OGLE-III
catalog (5 sources). Specifically, we examine the number ratio of the HMXBs [N(HMXBs)] to {\it (a)}
the number of OB stars, {\it (b)} the local star-formation rate (SFR), and {\it (c)} the stellar mass
produced during the specific star-formation burst, all as a function of the age of their parent stellar
populations. Each of these indicators serves a different role, but in all cases we find that the HMXB
formation efficiency increases as a function of time (following a burst of star formation) up to
$\sim$40--60\,Myr, and then gradually decreases. The peak formation efficiency N(HMXB)/SFR
is (49 $\pm$ 14) $[10^{-5}~{\rm M_{\odot}/yr}]^{-1}$, in good agreement with previous estimates
of the average formation efficiency in the broad $\sim$20--60\,Myr age range. The frequency of
HMXBs is a factor of 8$\times$ higher than at $\sim$10\,Myr, and 4$\times$ higher than at $\sim$260\,Myr,
i.e. at earlier and later epochs, respectively.
