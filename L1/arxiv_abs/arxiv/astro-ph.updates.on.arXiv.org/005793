We report L-band VLA observations of 1RXS J0603.3+4214, a cluster that hosts a bright radio relic,
known as the Toothbrush, and an elongated giant radio halo. These new observations allow us to study
the surface brightness distribution down to one arcsec resolution with very high sensitivity.
Our images provide an unprecedented detailed view of the Toothbrush, revealing enigmatic filamentary
structures. To study the spectral index distribution, we complement our analysis with published
LOFAR and GMRT observations. The bright `brush' of the Toothbrush shows a prominent narrow ridge
to its north with a sharp outer edge. The spectral index at the ridge is in the range $-0.70\leq\alpha\leq-0.80$.
We suggest that the ridge is caused by projection along the line of sight. With a simple toy model for
the smallest region of the ridge, we conclude that the magnetic field is below $5\,\rm\mu G$ and varies
significantly across the shock front. Our model indicates that the actual Mach number is higher
than that obtained from the injection index and agrees well with the one derived from the overall
spectrum, namely ${\cal M}=3.78^{+0.3}_{-0.2}$. The radio halo shows an average spectral index
of $\alpha=-1.16\pm0.05$ and a slight gradient from north to south. The southernmost part of the
halo is steeper and possibly related to a shock front. Excluding the southernmost part, the halo
morphology agrees very well with the X-ray morphology. A power-law correlation is found between
the radio and X-ray surface brightness
