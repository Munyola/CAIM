Dwarf stars with debris discs and planets appear to be excellent laboratories to study the core accretion
theory of planets formation. These systems are however, insufficiently studied. In this paper
we present the main metallicity and lithium abundance properties of these stars together with stars
with only debris discs and stars with only planets. Stars without detected planets nor discs are
also considered. The analysed sample is formed by main-sequence FGK field single stars. Apart from
the basic stellar parameters, we include the use of dusty discs masses. The main results show for
the first time that the dust mass of debris disc stars with planets correlate with metallicity. We
confirm that these disc dust masses are related to their central stellar masses. Separately, the
masses of stars and those of planets also correlate with metallicity. We conclude that two conditions
are necessary to form giant planets: to have a sufficient metallicity and also a sufficient protoplanetary
mass of gas and dust. The debris discs masses of stars without giant planets do not correlate with
metallicity, because they do not fulfil these two conditions. Concerning lithium, by adopting
a stellar model for lithium depletion based on a strong interaction between the star and a protoplanetary
disc, we found that in agreement with the model predictions, observations indicate that the main
lithium depletion occurs during this initial protoplanetary evolution stage. We show that the
ultimately lithium depletion is independent of the presence or absence of planets and appears to
be only age dependent.
