As a first step toward a multi-phase equation of state for dense water, we develop a temperature-dependent
equation of state for dense water covering the liquid and plasma regimes and extending to the super-ionic
and gas regimes. This equation of state covers the complete range of conditions encountered in planetary
modeling. We use first principles quantum molecular dynamics simulations and its Thomas-Fermi
extension to reach the highest pressures encountered in giant planets several times the size of
Jupiter. Using these results, as well as the data available at lower pressures, we obtain a parametrization
of the Helmholtz free energy adjusted over this extended temperature and pressure domain. The parametrization
ignores the entropy and density jumps at phase boundaries but we show that it is sufficiently accurate
to model interior properties of most planets and exoplanets. We produce an equation of state given
in analytical form that is readily usable in planetary modeling codes and dynamical simulations
{\bf (a fortran implementation can be found at this http URL)}. The EOS produced is valid for the entire
density range relevant to planetary modeling, {\bf for densities where quantum effects for the
ions can be neglected, and for temperatures below 50,000K. We use this equation of state to calculate
the mass-radius relationship of exoplanets up to 5,000M_Earth, explore temperature effects in
ocean and wet Earth-like planets, and quantify the influence of the water EOS for the core on the gravitational
moments of Jupiter.
