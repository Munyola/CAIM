The inclination $I$ of an Earth's satellite in polar orbit undergoes a secular De Sitter precession
of $-7.6$ milliarcseconds per year for a suitable choice of the initial value of its non-circulating
node $\Omega$. The competing long-periodic harmonic rates of change of $I$ due to the even and odd
zonal harmonics of the geopotential vanish for either a circular or polar orbit, while no secular
rates occur at all. This may open up, in principle, the possibility of measuring the geodesic precession
in the weak-field limit with an accurately tracked satellite by improving the current bound of $9\times
10^{-4}$ from Lunar Laser Ranging, which, on the other hand, may be even rather optimistic, by one
order of magnitude, or, perhaps, even better. The most insidious competing effects are due to the
solid and ocean components of the $K_1$ tide since their perturbations have nominal huge amplitudes
and the same temporal pattern of the De Sitter signature. They vanish for polar orbits. Departures
of $\simeq 10^{-5}-10^{-3}~\textrm{deg}$ from the ideal polar geometry allow to keep the $K_1$
tidal perturbations to a sufficiently small level. Most of the other gravitational and non-gravitational
perturbations vanish for the proposed orbital configuration, while the non-vanishing ones either
have different temporal signatures with respect to the De Sitter effect or can be modeled with sufficient
accuracy. In order to meet the proposed goal, the measurement accuracy of $I$ should be better than
$\simeq 35~\textrm{microarcseconds}=0.034~\textrm{milliarcseconds}$ over, say, 5 yr.
