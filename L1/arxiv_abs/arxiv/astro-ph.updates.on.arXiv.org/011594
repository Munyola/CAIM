Bright active galaxies show a range of properties but many of these properties are correlated which
has led to the concept of the Quasar Main Sequence. We test whether our current understanding of the
quasar structure allows reproducing the pattern observed in the optical plane formed by the kinematic
line width of H$\beta$ and the relative importance of the Fe II optical emission. We performed simulations
of the H$\beta$ and Fe II production using the code CLOUDY and well-justified assumptions about
the broadband spectra, distance of the emission line region, and the cloud properties. We show that
the presence of the warm corona is an important element of the broadband spectrum which decreases
the dependence of the relative Fe II emissivity on the Eddington ratio, and allows to reproduce the
rare cases of the particularly strong Fe II emitters. Models are sensitive to the adopted cloud distance,
and strong Fe II emission can be obtained either by adopting strongly super-solar metallicity,
or much shorter distance than traditionally obtained from reverberation mapping. We modelled
in a similar way the UV plane defined by the Mg II line and Fe II UV pseudo-continuum, but here the model
is less successful, in general overproducing the Fe II strength. We found that the Fe II optical and
UV emissivity depend in a different way on the turbulent velocity and metallicity, and the best extension
of the model in order to cover both planes is to allow very large turbulent velocities in the Broad
Line Region clouds.
