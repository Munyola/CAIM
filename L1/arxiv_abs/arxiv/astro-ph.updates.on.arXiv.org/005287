We have proposed a model of non repeating fast radio bursts ( FRBs ) that the collisions between axion
stars and neutron stars generate the bursts. In this paper, we propose a model of repeating FRBs that
they arise from the several collisions between magnetized accretion disk of a black hole and an axion
star orbiting the black hole. There would be many axions stars condensing as dark matter in an early
stage galaxy so that such collisions arises repeatedly. The radiations are caused by coherent oscillations
of electrons induced by axion stars under strong magnetic field $\sim O(10^{11})$G. Their emissions
are terminated by the thermal fluctuations increasing with the thermalization of the oscillation
energies. Although the radiations are monochromatic, the thermal Doppler effects broaden the
spectral lines; their fluxes $S(\nu)$ are given by $S(\nu) \propto \exp(-(\nu-\nu_c)^2/2(\delta\nu)^2)$
with the center frequency $\nu_c$.The bandwidth $\delta\nu=\nu_c\sqrt{T_c/m_e}$ with electron
mass $m_e$ is determined by the critical temperature $T_c$ at which the thermal fluctuations terminate
the emission of the bursts. The observed bandwidths $(3\sim5)\times10^2$MHz are originated from
the strong magnetic fields $\sim O(10^{11})$G. It is identical to the strength of the magnetic fields
leading to large amount of the burst energies. Various center frequencies $\nu_c$ in the repeating
FRBs come from the fact that various rotation speeds of the electron gas in the disk cause Doppler
shifts of an intrinsic frequency of the bursts.
