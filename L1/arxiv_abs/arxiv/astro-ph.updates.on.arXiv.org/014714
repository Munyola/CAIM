We present \nustar{} observation of the atoll type neutron star (NS) low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB)
Serpens~X-1 (Ser~X-1) performed on 17 February 2018. We observed Ser~X-1 in a soft X-ray spectral
state with $3-79\kev{}$ luminosity of $L_\text{X}\sim0.4\times 10^{38}$ erg~s$^{-1}$ ($\sim
23\%$ of the Eddington luminosity), assuming a distance of 7.7 kpc. A positive correlation between
intensity and hardness ratio suggests that the source was in the banana branch during this observation.
The broadband $3-30\kev$ \nustar{} energy spectrum can be well described by a three-component
continuum model consisting of a disk blackbody, a single temperature blackbody and a power-law.
A broad iron line $\sim 5-8$ keV and the Compton back-scattering hump peaking at $\sim10-20 \kev{}$
band are clearly detected in the X-ray spectrum. These features are best interpreted by a self-consistent
relativistic reflection model. Fits with relativistically blurred disc reflection model suggests
that the inner disc $R_{in}$ is truncated prior to the ISCO at $(1.7-2.3)\;R_{ISCO}$ ($\simeq10.2-13.8\,R_{g}\:
\text{or}\: 23-31$ km) and the accretion disc is viewed at an low inclination of $i\simeq18\degr-21\degr$.
The disc is likely to be truncated either by a boundary layer or by the magnetosphere. Based on the
measured flux and the mass accretion rate, the maximum radial extension for the boundary layer is
estimated to be $\sim6.4\:R_{g}$ from the NS surface. The truncated inner disc in association with
pressure from a magnetic field sets an upper limit of $B\leq1.6\times10^{9}$ G.
