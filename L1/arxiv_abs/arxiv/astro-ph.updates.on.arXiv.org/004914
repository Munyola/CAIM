We present deep high-resolution (R~15,000) and high-quality UVES optical spectrophotometry
of nine planetary nebulae with dual-dust chemistry. We compute physical conditions from several
diagnostics. Ionic abundances for a large number of ions of N, O, Ne, S, Cl, Ar, K, Fe and Kr are derived
from collisionally excited lines. Elemental abundances are computed using state-of-the-art
ionization correction factors. We derive accurate C/O ratios from optical recombination lines.
We have re-analyzed additional high-quality spectra of 14 PNe from the literature following the
same methodology. Comparison with asymptotic giant branch models reveals that about half of the
total sample objects are consistent with being descendants of low-mass progenitor stars (M < 1.5
Msun). Given the observed N/O, C/O, and He/H ratios, we cannot discard that some of the objects come
from more massive progenitor stars (M > 3--4 Msun) that have suffered a mild HBB. None of the objects
seem to be a descendant of very massive progenitors. We propose that in most of the planetary nebulae
studied here, the PAHs have been formed through the dissociation of the CO molecule. The hypothesis
of a last thermal pulse that turns O-rich PNe into C-rich PNe is discarded, except in three objects,
that show C/O > 1. We also discuss the possibility of a He pre-enrichment to explain the most He-enriched
objects. We cannot discard other scenarios like extra mixing, stellar rotation or binary interactions
to explain the chemical abundances behaviour observed in our sample.
