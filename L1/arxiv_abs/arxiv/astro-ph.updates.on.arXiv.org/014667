Gaia DR2 provides unprecedented precision in measurements of the distance and kinematics of stars
in the solar neighborhood. Through applying unsupervised machine learning on DR2's 5-dimensional
dataset (3d position + 2d velocity), we identify a number of clusters, associations, and co-moving
groups within 1 kpc and $|b|<30^\circ$ (many of which have not been previously known). We estimate
their ages with the precision of $\sim$0.15 dex. Many of these groups appear to be filamentary or
string-like, oriented in parallel to the Galactic plane, and some span hundreds of pc in length.
Most of these string lack a central cluster, indicating that their filamentary structure is primordial,
rather than the result of tidal stripping or dynamical processing. The youngest strings ($<$100
Myr) are orthogonal to the Local Arm. The older ones appear to be remnants of several other arm-like
structures that cannot be presently traced by dust and gas. The velocity dispersion measured from
the ensemble of groups and strings increase with age, suggesting a timescale for dynamical heating
of $\sim$300 Myr. This timescale is also consistent with the age at which the population of strings
begins to decline, while the population in more compact groups continues to increase, suggesting
that dynamical processes are disrupting the weakly bound string populations, leaving only individual
clusters to be identified at the oldest ages. These data shed a new light on the local galactic structure
and a large scale cloud collapse. \end{abstract}
