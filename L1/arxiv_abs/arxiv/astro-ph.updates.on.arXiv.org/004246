We present the first catalog and data release of the Swift-BAT AGN Spectroscopic Survey (BASS).
We analyze optical spectra of the majority of AGN (77%, 641/836) detected based on their 14-195 keV
emission in the 70-month Swift BAT all-sky catalog. This includes redshift determination, absorption
and emission line measurements, and black hole mass and accretion rate estimates for the majority
of obscured and un-obscured AGN (74%, 473/641) with 340 measured for the first time. With ~90% of
sources at z<0.2, the survey represents a significant census of hard-X-ray selected AGN in the local
universe. In this first catalog paper, we describe the spectroscopic observations and datasets,
and our initial spectral analysis. The FWHM of the emission lines show broad agreement with the X-ray
obscuration (~94%), such that Sy 1-1.8 have NH<10^21.9 cm^-2, and Seyfert 2, have NH>10^21.9 cm^-2.
Seyfert 1.9 show a range of column densities. Compared to narrow line AGN in the SDSS, the X-ray selected
AGN have a larger fraction of dusty host galaxies suggesting these types of AGN are missed in optical
surveys. Using the most sensitive [OIII]/Hbeta and [NII]/Halpha emission line diagnostic, about
half of the sources are classified as Seyferts, ~15% reside in dusty galaxies that lack an Hbeta detection,
but for which the line upper limits imply either a Seyfert or LINER, ~15% are in galaxies with weak
or no emission lines despite high quality spectra, and a few percent each are LINERS, composite galaxies,
HII regions, or in known beamed AGN.
