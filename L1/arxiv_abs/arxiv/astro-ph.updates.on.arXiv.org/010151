In this presentation, we report the results of intraday variability in the optical (BVRI bands)
and hard X-ray band (3-79 keV) in a number of blazars. In the optical microvariability studies of
the blazars S5 0716+714 and BL Lac, we observed many interesting features such as rapid variability,
large variability amplitude, presence of characteristic timescales, bluer-when-brighter achromatic
behavior, and single power-law power spectral density. In {\it NuSTAR} observations of several
blazars, using spectral and timing analysis, we found similar features consistent with the optical
studies. In addition, in BL Lacs we estimated the Lorentz factor of the population of highest energy
electrons emitting synchrotron emission, and whereas in flat-spectrum radio quasars, using external
Compton models, we estimated the energy of the lower end of the injected electrons to be a few tens
of Lorentz factors. In addition, we find that the low flux state exhibit more rapid variability in
contrast to the previously reported results showing high flux states displaying rapid variability.
In both the studies, the size of the emission regions estimated using variability timescales turn
out to be an order magnitude smaller than the gravitational radius of a typical black-hole masses
between $\sim 10^8-10^9$ solar masses, believed to be at the center of the radio-loud AGN. The results
of the studies suggest that these low-amplitude rapid variability might originate as a result of
magnetohydrodynamical instabilities near the base of the jets triggered by the processes modulated
by the magnetic field at accretion disc.
