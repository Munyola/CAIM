We aim to determine the constraints that observed chemical abundances put on the potential role
of mass loss in metal poor dwarfs. Self-consistent stellar evolutionary models that include all
the effects of atomic diffusion and radiative accelerations for 28 chemical species were computed
for stellar masses between 0.6 and 0.8 Msun. Models with an initial metallicity of Z_0=0.00017 and
mass loss rates from 10e-15 Msun to 10e-12 Msun were calculated. They were then compared to previous
models with mass loss, as well as to models with turbulent mixing. For models with an initial metallicity
of Fe/H=-2.31, mass loss rates of about 10e-12 Msun lead to surface abundance profiles that are very
similar to those obtained in models with turbulence. Both models have about the same level of agreement
with observations of galactic-halo lithium abundances, as well as lithium and other elemental
abundances from metal poor globular clusters such as NGC 6397. In this cluster, models with mass
loss agree slightly better with subgiant observations of Li abundance than those with turbulence.
Lower red giant branch stars instead favor the models with turbulence. Larger differences between
models with mass loss and those with turbulence appear in the interior concentrations of metals.
The relatively high mass loss rates required to reproduce plateau-like lithium abundances appear
unlikely when compared to the solar mass-loss rate. However the presence of a chromosphere on these
stars justifies further investigation of the mass-loss rates.
