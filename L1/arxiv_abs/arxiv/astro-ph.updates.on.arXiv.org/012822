Searches for optical transients are usually performed with a cadence of days to weeks, optimised
for supernova discovery. The optical fast transient sky is still largely unexplored, with only
a few surveys to date having placed meaningful constraints on the detection of extragalactic transients
evolving at sub-hour timescales. Here, we present the results of deep searches for dim, minute-timescale
extragalactic fast transients using the Dark Energy Camera, a core facility of our all-wavelength
and all-messenger Deeper, Wider, Faster programme. We used continuous 20 s exposures to systematically
probe timescales down to 1.17 minutes at magnitude limits g > 23 (AB), detecting hundreds of transient
and variable sources. Nine candidates passed our strict criteria on duration and non-stellarity,
5 of which could later be classified as flare stars, but 4 of which have more unsure classification.
Searches for fast radio burst and gamma-ray counterparts during simultaneous multi-facility
observations yielded no counterparts to those 4 optical transients. Also, no long-term variability
was detected with pre-imaging and follow-up observations using the SkyMapper optical telescope.
We place (conservative) upper limits and (optimistic) measurements of minute-timescale fast
optical transient rates for a range of depths and timescales. Finally, we demonstrate that optical
g-band light curve behaviour alone cannot discriminate between confirmed extragalactic fast
transients such as prompt GRB flashes and Galactic stellar flares.
