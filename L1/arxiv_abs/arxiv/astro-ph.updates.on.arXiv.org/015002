The Carnegie-Chicago Hubble Program (CCHP) is building a direct path to the Hubble constant (H0)
using Population II stars as the calibrator of the SN Ia-based distance scale. This path to calibrate
the SN Ia is independent of the systematics in the traditional Cepheid-based technique. In this
paper, we present the distance to M101, the host to SN2011fe, using the I-band tip of the red giant
branch (TRGB) based on observations from the ACS/WFC instrument on the Hubble Space Telescope.
The CCHP targets the halo of M101 where there is little to no host-galaxy dust, the red giant branch
is isolated from nearly all other stellar populations, and there is virtually no source confusion
or crowding at the magnitude of the tip. Applying the standard procedure for the TRGB method from
the other works in the CCHP series, we find a foreground-extinction-corrected M101 distance modulus
of {\mu_0}=29.07+/-0.04(stat)+/-0.05(sys) mag, which corresponds to a distance of D=6.52+/-0.12(stat)+/-0.15(sys)
Mpc. This result is consistent with several recent Cepheid-based determinations, suggesting
agreement between Population I and II distance scales for this nearby SN Ia-host galaxy. We further
analyze four archival datasets for M101 that have targeted its outer disk to argue that targeting
in the stellar halo provides much more reliable distance measurements from the TRGB method due to
the combination of multiple structural components and heavily population contamination. Application
of the TRGB in complex regions will have sources of uncertainty not accounted for in commonly used
uncertainty measurement techniques.
