This paper is the first of a series of papers constraining cosmological parameters with weak lensing
peak statistics using $\sim 450~\rm deg^2$ of imaging data from the Kilo Degree Survey (KiDS-450).
We measure high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR: $\nu$) weak lensing convergence peaks in the range
of $3<\nu<5$, and employ theoretical models to derive expected values. These models are validated
using a suite of simulations. We take into account two major systematic effects, the boost factor
and the effect of baryons on the mass-concentration relation of dark matter haloes. In addition,
we investigate the impacts of other potential astrophysical systematics including the projection
effects of large scale structures, intrinsic galaxy alignments, as well as residual measurement
uncertainties in the shear and redshift calibration. Assuming a flat $\Lambda$CDM model, we find
constraints for $S_{\rm 8}=\sigma_{\rm 8}(\Omega_{\rm m}/0.3)^{0.5}=0.746^{+0.046}_{-0.107}$
according to the degeneracy direction of the cosmic shear analysis and $\Sigma_{\rm 8}=\sigma_{\rm
8}(\Omega_{\rm m}/0.3)^{0.38}=0.696^{+0.048}_{-0.050}$ based on the derived degeneracy direction
of our high-SNR peak statistics. The difference between the power index of $S_{\rm 8}$ and in $\Sigma_{\rm
8}$ indicates that combining the two probes has the potential to break the degeneracy in $\sigma_{\rm
8}$ and $\Omega_{\rm m}$. Our results are consistent with the cosmic shear tomographic correlation
analysis of the same dataset and $\sim 2\sigma$ lower than the Planck 2016 results.
