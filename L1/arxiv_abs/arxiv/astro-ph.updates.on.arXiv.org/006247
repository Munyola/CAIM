We present the full sample of 118 galaxy-scale strong-lens candidates in the Sloan Lens ACS (SLACS)
Survey for the Masses (S4TM) Survey, which are spectroscopically selected from the final data release
of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Follow-up Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging observations confirm
that 40 candidates are definite strong lenses with multiple lensed images. The foreground lens
galaxies are found to be early-type galaxies (ETGs) at redshifts 0.06 to 0.44, and background sources
are emission-line galaxies at redshifts 0.22 to 1.29. As an extension of the SLACS Survey, the S4TM
Survey is the first attempt to preferentially search for strong-lens systems with relatively lower
lens masses than those in the pre-existing strong-lens samples. By fitting HST data with a singular
isothermal ellipsoid model, we find total projected mass within the Einstein radius of the S4TM
strong-lens sample ranges from $3 \times10^{10} M_{\odot}$ to $2 \times10^{11} M_{\odot}$. In
[Shu15], we have derived the total stellar mass of the S4TM lenses to be $5 \times10^{10} M_{\odot}$
to $1 \times10^{12} M_{\odot}$. Both total enclosed mass and stellar mass of the S4TM lenses are
on average almost a factor of 2 smaller than those of the SLACS lenses, which also represent typical
mass scales of the current strong-lens samples. The extended mass coverage provided by the S4TM
sample can enable a direct test, with the aid of strong lensing, for transitions in scaling relations,
kinematic properties, mass structure, and dark-matter content trends of ETGs at intermediate-mass
scales as noted in previous studies.
