A new 1.4 GHz 19-element, dual-polarization, cryogenic phased array feed (PAF) radio astronomy
receiver has been developed for the Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope (GBT) as part of FLAG (Focal
L-band Array for the GBT) project. Commissioning observations of calibrator radio sources show
that this receiver has the lowest reported beamformed system temperature ($T_{\rm sys}$) normalized
by aperture efficiency ($\eta$) of any phased array receiver to date. The measured $T_{\rm sys}/\eta$
is $25.4 \pm 2.5$ K near 1350 MHz for the boresight beam, which is comparable to the performance of
the current 1.4 GHz cryogenic single feed receiver on the GBT. The degradation in $T_{\rm sys}/\eta$
at $\sim$ 4 arcmin (required for Nyquist sampling) and $\sim$ 8 arcmin offsets from the boresight
is, respectively, $\sim$ 1\% and $\sim$ 20\% of the boresight value. The survey speed of the PAF with
seven formed beams is larger by a factor between 2.1 and 7 compared to a single beam system depending
on the observing application. The measured performance, both in frequency and offset from boresight,
qualitatively agree with predictions from a rigorous electromagnetic model of the PAF. The astronomical
utility of the receiver is demonstrated by observations of the pulsar B0329+54 and an extended HII
region, the Rosette Nebula. The enhanced survey speed with the new PAF receiver will enable the GBT
to carry out exciting new science, such as more efficient observations of diffuse, extended neutral
hydrogen emission from galactic in-flows and searches for Fast Radio Bursts.
