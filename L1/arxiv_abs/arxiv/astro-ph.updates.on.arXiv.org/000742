We extend the grid of NLTE models presented in Paper II to explore variations in abundance pattern
in two ways: 1) The adoption of the Asplund et al. (2009) (GASS10) abundances, 2) For stars of metallicity,
[M/H], of -0.5, the adoption of a non-solar enhancement of alpha-elements by +0.3 dex. Moreover,
our grid of synthetic spectral energy distributions (SEDs) is interpolated to a finer numerical
resolution in both T_eff (Delta T_eff = 25 K) and log g (Delta log g = 0.25). We compare the values of
T_eff and log g inferred from fitting LTE and Non-LTE SEDs to observed SEDs throughout the entire
visible band, and in an ad hoc "blue" band. We compare our spectrophotometrically derived T_eff
values to a variety of T_eff calibrations, including more empirical ones, drawn from the literature.
For stars of solar metallicity, we find that the adoption of the GASS10 abundances lowers the inferred
T_eff value by 25 - 50 K for late-type giants, and NLTE models computed with the GASS10 abundances
give T_eff results that are marginally in better agreement with other T_eff calibrations. For stars
of [M/H]=-0.5 there is marginal evidence that adoption of alpha-enhancement further lowers the
derived T_eff value by 50 K. Stellar parameters inferred from fitting NLTE models to SEDs are more
dependent than LTE models on the wavelength region being fitted, and we find that the effect depends
on how heavily line blanketed the fitting region is, whether the fitting region is to the blue of the
Wien peak of the star's SED, or both.
