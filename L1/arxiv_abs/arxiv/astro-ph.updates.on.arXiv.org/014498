We construct Schwarzschild orbit-based models of NGC 7457, known as a peculiar low-mass lenticular
galaxy. Our best-fitting model successfully retrieves most of the unusual kinematics behaviours
of this galaxy, in which, the orbital distribution of stars is dominated by warm and hot orbits. The
reconstructed surface brightness of the hot component matches fairly well the photometric bulge
and the reconstructed LOSVD map of this component shows clear rotation around the major photometric
axis of the galaxy. In the absence of a dominant cold component, the outer part of our model is dominated
by warm orbits, representing an exponential thick disc. Our orbital analysis also confirm the existence
of a counter-rotating orbital substructure in the very centre, reported in previous observational
studies. By comparing our model with a variety of simulation studies, and considering the stellar
kinematics and populations properties of this galaxy, we suggest that the thick disc is most likely
a dynamically heated structure, formed through the interactions and accretion of satellite(s)
with near-polar initial inclination. We also suggest a merger-driven process as the most plausible
scenario to explain the observed and dynamically-modelled properties of the bulge of NGC 7457.
We conclude that both the high level of cylindrical rotation and unusually low velocity dispersion
reported for the NGC 7457 have most-likely external origins. Therefore, NGC 7457 could be considered
as a candidate for merger-driven cylindrical rotation in the absence of a strong bar in disc galaxies.
