The rapidly oscillating Ap (roAp) stars exhibit pulsational photometric and/or radial velocity
variations on time scales of several minutes, which are essential to test current pulsation models
as well as our assumptions of atmospheric structure characteristics. In addition, their chemical
peculiarity makes them very interesting for probing stellar formation and evolution in the presence
of a global magnetic field. To date, a limited number of only 61 roAp stars are known to show photometric
variability. On the other hand, a literature survey yields 619 unique stars that have unsuccessfully
been searched for variability of this kind. Stroemgren-Crawford uvbybeta photometry of stars
from both subgroups were used to investigate whether there is a selection bias of the investigated
stars. We also present new photometric measurements (202 hours in 59 different nights) of 55 roAp
candidates.We did not detect any new roAp star. Although our detection limits are comparable to
other surveys, we also did not find pulsations in the known roAp star HD 12098, which may be a consequence
of temporal amplitude changes. On the other hand, we do find some evidence for photometric variability
of beta CrB at its spectroscopically derived pulsation period. From the uvbybeta photometry we
conclude that the blue border of the roAp instability strip appears observationally well defined,
whereas the red border is rather poorly known and studied. Within these boundaries, a total of 4646
candidates were identified which appear worthwhile to be investigated for short-term pulsational
variability.
