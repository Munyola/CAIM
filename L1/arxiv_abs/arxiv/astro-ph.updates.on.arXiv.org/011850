A class of asteroids, called large super-fast rotators (large SFRs), have rotation periods shorter
than 2 hours and diameters larger than ~ 0.3 km. They pose challenges to the usual interior rubble-pile
structure unless a relatively high bulk density is assumed. So far, only six large SFRs have been
found. Therefore, we present a survey of asteroid rotation period using Pan-STARRS 1 telescopes
during 2016 October 26 to 31 to search more large SFRs and study their properties. A total of 876 reliable
rotation periods are measured, among which seven are large SFRs, thereby increasing the inventory
of known large SFRs. These seven newly discovered large SFRs have diverse colors and locations in
the main asteroid belt, suggesting that the taxonomic tendency and the location preference in the
inner main belt of the six perviously known large SFRs could be a bias due to various observational
limits. Interestingly, five out of the seven newly discovered large SFRs are mid main-belt asteroids.
Considering the rare discovery rates of large SFR in the previously similar surveys (Chang et al.,
2015, 2016) and the survey condition in this work, the chance of detecting a large SFR in the inner
main belt seems to be relatively low. This probably suggests that the inner main belt harbors less
large SFRs than the mid main belt. From our survey, we also found the drop in number appearing at f >
5 rev/day on the spin-rate distribution for the outer main-belt asteroids of D < 3 km, which was reported
for the inner and mid main belt by (Chang et al., 2015, 2016).
