We have serendipitously discovered that Leoncino Dwarf, an ultra-faint, low-metallicity record-holder
dwarf galaxy, may have hosted a transient source, and possibly exhibited a change in morphology,
a shift in the center of brightness, and peak variability of the main (host) source in images taken
approximately 40 yr apart; it is highly likely that these phenomena are related. Scenarios involving
a Solar System object, a stellar cluster, dust enshrouding, and accretion variability have been
considered, and discarded, as the origin of the transient. Although a combination of time-varying
strong and weak lensing effects, induced by an intermediate mass black hole (10$^4$ - 5 $\times$
10$^{5}$ M$_{\odot}$) moving within the Milky Way halo (0.1 -- 4 kpc), can conceivably explain all
of the observed variable galaxy properties, it is statistically highly unlikely according to current
theoretical predictions, and, therefore, also discarded. A cataclysmic event such as a supernova/hypernova
could have occurred, as long as the event was observed towards the later/late-stage descent of the
light curve, but this scenario fails to explain the absence of a post-explosion source and/or host
HII region in recent optical images. An episode related to the giant eruption of a luminous blue variable
star, a stellar merger or a nova, observed at, or near, peak magnitude may explain the transient source
and possibly the change in morphology/center of brightness, but can not justify the main source
peak variability, unless stellar variability is evoked.
