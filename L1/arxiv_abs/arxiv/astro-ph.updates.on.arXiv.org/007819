Doppler imaging spectroscopy is the most reliable way to directly measure wind speeds of planetary
atmospheres of the Solar system. However, most knowledge about atmospheric dynamics has been obtained
with cloud-tracking technique, which consists of tracking visible features from images taken
at different dates. Doppler imaging is as challenging - motions can be less than 100 m/s - as appealing
because it measures the speed of cloud particles instead of large cloud structures. Significant
difference is expected in case of atmospheric waves interfering with cloud structures. The purpose
of this paper is to provide a theoretical basis for conducting accurate Doppler measurements of
planetary atmospheres, especially from the ground with reflected solar absorption lines. We focus
on three aspects which lead to significant biases. Firstly, we fully review the Young effect, which
is an artificial radial velocity field caused by the solar rotation that mimics a retrograde planetary
rotation. Secondly, we extensively study the impact of atmospheric seeing and show that it modifies
the apparent location of the planet in the sky whenever the planet is not observed at full phase (opposition).
Besides, the seeing convolves regions of variable radial velocity and photometry, which biases
radial-velocity measurements, by reducing the apparent amplitude of atmospheric motions. Finally,
we propose a method to interpret data, i.e., how to retrieve zonal, meridional, vertical, and subsolar-to-antisolar
circulation from radial velocity maps, by optimizing the signal to noise ratio.
