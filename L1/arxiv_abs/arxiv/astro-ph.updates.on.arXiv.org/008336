Interpixel capacitance (IPC) is a deterministic electronic coupling that results in a portion
of the collected signal incident on one pixel of a hybridized detector array being measured in adjacent
pixels. Data collected by light sensitive HgCdTe arrays which exhibit this coupling typically
goes uncorrected or is corrected by treating the coupling as a fixed point spread function. Evidence
suggests that this IPC coupling is not uniform across different signal and background levels. This
variation invalidates assumptions that are key in decoupling techniques such as Wiener Filtering
or application of the Lucy- Richardson algorithm. Additionally, the variable IPC results in the
point spread function (PSF) depending upon a star's signal level relative to the background level,
amond other parameters. With an IPC ranging from 0.68% to 1.45% over the full well depth of a sensor,
as is a reasonable range for the H2RG arrays, the FWHM of the JWSTs NIRCam 405N band is degraded from
2.080 pix (0".132) as expected from the diffraction patter to 2.186 pix (0".142) when the star is
just breaching the sensitivity limit of the system. For example, when attempting to use a fixed PSF
fitting (e.g. assuming the PSF observed from a bright star in the field) to untangle two sources with
a flux ratio of 4:1 and a center to center distance of 3 pixels, flux estimation can be off by upwards
of 1.5% with a separation error of 50 millipixels. To deal with this issue an iterative non-stationary
method for deconvolution is here proposed, implemented, and evaluated that can account for the
signal dependent nature of IPC.
