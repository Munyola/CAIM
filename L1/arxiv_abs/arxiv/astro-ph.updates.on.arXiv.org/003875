Fast magnetic reconnection events can be a very powerful mechanism operating in the core region,
near the jet launching area, of microquasars and AGNs. In earlier work, it has been suggested that
the power released by fast reconnection events between the magnetic field lines lifting from the
inner accretion disk region and the lines anchored into the central black hole could accelerate
relativistic particles and produce the observed radio emission from microquasars and low luminosity
AGNs (LLAGNs). Moreover, it has been proposed that the observed correlation between the radio emission
and the mass of these sources, spanning $10^{10}$ orders of magnitude in mass, might be related to
this process. In the present work, we revisit this model comparing different fast magnetic reconnection
mechanisms, and apply the scenario above to a much larger sample of sources (including also blazars,
and gamma-ray bursts - GRBs). We find that LLAGNs and microquasars do confirm the trend above. Furthermore,
when driven by turbulence, not only their radio but also their gamma-ray emission can be due to magnetic
power released fast reconnection which may accelerate particles to relativistic velocities in
the core region of these sources. On the other hand, the emission from blazars and GRBs does not follow
the same trend as that of the LLAGNs and microquasars, suggesting that the radio and gamma-ray emission
in these cases is produced further out along the jet, by another population of relativistic particles,
as expected.
