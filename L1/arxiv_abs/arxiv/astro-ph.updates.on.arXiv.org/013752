The internal dynamics of multiple stellar populations in Globular Clusters (GCs) provide unique
constraints on the physical processes responsible for their formation. Specifically, the present-day
kinematics of cluster stars, such as rotation and velocity dispersion, seem to be related to the
initial configuration of the system. In a recent work, we analyzed for the first time the kinematics
of the different stellar populations in NGC 0104 over a large field of view, exploiting the Gaia Data
Release 2 proper motions combined with multi-band ground-based photometry. In this paper, we extend
this analysis to six GCs, namely NGC 0288, NGC 5904, NGC 6121, NGC 6752 and NGC 6838 and further explore
NGC 0104. Among the analyzed clusters only NGC 0104 and NGC 5904 show significant rotation in the
plane of the sky. By separating our sample in 1G and 2G stars we find that overall these two populations
exhibit a similar rotation pattern in NGC 0104. However, some hints of different rotations between
1G and 2G stars are observed in the external regions of this cluster. Interestingly, 1G and 2G stars
in NGC 5904 exhibit different rotation curves, with distinct phases. The radial components of the
motion of 1G and 2G stars show different radial trends, in contrast with what is observed in most of
the other clusters. There is no evidence for rotation among the selected 1G and 2G stars of the remaining
clusters. The analysis of the velocity-dispersion profiles of multiple populations confirms
that 2G stars of NGC 0104 show stronger anisotropy than the 1G.
