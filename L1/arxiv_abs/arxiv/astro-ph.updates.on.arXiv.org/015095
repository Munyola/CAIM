A small subset of young stellar objects (YSOs) exhibit "see-saw" temporal variations in their mid-infrared
SED; as the flux short-ward of a fulcrum wavelength ($\lambda_{f}$) increases the flux long-wards
of this wavelength decreases (and vice-versa) over timescales of weeks to years. While previous
studies have shown that an opaque, axisymmetric occulter of variable height can cause this behaviour
in the SED of these objects, the conditions under which a single $\lambda_{f}$ occurs have not previously
been determined, nor the factors determining its value. Using radiative transfer modelling, we
conduct a parametric study of the exemplar of this class, LRLL 31 to explore this phenomenon, and
confirm that the cause of this flux variation is likely due to the change in height of the optically
thick inner rim of the accretion disc at the dust sublimation radius, or some other phenomenon which
results in a similar appearance. We also determine that a fulcrum wavelength only occurs for high
inclinations, where the line of sight intersects the accretion disc. Accepting that the disc of
LRLL 31 is highly inclined, the inner rim radius, radial and vertical density profiles are independently
varied to gauge what effect this had on $\lambda_{f}$ and its position relative to the silicate feature
near $10 \mu$m. While $\lambda_{f}$ is a function of each of these parameters, it is found to be most
strongly dependent on the vertical density exponent $\beta$. All other factors being held constant,
only for flatter discs ($\beta < 1.2$) did we find a $\lambda_{f}$ beyond the silicate feature.
