We report the formation of bound star clusters in a sample of high-resolution cosmological zoom-in
simulations of z>5 galaxies from the FIRE project. We find that bound clusters preferentially form
in high-pressure clouds with gas surface densities over 10^4 Msun pc^-2, where the cloud-scale
star formation efficiency is near unity and young stars born in these regions are gravitationally
bound at birth. These high-pressure clouds are compressed by feedback-driven winds and/or collisions
of smaller clouds/gas streams in highly gas-rich, turbulent environments. The newly formed clusters
follow a power-law mass function of dN/dM~M^-2. The cluster formation efficiency is similar across
galaxies with stellar masses of ~10^7-10^10 Msun at z>5. The age spread of cluster stars is typically
a few Myrs and increases with cluster mass. The metallicity dispersion of cluster members is ~0.08
dex in [Z/H] and does not depend on cluster mass significantly. Our findings support the scenario
that present-day old globular clusters (GCs) were formed during relatively normal star formation
in high-redshift galaxies. Simulations with a stricter/looser star formation model form a factor
of a few more/fewer bound clusters per stellar mass formed, while the shape of the mass function is
unchanged. Simulations with a lower local star formation efficiency form more stars in bound clusters.
The simulated clusters are larger than observed GCs due to finite resolution. Our simulations are
among the first cosmological simulations that form bound clusters self-consistently in a wide
range of high-redshift galaxies.
