We present a comprehensive view of the W51B HII region complex and the W51C supernova remnant (SNR)
using new radio observations from the VLA, VLBA, MERLIN, JCMT, and CSO along with archival data from
Spitzer, ROSAT, ASCA, and Chandra. Our VLA data include the first 400 cm (74 MHz) continuum image
of W51 at high resolution (88 arcsec). The 400 cm image shows non-thermal emission surrounding the
G49.2-0.3 HII region, and a compact source of non-thermal emission (W51B_NT) coincident with the
previously-identified OH (1720 MHz) maser spots, non-thermal 21 and 90 cm emission, and a hard X-ray
source. W51B_NT falls within the region of high likelihood for the position of TeV gamma-ray emission.
Using the VLBA three OH (1720 MHz) maser spots are detected in the vicinity of W51B_NT with sizes of
60 to 300 AU and Zeeman effect magnetic field strengths of 1.5 to 2.2 mG. The multiwavelength data
demonstrate that the northern end of the W51B HII region complex has been partly enveloped by the
advancing W51C SNR and this interaction explains the presence of W51B_NT and the OH masers. This
interaction also appears in the thermal molecular gas which partially encircles W51B_NT and exhibits
narrow pre-shock (DeltaV 5 km/s) and broad post-shock (DeltaV 20 km/s) velocity components. RADEX
radiative transfer modeling of these two components yield physical conditions consistent with
the passage of a non-dissociative C-type shock. Confirmation of the W51B/W51C interaction provides
additional evidence in favor of this region being one of the best candidates for hadronic particle
acceleration known thus far.
