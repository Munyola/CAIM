We have started a long-term reverberation mapping project using the Wyoming Infrared Observatory
2.3 meter telescope titled "Monitoring AGNs with H\beta\ Asymmetry" (MAHA). The motivations of
the project are to explore the geometry and kinematics of the gas responsible for complex H\beta\
emission-line profiles, ideally leading to an understanding of the structures and origins of the
broad-line region (BLR). Furthermore, such a project provides the opportunity to search for evidence
of close binary supermassive black holes. We describe MAHA and report initial results from our first
campaign, from December 2016 to May 2017, highlighting velocity-resolved time lags for four AGNs
with asymmetric H\beta\ lines. We find that 3C 120, Ark 120, and Mrk 6 display complex features different
from the simple signatures expected for pure outflow, inflow, or a Keplerian disk. While three of
the objects have been previously reverberation mapped, including velocity-resolved time lags
in the cases of 3C 120 and Mrk 6, we report a time lag and corresponding black hole mass measurement
for SBS 1518+593 for the first time. Furthermore, SBS 1518+593, the least asymmetric of the four,
does show velocity-resolved time lags characteristic of a Keplerian disk or virialized motion
more generally. Also, the velocity-resolved time lags of 3C 120 have significantly changed since
previously observed, indicating an evolution of its BLR structure. Future analyses of the data
for these objects and others in MAHA will explore the full diversity of H\beta\ lines and the physics
of AGN BLRs.
