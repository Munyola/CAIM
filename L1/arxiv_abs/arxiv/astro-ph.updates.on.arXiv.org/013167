We report on the discovery of five carbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) stars in the metallicity range
of $-3.3<$ [Fe/H] $<-2.4$. These stars were selected from the LAMOST DR3 low-resolution (R$ \sim$
2,000) spectroscopic database as metal-poor candidates and followed-up with high-resolution
spectroscopy (R$ \sim$110,000) with the LICK/APF. Stellar parameters and individual abundances
for 25 chemical elements (from Li to Eu) are presented for the first time. These stars exhibit chemical
abundance patterns that are similar to those reported in other literature studies of very and extremely
metal-poor stars. One of our targets, J2114$-$0616, shows high enhancement in carbon ([C/Fe]=1.37),
nitrogen ([N/Fe]= 1.88), barium ([Ba/Fe]=1.00), and europium ([Eu/Fe]=0.84). Such chemical
abundance pattern suggests that J2114$-$0616 can be classified as CEMP-r/s star. In addition,
the star J1054+0528 can be classified as a CEMP-rI star, with [Eu/Fe]=0.44 and [Ba/Fe]=$-$0.52.
The other stars in our sample show no enhancements in neutron-capture elements and can be classified
as CEMP-no stars. We also performed a kinematic and dynamical analysis of the sample stars based
on Gaia DR2 data. The kinematic parameters, orbits, and binding energy of these stars, show that
J2114$-$0616 is member of the outer halo population, while the remaining stars belong to the inner
halo population but with an accreted origin. Collectively, these results add important constraints
on the origin and evolution of CEMP stars as well as on their possible formation scenarios.
