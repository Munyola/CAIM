As the disk formation mechanism(s) in Be stars is(are) as yet unknown, we investigate the role of
rapidly rotating radiation-driven winds in this process. We implemented the effects of high stellar
rotation on m-CAK models accounting for: the shape of the star, the oblate finite disk correction
factor, and gravity darkening. For a fast rotating star, we obtain a two-component wind model, i.e.,
a fast, thin wind in the polar latitudes and an $\Omega$-slow, dense wind in the equatorial regions.
We use the equatorial mass densities to explore H$\alpha$ emission profiles for the following scenarios:
1) a spherically symmetric star, 2) an oblate shaped star with constant temperature, and 3) an oblate
star with gravity darkening. One result of this work is that we have developed a novel method for solving
the gravity darkened, oblated m-CAK equation of motion. Furthermore, from our modeling we find
a) the oblate finite disk correction factor, for the scenario considering the gravity darkening,
can vary by at least a factor of two between the equatorial and polar directions, influencing the
velocity profile and mass-loss rate accordingly, b) the H$\alpha$ profiles predicted by our model
are in agreement with those predicted by a standard power-law model for following values of the line-force
parameters: $1.5 \lesssim k \lesssim 3$, $ \, \alpha \sim 0.6$ and $\, \delta \gtrsim 0.1$, and c)
the contribution of the fast wind component to the H$\alpha$ emission line profile is negligible;
therefore, the line profiles arise mainly from the equatorial disks of Be stars.
