We study the saturation effect on broad absorption line (BAL) variability through a variation phenomenon,
which shows significant variation in Si IV BAL but no, or only small, change in C IV BAL (hereafter
Phenomenon I). First, we explore a typical case showing Phenomenon I, quasar SDSS J153715.74+582933.9
(hereafter J1537+5829). We identify four narrow absorption line (NAL) systems within its Si IV
BAL and two additional NAL systems within its C IV BAL, and confirm their coordinated weakening.
Combining with the obvious strengthening of the ionizing continuum, we attribute the BAL variability
in J1537+5829 to the ionization changes caused by the continuum variations. Secondly, a statistical
study based on multiobserved quasars from SDSS-I/II/III is presented. We confirm that (1) the moderate
anticorrelation between the fractional variations of Si IV BALs and the continuum in 74 quasars
that show Phenomenon I and (2) the sample showing BAL variations tends to have larger ionizing continuum
variations. These results reveal the ubiquitous effect of the continuum variability on Phenomenon
I and BAL variation. We attribute the relative lack of variation of C IV BALs in Phenomenon I to the
saturation effects. Nonetheless, these absorbers are not very optically thick in Si IV and the ionization
changes in response to continuum variations could be the main driver of their variations. Finally,
we find that the saturation effect on BAL variability can well explain many phenomena of BAL variations
that have been reported before.
