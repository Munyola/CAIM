The highest energies of solar energetic nucleons detected in space or through gamma-ray emission
in the solar atmosphere are in the GeV range. Where and how the particles are accelerated is still
controversial. We search for observational evidence on the acceleration region(s) by comparing
the timing of relativistic protons detected at Earth and radiative signatures in the solar atmosphere.
To this end a detailed comparison is undertaken of the double-peaked time profile of relativistic
protons, derived from the worldwide network of neutron monitors during the large particle event
of 2005 January 20, with UV imaging and radio petrography over a broad frequency band from the low
corona to interplanetary space. We show that both relativistic proton releases to interplanetary
space were accompanied by distinct episodes of energy release and electron acceleration in the
corona traced by the radio emission and by brightenings of UV kernels in the low solar atmosphere.
The timing of electromagnetic emissions and relativistic protons suggests that the first proton
peak was related to the acceleration of gamma-ray emitting protons during the impulsive flare phase,
as shown before. The second proton peak occurred together with signatures of magnetic restructuring
in the corona after the CME passage. We attribute the acceleration to reconnection and possibly
turbulence in large-scale coronal loops. While type II radio emission was observed in the high corona,
there is no evidence of a temporal relationship with the relativistic proton acceleration.
