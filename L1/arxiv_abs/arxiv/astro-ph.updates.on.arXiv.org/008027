We propose two methods for robustly estimating extragalactic distance errors in multi-measurement
catalogs. We seek to improve upon more commonly used frequentist propagation-of-error methods,
as they fail to explain both the scatter between different measurements and the effects of skewness
in the metric distance probability distribution. For individual galaxies, the most transparent
way to assess the variance of redshift independent distances is to directly sample the posterior
probability distribution obtained from the mixture of reported measurements. However, sampling
the posterior can be cumbersome for catalog-wide precision cosmology applications. We compare
the performance of frequentist methods versus our proposed measures for estimating the true variance
of the metric distance probability distribution. We provide pre-computed distance error data
tables for galaxies in 3 catalogs: NED-D, HyperLEDA, and Cosmicflows-3. From a Markov Chain Monte
Carlo-based analysis of systematic and random effects in the computed errors, we develop a predictive
Bayesian model for the variance of distance errors for Tully-Fisher relation (TF) derived distances
in NED-D. We validate this model with a Bayesian $p$-value computed using the Freeman-Tukey discrepancy
measure as a posterior predictive check. We are then able to predict distance errors for 818 galaxies
in the NED-D catalog which do not report TF distance modulus errors. Our goal is that our pre-computed
errors are used in catalog-wide applications that require acknowledging the true variance of extragalactic
distance measurements.
