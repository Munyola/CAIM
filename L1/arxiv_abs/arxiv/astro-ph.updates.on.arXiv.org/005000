We study the triggering mechanism of a limb-prominence eruption and the associated coronal mass
ejection near AR 12342 using SDO and LASCO/SOHO observations. The prominence is seen with an embedded
flux thread (FT) at one end and bifurcates from the middle to a different footpoint location. The
morphological evolution of the FT is similar to an unstable flux rope (FR), which we regard as prominence
embedded FR. The FR twist exceeds the critical value. In addition, the morphology of the prominence
plasma in 304\AA~images marks the helical nature of the magnetic skeleton with a total of 2.96 turns
along arc length. The potential field extrapolation model indicates that the critical height of
the background magnetic field gradient falls within the inner corona (105Mm) consistent with the
extent of coronal plasma loops. These results suggest that the helical kink instability in the embedded
FR caused the slow rise of the prominence to a height of the torus instability domain. Moreover, the
differential emission measure analysis unveils heating of the prominence plasma to coronal temperatures
during eruption, suggesting a reconnection-related heating underneath the upward rising embedded
FR. The prominence starts with a slow rise motion of 10km/s, followed by fast and slow acceleration
phases having an average acceleration of $28.9m/s^2$, $2.4m/s^2$ in C2, C3 field of view respectively.
As predicted by previous numerical simulations, the observed synchronous kinematic profiles
of the CME leading edge and the core supports the involved FR instability in the prominence initiation.
