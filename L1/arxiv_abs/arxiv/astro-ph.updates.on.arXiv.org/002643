The Calar Alto Legacy Integral Field Area survey (CALIFA survey) is providing Integral Field Spectroscopy
(IFS) data in the entire optical window for a diameter-limited sample of 600 objects in the Local
Universe (0.005$<$z$<$0.03). One of the main goals of this survey is to explore the spatial
distribution of the star formation in nearby galaxies free from the limitations associated to either
UV (dust attenuation) or narrow-band H$\alpha$ imaging (underlying H$\beta$ absorption). These
are limitations that have prevented (until now) carrying out a detailed study of the evolution of
the SFR by components (nuclei, bulges, disks), even locally. This kind of studies are key, for example,
for understanding how galaxies really evolve from the Blue Cloud to the Red Sequence. We will first
discuss in detail the validity of the assumption that the SFR given by the extincion-corrected H$\alpha$
is a good measure of the total SFR by means of cross-comparing this with other SFR estimators, namely
the integrated UV+22$\mu$m, UV+TIR, H$\alpha_{\rm{obs}}$+22$\mu$m, or H$\alpha_{\rm{obs}}$+TIR.
Only once these effects are properly accounted for we can obtain preliminary results from the spatially-resolved
analysis of the contribution of disks to the total SFR in the Local Universe, as a local benchmark
for future studies of disks at high redshift. Our analysis shows that at least in the Local Universe
the H$\alpha$ luminosity derived from observations of the CALIFA IFS survey can be used to trace
the SFR and that the disk to total (disk + bulge) SFR ratio is on average $\sim$88 $\%$.
