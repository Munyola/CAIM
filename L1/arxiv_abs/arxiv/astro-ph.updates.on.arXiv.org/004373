The mass function of galaxy clusters is a sensitive tracer of the gravitational evolution of the
cosmic large-scale structure and serves as an important census of the fraction of matter bound in
large structures. We obtain the mass function by fitting the observed cluster X-ray luminosity
distribution from the REFLEX galaxy cluster survey to models of cosmological structure formation.
We marginalise over uncertainties in the cosmological parameters as well as those of the relevant
galaxy cluster scaling relations. The mass function is determined with an uncertainty less than
10% in the mass range 3 x 10^12 to 5 x 10^14 M$_\odot$. For the cumulative mass function we find a slope
at the low mass end consistent with a value of -1, while the mass rich end cut-off is milder than a Schechter
function with an exponential term exp($- M^\delta$) with $\delta$ smaller than 1. Changing the
Hubble parameter in the range $H_0 = 67 - 73 km s^-1 Mpc^{-1}$ or allowing the total neutrino mass to
have a value between 0 - 0.4 eV causes variations less than the uncertainties. We estimate the fraction
of mass locked up in galaxy clusters: about 4.4% of the matter in the Universe is bound in clusters
(inside $r_200$) with a mass larger than 10^14 M$_\odot$ and 14% to clusters and groups with a mass
larger than 10^13 M$_\odot$ at the present Universe. We also discuss the evolution of the galaxy
cluster population with redshift. Our results imply that there is hardly any clusters with a mass
> 10^15 M$_\odot$ above a redshift of z = 1.
