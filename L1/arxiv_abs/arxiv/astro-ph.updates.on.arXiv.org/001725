It has been recently proposed to combine the node drifts of the future constellation of 27 Galileo
spacecraft together with those of the existing LAGEOS-type satellites to improve the accuracy
of the past and ongoing tests of the Lense-Thirring (LT) effect by removing the bias of a larger number
of even zonal harmonics $J_{\ell}$ than either done or planned so far. Actually, it seems a difficult
goal to be realistically achieved for a number of reasons. First, the LT range signature of a Galileo-type
satellite is as little as $0.5$ mm over 3-days arcs, corresponding to a node rate of just $\dot\Omega_{\rm
LT}=2$ milliarcseconds per year (mas yr$^{-1}$). Some tesseral and sectorial ocean tides such
as $K_1,K_2$ induce long-period harmonic node perturbations with frequencies which are integer
multiples of the extremely slow Galileo's node rate $\dot\Omega$ completing a full cycle in about
40 yr. Thus, over time spans $T$ of some years they would act as superimposed semi-secular aliasing
trends. Since the coefficients of the $J_{\ell}$-free multisatellite linear combinations are
determined only by the semimajor axis $a$, the eccentricity $e$ and the inclination $I$, which are
nominally equal for all the Galileo satellites, it is not possible to include all of them. Even by
using only one Galileo spacecraft together with the LAGEOS family would be unfeasible because the
resulting Galileo coefficient would be $\gtrsim 1$, thus enhancing the aliasing impact of the uncancelled
non-conservative and tidal perturbations.
