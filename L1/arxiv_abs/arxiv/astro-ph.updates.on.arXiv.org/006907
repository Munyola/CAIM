We present a polarisation map of the warm dust emission from the minispiral in the central parsec
of the Galactic centre. The observations were made at a wavelength of 12.5 microns with CanariCam
mounted on the 10.4-m Gran Telescopio Canarias. The magnetic field traced by the polarised emission
from aligned dust grains is consistent with previous observations, but the increased resolution
of the present data reveals considerably more information on the detailed structure of the B field
and its correspondence with the filamentary emission seen in both mid-infrared continuum emission
and free-free emission at cm wavelengths. The magnetic field appears to be compressed and pushed
by the outflows from luminous stars in the Northern Arm, but it is not disordered by them. We identify
some magnetically coherent filaments that cross the Northern Arm at a Position Angle of ~45 degrees,
and which may trace orbits inclined to the primary orientation of the Northern Arm and circumnuclear
disk. In the East-West bar, the magnetic fields implied by the polarization in the lower intensity
regions lie predominantly along the bar at a Position Angle of 130 - 140 degrees. In contrast to the
Northern Arm, the brighter regions of the bar tend to have lower degrees of polarization with a greater
divergence in position angle compared to the local diffuse emission. It appears that the diffuse
emission in the East-West bar traces the underlying field and that the bright compact sources are
unrelated objects presumably projected onto the bar and with different field orientations
