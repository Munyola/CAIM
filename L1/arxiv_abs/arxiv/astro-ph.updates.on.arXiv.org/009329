Many spiral galaxies have extended outer H~I disks and display low levels of star formation, inferred
from the far-ultraviolet emission detected by {\it GALEX}, well beyond the optical radius. Here,
we investigate the supernova (SN) rate in the outskirts of galaxies, using the largest and most homogeneous
set of nearby supernovae (SNe) from the Lick Observatory Supernova Search (LOSS). While SN rates
have been measured with respect to various galaxy properties, such as stellar mass and metallicity,
their relative frequency in the outskirts versus the inner regions has not yet been studied. Understanding
the SN rate as a function of intragalactic environment has many ramifications, including the interpretation
of LIGO observations, the formation of massive stars, and the puzzlingly high velocity dispersion
of the outer H~I disk. Using data from the LOSS survey, we find that the rate beyond the optical radius
of spiral galaxies is $2.5 \pm 0.5$ SNe per millennium, while dwarf galaxies host $ 4.0 \pm 2.2$ SNe
per millennium. The rates of core-collapse SNe (that may collapse to form the massive black holes
detected by LIGO/Virgo) in the outer disks of spirals is $1.5 \pm 0.15$ SNe per millennium and in dwarf
galaxies is $2.6 \pm 1.5$ SNe per millennium. Core-collapse SNe in spiral outskirts contribute
$7600 \pm 1700$\,SNe\,~Gpc$^{-3}$\,yr$^{-1}$ to the volumetric rate, and dwarf galaxies have
a rate of $31,000 \pm 18,000$\,SNe\,Gpc$^{-3}$\,yr$^{-1}$. The relative ratio of core-collapse
to Type Ia SNe is comparable in the inner and outer parts of spirals, and in dwarf galaxies.
