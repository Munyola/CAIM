We present an analysis of ALMA 1.25 millimeter continuum observations of spiral structures in three
protoplanetary disks from the Disk Substructures at High Angular Resolution Project (Andrews
et al. 2018). The disks around Elias 27, IM Lup, and WaOph 6 were observed at a resolution of $\sim40-60$
mas ($\sim6-7$ au). All three disks feature $m=2$ spiral patterns in conjunction with annular substructures.
Gas kinematics established by $^{12}$CO $J=2-1$ observations indicate that the continuum spiral
arms are trailing. The arm-interarm intensity contrasts are modest, typically less than 3. The
Elias 27 spiral pattern extends throughout much of the disk, and the arms intersect the gap at $R\sim69$
au. The spiral pattern in the IM Lup disk is particularly complex-it extends about halfway radially
through the disk, exhibiting pitch angle variations with radius and interarm features that may
be part of ring substructures or spiral arm branches. Spiral arms also extend most of the way through
the WaOph 6 disk, but the source overall is much more compact than the other two disks. We discuss possible
origins for the spiral structures, including gravitational instability and density waves induced
by a stellar or planetary companion. Unlike the millimeter continuum counterparts of many of the
disks with spiral arms detected in scattered light, these three sources do not feature high-contrast
crescent-like asymmetries or large ($R>20$ au) emission cavities. This difference may point to
multiple spiral formation mechanisms operating in disks.
