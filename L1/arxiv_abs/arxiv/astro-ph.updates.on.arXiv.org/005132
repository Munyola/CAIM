We present abundance measurements of elements O, C, Si and Fe for three gas-rich galaxies at z~5 using
observations from the Very Large Telescope (VLT) and the Keck telescope in order to better constrain
the early chemical enrichment of gas-rich galaxies. These galaxies show strong Lyman-{\alpha}
absorption in the spectra of background quasars, with neutral hydrogen column densities log N${_H{}_I}$(cm$^{-2}$)=20.10$\pm$0.15,
20.10$\pm$0.15, and 20.80$\pm$0.15. Using the undepleted element O, we find the metallicities
[O/H] to be in the range of -2.51 to -2.05 dex. Our study has doubled the existing sample of measurements
of undepleted elements at z>4.5. Combining our measurements with those from the literature, we
find that the N${_H{}_I}$-weighted mean metallicity of z~5 absorbers is consistent with the prediction
based on z<4.5 DLAs. Thus, we find no significant evidence of a sudden drop in metallicity at z>4.7
as reported by some prior studies. We also determine the extent of dust depletion using a combination
of both the volatile element O and the refractory elements Si and/or Fe. Some of the absorbers show
evidence of depletion of elements on dust grains, e.g. low [Si/O] or [Fe/O]. The relative abundances
of these absorbers along with other z~5 absorbers from the literature show some peculiarities,
e.g. low [C/O] in several absorbers and high [Si/O] in one absorber. Finally, we find that the metallicity
vs. velocity dispersion relation of z~5 absorbers may be different from that of lower-redshift
absorbers.
