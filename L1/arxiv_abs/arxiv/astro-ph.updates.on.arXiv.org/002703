We extend the non-equilibrium model for the chemical and thermal evolution of diffuse interstellar
gas presented in Richings et al. (2014) to account for shielding from the UV radiation field. We attenuate
the photochemical rates by dust and by gas, including absorption by HI, H2, HeI, HeII and CO where
appropriate. We then use this model to investigate the dominant cooling and heating processes in
interstellar gas as it becomes shielded from the UV radiation. We consider a one-dimensional plane-parallel
slab of gas irradiated by the interstellar radiation field, either at constant density and temperature
or in thermal and pressure equilibrium. The dominant thermal processes tend to form three distinct
regions in the clouds. At low column densities cooling is dominated by ionised metals such as SiII,
FeII, FeIII and CII, which are balanced by photoheating, primarily from HI. Once the hydrogen-ionising
radiation becomes attenuated by neutral hydrogen, photoelectric dust heating dominates, while
CII becomes dominant for cooling. Finally, dust shielding triggers the formation of CO and suppresses
photoelectric heating. The dominant coolants in this fully shielded region are H2 and CO. The column
density of the HI-H2 transition predicted by our model is lower at higher density (or at higher pressure
for gas clouds in pressure equilibrium) and at higher metallicity, in agreement with previous PDR
models. We also compare the HI-H2 transition in our model to two prescriptions for molecular hydrogen
formation that have been implemented in hydrodynamic simulations.
