At $z\sim2$, star-formation activity is thought to be high even in high-density environments such
as galaxy clusters and proto-clusters. One of the critical but outstanding issues is if structural
growth of star-forming galaxies can differ depending on their surrounding environments. In order
to investigate how galaxies grow their structures and what physical processes are involved in the
evolution of galaxies, one requires spatially resolved images of not only stellar components but
also star-forming regions within galaxies. We conducted the Adaptive Optics(AO)-assisted imaging
observations for star-forming galaxies in a dense proto-cluster core at $z=2.53$ with IRCS and
AO188 mounted on the Subaru Telescope. A combination of AO and narrow-band filters allows us to obtain
resolved maps of H$\alpha$-emitting regions with an angular resolution of 0.1--0.2~arcsec, which
corresponds to $\sim1$ kpc at $z\sim2.5$. Based on stacking analyses, we compare radial profiles
of star-forming regions and stellar components and find that the star-forming region of a sub-sample
with $\rm log(M_*/M_\odot)\sim10-11$ is more extended than the stellar component, indicating
the inside-out growth of the structure. This trend is similar to the one for star-forming galaxies
in general fields at $z=2-2.5$ obtained with the same observational technique. Our results suggest
that the structural evolution of star-forming galaxies at $z=2-2.5$ is mainly driven by internal
secular processes irrespective of surrounding environments.
