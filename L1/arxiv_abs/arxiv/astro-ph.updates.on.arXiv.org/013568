We present new Chandra constraints on the X-ray luminosity functions (XLFs) of X-ray binary (XRB)
populations, and their scaling relations, for a sample of 38 nearby galaxies (D = 3.4-29 Mpc). Our
galaxy sample is drawn primarily from the Spitzer infrared nearby galaxy survey (SINGS), and contains
a wealth of Chandra (5.8 Ms total) and multiwavelength data, allowing for star-formation rates
(SFRs) and stellar masses (M*) to be measured on subgalactic scales. We divided the 2478 X-ray detected
sources into 21 subsamples in bins of specific-SFR (sSFR = SFR/M*) and constructed XLFs. To model
the XLF dependence on sSFR, we fit a global XLF model, containing contributions from high-mass XRBs
(HMXBs), low-mass XRBs (LMXBs), and background sources from the cosmic X-ray background (CXB)
that respectively scale with SFR, M*, and sky area. We find an HMXB XLF that is more complex in shape
than previously reported and an LMXB XLF that likely varies with sSFR, potentially due to an age dependence.
When applying our global model to XLF data for each individual galaxy, we discover a few galaxy XLFs
that significantly deviate from our model beyond statistical scatter. Most notably, relatively
low-metallicity galaxies have an excess of HMXBs above ~10^38 erg/s and elliptical galaxies that
have relatively rich populations of globular clusters (GCs) show excesses of LMXBs compared to
the global model. Additional modeling of how the XRB XLF depends on stellar age, metallicity, and
GC specific frequency is required to sufficiently characterize the XLFs of galaxies.
