In the canonical model for tidal disruption events (TDEs), the stellar debris circularizes quickly
to form an accretion disk of size about twice the orbital pericenter of the star. Most TDEs and candidates
discovered in the optical/UV have broad optical emission lines with complex and diverse profiles
of puzzling origin. Liu et al. recently developed a relativistic elliptical disk model of constant
eccentricity in radius for the broad optical emission lines of TDEs and well reproduced the double-peaked
line profiles of the TDE candidate PTF09djl with a large and extremely eccentric accretion disk.
In this paper, we show that the optical emission lines of the TDE ASASSN-14li with radically different
profiles are well modelled with the relativistic elliptical disk model, too. The accretion disk
of ASASSN-14li has an eccentricity 0.97 and semimajor axis of 847 times the Schwarzschild radius
(r_S) of the black hole (BH). It forms as the consequence of tidal disruption of a star passing by a
massive BH with orbital pericenter 25r_S. The optical emission lines of ASASSN-14li are powered
by an extended X-ray source of flat radial distribution overlapping the bulk of the accretion disk
and the single-peaked asymmetric line profiles are mainly due to the orbital motion of the emitting
matter within the disk plane of inclination about 26\degr and of pericenter orientation closely
toward the observer. Our results suggest that modelling the complex line profiles is powerful in
probing the structures of accretion disks and coronal X-ray sources in TDEs.
