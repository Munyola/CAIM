The Crab nebula is a supernova remnant exhibiting a highly polarized synchrotron radiation at radio
and millimeter wavelengths. It is the brightest source in the microwave sky with an extension of
7 by 5 arcminutes and commonly used as a standard candle for any experiment which aims at measuring
the polarization of the sky. Though its spectral energy distribution has been well characterized
in total intensity, polarization data are still lacking at millimetre wavelengths. We report in
this paper high resolution (1800 FWHM) observations of the Crab nebula in total intensity and linear
polarization at 150 GHz with the NIKA camera. NIKA, operated at the IRAM 30 m telescope from 2012 to
2015, is a camera made of Lumped Element Kinetic Inductance Detectors (LEKIDs) observing the sky
at 150 and 260 GHz. From these observations we are able to reconstruct the spatial distribution of
the Crab nebula polarization degree and angle, which is found to be compatible with previous observations
at lower and higher frequencies. Averaging across the source and using other existing data sets
we find that the Crab nebula polarization angle is consistent with being constant over a wide range
of frequencies with a value of -87.5^{\circle} +- 0.3 in Galactic coordinates. We also present the
first estimation of the Crab nebula Spectral Energy Distribution polarized flux in a wide frequency
range: 30-353 GHz. Assuming a single power law emission model we find that the polarization spectral
index \beta_{pol} = - 0.347 +- 0.026 is compatible with the intensity spectral index \beta = - 0.323
+- 0.001.
