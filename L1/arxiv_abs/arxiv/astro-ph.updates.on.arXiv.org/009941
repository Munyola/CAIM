The current paper is addressing the possibility of the Dark Energy scalar field potential reconstruction
from the SNe Ia data and the problems arising during the process. We describe the method and test its
limits, stability of the reconstruction with respect to the $\Omega_m$ and $H_0$ parameters, as
well as several issues connected to the errors propagation, with use of synthetic data. After that,
we test the method with real Union2.1 and JLA, as well as recent PANTHEON SNe Ia datasets. It worths
mentioning that in our approach we assume no {\it Ans\"atzen} on the dynamical variables (e.g.,
$H(z)$), which makes our method free of any degeneracies and biases which arise if one assume one
or another way to parameterize $H(z)$, or the equation of state, or some other variable. On the other
hand, the price we pay for this freedom is immense -- although the scheme demonstrates perfect reconstruction
in the case of synthetic data, the reconstruction from the real data seems almost impossible, at
least on the current data precision level. The errors of the resulting potential and of the kinetic
term are huge; for the Hubble parameter they are smaller but still severalfold larger than those
obtained with parameterization. Finally, we test the method with non-SNe $H(z)$ datasets, and
the results are also disappointing -- similar to the SNe case, the reconstruction is not possible
as the reconstructed kinetic term enters the negative values. This could be treated as a manifestation
of the insufficient data precision, or as the overestimation of $(H_0, \Omega_m)$ values -- we discuss
both possibilities.
