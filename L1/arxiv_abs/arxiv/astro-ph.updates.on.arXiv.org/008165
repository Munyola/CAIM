Although several S-type and P-type planets in binary systems were discovered in past years, S-type
planets have not yet been found in close binaries with an orbital separation not more than 5 au. Recent
studies suggest that S-type planets in close binaries may be detected through high-accuracy observations.
However, nowadays planet formation theories imply that it is difficult for S-type planets in close
binaries systems to form in situ. In this work, we extensively perform numerical simulations to
explore scenarios of planet-planet scattering among circumbinary planets and subsequent tidal
capture in various binary configurations, to examine whether the mechanism can play a part in producing
such kind of planets. Our results show that this mechanism is robust. The maximum capture probability
is $\sim 10\%$, which can be comparable to the tidal capture probability of hot Jupiters in single
star systems. The capture probability is related to binary configurations, where a smaller eccentricity
or a low mass ratio of the binary will lead to a larger probability of capture, and vice versa. Furthermore,
we find that S-type planets with retrograde orbits can be naturally produced via capture process.
These planets on retrograde orbits can help us distinguish in situ formation and post-capture origin
for S-type planet in close binaries systems. The forthcoming missions (PLATO) will provide the
opportunity and feasibility to detect such planets. Our work provides several suggestions for
selecting target binaries in search for S-type planets in the near future.
