Luminosity of X-ray spectral state transitions in black hole and neutron star X-ray binaries can
put constraint on the critical mass accretion rate between accretion regimes. Previous studies
indicate that the hard-to-soft spectral state transitions in some ultracompact neutron star LMXBs
have the lowest luminosity. With X-ray monitoring observations in the past decade, we were able
to identify state transitions towards the lowest luminosity limit in 4U 0614+091, 2S 0918-549 and
4U 1246-588. By analysing corresponding X-ray pointed observations with the Swift/XRT and the
RXTE/PCA, we found no hysteresis of state transitions in these sources, and determined the critical
mass accretion rate in the range of 0.002 - 0.04 $\dot{\rm M}_{\rm Edd}$ and 0.003 - 0.05 $\dot{\rm
M}_{\rm Edd}$ for the hard-to-soft and the soft-to-hard transition, respectively, by assuming
a neutron star mass of 1.4 solar masses. This range is comparable to the lowest transition luminosity
measured in black hole X-ray binaries, indicating the critical mass accretion rate is not affected
by the nature of the surface of the compact stars. Our result does not support the Advection-Dominated
Accretion Flow (ADAF) model which predicts that the critical mass accretion rate in neutron star
systems is an order of magnitude lower if same viscosity parameters are taken. The low transition
luminosity and insignificant hysteresis in these ultracompact X-ray binaries provide further
evidence that the transition luminosity is likely related to the mass in the disc.
