We examine the origin of radial and vertical gradients in the age/metallicity of the stellar component
of a galaxy disc formed in the APOSTLE cosmological hydrody- namical simulations. Some of these
gradients resemble those in the Milky Way, where they have sometimes been interpreted as due to internal
evolution, such as scattering off giant molecular clouds, radial migration driven by spiral patterns,
or orbital reso- nances with a bar. Secular processes play a minor role in the simulated galaxy, which
lacks strong spiral or bar patterns, and where such gradients arise as a result of the gradual enrichment
of a gaseous disc that is born thick but thins as it turns into stars and settles into centrifugal equilibrium.
The settling is controlled by the feedback of young stars; which links the star formation, enrichment,
and equilibration timescales, inducing radial and vertical gradients in the gaseous disc and its
descendent stars. The kinematics of coeval stars evolve little after birth and provide a faithful
snapshot of the gaseous disc structure at the time of their formation. In this interpretation, the
age-velocity dispersion relation would reflect the gradual thinning of the disc rather than the
importance of secular orbit scattering; the outward flaring of stars would result from the gas disc
flare rather than from radial migration; and vertical gradients would arise because the gas disc
gradually thinned as it enriched. Such radial and vertical trends might just reflect the evolving
properties of the parent gaseous disc, and are not necessarily the result of secular evolutionary
processes.
