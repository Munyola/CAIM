This paper reports the discovery of spatially-extended line-emitting nebula, reaching to ~100
physical kpc (pkpc) from a damped Ly{\alpha} absorber (DLA) at z_DLA=0.313 along the sightline
toward QSO PKS1127-145 (z_QSO=1.188). This DLA was known to be associated with a galaxy group of
dynamical mass M_group ~3e12 M_sun, but its physical origin remained ambiguous. New wide-field
integral field observations revealed a giant nebula detected in [OII], H{\beta}, [OIII], H{\alpha},
and [NII] emission, with the line-emitting gas following closely the motions of group galaxies.
One of the denser streams passes directly in front of the QSO with kinematics consistent with the
absorption profiles recorded in the QSO echelle spectra. The emission morphology, kinematics,
and line ratios of the nebula suggest that shocks and turbulent mixing layers, produced as a result
of stripped gaseous streams moving at supersonic speed across the ambient hot medium, contribute
significantly to the ionization of the gas. While the DLA may not be associated with any specific
detected member of the group, both the kinematic and dust properties are consistent with the DLA
originating in streams of gas stripped from sub-L* group members at <~25 pkpc from the QSO sightline.
This study demonstrates that gas stripping in low-mass galaxy groups is effective in releasing
metal-enriched gas from star-forming regions, producing absorption systems in QSO spectra, and
that combining absorption and emission-line observations provides an exciting new opportunity
for studying gas and galaxy co-evolution.
