During these last decades, our knowledge of evolutionary and structural properties of stars of
different mass and chemical composition is significantly improved. This result has been achieved
as a consequence of our improved capability in understanding and describing the physical behavior
of matter in the different thermal regimes characteristic of the various stellar mass ranges and
evolutionary stages. This notwithstanding, current generation of stellar models is still affected
by significant and, usually, not negligible uncertainties. These uncertainties are related to
our poor knowledge of some physical proceses occurring in the real stars such as, for instance, some
thermodynamical processes, nuclear reaction rates, as well as the efficiency of mixing processes.
These drawbacks of stellar models have to be properly taken into account when comparing theory with
observations in order to derive relevant information about the properties of both resolved and
unresolved stellar populations. On the other hand, observations of both field and cluster stars
can provide fundamental benchmarks for constraining the reliability and accuracy of the theoretical
framework. In the following we review some important evolutionary and structural properties of
very-low and low-mass stars, as well as the most important uncertainties affecting the stellar
models for such stars. We show what are the main sources of uncertainty along the main evolutionary
stages, and discuss the present level of agreement between theory and observations.
