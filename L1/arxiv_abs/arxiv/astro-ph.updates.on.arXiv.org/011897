We study the cosmological build-up of pseudobulges using the LGalaxies semi-analytical model
for galaxy formation with a new approach for following separately the assembly of classical bulges
and pseudobulges. Classical bulges are assumed to be the result of violent processes (i.e., mergers
and starbursts), while the formation of pseudobulges is connected to the secular growth of disks.
We apply the model to both the Millennium and the Millennium II simulations, in order to study our
results across a wide range of stellar masses ($10^{7} - 10^{11.5} M_{\odot}$). We find that $z=0$
pseudobulges mainly reside in galaxies of $ \rm M_{stellar} \sim 10^{10} - 10^{10.5} M_{\odot}$
($\rm M_{halo} \sim 10^{11.5}-10^{12} M_{\odot}$) and we recover structural properties of these
objects (e.g., sizes and bulge-to-total ratios) that are in good agreement with observational
results. Tracing their formation history, we find that pseudobulges assembled in galaxies with
a very quiet merger history, as opposed to the host galaxies of classical bulges. Regarding the bulge
structure, we find that $\sim$ 30\% of the galaxies with a predominant pseudobulge feature a composite
structure, hosting both a pseudo and a classical bulge component. The classical component typically
constitutes $\sim$10\% of the total bulge galaxy mass. When looking at the properties of the host
galaxies, we find that $z = 0$ pseudobulges are hosted by main sequence galaxies, characterized
by a stellar population which is generally younger compared to the one of the hosts of classical bulges.
