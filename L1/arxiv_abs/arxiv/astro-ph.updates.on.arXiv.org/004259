This work illustrates how formation of energy preserving shocks for polytropic accretion and temperature
preserving shocks for isothermal accretion are influenced by various geometrical configurations
of general relativistic, axisymmetric, low angular momentum flow in Kerr metric. Relevant pre-
and post-shock states, both dynamical and thermodynamic, have been studied comprehensively.
This work elaborates how such states depend on different flow structures. Back-reaction on the
metric itself due to self gravity has not been considered in the present context. An elegant eigenvalue
based analytical method has been introduced to provide qualitative descriptions of the phase orbits
corresponding to transonic accretion solutions, without the requirement of incorporating any
involved numerical recipe. An effort has been made to understand how the weakly rotating flow behaves
at close proximity of the event horizon and how such quasi-terminal quantities are influenced by
the black hole spin for different matter geometries. Our main purpose is thus to mathematically
demonstrate that for non-self gravitating accretion, separate matter geometries, in addition
to the corresponding space-time geometry, control various shock induced phenomena observed within
black hole accretion discs. This work is expected to reveal how such phenomena observed near the
horizon depend on the physical environment of the source nursing a supermassive black hole at its
centre. It is also expected to unfold correspondences between the dependence of accretion related
parameters on flow geometries and that on black hole spin.
