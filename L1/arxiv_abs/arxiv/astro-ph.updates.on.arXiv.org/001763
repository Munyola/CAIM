The ultra-long Gamma Ray Burst 111209A, which occurred at a redshift of $z = 0.677$, is the longest
duration burst ever observed due to a rest frame prompt emission duration of order of $10^{4}$ s.
The very early X-ray afterglow of Gamma Ray Burst 111209A showed unusual behavior, with a significant
bump observed at about 2000 s after the BAT trigger. One possible explanation is that the bump resulted
from mass fall back. In this paper, we present a detailed numerical study of the fall back process
to interpret the very early X-ray afterglow light curve of Gamma Ray Burst 111209A. For the afterglow
at late times, we apply external shock by adding an energy injection. In our model, we assume two periods
of energy injection, each with a constant injection power. One injection starts at $8.0\times10^{3}$
s and lasts for about 8000 s, with an injection power of $9.0\times10^{47}$ ${\rm erg}$ ${\rm s^{-1}}$;
this energy injection accounts for the plateau at X-ray wavelength in the early stage. The other
injection starts at $6.5\times10^{4}$ s and lasts for about 16 ks with an injection power of $6.0\times10^{46}$
${\rm erg}$ ${\rm s^{-1}}$. This second energy injection can help to explain the other plateau at
X-ray wavelengths and the rebrightening in the optical band at about $10^{5}$ s. We argue that the
two periods of energy injection can be produced by the infall of clumpy mass onto the central compact
object of the burster, which leads to an enhancement of the accretion rate and results in a strong
temporary outflow.
