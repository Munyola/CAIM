We introduce the first result of the Clusters Hiding in Plain Sight (CHiPS) survey, which aims to
discover new, nearby, and massive galaxy clusters that were incorrectly identified as isolated
point sources in the ROSAT All-Sky Survey. We present a Chandra X-ray observation of our first newly
discovered low-redshift (z = 0.223) galaxy cluster with a central X-ray bright point source, PKS1353-341.
After removing the point source contribution to the cluster core, we determine various properties
of the cluster. The presence of a relaxed X-ray morphology, a central temperature drop, and a central
cooling time around 400 Myr points to it being a strong cool-core cluster. The central galaxy appears
to be forming stars at the rate of 6.2+/-3.6 Msun/yr, corresponding to ~1% of the classical cooling
prediction. The supermassive black hole in the central galaxy appear to be accreting at ~0.1% of
the Eddington rate with the total power output of ~5x10^45 erg/s, split nearly equally between radiative
and mechanical power. Comparing the cluster's bulk properties with those of other known clusters
(e.g., M_500 = 6.9(+4.3)(-2.6)x10^14 Msun, and L_X = 7x10^44 erg/s), we show that this cluster is
sufficiently luminous that it would have been identified as a cluster in the ROSAT All Sky-Survey
data, if it did not have such a bright central point source. This discovery demonstrates the potential
of the CHiPS survey to find massive nearby clusters with extreme central properties that may have
been missed or misidentified by previous surveys.
