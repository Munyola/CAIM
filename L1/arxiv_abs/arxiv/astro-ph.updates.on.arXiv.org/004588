We develop a classification scheme for the evolutionary state of planets based on the non-equilibrium
thermodynamics of their coupled systems, including the presence of a biosphere and the possibility
of what we call an agency-dominated biosphere (i.e. an energy-intensive technological species).
The premise is that Earths entry into the Anthropocene represents what might be from an astrobiological
perspective a predictable planetary transition. We explore this problem from the perspective
of the solar system and exoplanet studies. Our classification discriminates planets by the forms
of free energy generation driven from stellar forcing. We then explore how timescales for global
evolutionary processes on Earth might be synchronized with ecological transformations driven
by increases in energy harvesting and its consequences (which might have reached a turning point
with global urbanization). Finally, we describe quantitatively the classification scheme based
on the maintenance of chemical disequilibrium in the past and current Earth systems and on other
worlds in the solar system. In this perspective, the beginning of the Anthropocene can be seen as
the onset of the hybridization of the planet - a transitional stage from one class of planetary systems
interaction to another. For Earth, this stage occurs as the effects of human civilization yield
not just new evolutionary pressures, but new selected directions for novel planetary ecosystem
functions and their capacity to generate disequilibrium and enhance planetary dissipation.
