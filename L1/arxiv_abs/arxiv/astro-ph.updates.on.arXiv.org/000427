The coalescence of compact objects are a promising astrophysical sources of gravitational wave
(GW) signals. The ejection of r-process material from such mergers may lead to a radioactively-powered
electromagnetic counterpart which, if discovered, would enhance the science return of a GW detection.
As very little is known about the optical properties of heavy r-process elements, previous light
curve models have adopted opacities similar to those of iron group elements. Here we report that
the presence of heavier elements, particularly the lanthanides, increase the ejecta opacity by
several orders of magnitude. We include these higher opacities in time dependent, multi-wavelength
radiative transport calculations to predict the broadband light curves of one-dimensional models
over a range of parameters (ejecta masses from 0.001 to 0.1 solar masses and velocities from 0.1 to
0.3c). We find that the higher opacities lead to much longer duration light curves which can last
a week or more. The emission is shifted toward the infrared bands due to strong optical line blanketing,
and the colors at later times are representative of a blackbody near the recombination temperature
of the lanthanides (T ~ 2500K). We further consider the case in which a second mass outflow, composed
of 56Ni, is ejected from a disk wind, and show that the net result is a distinctive two component spectral
energy distribution, with a bright optical peak due to 56Ni and an infrared peak due to r-process
ejecta. We briefly consider the prospects for detection and identification of these transients.
