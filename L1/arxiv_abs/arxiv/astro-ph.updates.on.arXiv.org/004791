On April 18, 2014 (SOL2014-04-18T13:03) an M-class flare was observed by IRIS. The associated flare
ribbon contained a quasi-periodic sawtooth pattern that was observed to propagate along the ribbon,
perpendicular to the IRIS spectral slit, with a phase velocity of $\sim 15$ km s$^{-1}$. This motion
resulted in periodicities in both intensity and Doppler velocity along the slit. These periodicities
were reported to be approximately $\pm0.5$ arcseconds in position and $\pm20$ km s$^{-1}$ in velocity
and were measured to be $\sim180^{\circ}$ out of phase with one another. This quasi-periodic behavior
has been attributed by others to bursty or patchy reconnection and slipping occurring during three-dimensional
magnetic reconnection. While able to account for periodicities in both intensity and Doppler velocity
these suggestions do not explicitly account for the phase velocity of the entire sawtooth structure,
or for the relative phasing of the oscillations. Here we propose that the observations can be explained
by a tearing mode instability occurring at a current sheet across which there is also a velocity shear.
Using a linear model of this instability we reproduce the relative phase of the oscillations, as
well as the phase velocity of the sawtooth structure. We suggest a geometry and local plasma parameters
for the April 18 flare which would support our hypothesis. Under this proposal the combined spectral
and spatial IRIS observations of this flare may provide the most compelling evidence to date of a
tearing mode occurring in the solar magnetic field.
