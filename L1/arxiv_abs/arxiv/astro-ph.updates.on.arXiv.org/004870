We have performed a high sensitivity observation of the UFO/BAL quasar APM 08279+5255 at z=3.912
with NOEMA at 3.2 mm, aimed at detecting fast moving molecular gas. We report the detection of blueshifted
CO(4-3) with maximum velocity (v95\%) of $-1340$ km s$^{-1}$, with respect to the systemic peak
emission, and a luminosity of $L' = 9.9\times 10^9 ~\mu^{-1}$ K km s$^{-1}$ pc$^{-2}$ (where $\mu$
is the lensing magnification factor). We discuss various scenarios for the nature of this emission,
and conclude that this is the first detection of fast molecular gas at redshift $>3$. We derive a mass
flow rate of molecular gas in the range $\rm \dot M=3-7.4\times 10^3$ M$_\odot$/yr, and momentum
boost $\dot P_{OF} / \dot P_{AGN} \sim 2-6$, therefore consistent with a momentum conserving flow.
For the largest $\dot P_{OF}$ the scaling is also consistent with a energy conserving flow with an
efficiency of $\sim$10-20\%. The present data can hardly discriminate between the two expansion
modes. The mass loading factor of the molecular outflow $\eta=\dot M_{OF}/SFR$ is $>>1$. We also
detect a molecular emission line at a frequency of 94.83 GHz, corresponding to a rest frame frequency
of 465.8 GHz, which we tentatively identified with the cation molecule $\rm N_2H^+$(5-4), which
would be the first detection of this species at high redshift. We discuss the alternative possibility
that this emission is due to a CO emission line from the, so far undetected, lens galaxy. Further observations
of additional transitions of the same species with NOEMA can discriminate between the two scenarios.
