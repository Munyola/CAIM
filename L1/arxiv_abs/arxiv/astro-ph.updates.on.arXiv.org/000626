Super star clusters are the end product of star formation under the most extreme conditions. As such,
studying how their final stellar populations are assembled from their natal progenitor gas clouds
can provide strong constraints on star formation theories. An obvious place to look for the initial
conditions of such extreme stellar clusters are gas clouds of comparable mass and density, with
no star formation activity. We present a method to identify such progenitor gas clouds and demonstrate
the technique for the gas in the inner few hundred pc of our Galaxy. The method highlights three clouds
in the region with similar global physical properties to the previously identified extreme cloud,
G0.253+0.016, as potential young massive cluster (YMC) precursors. The fact that four potential
YMC progenitor clouds have been identified in the inner 100 pc of the Galaxy, but no clouds with similar
properties have been found in the whole first quadrant despite extensive observational efforts,
has implications for cluster formation/destruction rates across the Galaxy. We put forward a scenario
to explain how such dense gas clouds can arise in the Galactic centre environment, in which YMC formation
is triggered by gas streams passing close to the minimum of the global Galactic gravitational potential
at the location of the central supermassive black hole, Sgr A*. If this triggering mechanism can
be verified, we can use the known time interval since closest approach to Sgr A* to study the physics
of stellar mass assembly in an extreme environment as a function of absolute time.
