Although the new era of high precision cosmology of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation
improves our knowledge to understand the infant as well as the presentday Universe, it also leads
us to question the main assumption of the exact isotropy of the CMB. There are two pieces of observational
evidence demonstrating that there is no exact isotropy. These are first the existence of small anisotropy
deviations from isotropy of the CMB radiation and second, the presence of large angle anomalies
that are shown as real features by the Planck satellite results. These evidences are particularly
important since isotropy is one of the two main postulates of the Copernican principle on which the
FRW models are built. This almost isotropic CMB radiation implies that the universe is almost a FRW
universe, as is proved by previous studies. Assuming the matter component forms the deviations
from isotropy in the CMB density fluctuations when matter and radiation decouples, we here attempt
to find possible constraints on these deviations by using the Bianchi type I (BI) anisotropic model
which is asymptotically equivalent to the standard FRW. Then we obtain the separations from the
FRW type scale factor and the Hubble parameter in the form of time dependent functions. Hence we put
constraints on the anisotropy coefficients from the anisotropy upper limits of the recent Planck
data and from the theoretical consistency relation. These constraints lead us to obtain a BI model
which becomes to be an almost FRW in time that is consistent with observational data of the CMB.
