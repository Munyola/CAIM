Rotation and magnetism are increasingly recognized as important phenomena in stellar evolution.
Surface magnetic fields from a few to $20{,}000\,$G have been observed and models have suggested
that magnetohydrodynamic transport of angular momentum and chemical composition could explain
the peculiar composition of some stars. Stellar remnants such as white dwarfs have been observed
with fields from a few to more than $10^{9}\,$G. We investigate the origin of and the evolution, on
thermal and nuclear rather than dynamical time-scales, of an averaged large-scale magnetic field
throughout a star's life and its coupling to stellar rotation. Large-scale magnetic fields sustained
until late stages of stellar evolution with conservation of magnetic flux could explain the very
high fields observed in white dwarfs. We include these effects in the Cambridge stellar evolution
code using three time-dependant advection-diffusion equations coupled to the structural and
composition equations of stars to model the evolution of angular momentum and the two components
of the magnetic field. We present the evolution in various cases for a $3\rm\,M_{\odot}$ star from
the beginning to the late stages of its life. Our particular model assumes that turbulent motions,
including convection, favour small-scale field at the expense of large-scale field. As a result
the large-scale field concentrates in radiative zones of the star and so is exchanged between the
core and the envelope of the star as it evolves. The field is sustained until the end of the asymptotic
giant branch, when it concentrates in the degenerate core.
