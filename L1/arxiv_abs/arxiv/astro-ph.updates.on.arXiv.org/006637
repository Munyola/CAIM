Recent studies of interstellar neutral (ISN) hydrogen observed by the Interstellar Boundary Explorer
(IBEX) suggested that the present understanding of the radiation pressure acting on hydrogen atoms
in the heliosphere should be revised. There is a significant discrepancy between theoretical predictions
of the ISN H signal using the currently used model of the solar Lyman-alpha profile by Tarnopolski
et al. 2009 (TB09) and the signal due to ISN H observed by IBEX-Lo. We developed a new model of evolution
of the solar Lyman-alpha profile that takes into account all available observations of the full-disk
solar Lyman-alpha profiles from SUMER/SOHO, provided by Lemaire et al. 2015 (L15), covering practically
the entire 23rd solar cycle. The model has three components that reproduce different features of
the profile. The main shape of the emission line that is produced in the chromosphere is modeled by
the kappa function; the central reversal due to absorption in the transition region is modeled by
the Gauss function; the spectral background is represented by the linear function. The coefficients
of all those components are linear functions of the line-integrated full-disk Lyman-alpha irradiance,
which is the only free parameter of the model. The new model features potentially important differences
in comparison with the model by TB09, which was based on a limited set of observations. This change
in the understanding of radiation pressure, especially during low solar activity, may significantly
affect the interstellar H and D distributions in the inner heliosphere and their derivative populations.
