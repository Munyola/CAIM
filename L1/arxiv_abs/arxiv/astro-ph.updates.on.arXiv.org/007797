We present a composite model and radiative transfer simulations of the massive star forming core
W33A MM1. The model was tailored to reproduce the complex features observed with ALMA at $\approx
0.2$ arcsec resolution in CH$_3$CN and dust emission. The MM1 core is fragmented into six compact
sources coexisting within $\sim 1000$ au. In our models, three of these compact sources are better
represented as disc-envelope systems around a central (proto)star, two as envelopes with a central
object, and one as a pure envelope. The model of the most prominent object (Main) contains the most
massive (proto)star ($M_\star\approx7~M_\odot$) and disc+envelope ($M_\mathrm{gas}\approx0.4~M_\odot$),
and is the most luminous ($L_\mathrm{Main} \sim 10^4~L_\odot$). The model discs are small (a few
hundred au) for all sources. The composite model shows that the elongated spiral-like feature converging
to the MM1 core can be convincingly interpreted as a filamentary accretion flow that feeds the rising
stellar system. The kinematics of this filament is reproduced by a parabolic trajectory with focus
at the center of mass of the region. Radial collapse and fragmentation within this filament, as well
as smaller filamentary flows between pairs of sources are proposed to exist. Our modelling supports
an interpretation where what was once considered as a single massive star with a $\sim 10^3$ au disc
and envelope, is instead a forming stellar association which appears to be virialized and to form
several low-mass stars per high-mass object.
