Gravitational waves and electromagnetic radiations from a neutron star merger were discovered
on 17 August 2017. Multiband observations of the optical transient have identified brightness
and spectrum features broadly consistent with theoretical predictions. According to the theoretical
model, the optical radiation from a neutron star merger originates from the radioactive decay of
unstable nuclides freshly synthesized in the merger ejecta. In about a day the ejecta transits from
an optically thick state to an optically thin state due to its subrelativistic expansion. Hence,
we expect that about a day after the merger, the gamma-ray photons produced by radioactive decays
start to escape from the ejecta and make it bright in the MeV band. In this paper, we study the features
of the radioactive gamma-ray emission from a neutron star merger, including the brightness and
the spectrum, and discuss the observability of the gamma-ray emission. We find that more than $95\%$
of the radiated gamma-ray energy is carried by photons of $0.2$-$4$ MeV, with a spectrum shaped by
the nucleosynthesis process and the subrelativistic expansion of the ejecta. Under favorable
conditions, a prominent pair annihilation line can be present in the gamma-ray spectrum with the
energy flux about $3$-$5\%$ of the total. For a merger event similar to GW170817, the gamma-ray emission
attains a peak luminosity $\approx 2\times 10^{41}$erg s$^{-1}$ at $\approx 1.2$ day after the
merger, and fades by a factor of two in about two days. Such a source will be detectable by Satellite-ETCC
if it occurs at a distance $\leq 12$ Mpc.
