The predominantly ancient stellar populations observed in the lowest-mass galaxies (i.e. ultra-faint
dwarfs) suggest that their star formation was suppressed by reionization. Most of the well-studied
ultra-faint dwarfs, however, are within the central half of the Milky Way dark matter halo, such
that they are consistent with a population that was accreted at early times and thus potentially
quenched via environmental processes. To study the potential role of environment in suppressing
star formation on the smallest scales, we utilize the Exploring the Local Volume in Simulations
(ELVIS) suite of $N$-body simulations to constrain the distribution of infall times for low-mass
subhalos likely to host the ultra-faint population. For the ultra-faint satellites of the Milky
Way with star-formation histories inferred from $Hubble~Space~Telescope$ imaging, we find that
environment is highly unlikely to play a dominant role in quenching their star formation. Even when
including the potential effects of pre-processing, there is a $\lesssim 0.1\%$ probability that
environmental processes quenched all of the known ultra-faint dwarfs early enough to explain their
observed star-formation histories. Instead, we argue for a mass floor in the effectiveness of satellite
quenching at roughly $M_{\star} \sim 10^{5}~M_{\odot}$, below which star formation in surviving
galaxies is globally suppressed by reionization. We predict a large population of quenched ultra-faint
dwarfs in the Local Field ($1 < R/R_{\rm{vir}} < 2$), with as many as $\sim250$ to be discovered by
future wide-field imaging surveys.
