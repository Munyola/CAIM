Stellar streams originating in disrupted dwarf galaxies and star clusters are observed around
the Milky Way and nearby galaxies. Such substructures are the important tracers that record how
the host haloes have accreted progenitor galaxies. Based on the cosmological context, we investigate
the relationship between structural properties of substructures such as length and thinness at
$z=0$, and orbits of their progenitors. We model stellar components of a large sample of substructures
around Milky Way-sized haloes by combining semi-analytic models with a high-resolution cosmological
$N$-body simulation. Using the Particle Tagging method, we embed stellar components in progenitor
haloes and trace phase-space distributions of the substructures down to $z=0$. We find that the
length and thinness of substructures vary smoothly as the redshift when the host haloes accrete
their progenitors. For substructures observed like streams at $z=0$, a large part of the progenitors
is accreted by their host haloes at redshift $0.5\lesssim z\lesssim 2.5$. Substructures with progenitors
out of this accretion redshift range are entirely or less disrupted by $z=0$ and cannot be observed
as streams. We also find that the distributions of length and thinness of substructures vary smoothly
as pericenter and apocenter of the progenitors. Substructures observed like streams tend to have
the specific range of $10\ {\rm kpc} \lesssim r_{\rm peri}\lesssim100\ {\rm kpc}$ and $50\ {\rm
kpc} \lesssim r_{\rm apo}\lesssim300\ {\rm kpc}$.
