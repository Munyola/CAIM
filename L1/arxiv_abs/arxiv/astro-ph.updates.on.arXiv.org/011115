We present a study of 16 HI-detected galaxies found in 178 hours of observations from Epoch 1 of the
COSMOS HI Large Extragalactic Survey (CHILES). We focus on two redshift ranges between 0.108 <=
z <= 0.127 and 0.162 <= z <= 0.183 which are among the worst affected by radio frequency interference
(RFI). While this represents only 10% of the total frequency coverage and 18% of the total expected
time on source compared to what will be the full CHILES survey, we demonstrate that our data reduction
pipeline recovers high quality data even in regions severely impacted by RFI. We report on our in-depth
testing of an automated spectral line source finder to produce HI total intensity maps which we present
side-by-side with significance maps to evaluate the reliability of the morphology recovered by
the source finder. We recommend that this become a common place manner of presenting data from upcoming
HI surveys of resolved objects. We use the COSMOS 20k group catalogue, and we extract filamentary
structure using the topological DisPerSE algorithm to evaluate the \hi\ morphology in the context
of both local and large-scale environments and we discuss the shortcomings of both methods. Many
of the detections show disturbed HI morphologies suggesting they have undergone a recent interaction
which is not evident from deep optical imaging alone. Overall, the sample showcases the broad range
of ways in which galaxies interact with their environment. This is a first look at the population
of galaxies and their local and large-scale environments observed in HI by CHILES at redshifts beyond
the z=0.1 Universe.
