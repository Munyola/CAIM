We recently proposed a method to calculate the relative magnetic helicity in a finite volume for
a given magnetic field which however required the flux to be balanced separately on all the sides
of the considered volume. In order to allow finite magnetic fluxes through the boundaries, a Coulomb
gauge is constructed that allows for global magnetic flux balance. We tested and verified our method
in a theoretical fore-free magnetic field model. We apply the new method to the former calculation
data and found a difference of less than 1.2\%. We also applied our method to the magnetic field above
active region NOAA 11429 obtained by a new photospheric-data-driven MHD model code GOEMHD3. We
analyzed the magnetic helicity evolution in the solar corona using our new method. It was found that
the normalized magnetic helicityis equal to -0.038 when fast magnetic reconnection is triggered.
This value is comparable to the previous value (-0.029) in the MHD simulations when magnetic reconnection
happened and the observed normalized magnetic helicity (-0.036) from the eruption of newly emerging
active regions. We found that only 8\% of the accumulated magnetic helicity is dissipated after
it is injected through the bottom boundary. This is in accordance with the Woltjer conjecture. Only
2\% of magnetic helicity injected from the bottom boundary escapes through the corona. This is consistent
with the observation of magnetic clouds, which could take away magnetic helicity into the interplanetary
space, in the case considered here, several halo CMEs and two X-class solar flares origin from this
active region.
