When combining cosmological and oscillations results to constrain the neutrino sector, the question
of the propagation of systematic uncertainties is often raised. We address this issue in the context
of the derivation of an upper bound on the sum of the neutrino masses ($\Sigma m_\nu$) with recent
cosmological data. This work is performed within the ${{\mathrm{\Lambda{CDM}}}}$ model extended
to $\Sigma m_\nu$, for which we advocate the use of three mass-degenerate neutrinos. We focus on
the study of systematic uncertainties linked to the foregrounds modelling in CMB data analysis,
and on the impact of the present knowledge of the reionisation optical depth. This is done through
the use of different likelihoods built from Planck data. Limits on $\Sigma m_\nu$ are derived with
various combinations of data, including the latest Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) and Type
Ia Supernovae (SN) results. We also discuss the impact of the preference for current CMB data for
amplitudes of the gravitational lensing distortions higher than expected within the ${{\mathrm{\Lambda{CDM}}}}$
model, and add the Planck CMB lensing. We then derive a robust upper limit: $\Sigma m_\nu< 0.17\hbox{
eV at }95\% \hbox{CL}$, including 0.01 eV of foreground systematics. We also discuss the neutrino
mass repartition and show that today's data do not allow one to disentangle normal from inverted
hierarchy. The impact on the other cosmological parameters is also reported, for different assumptions
on the neutrino mass repartition, and different high and low multipole CMB likelihoods.
