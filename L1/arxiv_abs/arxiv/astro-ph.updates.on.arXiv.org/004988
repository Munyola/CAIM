Using few-body simulations, we investigate the evolution of supermassive black holes (SMBHs)
in galaxies ($M_{\star}=10^{10}-10^{12}{\rm M}_{\odot}$ at $z=0$) at $0<z<4$. Following galaxy
merger trees from the Millennium simulation, we model BH mergers with two extreme binary decay scenarios
for the `hard binary' stage: a full or an empty loss cone. These two models should bracket the true
evolution, and allow us to separately explore the role of dynamical friction and that of multi-body
BH interactions on BH mergers. Using the computed merger rates, we infer the stochastic gravitational
wave background (GWB). Our dynamical approach is a first attempt to study the dynamical evolution
of multiple SMBHs in the host galaxies undergoing mergers with various mass ratios ($10^{-4} < q_{\star}
< 1$). Our main result demonstrates that SMBH binaries are able to merge in both scenarios. In the
empty loss cone case, we find that BHs merge via multi-body interactions, avoiding the `final parsec'
problem, and entering the PTA band with substantial orbital eccentricity. Our full loss cone treatment,
albeit more approximate, suggests that the eccentricity becomes even higher when GWs become dominant,
leading to rapid coalescences (binary lifetime $\lesssim1 {\rm ~Gyr}$). Despite the lower merger
rates in the empty loss cone case, due to their higher mass ratios and lower redshifts, the GWB in the
full/empty loss cone models are comparable ($0.70\times10^{-15}$ and $0.53\times10^{-15}$
at a frequency of $1~{\rm yr}^{-1}$, respectively). Finally, we compute the effects of high eccentricities
on the GWB spectrum.
