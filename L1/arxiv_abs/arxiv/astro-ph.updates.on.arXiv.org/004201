A high fraction of carbon bound in solid carbonaceous material is observed to exist in bodies formed
in the cold outskirts of the solar nebula, while bodies in the terrestrial planets region contain
nearly none. We study the fate of the carbonaceous material during the spiral-in of matter as the
sun accretes matter from the solar nebula. From observational data on the composition of the dust
component in comets and interplanetary dust particles, and from data on pyrolysis experiments,
we construct a model for the composition of the pristine carbonaceous material in the outer parts
of the solar nebula. We study the pyrolysis of the refractory and volatile organic component and
the concomitant release of high-molecular-weight hydrocarbons under quiescent conditions of
disk evolution where matter migrates inwards. We also study the decomposition and oxidation of
the carbonaceous material during violent flash heating events, which are thought to be responsible
for the formation of chondrules. It is found that the complex hydrocarbon components are removed
from the solid disk matter at temperatures between 250 and 400 K, while the amorphous carbon component
survives up to 1200 K. Without efficient carbon destruction during flash-heating associated with
chondrule formation the carbon abundance of terrestrial planets, except for Mercury, would be
not as low as it is found in cosmochemical studies. Chondrule formation seems to be a process that
is crucial for the carbon-poor composition of the material of terrestrial planets.
