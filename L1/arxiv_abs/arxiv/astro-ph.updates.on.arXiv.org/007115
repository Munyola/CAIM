HI intensity mapping data traces the large-scale structure matter distribution using the integrated
emission of neutral hydrogen gas (HI). The cross-correlation of the intensity maps with optical
galaxy surveys can mitigate foreground and systematic effects, but has been shown to significantly
depend on galaxy evolution parameters of the HI and the optical sample. Previously, we have shown
that the shot noise of the cross-correlation scales with the HI content of the optical samples, such
that the shot noise estimation infers the average HI masses of these samples. In this article, we
present an adaptive framework for the cross-correlation of HI intensity maps with galaxy samples
using our implementation of the halo model formalism (Murray et al 2018, in prep) which utilises
the halo occupation distribution of galaxies to predict their power spectra. We compare two HI population
models, tracing the spatial halo and the galaxy distribution respectively, and present their auto-
and cross-power spectra with an associated galaxy sample. We find that the choice of the HI model
and the distribution of the HI within the galaxy sample have minor significance for the shape of the
auto- and cross-correlations, but highly impact the measured shot noise amplitude of the estimators,
a finding we confirm with simulations. We demonstrate parameter estimation of the HI halo occupation
models and advocate this framework for the interpretation of future experimental data, with the
prospect of determining the HI masses of optical galaxy samples via the cross-correlation shot
noise.
