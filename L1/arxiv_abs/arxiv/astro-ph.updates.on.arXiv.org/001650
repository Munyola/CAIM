Among many physical processes involved in star formation, radiation transfer is one of the key processes
since it dominantly controls the thermodynamics. Because metallicities control opacities, they
are one of the important environmental parameters which affect star formation processes. In this
work, I investigate protostellar collapse in solar-metallicity and low-metallicity ($Z = 0.1
Z_\odot$) environments using 3D radiation hydrodynamic and magnetohydrodynamic simulations.
Because radiation cooling is more effective in the low-metallicity environments, first cores
are colder and have lower entropies. As a result, first cores are smaller, less massive and have shorter
lifetimes in the low-metallicity clouds. Therefore, first cores would be less likely to be found
in low-metallicity star forming clouds. This also implies that first cores tend to be more gravitationally
unstable and susceptible to fragmentation. The evolution and structure of protostellar cores
formed after the second collapse weakly depend on metallicities in the spherical and magnetized
models despite the large difference in the metallicities. Because this is due to the change of the
heat capacity by dissociation and ionization of hydrogen, it is a general consequence of the second
collapse as long as the effects of radiation cooling are not very large during the second collapse.
On the other hand, the effects of different metallicities are more significant in the rotating models
without magnetic fields, because they evolve slower than other models and therefore more affected
by radiation cooling.
