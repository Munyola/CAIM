While powerful techniques exist to accurately account for anharmonicity in vibrational molecular
spectroscopy, they are computationally very expensive and cannot be routinely employed for large
species and/or at non- zero vibrational temperatures. Motivated by the study of Polycyclic Aromatic
Hydrocarbon (PAH) emission in space, we developed a new code, which takes into account all modes
and can describe all IR transitions including bands becoming active due to resonances as well as
overtones, combination and difference bands. In this article, we describe the methodology that
was implemented and discuss how the main difficulties were overcome, so as to keep the problem tractable.
Benchmarking with high-level calculations was performed on a small molecule. We carried out specific
convergence tests on two prototypical PAHs, pyrene (C$_{16}$H$_{10}$) and coronene (C$_{24}$H$_{12}$),
aiming at optimising tunable parameters to achieve both acceptable accuracy and computational
costs for this class of molecules. We then report the results obtained at 0 K for pyrene and coronene,
comparing the calculated spectra with available experimental data. The theoretical band positions
were found to be significantly improved compared to harmonic Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations.
The band intensities are in reasonable agreement with experiments, the main limitation being the
accuracy of the underlying calculations of the quartic force field. This is a first step towards
calculating moderately high-temperature spectra of PAHs and other similarly rigid molecules
using Monte Carlo sampling.
