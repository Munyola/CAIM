We present a catalog of Galactic star clusters, associations and candidates with 10978 entries.
This multi-band catalog was constructed over 20 years, starting with visual inspections on the
Digital Sky Survey and incremented with the 2MASS, WISE, VVV, Spitzer and Herschel surveys. Large
and small catalogs, as well as papers on individual objects have been systematically cross-identified.
The catalog provides Galactic and equatorial coordinates, angular diameters, and chronologically
ordered designations, making it simple to assign discoveries, and verify how often the objects
were cataloged by different authors, search methods and/or surveys. Detection in a single band
is the minimum constraint to validate an entry. About 3200 objects have measured parameters in the
literature. A fundamental contribution of the present study is to present additional $\approx7700$
objects for first analyses of nature, photometry, spectroscopy and structure. The present focus
is not to compile or determine fundamental parameters, but to provide a catalog characterizing
uniformly the entries. A major result is that now 4060 embedded clusters are catologed, a factor
of $\approx2$ larger than open clusters. Besides cross-identifications in different references
and wavelength domains, we also communicate the discovery of 638 star clusters and alike objects.
The present general catalog provides previously studied objects and thousands of additional entries
in a homogeneous way, a timely contribution to {\em Gaia} related works.
