The supernova remnant SN 1006 is a powerful source of high-energy particles and evolves in a relatively
tenuous and uniform environment, though interacting with an atomic cloud in its northwestern limb.
The X-ray image of SN 1006 reveals an indentation in the southwestern part of the shock front and the
HI maps show an isolated cloud (southwestern cloud) having the same velocity as the northwestern
cloud and whose morphology fits perfectly in the indentation. We performed spatially resolved
spectral analysis of a set of small regions in the southwestern nonthermal limb and studied the deep
X-ray spectra obtained within the XMM-Newton SN 1006 Large Program. We also analyzed archive HI
data, obtained combining single dish and interferometric observations. We found that the best-fit
value of the N_H derived from the X-ray spectra significantly increases in regions corresponding
to the southwestern cloud, while the cutoff energy of the synchrotron emission decreases. The amount
of the N_H variations corresponds perfectly with the HI column density of the southwestern cloud,
as measured from the radio data. The decrease in the cutoff energy at the indentation clearly reveals
that the back side of the cloud is actually interacting with the remnant. The southwestern limb therefore
presents a unique combination of efficient particle acceleration and high ambient density, thus
being the most promising region for gamma-ray hadronic emission in SN 1006. We estimate that such
emission will be detectable with the Fermi telescope within a few years.
