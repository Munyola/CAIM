We present low-frequency, GMRT observations at 240, 610 and 1300 MHz of IC~711, a narrow angle tail
(NAT) radio galaxy. The total angular extent of the radio emission, $\sim 22$ arcmin, corresponds
to a projected linear size of $\sim 900$ kpc, making it the longest among the known head-tail radio
galaxies. The objectives of the GMRT observations were to investigate the radio morphology, especially
of the long tail structure, at low frequencies. The radio structure, especially initial $\sim 10$
arcmin of tail being a long straight feature, does not seem to be consistent with a simple circular
motion around the cluster centre, as previously suggested in the literature. Two sharp bends after
the straight section of the tail cast doubt on the prevailing idea in the literature that the long
narrow tails represent trails left behind by the fast moving parent optical galaxy with respect
to the cluster medium, as the optical galaxy could not have undergone such sharp bends in its path,
under any conceivable gravitational influence of some individual galaxy or of the overall cluster
gravitational potential. In fact the tail does not seem to have been influenced by the gravitational
field of any of the cluster-member galaxies. The radio spectrum of the head, coinciding with the
optical galaxy, is flat ($\alpha \stackrel{<}{_{\sim}}0.4$ for $S \propto \nu ^{-\alpha}$),
but steadily steepens along the radio tail, with the end part of the tail showing the steepest spectrum
($\alpha \stackrel{>}{_{\sim}}5$) ever seen in any diffuse radio emission region.
