We have characterized the amount, spatial distribution and kinematics of the molecular gas in the
merging, double nucleus type 2 quasar SDSS J0025-10 at z=0.30 using the CO(1-0) transition, based
on data obtained with ATCA. This is one of the scarce examples of quasar host galaxies where the CO
emission has been resolved spatially at any redshift. We infer a molecular gas mass M(H2) = (6 +/-
1) x 1e9 Msun, which is distributed in two main reservoirs separated by ~9 kpc. ~60% of the gas is in
the central region, associated with the QSO nucleus and/or the intermediate region between the
two nuclei. The other 40% is associated with the northern tidal tail and is therefore unsettled.
With its high infrared luminosity L(IR) = (1.1 +/- 0.3) x 1e12 Lsun, SDSS J0025-10 is an analogue of
local luminous LIRGs and ULIRGs. On the other hand, the clear evidence for an ongoing major merger
of two gas rich progenitors, the high L(IR) dominated by a starburst, the massive reservoir of molecular
gas with a large fraction still unsettled, and the quasar activity are all properties consistent
with a transition phase in the (U)LIRG-optical QSO evolutionary scenario. We propose that we are
observing the system during a particular transient phase, prior to more advanced mergers where
the nuclei have already coalesced. We argue that a fraction of the molecular gas reservoir is associated
with a tidal dwarf galaxy identified in the optical HST image at the tip of the northern tidal tail.
The formation of such structures is predicted by simulations of colliding galaxies.
