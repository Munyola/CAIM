Recent studies have revealed a dynamic interplay between the galaxy ecosystem and the circumgalactic
medium (CGM). We investigate the CGM at high redshifts (z $\gtrsim$ 2) by using bright afterglows
of gamma-ray bursts (GRB) as background sources. We compiled a sample of medium-resolution ($\delta$v
$<$ 50 km/s) and high signal-to-noise (typical SNR $\sim$ 10) spectra from 27 GRB afterglows covering
z $\sim$ 2 - 6, with six of them at z $\gtrsim$ 4. We analyzed the high- and low-ionization absorption
features within $\pm$400 km/s to extract the CGM and ISM kinematics. In the stacked spectra, high-ionization
absorption profiles (e.g. C IV, Si IV) present significant absorption excess in their blue wings
(v $<$ -100 km/s) relative to the red wings (v $>$ 100 km/s). The stronger blue wings in high-ionization
species are indicative of the presence of ubiquitous warm outflows in the GRB hosts at high redshifts.
We used simple toy models to kinematically distinguish the CGM and ISM absorption and estimate the
CGM mass and outflow velocity. We find tentative evidence of the evolution of the CGM metal mass by
$\sim$ 0.5 dex between two redshift bins, each spanning 1 Gyr, z1: 2-2.7 and z2: 2.7-5. By comparing
with past studies, we find that over the course of evolution of present-day galaxies with $M_{*}
> 10^{10}M_{\odot}$, the ratio of C IV mass in the CGM to the stellar mass remains fairly uniform,
with $log(M_{CIV}/M_{*}) \sim -4.5$ within $\pm$0.5 dex from z $\sim$ 4 to z $\sim$ 0, suggesting
CGM-galaxy co-evolution.
