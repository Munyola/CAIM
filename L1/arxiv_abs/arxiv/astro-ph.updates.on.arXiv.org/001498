We present first results from RoboPol, a novel-design optical polarimeter operating at the Skinakas
Observatory in Crete. The data, taken during the May - June 2013 commissioning of the instrument,
constitute a single-epoch linear polarization survey of a sample of gamma-ray - loud blazars, defined
according to unbiased and objective selection criteria, easily reproducible in simulations,
as well as a comparison sample of, otherwise similar, gamma-ray - quiet blazars. As such, the results
of this survey are appropriate for both phenomenological population studies and for tests of theoretical
population models. We have measured polarization fractions as low as $0.015$ down to $R$ magnitude
of 17 and as low as $0.035$ down to 18 magnitude. The hypothesis that the polarization fractions of
gamma-ray - loud and gamma-ray - quiet blazars are drawn from the same distribution is rejected at
the $10^{-3}$ level. We therefore conclude that gamma-ray - loud and gamma-ray - quiet sources have
different optical polarization properties. This is the first time this statistical difference
is demonstrated in optical wavelengths. The polarization fraction distributions of both samples
are well-described by exponential distributions with averages of $\langle p \rangle =6.7 ^{+1.0}_{-0.8}\times
10^{-2}$ for gamma-ray--loud blazars, and $\langle p \rangle =3.2 ^{+1.8}_{-1.0}\times 10^{-2}$
for gamma-ray--quiet blazars. The most probable value for the difference of the means is $3.4^{+1.5}_{-2.0}\times
10^{-2}$. The distribution of polarization angles is statistically consistent with being uniform.
