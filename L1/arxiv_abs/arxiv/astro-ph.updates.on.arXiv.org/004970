Gaia's exceptional resolution (FWHM $\sim$ 0.1$^{\prime\prime}$) allows identification and
cataloguing of the multiple images of gravitationally lensed quasars. We investigate a sample
of 49 known lensed quasars in the SDSS footprint, with image separations less than 2$^{\prime\prime}$,
and find that 8 are detected with multiple components in the first Gaia data release. In the case of
the 41 single Gaia detections, we generally are able to distinguish these lensed quasars from single
quasars when comparing Gaia flux and position measurements to those of Pan-STARRS and SDSS. This
is because the multiple images of these lensed quasars are typically blended in ground-based imaging
and therefore the total flux and a flux-weighted centroid are measured, which can differ significantly
from the fluxes and centroids of the individual components detected by Gaia. We compare the fluxes
through an empirical fit of Pan-STARRS griz photometry to the wide optical Gaia bandpass values
using a sample of isolated quasars. The positional offsets are calculated from a recalibrated astrometric
SDSS catalogue. Applying flux and centroid difference criteria to spectroscopically confirmed
quasars, we discover 4 new sub-arcsecond-separation lensed quasar candidates which have two distinct
components of similar colour in archival CFHT or HSC data. Our method based on single Gaia detections
can be used to identify the $\sim$ 1400 lensed quasars with image separation above 0.5$^{\prime\prime}$,
expected to have only one image bright enough to be detected by Gaia.
