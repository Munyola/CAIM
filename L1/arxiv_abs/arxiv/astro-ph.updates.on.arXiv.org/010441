The origin of the elements is a fascinating question that scientists have been trying to answer for
the last seven decades. The formation of light elements in the primordial universe and heavier elements
in astrophysical sources occurs through nuclear reactions. We can say that nuclear processes are
responsible for the production of energy and synthesis of elements in the various astrophysical
sites. Thus, nuclear reactions have a determining role in the existence and evolution of several
astrophysical environments, from the Sun to the spectacular explosions of supernovae. Nuclear
astrophysics attempts to address the most basic and important questions of our existence and future.
There are still many issues that are unresolved such as, how stars and our Galaxy have formed and how
they evolve, how and where are the heaviest elements made, what is the abundance of nuclei in the universe
and what is the nucleosynthesis output of the various production processes and why the amount of
lithium-7 observed is less than predicted. In this paper, we review our current understanding of
the different astrophysical nuclear processes leading to the formation of chemical elements and
pay particular attention to the formation of heavy elements occurring during high-energy astrophysical
events. Thanks to the recent multi-messenger observation of a binary neutron star merger, which
also confirmed production of heavy elements, explosive scenarios such as short gamma-ray bursts
and the following kilonovae are now strongly supported as nucleosynthesis sites.
