Star clusters interact with the interstellar medium (ISM) in various ways, most importantly in
the destruction of molecular star-forming clouds, resulting in inefficient star formation on
galactic scales. On cloud scales, ionizing radiation creates \hii regions, while stellar winds
and supernovae drive the ISM into thin shells. These shells are accelerated by the combined effect
of winds, radiation pressure and supernova explosions, and slowed down by gravity. Since radiative
and mechanical feedback is highly interconnected, they must be taken into account in a self-consistent
and combined manner, including the coupling of radiation and matter. We present a new semi-analytic
one-dimensional feedback model for isolated massive clouds ($\geq 10^5\,M_{\odot}$) to calculate
shell dynamics and shell structure simultaneously. It allows us to scan a large range of physical
parameters (gas density, star formation efficiency, metallicity) and to estimate escape fractions
of ionizing radiation $f_{\rm{esc,i}}$, the minimum star formation efficiency $\epsilon_{\rm{min}}$
required to drive an outflow, and recollapse time scales for clouds that are not destroyed by feedback.
Our results show that there is no simple answer to the question of what dominates cloud dynamics,
and that each feedback process significantly influences the efficiency of the others. We find that
variations in natal cloud density can very easily explain differences between dense-bound and
diffuse-open star clusters. We also predict, as a consequence of feedback, a $4-6$ Myr age difference
for massive clusters with multiple generations.
