Some of the exoplanets so far observed show featureless or flat transmission spectra, possibly
indicating the existence of clouds and/or haze in their atmospheres. Thanks to its large aperture
size and broad wavelength coverage, JWST is expected to enable detailed investigation of exoplanet
atmospheres, which could provide important constraints on the atmospheric composition obscured
by clouds/haze. Here, we use four warm ($\lesssim 1000$ K) planets suitable for atmospheric characterization
via transmission spectroscopy, GJ 1214b, GJ 436b, HD 97658b, and Kepler-51b, as examples to explore
molecular absorption features detectable by JWST even in the existence of hydrocarbon haze in the
atmospheres. We simulate photochemistry, the growth of hydrocarbon haze particles, and transmission
spectra for the atmospheres of these four planets. Among the planetary parameters considered,
super-Earths with hazy, relatively hydrogen-rich atmospheres are mostly expected to produce
detectable molecular absorption features such as a quite prominent $\mathrm{CH_4}$ feature at
3.3 ${\rm \mu}$m even for the extreme case of the most efficient production of photochemical haze.
For a planet that has extremely low gravity, such as Kepler-51b, haze particles grow significantly
large in the upper atmosphere due to the small sedimentation velocity, resulting in the featureless
or flat transmission spectrum in a wide wavelength range. This investigation shows that the transmission
spectra with muted features measured by HST in most cases do not preclude strong features at the longer
wavelengths accessible by JWST.
