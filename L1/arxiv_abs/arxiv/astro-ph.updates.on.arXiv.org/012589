Young massive clusters (YMCs) are the most compact, high-mass stellar systems still forming at
the present day. The precursor clouds to such systems are, however, rare due to their large initial
gas mass reservoirs and rapid dispersal timescales due to stellar feedback. Nonetheless, unlike
their high-z counterparts, these precursors are resolvable down to the sites of individually forming
stars, and hence represent the ideal environments in which to test the current theories of star and
cluster formation. Using high angular resolution (1$^{\prime\prime}$ / 0.05pc) and sensitivity
ALMA observations of two YMC progenitor clouds in the Galactic Centre, we have identified a suite
of molecular line transitions -- e.g. c-C$_{3}$H$_{2} $($7-6$) -- that are believed to be optically
thin, and reliably trace the gas structure in the highest density gas on star-forming core scales.
We conduct a virial analysis of the identified core and proto-cluster regions, and show that half
of the cores (5/10) and both proto-clusters are unstable to gravitational collapse. This is the
first kinematic evidence of global gravitational collapse in YMC precursor clouds at such an early
evolutionary stage. The implications are that if these clouds are to form YMCs, then they likely
do so via the "conveyor-belt" mode, whereby stars continually form within dispersed dense gas cores
as the cloud undergoes global gravitational collapse. The concurrent contraction of both the cluster-scale
gas and embedded (proto)stars ultimately leads to the high (proto)stellar density in YMCs.
