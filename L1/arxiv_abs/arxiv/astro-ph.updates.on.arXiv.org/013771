The Echelle spectrograph operating at Vainu Bappu Telescope (VBT) is a general purpose instrument
designed for high resolution spectroscopy. It is being considered for precision Doppler measurements
without altering the existing design and basic usage. However, the design level limitations and
environmental perturbations are a major source of instability and systematic errors. As a result,
a small Doppler signal in the stellar spectra is completely swamped by the large and uncontrolled
instrumental drift. In this paper, we discuss some of the remedial measures we took to improve the
radial velocity performance of the spectrograph. We show that a new auto-guider assembly has greatly
reduced the mechanical jitter of the star image at the fibre input, making the illumination of the
spectrograph slit at the other end stable. We have also installed an iodine absorption cell to track
and eliminate the instrumental drifts to facilitate precision radial velocity observations.
Furthermore, we have developed a generic algorithm that uses iodine exposures to extract the stellar
radial velocities without the need for the complex forward modeling. Our algorithm is not accurate
to the level of traditional iodine technique. However it is convenient to use on a low-cost general-purpose
spectrograph targeting a moderate Radial Velocity (RV) precision at a few 10-100~$\textrm{ms}^{-1}$
level. Finally, we have demonstrated the usefulness of our approach by measuring the RV signal of
a well known short-period, planet-hosting star.
