We report the detection of relativistically broadened iron K alpha emission in the X-ray spectra
of AGN detected in the 4Ms CDF-S. Using the Bayesian X-ray analysis (BXA) package, we fit 199 hard
band (2-7 keV) selected sources in the redshift range z=0.5--4 with three models: (i) an absorbed
power-law, (ii) the first model plus a narrow reflection component, and (iii) the second model with
an additional relativistic broadened reflection. The Bayesian evidence for the full sample of
sources selects the model with the additional broad component as being 10^5 times more probable
to describe the data better than the second model. For the two brightest sources in our sample, CID
190 (z=0.734) and CID 104 (z=0.543), BXA reveals the relativistic signatures in the individual
spectra. We estimate the fraction of sources containing a broad component to be 54^{+35}_{-37}%
(107/199 sources). Considering that the low signal-to-noise ratio of some spectra prevents the
detection of the broad iron K alpha line, we infer an intrinsic fraction with broad emission of around
two thirds. The detection of relativistic signatures in the X-ray spectra of these sources suggests
that they are powered by a radiatively efficient accretion disk. Preliminary evidence is found
that the spin of the black hole is high, with a maximally spinning Kerr BH model (a=1) providing a significantly
better fit than a Schwarzschild model (a=0). Our analysis demonstrate the potential of X-ray spectroscopy
to measure this key parameter in typical SMBH systems at the peak of BH growth.
