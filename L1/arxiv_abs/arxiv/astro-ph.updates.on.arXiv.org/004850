Near Infrared (NIR) and optical photometry and spectroscopy are presented for the nova V1831 Aquilae,
covering the early decline and dust forming phases during the first $\sim$90 days after its discovery.
The nova is highly reddened due to interstellar extinction. Based solely on the nature of NIR spectrum
we are able to classify the nova to be of the Fe II class. The distance and extinction to the nova are
estimated to be 6.1 $\pm$ 0.5 kpc and $A_{\rm v}$ $\sim$ 9.02 respectively. Lower limits of the electron
density, emission measure and ionized ejecta mass are made from a Case B analysis of the NIR Brackett
lines while the neutral gas mass is estimated from the optical [OI] lines. We discuss the cause for
a rapid strengthening of the He I 1.0830 $\mu$m line during the early stages. V1831 Aql formed a modest
amount of dust fairly early ($\sim$ 19.2 days after discovery); the dust shell is not seen to be optically
thick. Estimates are made of the dust temperature, dust mass and grain size. Dust formation commences
around day 19.2 at a condensation temperature of 1461 $\pm$ 15 K, suggestive of a carbon composition,
following which the temperature is seen to gradually decrease to 950K. The dust mass shows a rapid
initial increase which we interpret as being due to an increase in the number of grains, followed
by a period of constancy suggesting the absence of grain destruction processes during this latter
time. A discussion is made of the evolution of these parameters, including certain peculiarities
seen in the grain radius evolution.
