We used the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA) to map the CO(3-2) and [CI](1-0)
lines, as well as their underlying continuum emission, from the central $\sim 200$ pc region of the
Circinus galaxy that hosts the nearest type 2 Seyfert-class active galactic nucleus (AGN), with
a spatial resolution of $\sim 6-15$ pc. The lines and continuum-emitting regions consist of a circumnuclear
disk (CND; 74 pc $\times$ 34 pc) and spiral arms. The distribution of the continuum emission revealed
a temperature-dependent dust geometry and possibly polar dust elongation in the torus region.
The molecular mass of the CND is $M_{\rm H2} \sim 3 \times 10^6~M_\odot$ with a beam-averaged H$_2$
column density of $\sim 5 \times 10^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$ toward the AGN position, which contributes
significantly to the nuclear obscuration. The [CI](1-0)/CO(3-2) ratio at the AGN position is unusually
high, suggesting an X-ray dominated region-type chemistry. We decomposed the observed velocity
fields into rotational and dispersion components, and revealed multi-phase dynamic nature in
the $r \lesssim 10$ pc torus region, i.e., the diffuse atomic gas is more spatially extended along
the vertical direction of the disk than the dense molecular gas. Through comparisons with our model
predictions based on the radiation-driven fountain scheme, we indicate that atomic outflows are
the driver of the geometrical thickness of the atomic disk. This supports the validity of the radiation-driven
fountain scheme in the vicinity of this AGN, which would explain the long-lasting mystery, the physical
origin of the AGN torus.
