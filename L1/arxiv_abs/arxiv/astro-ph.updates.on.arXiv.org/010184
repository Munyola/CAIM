We perform a joint analysis of the auto and cross-correlations between three cosmic fields: the
galaxy density field, the galaxy weak lensing shear field, and the cosmic microwave background
(CMB) weak lensing convergence field. These three fields are measured using roughly 1300 sq. deg.
of overlapping optical imaging data from first year observations of the Dark Energy Survey and millimeter-wave
observations of the CMB from both the South Pole Telescope Sunyaev-Zel'dovich survey and Planck.
We present cosmological constraints from the joint analysis of the two-point correlation functions
between galaxy density and galaxy shear with CMB lensing. We test for consistency between these
measurements and the DES-only two-point function measurements, finding no evidence for inconsistency
in the context of flat $\Lambda$CDM cosmological models. Performing a joint analysis of five of
the possible correlation functions between these fields (excluding only the CMB lensing autospectrum)
yields $S_{8}\equiv \sigma_8\sqrt{\Omega_{\rm m}/0.3} = 0.782^{+0.019}_{-0.025}$ and $\Omega_{\rm
m}=0.260^{+0.029}_{-0.019}$. We test for consistency between these five correlation function
measurements and the Planck-only measurement of the CMB lensing autospectrum, again finding no
evidence for inconsistency in the context of flat $\Lambda$CDM models. Combining constraints
from all six two-point functions yields $S_{8}=0.776^{+0.014}_{-0.021}$ and $\Omega_{\rm m}=
0.271^{+0.022}_{-0.016}$. These results provide a powerful test and confirmation of the results
from the first year DES joint-probes analysis.
