Accurate cosmology from upcoming weak lensing surveys relies on knowledge of the total matter power
spectrum at percent level at scales $k < 10$ $h$/Mpc, for which modelling the impact of baryonic physics
is crucial. We compare measurements of the total matter power spectrum from the Horizon cosmological
hydrodynamical simulations: a dark matter-only run, one with full baryonic physics, and another
lacking Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) feedback. Baryons cause a suppression of power at $k\simeq
10$ $h/$Mpc of $<15\%$ at $z=0$, and an enhancement of a factor of a few at smaller scales due to the
more efficient cooling and star formation. The results are sensitive to the presence of the highest
mass haloes in the simulation and the distribution of dark matter is also impacted up to a few percent.
The redshift evolution of the effect is non-monotonic throughout $z=0-5$ due to an interplay between
AGN feedback and gas pressure, and the growth of structure. We investigate the effectiveness of
an analytic `baryonic correction model' in describing our results. We require a different redshift
evolution and propose an alternative fitting function with $4$ free parameters that reproduces
our results within $5\%$. Compared to other simulations, we find the impact of baryonic processes
on the total matter power spectrum to be smaller at $z=0$. Correspondingly, our results suggest
that AGN feedback is not strong enough in the simulation. Total matter power spectra from the Horizon
simulations are made publicly available at https://www.horizon-simulation.org/catalogues.html.
