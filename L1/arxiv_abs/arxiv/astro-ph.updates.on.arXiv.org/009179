The Cassini Mission has greatly improved our understanding of the dynamics and chemical processes
occurring in Titan's atmosphere. It has also provided us with more insight into the formation of
the aerosols in the upper atmospheric layers. However, the chemical composition and mechanisms
leading to their formation were out of reach for the instruments onboard Cassini. In this context,
it is deemed necessary to apply and exploit laboratory simulations to better understand the chemical
reactivity occurring in the gas phase of Titan-like conditions. In the present work, we report gas
phase results obtained from a plasma discharge simulating the chemical processes in Titan's ionosphere.
We use the PAMPRE cold dusty plasma experiment with an N2-CH4 gaseous mixture under controlled pressure
and gas influx. An internal cryogenic trap has been developed to accumulate the gas products during
their production and facilitate their detection. The cryogenic trap condenses the gas-phase precursors
while they are forming, so that aerosols are no longer observed during the 2h plasma discharge. We
focus mainly on neutral products NH3, HCN, C2H2 and C2H4. The latter are identified and quantified
by in situ mass spectrometry and infrared spectroscopy. We present here results from this experiment
with mixing ratios of 90-10% and 99-1% N2-CH4, covering the range of methane concentrations encountered
in Titan's ionosphere. We also detect in situ heavy molecules (C7). In particular, we show the role
of ethylene and other volatiles as key solid-phase precursors.
