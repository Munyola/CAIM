We report results of molecular line observations carried out toward a massive dense core in the Cyg
OB 7 molecular cloud. The core has an extraordinarily large mass ($\sim1.1 \times 10^4$ $M_\odot$)
and size ($\sim2 \times 5$ pc$^2$), but there is no massive young star forming therein. We observed
this core in various molecular lines such as C$^{18}$O($J=1-0$) using the 45m telescope at Nobeyama
Radio Observatory. We find that the core has an elongated morphology consisting of several filaments
and core-like structures. The filaments are massive ($10^2-10^3$ $M_\odot$), and they are apparently
colliding against each other. Some candidates of YSOs are distributed around their intersection,
suggesting that the collisions of the filaments may have influenced on their formation. To understand
the formation and evolution of such colliding filaments, we performed numerical simulations using
the adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) technique adopting the observed core parameters (e.g., the
mass and size) as the initial conditions. Results indicate that the filaments are formed as seen
in other earlier simulations for small cores in literature, but we could not reproduce the collisions
of the filaments simply by assuming the large initial mass and size. We find that the collisions of
the filaments occur only when there is a large velocity gradient in the initial core in a sense to compress
it. We suggest that the observed core was actually compressed by an external effect, e.g., shocks
of nearby supernova remnants including HB21 which has been suggested to be interacting with the
Cyg OB 7 molecular cloud.
