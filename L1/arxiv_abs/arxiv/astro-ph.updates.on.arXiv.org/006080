Previous studies of the rotation law in the outer Galactic disc have mainly used gas tracers or clump
giants. Here, we explore A and F stars as alternatives: these provide a much denser sampling in the
outer disc than gas tracers and have experienced significantly less velocity scattering than older
clump giants. This first investigation confirms the suitability of A stars in this role. Our work
is based on spectroscopy of $\sim$ 1300 photometrically-selected stars in the red calcium-triplet
region, chosen to mitigate against the effects of interstellar extinction. The stars are located
in two low Galactic latitude sightlines, at longitudes $\ell = 118^{\circ}$, sampling strong Galactic
rotation shear, and $\ell = 178^{\circ}$, near the Anticentre. With the use of Markov Chain Monte
Carlo parameter fitting, stellar parameters and radial velocities are measured, and distances
computed. The obtained trend of radial velocity with distance is inconsistent with existing flat
or slowly rising rotation laws from gas tracers (Brand & Blitz 1993; Reid et al. 2014). Instead, our
results fit in with those obtained by Huang et al. (2016) from disc clump giants that favoured rising
circular speeds. An alternative interpretation in terms of spiral arm perturbation is not straight
forward. We assess the role that undetected binaries in the sample and distance error may have in
introducing bias, and show that the former is a minor factor. The random errors in our trend of circular
velocity are within $\pm 5$ km s$^{-1}$.
