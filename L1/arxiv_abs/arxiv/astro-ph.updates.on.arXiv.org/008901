Fornax is the most massive of the Milky Way dwarf spheroidal galaxies and has five globular clusters
orbiting in a dense background of dark matter. Observational analyses suggest that globular clusters
were initially much more massive and lost most of their stars to the Fornax field. We re-investigate
the Fornax cusp-core problem, to clarify tensions between simulations and observations concerning
the dark matter halo density profile. N-body simulations predict a centrally steep power-law density
profile, while observations of the globular clusters seem to prefer that the dark matter halo density
is constant at the center. For the first time, we ran pure N-body simulations with entirely live systems,
i.e. self-gravitating systems composed of particles (including stars and dark matter). Only this
numerical approach accounts correctly for dynamical friction and tidal effects between Fornax
and the globular clusters. We show that a weak cusp ($r_{s}=$ 1.5 kpc) or a large core ($r_{c}=$ 848
pc) are not compatible with the current observed positions and masses of Fornax clusters. In contrast,
a small dark matter core ($r_{c}=$ 282 pc) for Fornax naturally reproduces the cluster spatial and
mass distributions over a wide range of initial globular cluster masses. We derive an upper limit
of $r_{c}\lesssim$ 282 pc. This core size range favors only warm dark datter (WDM). It is also possible
to obtain a compatible core size range from cold dark matter (CDM) theories, if the initial halo's
central cusp is heated by gas to form a small core.
