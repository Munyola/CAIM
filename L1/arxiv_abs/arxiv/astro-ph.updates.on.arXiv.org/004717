Weakly magnetic, millisecond spinning neutron stars attain their very fast rotation through a
1E8-1E9 yr long phase during which they undergo disk-accretion of matter from a low mass companion
star. They can be detected as accretion-powered millisecond X-ray pulsars if towards the end of
this phase their magnetic field is still strong enough to channel the accreting matter towards the
magnetic poles. When mass transfer is much reduced or ceases altogether, pulsed emission generated
by particle acceleration in the magnetosphere and powered by the rotation of the neutron star is
observed, preferentially in the radio and gamma-ray bands. In recent years, a few transitional
millisecond pulsars that swing between an accretion-powered X-ray pulsar regime and a rotation-powered
radio pulsar regime have been identified. Transitions take place in response to large variations
of the mass inflow rate, on time-scales of a few weeks or less. Here we report the detection of optical
pulsations from a transitional pulsar in a binary system, the first ever from a millisecond spinning
neutron star. The pulsations originate inside the magnetosphere or within a few hundreds of kilometers
from it, through an incoherent radiation process, likely synchrotron emission. The optical pulsation
luminosity to spin-down power is about two orders of magnitude higher in this system than in the young,
isolated, highly magnetic rotation-powered pulsar from which pulsations in the optical band were
previously detected, 9; we argue that this may be related to the presence of an accretion disk.
