Methods to determine abundances of the elements in the atmospheres of F, G, and K stars with precisions
of 0.01-0.03 dex are reviewed. Such high-precision stellar abundances have led to the discovery
of unexpected phenomena and relations with important bearings on the astrophysics of galaxies,
stars, and planets, such as existence of discrete stellar populations in the Galactic disk and halo,
differences in the relation between abundances and elemental condensation temperature for the
Sun and solar twins, differences in chemical composition between binary star components and between
members of star clusters, and tight relations between some abundance ratios and age for solar-like
stars. We conclude that if high-precision abundances can be achieved in studies of more distant
stars and stars on the giant and supergiant branches, many more interesting future applications,
of great relevance to stellar and galaxy evolution, will be possible. Hence, in planning abundance
surveys, it is important to carefully balance the need for large samples of stars against the spectral
resolution and signal-to-noise ratio needed to obtain high-precision abundances. Furthermore,
it is an advantage to work differentially on stars with similar atmospheric parameters, because
then a simple 1D LTE analysis of stellar spectra may be sufficient. However, when determining high-precision
absolute abundances or differential abundances between stars having more widely different parameters,
e.g. metal-poor stars compared to the Sun or giants to dwarfs, then 3D non-LTE effects must be taken
into account.
