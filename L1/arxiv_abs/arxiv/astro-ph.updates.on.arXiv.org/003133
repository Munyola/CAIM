The Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Frontier Fields Campaign targets six massive clusters of galaxies,
exploiting the strong gravitational lensing effect to study the distant Universe. At Gemini South
we observe the three southern-most clusters in Ks-band, overcoming HST/WFC3's sensitivity cut-off
redwards of 1.7 microns. We use the Gemini Multi-Conjugate Adaptive Optics System (GeMS) and the
Gemini South Adaptive Optics Imager (GSAOI), delivering near diffraction-limited images on arcminute
scales. In this paper we describe our public release of 100"x110" wide images of the first target,
MACS J0416.1-2403. We have achieved an angular resolution of 0.07"-0.10", twice as high as HST/WFC3,
with only one natural guide star. With a $5\sigma$ depth of Ks=23.8 mag for extended sources our images
are shallower than the HST/WFC3 images. The data were distortion corrected and registered with
sub-pixel accuracy despite only a few low-S/N extended sources are visible in the individual exposures.
This is a demonstration that even for fields at high galactic latitude, where natural guide stars
are scarce, current multi-conjugated adaptive optics technology at 8m-telescopes has opened
a new window on the distant Universe. We provide fully calibrated, co-added images matching the
native GSAOI pixel scale as well as the larger plate scales and the WCS projections of the HST release.
Two more Frontier Fields, Abell 2744 and Abell S1063, will be observed with GeMS/GSAOI, adding to
the legacy value of this community effort.
