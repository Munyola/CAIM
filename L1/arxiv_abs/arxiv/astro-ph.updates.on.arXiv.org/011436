In this work, we explore the evolution of the dark energy equation of state {\omega} by using Chevalliear-PolarskiLinder
(CPL) parametrization and the binned parametrizations. For binned parametrizations, we adopt
three methods to choose the redshift interval: I. Ensure that "{\Delta}z = const", where {\Delta}z
is the width of each bin; II.Ensure that "n{\Delta}z = const", where n is the number of SNIa in each
bin; III. Treat redshift discontinuity points as models parameters, i.e. "free {\Delta}z". For
observational data, we adopt JLA type Ia supernova (SNIa) samples, SDSS DR12 data, and Planck 2015
distance priors. In particular, for JLA SNIa samples, we consider three statistic techniques:
I. Magnitude statistics, which is the traditional method; II. Flux statistics, which reduces the
systematic uncertainties of SNIa; III. Improve flux statistics, which can reduce the systematic
uncertainties and give tighter constrains at the same time. The results are as follows: (1) For all
the cases, {\omega} = -1 is always satisfied at 1{\sigma} confidence regions; It means that {\Lambda}CDM
is still favored by current observations. (2) For magnitude statistics, "free {\Delta}z" model
will give the smallest error bars; this conclusion does not hold true for flux statistics and improved
flux statistic. (3) The improved flux statistic yields a largest present fractional density of
matter {\Omega}m; in addition, this technique will give a largest current deceleration parameter
q0 , which reveals a universe with a slowest cosmic acceleration.
