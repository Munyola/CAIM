To gain understanding of the complicated, non-linear and numerical processes associated with
the tidal evolution of dark matter subhaloes in numerical simulation, we perform a large suite of
idealized simulations that follow individual N-body subhaloes in a fixed, analytical host halo
potential. By varying both physical and numerical parameters, we investigate under what conditions
the subhaloes undergo disruption. We confirm the conclusions from our more analytical assessment
in van den Bosch et al. that most disruption is numerical in origin; as long as a subhalo is resolved
with sufficient mass and force resolution, a bound remnant survives. This implies that state-of-the-art
cosmological simulations still suffer from significant overmerging. We demonstrate that this
is mainly due to inadequate force-softening, which causes excessive mass loss and artificial tidal
disruption. In addition, we show that subhaloes in N-body simulations are susceptible to a runaway
instability triggered by the amplification of discreteness noise in the presence of a tidal field.
These two processes conspire to put serious limitations on the reliability of dark matter substructure
in state-of-the-art cosmological simulations. We present two criteria that can be used to assess
whether individual subhaloes in cosmological simulations are reliable or not, and advocate that
subhaloes that satisfy either of these two criteria be discarded from further analysis. We discuss
the potential implications of this work for several areas in astrophysics.
