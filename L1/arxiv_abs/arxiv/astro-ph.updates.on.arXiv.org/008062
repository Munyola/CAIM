We present two algorithms to identify and flag radio frequency interference (RFI) in radio interferometric
imaging data. The first algorithm utilizes the redundancy of visibilities inside a UV cell in the
visibility plane to identify corrupted data, while varying the detection threshold in accordance
with the observed reduction in noise with radial UV distance. In the second algorithm, we propose
a scheme to detect faint RFI in the visibility time-channel plane of baselines. The efficacy of identifying
RFI in the residual visibilities is reduced by the presence of ripples due to inaccurate subtraction
of the strongest sources. This can be due to several reasons including primary beam asymmetries
and other direction dependent calibration errors. We eliminated these ripples by clipping the
corresponding peaks in the associated Fourier plane. RFI was detected in the ripple-free time-channel
plane but was flagged in the original visibilities. Application of these two algorithms to 5 different
150 MHz datasets from the GMRT resulted in a reduction in image noise of 20-50% throughout the field
along with a reduction in systematics and a corresponding increase in the number of detected sources.
However, on comparing the mean flux densities before and after flagging RFI we find a differential
change with the fainter sources ($25\sigma <$ S $< 100$ mJy) showing a change of -6% to +1% relative
to the stronger sources (S $>$ 100 mJy). We are unable to explain this effect but it could be related
to the CLEAN bias known for interferometers.
