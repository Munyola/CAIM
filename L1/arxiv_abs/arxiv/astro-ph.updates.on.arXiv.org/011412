As an evolutionary phase of galaxies, active galactic nuclei (AGN) over a large range of redshift
have been utilized for understanding cosmic evolution. In particular, the population and evolution
of AGNs have been investigated through the study of the cosmic X-ray background in various fields.
As one of the deep fields observed by Chandra with a total of 2.8 Msec exposures, Abell 133 is a special
region to investigate AGNs, providing a testbed for probing the environmental effect on AGN trigger,
since cluster environments can be different from field environments. The achieved flux limit of
data at 50% completeness level of 6.95x10^(-16), 1.43x10^(-16), and 1.57x10^(-15) ergs cm^(-2)
in 0.5-8, 0.5-2, and 2-8 keV. Using the wavdetect and no-source binomial probability (i.e., p<0.007),
we analyze the combined \textit{Chandra} image, detecting 1617 (in 0.5-8 keV), 1324 (in 0.5-2 keV),
and 1028 (in 2-8 keV), X-ray point sources in the Abell 133 region. Here, we present the X-ray point
source catalogue with the source fluxes, which can be combined with multiwavelength data for future
works. We find that the number count distribution of the X-ray point sources is well reproduced with
a broken power-law model while the best-fit model parameters are sensitive to the fitting range
of the number count distribution. Finally, we find an excess of the number density (decrease of AGN
fraction) at the central region of the cluster, which reflects the effect of dense environments
on AGN trigger, as similarly found in studies of other galaxy clusters.
