Narrowband imaging is a highly successful approach for finding large numbers of high redshift Lya
emitting galaxies (LAEs) up to z~6.6. However, at z>~7 there are as yet only 3 narrowband selected
LAEs with spectroscopic confirmations (two at z~6.9-7.0, one at z~7.3), which hinders extensive
studies on cosmic reionization and galaxy evolution at this key epoch. We have selected 23 candidate
z~6.9 LAEs in COSMOS field with the large area narrowband survey LAGER (Lyman-Alpha Galaxies at
the End of Reionization). In this work we present spectroscopic followup observations of 12 candidates
using IMACS on Magellan. For 9 of these, the observations are sufficiently deep to detect the expected
lines. Lya emission lines are identified in six sources (yielding a success rate of 2/3), including
3 luminous LAEs with Lya luminosities of L(Lya) ~ 10^{43.5} erg/s, the highest among known spectroscopically
confirmed galaxies at >~7.0. This triples the sample size of spectroscopically confirmed narrowband
selected LAEs at z>~7, and confirms the bright end bump in the Lya luminosity function we previously
derived based on the photometric sample, supporting a patchy reionization scenario. Two luminous
LAEs appear physically linked with projected distance of 1.1 pMpc and velocity difference of ~ 170
km/s. They likely sit in a common ionized bubble produced by themselves or with close neighbors,
which reduces the IGM attenuation of Lya. A tentative narrow NV${\lambda}$1240 line is seen in one
source, hinting at activity of a central massive black hole with metal rich line emitting gas.
