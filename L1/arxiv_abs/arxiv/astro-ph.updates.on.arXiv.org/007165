We present the results of an outflow and infall survey towards a distance limited sample of 31 massive
star forming regions drawn from the RMS survey. The presence of young, active outflows is identified
from SiO (8-7) emission and the infall dynamics are explored using HCO$^+$/H$^{13}$CO$^+$ (4-3)
emission. We investigate if the infall and outflow parameters vary with source properties, exploring
whether regions hosting potentially young active outflows show similarities or differences with
regions harbouring more evolved, possibly momentum driven, "fossil" outflows. SiO emission is
detected towards approximately 46% of the sources. When considering sources with and without an
SiO detection (i.e. potentially active and fossil outflows respectively), only the $^{12}$CO
outflow velocity shows a significant difference between samples, indicating SiO is more prevalent
towards sources with higher outflow velocities. Furthermore, we find the SiO luminosity increases
as a function of the Herschel 70$\mu$m to WISE 22$\mu$m flux ratio, suggesting the production of
SiO is prevalent in younger, more embedded regions. Similarly, we find tentative evidence that
sources with an SiO detection have a smaller bolometric luminosity-to-mass ratio, indicating
SiO (8-7) emission is associated with potentially younger regions. We do not find a prevalence towards
sources displaying signatures of infall in our sample. However, the higher energy HCO$^+$ transitions
may not be the best suited tracer of infall at this spatial resolution in these regions.
