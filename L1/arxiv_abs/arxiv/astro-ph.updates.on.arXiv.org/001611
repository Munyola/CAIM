We perform an exploratory study of the physical properties of accretion flows and jets in low-luminosity
active galactic nuclei (LLAGNs) by modeling the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of 12 LLAGNs
in low-ionization nuclear emission-line regions (LINERs). These SEDs we constructed from high-resolution
radio, X-ray and optical/UV observations of the immediate vicinity of the black hole. We adopt a
coupled accretion-jet model comprising an inner advection-dominated accretion flow (ADAF) and
an outer standard thin disk. We present best-fit models in which either the ADAF or the jet dominate
the X-ray emission. Six sources in our sample display an optical-UV excess with respect to ADAF and
jet models; this excess can be explained as emission from the truncated disk with transition radii
30-225 Rs in four of them. In almost all sources the optical emission can also be attributed to unresolved,
old stellar clusters with masses ~1E7-1E8 Msun. We find evidence for a correlation between the accretion
rate and jet power and an anti-correlation between the radio-loudness and the accretion rate. We
confirm previous findings that the radio emission is severely underpredicted by ADAF models and
explained by the relativistic jet. We find evidence for a nonlinear relation between the X-ray and
bolometric luminosities and a slight IR excess in the average model SED compared to that of quasars.
We suggest that the hardness of the X-ray spectrum can be used to identify the X-ray emission mechanism
and discuss directions for progress in understanding the origin of the X-rays.
