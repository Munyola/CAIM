The Seyfert 1 galaxy NGC 4593 was monitored spectroscopically with the Hubble Space Telescope as
part of a reverberation mapping campaign that also included Swift, Kepler and ground-based photometric
monitoring. During 2016 July 12 - August 6, we obtained 26 spectra across a nearly continuous wavelength
range of ~1150 - 10,000A. These were combined with Swift data to produce a UV/optical "lag spectrum",
which shows the interband lag relative to the Swift UVW2 band as a function of wavelength. The broad
shape of the lag spectrum appears to follow the $\tau \propto \lambda^{4/3}$ relation seen previously
in photometric interband lag measurements of other active galactic nuclei (AGN). This shape is
consistent with the standard thin disk model but the magnitude of the lags implies a disk that is a
factor of ~3 larger than predicted, again consistent with what has been previously seen in other
AGN. In all cases these large disk sizes, which are also implied by independent gravitational microlensing
of higher-mass AGN, cannot be simply reconciled with the standard model. However the most striking
feature in this higher resolution lag spectrum is a clear excess around the 3646A Balmer jump. This
strongly suggests that diffuse emission from gas in the much larger broad-line region (BLR) must
also contribute significantly to the interband lags. While the relative contributions of the disk
and BLR cannot be uniquely determined in these initial measurements, it is clear that both will need
to be considered in comprehensively modeling and understanding AGN lag spectra.
