In a recent study, using the distribution of galaxies in the north galactic pole of SDSS DR7 region
enclosed in a 500$\mpch$ box, we carried out our ELUCID simulation (Wang et al. 2016, ELUCID III).
Here we {\it light} the dark matter halos and subhalos in the reconstructed region in the simulation
with galaxies in the SDSS observations using a novel {\it neighborhood} abundance matching method.
Before we make use of thus established galaxy-subhalo connections in the ELUCID simulation to evaluate
galaxy formation models, we set out to explore the reliability of such a link. For this purpose, we
focus on the following a few aspects of galaxies: (1) the central-subhalo luminosity and mass relations;
(2) the satellite fraction of galaxies; (3) the conditional luminosity function (CLF) and conditional
stellar mass function (CSMF) of galaxies; and (4) the cross correlation functions between galaxies
and the dark matter particles, most of which are measured separately for all, red and blue galaxy
populations. We find that our neighborhood abundance matching method accurately reproduces the
central-subhalo relations, satellite fraction, the CLFs and CSMFs and the biases of galaxies.
These features ensure that thus established galaxy-subhalo connections will be very useful in
constraining galaxy formation processes. And we provide some suggestions on the three levels of
using the galaxy-subhalo pairs for galaxy formation constraints. The galaxy-subhalo links and
the subhalo merger trees in the SDSS DR7 region extracted from our ELUCID simulation are available
upon request.
