Intrinsic alignments (IA) of galaxies, i.e. correlations of galaxy shapes with each other or with
the density field, are a major astrophysical source of contamination for weak lensing surveys.
We present the results of IA measurements of galaxies on 0.1- 200 Mpc/h scales using the SDSS-III
BOSS LOWZ sample, in the redshift range 0.16<z<0.36. We extend the existing IA measurements
for spectroscopic LRGs to lower luminosities, and show that the luminosity dependence of large-scale
IA can be well-described by a power law. Within the limited redshift and color range of our sample,
we observe no significant redshift or color dependence of IA. We measure the halo mass of LOWZ galaxies
using galaxy-galaxy lensing, and show that the mass dependence of large-scale IA is also well described
by a power law. We detect variation in the scale dependence of IA with mass and luminosity, which underscores
the need to use flexible templates in order to remove the IA signal. We also study the environment
dependence of IA by splitting the sample into field and group galaxies, which are further split into
satellite and central galaxies. We show that group central galaxies are aligned with their halos
at small scales and also are aligned with the tidal fields out to large scales. We also detect the radial
alignments of satellite galaxies within groups, which results in a null detection of large-scale
intrinsic alignments for satellites. These results can be used to construct better intrinsic alignment
models for removal of this contaminant to the weak lensing signal.
