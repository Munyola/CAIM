We report 78 secondary eclipse depths for a sample of 36 transiting hot Jupiters observed at 3.6-
and 4.5 microns using the Spitzer Space Telescope. Our eclipse results for 27 of these planets are
new, and include highly irradiated worlds such as KELT-7b, WASP-87b, WASP-76b, and WASP-64b, and
important targets for JWST such as WASP-62b. We find that WASP-62b has a slightly eccentric orbit
e cos(omega) = 0.00614 +/- 0.00058, and we confirm the eccentricity of HAT-P-13b and WASP-14b. The
remainder are individually consistent with circular orbits, but we find statistical evidence
for eccentricity increasing with orbital period in our range from 1 to 5 days. Our day-side brightness
temperatures for the planets yield information on albedo and heat redistribution, following Cowan
and Agol (2011). Planets having maximum day side temperatures exceeding ~ 2200K are consistent
with zero albedo and distribution of stellar irradiance uniformly over the day-side hemisphere.
Our most intriguing result is that we detect a systematic difference between the emergent spectra
of these hot Jupiters as compared to blackbodies. The ratio of observed brightness temperatures,
Tb(4.5)/Tb(3.6), increases with equilibrium temperature by 98 +/- 26 parts-per-million per Kelvin,
over the entire temperature range in our sample (800K to 2500K). No existing model predicts this
trend over such a large range of temperature. We suggest that this may be due to a structural difference
in the atmospheric temperature profile between the real planetary atmospheres as compared to models.
