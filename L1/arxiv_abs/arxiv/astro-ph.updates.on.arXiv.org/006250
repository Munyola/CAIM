Aims: We test the effects of re-orienting jets on the Intra-Cluster Medium in a cool-core galaxy
cluster environment. We investigate both the appearance of the X-ray gas cavities and the heating
they provide to the cool core. Methods: We test, making use of numerical simulations, four models
of periodically re-orienting jets from the central AGN. We keep the jet power and duration fixed
and change only the re-orientation angle prescription. We are able to produce realistic X-ray synthetic
images and compare them qualitatively to real ones. We show the total energy of the gas and its thermodynamic
properties, as well as the energy transfer from the AGN to the ICM. Results: Jets whose re-orientation
is substantial (always above $20$ degrees) are able to produce several detached cavities, as opposed
to a single, internally connected cavity system. The latter is usually larger and filled by hot plasma
of different ages. Synthetic X-ray observations are able to reproduce many observed features,
especially resembling real cool-core clusters when the re-orientation angle is constrained between
$20$ and $30$ degrees. Jets in those same runs, though inflating smaller cavities, allow for a more
efficient heating of the gas, most importantly on scales smaller than $50$ kpc. Re-orienting jets,
over hundreds of Myr, can deposit up to $80\%$ of their energy into the ICM, against $60\%$ for jets
along a single direction. These jets are finally the only ones in our models reaching an inflow/outflow
balance, effectively counteracting cooling flows and keeping the gas' luminosity around the observed
values.
