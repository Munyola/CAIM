Studies of galaxy clusters provide stringent constraints on models of structure formation. Provided
that selection effects are under control, large X-ray surveys are well suited to derive cosmological
parameters, in particular those governing the dark energy equation of state. We forecast the capabilities
of the all-sky eROSITA (the extended ROentgen Survey with an Imaging Telescope Array) survey to
be achieved by the early 2020s. We bring special attention to modeling the entire chain from photon
emission to source detection and cataloguing. The selection function of galaxy clusters for the
upcoming eROSITA mission is investigated by means of extensive and dedicated Monte-Carlo simulations.
Employing a combination of accurate instrument characterization and of state-of-the-art source
detection technique, we determine a cluster detection efficiency based on the cluster fluxes and
sizes. Using this eROSITA cluster selection function, we find that eROSITA will detect a total of
$\sim 10^5$ clusters in the extra-galactic sky. This number of clusters will allow eROSITA to put
stringent constraints on cosmological models. We show that incomplete assumptions on selection
effects, such as neglecting the distribution of cluster sizes, induce a bias in the derived value
of cosmological parameters. Synthetic simulations of the eROSITA sky capture the essential characteristics
impacting the next-generation galaxy cluster surveys and they highlight parameters requiring
tight monitoring in order to avoid biases in cosmological analyses.
