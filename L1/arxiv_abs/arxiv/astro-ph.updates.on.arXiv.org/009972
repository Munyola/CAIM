The formation and chemical evolution of the Milky Way Galaxy is numerically simulated by developing
a Monte Carlo approach to predict the elemental abundance gradients and other galactic features
using the revised solar abundance. The galaxy is accreted gradually by using either a two-infall
or a three-infall accretion scenario. The galaxy is chemically enriched by the nucleosynthetic
contributions from an evolving ensemble of generations of stars. We analyse the role of star formation
efficiency. The influence of the radial gas inflow as well as radial gas mixing on the evolution of
galaxy is also studied. The SN Ia delay time distribution (DTD) is incorporated by synthesizing
SN Ia populations using random numbers based on a distribution function. The elemental abundance
evolutionary trends corroborate fractional contributions of ~0.1 from prompt ( < 100 Myr) SN Ia
population. The models predict steep gradients in the inner regions and less steep gradients in
the outer regions which agrees with the observations. The gradients indicate an average radial
gas mixing velocity of < 1 km/s. The models with radial gas inflows reproduce the observed inversion
in the elemental abundance gradients around 2 billion years. The three-infall accretion scenario
performs better than the two-infall accretion model in terms of explaining the elemental abundance
distributions of the galactic halo, thick and thin discs. The accuracy of all the models has been
monitored as a cumulative error of < 0.15 M in the mass balance calculations during the entire evolution
of the galaxy.
