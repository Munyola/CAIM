We investigate planetesimal accretion via a direct N-body simulation of an annulus at 1 AU orbiting
a 1 $M_{\odot}$ star. The planetesimal ring, which initially contains N = $10^6$ bodies is evolved
into the oligarchic growth phase. Unlike previous lower resolution studies, we find that the mass
distribution of planetesimals develops a bump at intermediate mass after the oligarchs form. This
feature marks a boundary between growth modes. The smallest planetesimals are packed tightly enough
together to populate mean motion resonances with the oligarchs, which heats the small bodies, enhancing
their growth. If we depopulate most of the resonances by decreasing the width of the annulus, this
effect becomes weaker. To clearly demonstrate the dynamics driving these growth modes, we also
examine the evolution of a planetary embryo embedded in an annulus of collisionless planetesimals.
In this case, we find that the resonances push planetesimals away from the embryo, decreasing the
surface density of the bodies adjacent to the embryo. This effect only occurs when the annulus is
wide enough and the mass resolution of the planetesimals is fine enough to populate the resonances.
The bump we observe in the mass distribution resembles the 100 km power law break seen in the size distribution
of asteroid belt objects. Although the bump produced in our simulations occurs at a size larger than
100 km, we show that the bump location is sensitive to the initial planetesimal mass, which implies
that this feature is potentially useful for constraining planetesimal formation models.
