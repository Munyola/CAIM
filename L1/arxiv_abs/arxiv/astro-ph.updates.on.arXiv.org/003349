I present an organic description of the spectrum of regimes of collisionless tidal streams and define
the orderings between the relevant physical quantities that shape their morphology. Three dichotomies
are identified and the mechanisms through which they regulate the main qualitative properties
of a stream are illustrated. These determine (i) the speed of the differential streaming, (ii) the
internal coherence of the stream, (iii) its thickness or opening angle. The roles of the slope of
the host's density profile, the progenitor's internal kinematics (and ordered rotation), the
details of the shedding history are systematically inspected. Within this framework, I concentrate
on the mechanism that causes the characteristic `feathering' typical of streams of star clusters,
which is found to be a natural feature of coherent streams. Feathers appear as collections of multiple
`armlets', each composed of stars shed between two successive apocentric passages of the progenitor.
Each armlet is folded along its length, pulled at its centre by the faster differential streaming
of stars released near pericenter. The same mechanism is capable of generating `bifurcations'
(i.e. bimodal density distributions) in the faster streams of more massive progenitors. I explore
on the conditions under which streams are internally coherent and comment on the cases of Palomar~5,
Willman~1, the Anticenter and Sagittarius' streams. Analytic analyses are accompanied by numerical
experiments, which are performed using a purposely built generative model, also presented here.
