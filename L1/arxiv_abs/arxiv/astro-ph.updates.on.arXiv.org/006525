The balloon-borne HiCal radio-frequency (RF) transmitter, in concert with the ANITA radio-frequency
receiver array, is designed to measure the Antarctic surface reflectivity in the RF wavelength
regime. The amplitude of surface-reflected transmissions from HiCal, registered as triggered
events by ANITA, can be compared with the direct transmissions preceding them by O(10) microseconds,
to infer the surface power reflection coefficient $\cal{R}$. The first HiCal mission (HiCal-1,
Jan. 2015) yielded a sample of 100 such pairs, resulting in estimates of $\cal{R}$ at highly-glancing
angles (i.e., zenith angles approaching $90^\circ$), with measured reflectivity for those events
which exceeded extant calculations. The HiCal-2 experiment, flying from Dec., 2016-Jan., 2017,
provided an improvement by nearly two orders of magnitude in our event statistics, allowing a considerably
more precise mapping of the reflectivity over a wider range of incidence angles. We find general
agreement between the HiCal-2 reflectivity results and those obtained with the earlier HiCal-1
mission, as well as estimates from Solar reflections in the radio-frequency regime. In parallel,
our calculations of expected reflectivity have matured; herein, we use a plane-wave expansion
to estimate the reflectivity R from both a flat, smooth surface (and, in so doing, recover the Fresnel
reflectivity equations) and also a curved surface. Multiplying our flat-smooth reflectivity
by improved Earth curvature and surface roughness corrections now provides significantly better
agreement between theory and the HiCal 2a/2b measurements.
