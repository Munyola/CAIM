The detailed observational analysis of a homologous Extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) wave event is presented
to study the driving mechanism and the physical property of the EUV waves, combining high resolution
data taken by the Solar Dynamics Observatory and the Solar TErrestrial RElations Observatory.
It is observed that four homologous EUV waves originated from the same active region AR11476 within
about one hour, and the time separations between consecutive waves were of 8 - 20 minutes. The waves
showed narrow arc-shaped wavefronts and propagated in the same direction along a large-scale transequatorial
loop system at a speed of 648 - 712 km/s and a deceleration of 0.985 - 1.219 km/s2. The EUV waves were
accompanied by weak flares, coronal jets, and radio type III bursts, in which the EUV waves were delayed
with respect to the start times of the radio type III bursts and coronal jets about 2 - 13 and 4 - 9 minutes,
respectively. Different to previous studies of homologous EUV waves, no coronal mass ejections
were found in the present event. Based on the observational results and the close temporal the spatial
relationship between the EUV waves and the coronal jets, for the first time, we propose that the observed
homologous EUV waves were large-amplitude nonlinear fast-mode magnetosonic waves or shocks driven
by the associated recurrent coronal jets, resemble the generation mechanism of a piston shock in
a tube. In addition, it is found that the recurrent jets were tightly associated with the alternating
flux cancellation and emergence in the eruption source region and radio type III bursts.
