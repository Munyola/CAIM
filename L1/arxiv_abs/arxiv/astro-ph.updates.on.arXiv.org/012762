In recent years, several close post-common-envelope eclipsing binaries have been found to show
cyclic eclipse timing variations (ETVs). This effect is usually interpreted either as the gravitational
interaction among circumbinary bodies and the host binary -- known as the light travel time (LTT)
effect -- or as the quadrupole moment variations in one magnetic active component -- known as Applegate
mechanism. In this study, we present an analysis of the ETV and the magnetic cycle of the close binary
KIC 10544976. This system is composed of a white dwarf and a red dwarf in a short orbital period (0.35
days) and was monitored by ground-based telescopes between 2005 and 2017 and by the Kepler satellite
between 2009 and 2013. Using the Kepler data, we derived the magnetic cycle of the red dwarf by two
ways: the rate and energy of flares and the variability due to spots. Both methods resulted in a cycle
of ~600 days, which is in agreement with magnetic cycles measured for single low-mass stars. The
orbital period of KIC 10544976 shows only one long-term variation which can be fitted by an LTT effect
with period of ~16.8 yr. Hence, one possible explanation for the ETVs is the presence of a circumbinary
body with minimal mass of ~13.4 M_Jup. In the particular scenario of coplanarity between the external
body and the inner binary, the third body mass is also ~13.4 M_Jup. In this case, the circumbinary
planet must either have survived the evolution of the host binary or have been formed as a consequence
of its evolution.
