Landing robotic spacecrafts and humans on the surface of Mars has become one of the inevitable technological
necessity for humans. To accomplish this intention, we need to land enormous number of cargoes,
crewed modules, return vehicles and scientific laboratories on Mars. In this entailing condition,
there are many incidences of crash landing leading to complete demolition of lander modules. Crash
landing occurs under numerous circumstances. Significant problems were loss of communication,
onboard command error, lander malfunction, software problem and premature EDL performance. Moreover,
existence of deformable shock absorbers like Aluminium honeycomb and crushable carbon fibers
in landing gears are not feasible for high scale mass and crewed landing. Consequently, it may cause
impairment of landing module. Further, while evaluating the interim EDL performance, landing
and switching EDL events within a limited span of 5 to 8 minutes appears to be the most challenging
task. Scrutinizing this concern, we propose a novel shock absorbing landing gear system that will
be more achievable for large scale and frequent landing missions. This paper relies on theoretical
proposition of practical design of landing gear system and we expect that, subject to any obstruction
in EDL sequence, this mechanical system will enable soft-landing thereby increasing the probability
of success in forthcoming landing missions. Hence, our ultimate aim is to protect lander modules
and their instruments during the course of landing.
