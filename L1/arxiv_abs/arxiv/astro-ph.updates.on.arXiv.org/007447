We present the first application of deep neural networks to the semantic segmentation of cosmological
filaments and walls in the Large Scale Structure of the Universe. Our results are based on a deep Convolutional
Neural Network (CNN) with a U-Net architecture trained using an existing state-of-the-art manually-guided
segmentation method. We successfully trained an tested an U-Net with a Voronoi model and an N-body
simulation. The predicted segmentation masks from the Voronoi model have a Dice coefficient of
0.95 and 0.97 for filaments and mask respectively. The predicted segmentation masks from the N-body
simulation have a Dice coefficient of 0.78 and 0.72 for walls and filaments respectively. The relatively
lower Dice coefficient in the filament mask is the result of filaments that were predicted by the
U-Net model but were not present in the original segmentation mask. Our results show that for a well-defined
dataset such as the Voronoi model the U-Net has excellent performance. In the case of the N-body dataset
the U-Net produced a filament mask of higher quality than the segmentation mask obtained from a state-of-the
art method. The U-Net performs better than the method used to train it, being able to find even the
tenuous filaments that the manually-guided segmentation failed to identify. The U-Net presented
here can process a $512^3$ volume in a few minutes and without the need of complex pre-processing.
Deep CNN have great potential as an efficient and accurate analysis tool for the next generation
large-volume computer N-body simulations and galaxy surveys.
