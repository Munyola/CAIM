We have determined the rate of large accretion events in class I and II young stellar objects (YSOs)
by comparing the all-sky digitised photographic plate surveys provided by SuperCOSMOS with the
latest data release from Gaia (DR2). The long mean baseline of 55 years along with a large sample of
class II YSOs ($\simeq$15,000) allows us to study approximately 1 million YSO-years. We find 139
objects with $\Delta R\geq1$~mag, most of which are found at amplitudes between 1 and 3 mag. The majority
of YSOs in this group show irregular variability or long-lasting fading events, which is best explained
as hot spots due to accretion or by variable extinction. There is a tail of YSOs at $\Delta R\geq3$~mag
and they seem to represent a different population. Surprisingly many objects in this group show
high-amplitude irregular variability over timescales shorter than 10 years, in contrast with
the view that high-amplitude objects always have long outbursts. However, we find 6 objects that
are consistent with undergoing large, long lasting accretion events, 3 of them previously unknown.
This yields an outburst recurrence timescale of 112 kyr, with a 68\% confidence interval [74 to 180]
kyr. This represents the first robust determination of the outburst rate in class II YSOs and shows
that YSOs in their planet-forming stage do in fact undergo large accretion events, and with timescales
of $\simeq$100,000 years. In addition, we find that outbursts in the class II stage are $\simeq$10
times less frequent than during the class I stage.
