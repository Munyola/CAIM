We imaged Comet 252P/2000 G1 (LINEAR) (hereafter 252P) with the Hubble Space Telescope and both
252P and P/2016 BA$_{14}$ (PanSTARRS) (hereafter BA$_{14}$) with the Discovery Channel Telescope
in March and April 2016, surrounding its close encounter to Earth. The r'-band $Af\rho$ of 252P in
a 0.2"-radius aperture were $16.8\pm0.3$ and $57\pm1$ cm on March 14 and April 4, respectively,
and its gas production rates were: $Q$(OH) = $(5.8\pm0.1)\times10^{27}$ s$^{-1}$, and $Q$(CN)
= $(1.25\pm0.01)\times10^{25}$ s$^{-1}$ on April 17. The r'-band upper limit $Af\rho$ of BA1$_{14}$
was $0.19\pm0.01$ cm in a 19.2"-radius aperture, and $Q$(CN) = $(1.4\pm0.1)10^{22}$ s$^{-1}$
on April 17, 2017. 252P shows a bright and narrow jet of a few hundred kilometers long in the sunward
direction, changing its projected position angle in the sky with a periodicity consistent with
7.24 hours. However, its photometric lightcurve is consistent with a periodicity of 5.41 hours.
We suggest that the nucleus of 252P is likely in a non-principal axis rotation. The nucleus radius
of 252P is estimated to be about $0.3\pm0.03$ km, indicating an active fraction of 40% to >100% in
its 2016 apparition. Evidence implies a possible cloud of slow-moving grains surrounding the nucleus.
The activity level of 252P in the 2016 apparition increased by two orders of magnitude from its previous
apparitions, making this apparition unusual. On the other hand, the activity level of BA14 appears
to be at least three orders of magnitude lower than that of 252P, despite its ten times or larger surface
area.
