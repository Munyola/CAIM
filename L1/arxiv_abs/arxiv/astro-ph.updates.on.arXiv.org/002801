The Circinus galaxy is one of the nearest obscured AGN, making it an ideal target for detailed study.
Combining archival Chandra and XMM-Newton data with new NuSTAR observations, we model the 2-79
keV spectrum to constrain the primary AGN continuum and to derive physical parameters for the obscuring
material. Chandra's high angular resolution allows a separation of nuclear and off-nuclear galactic
emission. In the off-nuclear diffuse emission we find signatures of strong cold reflection, including
high equivalent-width neutral Fe lines. This Compton-scattered off-nuclear emission amounts
to 18% of the nuclear flux in the Fe line region, but becomes comparable to the nuclear emission above
30 keV. The new analysis no longer supports a prominent transmitted AGN component in the observed
band. We find that the nuclear spectrum is consistent with Compton-scattering by an optically-thick
torus, where the intrinsic spectrum is a powerlaw of photon index $\Gamma = 2.2-2.4$, the torus has
an equatorial column density of $N_{\rm H} = (6-10)\times10^{24}$cm$^{-2}$ and the intrinsic
AGN $2-10$ keV luminosity is $(2.3-5.1)\times 10^{42}$ erg/s. These values place Circinus along
the same relations as unobscured AGN in accretion rate-vs-$\Gamma$ and $L_X$-vs-$L_{IR}$ phase
space. NuSTAR's high sensitivity and low background allow us to study the short time-scale variability
of Circinus at X-ray energies above 10 keV for the first time. The lack of detected variability favors
a Compton-thick absorber, in line with the the spectral fitting results.
