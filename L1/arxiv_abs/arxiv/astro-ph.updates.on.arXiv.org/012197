We present an exploration of the expected detection of the earliest Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN)
in the Universe from state-of-art galaxy formation and evolution semi-analytic models and hydro-dynamical
simulations. We estimate the number and radiative characteristics of Super Massive Black Holes
(SMBHs) at $z\geq 6$, a redshift range that will be intensively explored by the next generation of
telescopes, in particular in the radio through the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) and at high energies
with ESA's Athena X-ray Observatory. We find that Athena will be able to observe over 5000 AGN/$\rm
deg^2$ at the Epoch of Re-ionization (EoR), $6\leq z \leq 10$. Similarly, for the same redshift range
the models/simulations suggest that SKA will detect at least 400 AGN/$\rm deg^2$. Additionally,
we stress the importance of the volume of the simulation box as well as the initial physical conditions
of the models/simulations on their effect on the luminosity functions (LFs) and the creation of
the most massive SMBHs that we currently observe at the EoR. Furthermore, following the evolution
of the accretion mode of the SMBHs in each model/simulation, we show that, while the quasar dominates
over the radio mode at the EoR, detection at radio wavelengths still reaches significant numbers
even at the highest redshifts. Finally, we present the effect that the radiative efficiency has
on the LFs by comparing results produced with a constant value for the radiative efficiency and more
complex calculations based on the spin of each SMBH.
