Recent theory predicts that a first star is born with a massive initial mass of $\gtrsim$ 100 $M_\odot$.
Pair instability supernova (PISN) is a common fate for such a massive star. Our final goal is to prove
the existence of PISN and thus the high mass nature of the initial mass function in the early universe
by conducting {\it abundance profiling}, in which properties of a hypothetical first star is constrained
by metal-poor star abundances. In order to determine reliable and useful abundances, we investigate
the PISN nucleosynthesis taking both rotating and non-rotating progenitors for the first time.
We show that the initial and CO core mass ranges for PISNe depend on the envelope structures: non-magnetic
rotating models developing inflated envelopes have a lower-shifted CO mass range of $\sim$ 70--125
$M_\odot$, while non-rotating and magnetic rotating models with deflated envelopes have a range
of $\sim$ 80--135 $M_\odot$. However, we find no significant difference in explosive yields from
rotating and non-rotating progenitors, except for large nitrogen production in non-magnetic
rotating models. Furthermore, we conduct the first systematic comparison between theoretical
yields and a large sample of metal-poor star abundances. We find that the predicted low [Na/Mg] $\sim$
$-1.5$ and high [Ca/Mg] $\sim$ $0.5$--$1.3$ abundance ratios are the most important to discriminate
PISN signatures from normal metal-poor star abundances, and confirm that no currently observed
metal-poor star matches with the PISN abundance. Extensive discussion on the non-detection is
finally made.
