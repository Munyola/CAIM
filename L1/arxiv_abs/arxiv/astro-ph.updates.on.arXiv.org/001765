The Grism Lens-Amplified Survey from Space (GLASS) is a Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Large Program,
which will obtain 140 orbits of grism spectroscopy of the core and infall regions of 10 galaxy clusters,
selected to be among the very best cosmic telescopes. Extensive HST imaging is available from many
sources including the CLASH and Frontier Field programs. We introduce the survey by analyzing spectra
of faint multiply-imaged galaxies and $z\gtrsim6$ galaxy candidates obtained from the first seven
orbits targeting the core of the Frontier Field cluster MACS0717.5+3745. Using the G102 and G141
grisms to cover the wavelength range 0.8-1.7$\mu$m, we confirm 4 strongly lensed systems by detecting
emission lines in each of the images. For the 9 $z\gtrsim6$ galaxy candidates clear from contamination,
we do not detect any emission line down to a 1-$\sigma$ noise level of $\sim$5$\times$10$^{-18}$
erg/s/cm$^2$. Taking lensing magnification into account, our flux sensitivity reaches $\sim$0.2-5$\times$10$^{-18}$
erg/s/cm$^2$. These limits over an uninterrupted wavelength range rule out the possibility that
the high-$z$ galaxy candidates are instead strong line emitters at lower redshift. These results
show that by means of careful modeling of the background - and with the assistance of lensing magnification
- interesting flux limits can be reached for large numbers of objects, avoiding pre-selection and
the wavelength restrictions inherent to ground-based multi-slit spectroscopy. These observations
confirm the power of slitless HST spectroscopy even in fields as crowded as a cluster core.
