Recently an unidentified emission line at 3.55 keV has been detected in X-ray spectra of clusters
of galaxies. The line has been discussed as a possible decay signature of 7.1 keV sterile neutrinos,
which have been proposed as a dark matter (DM) candidate. We aim to further constrain the line strength
and its implied mixing angle under the assumption that all DM is made of sterile neutrinos. The X-ray
observations of the Limiting Window (LW) towards the Galactic bulge (GB) offer a unique dataset
for exploring DM lines. We characterize the systematic uncertainties of the observation and the
fitted models with simulated X-ray spectra. In addition we discuss uncertainties of indirect DM
column density constraints towards the GB to understand systematic uncertainties in the assumed
DM mass in the field of view of the observation. We found tight constraints on the allowed flux for
an additional line at 3.55 keV with a positive ($\mathrm{\sim1.5\sigma}$) best fit value $\mathrm{F_X^{3.55keV}\approx(4.5\pm3.5)\times10^{-7}~cts~cm^{-2}~s^{-1}}$.
This would translate into a mixing angle of $\mathrm{sin^{2}(2\Theta)\approx(2.3\pm1.8)\times10^{-11}}$
which, while consistent with some recent results, is in tension with earlier detections. We used
a very deep dataset with well understood systematics to derive tight constraints on the mixing angle
of a 7.1 keV sterile neutrino DM. The results highlight that the inner Milky Way will be a good target
for DM searches with upcoming missions like eROSITA, XRISM, and ATHENA.
