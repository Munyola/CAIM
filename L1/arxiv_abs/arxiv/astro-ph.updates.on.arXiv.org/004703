We conduct a linear stability calculation of an ideal Keplerian flow on which a sinusoidal zonal
flow is imposed. The analysis uses the shearing sheet model and is carried out both in isothermal
and adiabatic conditions, with and without self-gravity (SG). In the non-SG regime a structure
in the potential vorticity (PV) leads to a non-axisymmetric Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) instability;
in the short-wavelength limit its growth rate agrees with the incompressible calculation by Lithwick
(2007), which only considers perturbations elongated in the streamwise direction. The instability's
strength is analysed as a function of the structure's properties, and zonal flows are found to be
stable if their wavelength is $\gtrsim 8H$, where $H$ is the disc's scale height, regardless of the
value of the adiabatic index $\gamma$. The non-axisymmetric KH instability can operate in Rayleigh-stable
conditions, and it therefore represents the limiting factor to the structure's properties. Introducing
SG triggers a second non-axisymmetric instability, which is found to be located around a PV maximum,
while the KH instability is linked to a PV minimum, as expected. In the adiabatic regime, the same
gravitational instability is detected even when the structure is present only in the entropy (not
in the PV) and the instability spreads to weaker SG conditions as the entropy structure's amplitude
is increased. This eventually yields a non-axisymmetric instability in the non-SG regime, albeit
of weak strength, localised around an entropy maximum.
