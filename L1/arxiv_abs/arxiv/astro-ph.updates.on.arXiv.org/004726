We propose a mechanism of state transition in wind-fed black hole binaries (high-mass X-ray binaries)
such as Cyg X-1 and LMC X-1. Modeling a line-driven stellar wind from the companion by two-dimensional
hydrodynamical calculations, we investigate the processes of wind capture by and accretion onto
the black hole. We assume that the wind acceleration is terminated at the He II ionization front because
ions responsible for line-driven acceleration are ionized within the front, i.e. He III region.
It is found that the mass accretion rate inferred from the luminosity is remarkably smaller than
the capture rate. Considering the difference, we construct a model for the state transition based
on the accretion flow being controlled by magneto-rotational instability. The outer flow is torus
like, and plays an important role to trigger the transition. The model can explain why state transition
does occur in Cyg X-1, while not in LMC X-1. Cyg X-1 exhibits a relatively low luminosity, and then
the He II ionization front is located and can move between the companion and black hole, depending
on its ionizing photon flux. On the other hand, LMC X-1 exhibits too high luminosity for the front
to move considerably; the front is too close to the companion atmosphere. The model also predicts
that each state of high-soft or low-hard would last fairly long because the luminosity depends weakly
on the wind velocity. In the context of the model, the state transition is triggered by a fluctuation
of the magnetic field when its amplitude becomes comparable to the field strength in the torus-like
outer flow.
