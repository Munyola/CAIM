The electromagnetic signature of a point explosion near a Kerr black hole (BH) is evaluated. The
first repetitions produced by gravitational lensing are not periodic in time; periodicity emerges
only as the result of multiple circuits of the prograde and retrograde light rings, and is accompanied
by exponential dimming. Gravitational focusing creates a sequence of concentrated caustic features,
and biases the detection of such a system toward alignment of the BH spin with the plane of the sky.
We consider the polarization pattern in the case of emission by the Lorentz upboosting and reflection
of a magnetic field near the explosion site. Then the polarized fraction of the detected pulse approaches
unity, and rays propagating near the equatorial plane maintain a consistent polarization direction.
Near a slowly accreting, supermassive BH (SMBH) additional repetitions are caused by reflection
off annular fragments of an orbiting disk that has passed through an ionization instability. These
results are applied to the repeating fast radio burst source 121102, giving a concrete and predictive
example of how FRB detectability may be biased by lensing. A gravitational lensing delay of 10-30
s, and reflection delay up to $\sim 10^4$ s, are found for emission near the ISCO of a $3\times 10^5\,M_\odot$
SMBH; these effects combine to produce interesting correlations between delay time and burst fluence.
A similar repetitive pulse envelope could be seen in the gravitational wave signal produced by a
collision between compact stars near a SMBH.
