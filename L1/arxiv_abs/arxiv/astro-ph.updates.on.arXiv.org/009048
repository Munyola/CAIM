We present the first results from a detailed analysis of a new, long ($\sim100$ ks) XMM-Newton observation
of the narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxy PG 1404$+$226 which showed a large-amplitude, rapid X-ray variability
by a factor of $\sim7$ in $\sim10$ ks with an exponential rise and a sharp fall in the count rate. We
investigate the origin of the soft X-ray excess emission and rapid X-ray variability in the source
through time-resolved spectroscopy and fractional root-mean-squared (rms) spectral modeling.
The strong soft X-ray excess below 1 keV observed both in the time-averaged and time-resolved spectra
is described by the intrinsic disk Comptonization model as well as the relativistic reflection
model where the emission is intensive merely in the inner regions ($r_{\rm in}<1.7 r_{\rm g}$) of
an ionized accretion disk. We detected no significant UV variability while the soft X-ray excess
flux varies together with the primary power-law emission (as $F_{{\rm primary}}\propto F_{{\rm
excess}}^{1.54}$), although with a smaller amplitude, as expected in the reflection scenario.
The observed X-ray fractional rms spectrum is approximately constant with a drop at $\sim0.6$ keV
and is described by a non-variable emission line component with the observed energy of $\sim0.6$
keV and two variable spectral components: a more variable primary power-law emission and a less
variable soft excess emission. Our results suggest the `lamppost geometry' for the primary X-ray
emitting hot corona which illuminates the innermost accretion disk due to strong gravity and gives
rise to the soft X-ray excess emission.
