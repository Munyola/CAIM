The nature of the $\gamma$-ray emission from the \emph{Fermi} bubbles is unknown. Both hadronic
and leptonic models have been formulated to explain the peculiar $\gamma$-ray signal observed
by the Fermi-LAT between 0.1-500~GeV. If this emission continues above $\sim$30~TeV, hadronic
models of the \emph{Fermi} bubbles would provide a significant contribution to the high-energy
neutrino flux detected by the IceCube observatory. Even in models where leptonic $\gamma$-rays
produce the \emph{Fermi} bubbles flux at GeV energies, a hadronic component may be observable at
very high energies. The combination of IceCube and HAWC measurements have the ability to distinguish
these scenarios through a comparison of the neutrino and $\gamma$-ray fluxes at a similar energy
scale. We examine the most recent four-year dataset produced by the IceCube collaboration and find
no evidence for neutrino emission originating from the \emph{Fermi} bubbles. In particular, we
find that previously suggested excesses are consistent with the diffuse astrophysical background
with a p-value of 0.22 (0.05 in an extreme scenario that all the IceCube events that overlap with the
bubbles come from them). Moreover, we show that existing and upcoming HAWC observations provide
independent constraints on any neutrino emission from the \emph{Fermi} bubbles, due to the close
correlation between the $\gamma$-ray and neutrino fluxes in hadronic interactions. The combination
of these results disfavors a significant contribution from the \emph{Fermi} bubbles to the IceCube
neutrino flux.
