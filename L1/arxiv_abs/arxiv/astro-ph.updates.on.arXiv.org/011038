We consider the effects of radio-wave scattering by cool ionized clumps ($T\sim 10^4\,$K) in circumgalactic
media (CGM). The existence of such clumps are inferred from intervening quasar absorption systems,
but have long been something of a theoretical mystery. We consider the implications for compact
radio sources of the `fog-like' two-phase model of the circumgalactic medium recently proposed
by McCourt et al.(2018). In this model, the CGM consists of a diffuse coronal gas ($T\gtrsim 10^6\,$K)
in pressure equilibrium with numerous $\lesssim 1\,$pc scale cool clumps or `cloudlets' formed
by shattering in a cooling instability. The areal filling factor of the cloudlets is expected to
exceed unity in $\gtrsim 10^{11.5} M_\odot$ haloes, and the ensuing radio-wave scattering is akin
to that caused by turbulence in the Galactic warm ionized medium (WIM). If $30\,$per-cent of cosmic
baryons are in the CGM, we show that for a cool-gas volume fraction of $f_{\rm v}\sim 10^{-3}$, sources
at $z_{\rm s}\sim 1$ suffer angular broadening by $\sim 15\,\mu$as and temporal broadening by $\sim
1\,$ms at $\lambda = 30\,$cm, due to scattering by the clumps in intervening CGM. The former prediction
will be difficult to test (the angular broadening will suppress Galactic scintillation only for
$<10\,\mu$Jy compact synchrotron sources). However the latter prediction, of temporal broadening
of localized fast radio bursts, can constrain the size and mass fraction of cool ionized gas clumps
as function of halo mass and redshift, and thus provides a test of the model proposed by McCourt et
al.(2018).
