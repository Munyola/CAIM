We propose a physical mechanism to explain giant flares and radio afterglows in terms of a magnetospheric
model containing both a helically twisted flux rope and a current sheet (CS). With the appearance
of CS, we solve a mixed boundary value problem to get the magnetospheric field based on a domain decomposition
method. We investigate properties of the equilibrium curve of the flux rope when the CS is present
in background multipolar fields. In response to the variations at the magnetar surface, it quasi-statically
evolves in stable equilibrium states. The loss of equilibrium occurs at a critical point and, beyond
that point, it erupts catastrophically. New features show up when the CS is considered. Especially,
we find two kinds of physical behaviors, i.e., catastrophic state transition and catastrophic
escape. Magnetic energy would be released during state transitions. The released magnetic energy
is sufficient to drive giant flares. The flux rope would go away from the magnetar quasi-statically,
which is inconsistent with the radio afterglow. Fortunately, in the latter case, i.e., the catastrophic
escape, the flux rope could escape the magnetar and go to infinity in a dynamical way. This is more
consistent with radio afterglow observations of giant flares. We find that the minor radius of flux
rope has important implications for its eruption. Flux ropes with larger minor radius are more prone
to erupt. We stress that the CS provides an ideal place for magnetic reconnection, which would further
enhance the energy release during eruptions.
