In this work we present a set of synthetic observations that mimic the properties of the Integral
Field Spectroscopy (IFS) survey CALIFA, generated using radiative transfer techniques applied
to hydrodynamical simulations of galaxies in a cosmological context. The simulated spatially-resolved
spectra include stellar and nebular emission, kinematic broadening of the lines, and dust extinction
and scattering. The results of the radiative transfer simulations have been post-processed to
reproduce the main properties of the CALIFA V500 and V1200 observational setups. The data has been
further formatted to mimic the CALIFA survey in terms of field of view size, spectral range and sampling.
We have included the effect of the spatial and spectral Point Spread Functions affecting CALIFA
observations, and added detector noise after characterizing it on a sample of 20 galaxies. The simulated
datacubes are suited to be analyzed by the same algorithms used on real IFS data. In order to provide
a benchmark to compare the results obtained applying IFS observational techniques to our synthetic
datacubes, and test the calibration and accuracy of the analysis tools, we have computed the spatially-resolved
properties of the simulations. Hence, we provide maps derived directly from the hydrodynamical
snapshots or the noiseless spectra, in a way that is consistent with the values recovered by the observational
analysis algorithms. Both the synthetic observations and the product datacubes are public and
