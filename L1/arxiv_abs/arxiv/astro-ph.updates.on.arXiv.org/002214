Modal noise in optical fibers imposes limits on the signal to noise and velocity precision achievable
with the next generation of astronomical spectrographs. This is an increasingly pressing problem
for precision radial velocity (RV) spectrographs in the near-infrared (NIR) and optical that require
both high stability of the observed line profiles and high signal to noise. Many of these spectrographs
plan to use highly coherent emission line calibration sources like laser frequency combs and Fabry-Perot
etalons to achieve precision sufficient to detect terrestrial mass planets. These high precision
calibration sources often use single mode fibers or highly coherent sources. Coupling light from
single mode fibers to multi-mode fibers leads to only a very low number of modes being excited, thereby
exacerbating the modal noise measured by the spectrograph. We present a commercial off-the-shelf
(COTS) solution that significantly mitigates modal noise at all optical and NIR wavelengths, and
which can be applied to spectrograph calibration systems. Our solution uses an integrating sphere
in conjunction with a diffuser that is moved rapidly using electrostrictive polymers, and is generally
superior to most tested forms of mechanical fiber agitation. We demonstrate a high level of modal
noise reduction with a narrow bandwidth 1550 nm laser. Our relatively inexpensive solution immediately
enables spectrographs to take advantage of the innate precision of bright state-of-the art calibration
sources by removing a major source of systematic noise.
