In support of the Astrobiology Science Strategy, this whitepaper outlines some key technology
challenges pertaining to the remote search for life in exoplanetary systems. Finding evidence
for life on rocky planets outside of our solar system requires new technical capabilities for the
key measurements of spectral signatures of biosignature gases, and of planetary mass measurement.
Spectra of Earth-like planets can be directly measured in reflected stellar light in the visible
band or near-infrared using a factor 1e-10 starlight suppression with occulters, either internal
(coronagraph) or external (starshade). Absorption and emission (reflected and thermal) spectra
can be obtained in the mid-infrared of rocky planets transiting M-dwarfs via spectroscopy of the
transit and secondary eclipse, respectively. Mass can be measured from the star's reflex motion,
the reflex motion of a star, via either precision radial velocity methods or astrometry. Several
technology gaps must be closed to provide astronomers the necessary capabilities to obtain these
key measurements for small planets orbiting within the predicted temperate zones around nearby
stars. These involved performance improvements, in some cases, 1-2 orders of magnitude from state-of-the-art
or involve performances never demonstrated. The technologies advancing to close these gaps have
been identified through the NASA Exoplanet Exploration Program's annual Technology Selection
and Prioritization Process in collaboration with the larger exoplanet science and technology
