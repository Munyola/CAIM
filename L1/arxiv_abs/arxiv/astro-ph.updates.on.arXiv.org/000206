Galaxy clusters are the most massive objects in the universe, and they comprise a high temperature
intracluster medium of about $10^7$K, believed to offer a main foreground effect for the CMB data
with thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect. This assumption has been confirmed with SZ signal
detection in hundreds of clusters, but comparing with the huge numbers of clusters within optical
selected samples from SDSS data, this only accounts for a few percent. Here we introduce a model-independent
new method to confirm this assumption that most galaxy clusters can offer the thermal SZ signal as
their main foreground effect. For the WMAP 7year data (and a given galaxy cluster sample), we introduce
a parameter $d_1$ as each pixel's nearest neighbor cluster's angular distance, then we classified
data pixels as "to be"($d_1 \rightarrow 0$ case) or "not to be"($d_1$ large enough) affected by the
sample clusters. By comparing the statistical results of these two kinds of pixels, we can see how
the sample clusters affect the CMB data directly. We find that Planck-ESZ sample and the Xray samples($\sim10^2$
clusters) can lead to obvious temperature depression in WMAP 7year data, this confirms the SZ effect
prediction. However, each optical selected sample ($> 10^4$ clusters), shows an opposite result:
the mean temperature rises to about 10 uK. The unexpected qualitative scenario implies that the
main foreground effect of most clusters is NOT always the expected SZ effect. This is maybe the reason
why the SZ signal detection result is lower than what is expected by the model.
