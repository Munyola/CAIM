We used data from the INTErnational Gamma-Ray Astrophysics Laboratory (INTEGRAL) to set upper-limits
on the ${\gamma}$-ray and hard X-ray prompt emission associated with the gravitational wave event
GW170104, discovered by the LIGO/Virgo collaboration. The unique omni-directional viewing capability
of the instruments on-board INTEGRAL allowed us to examine the full 90% confidence level localization
region of the LIGO trigger. Depending on the particular spectral model assumed and the specific
position within this region, the upper limits inferred from the INTEGRAL observations range from
F${\gamma}$=1.9x10-7 erg cm-2 to F${\gamma}$=10-6 erg cm-2 (75 keV - 2 MeV energy range). This translates
into a ratio between the prompt energy released in ${\gamma}$-rays along the direction to the observer
and the gravitational wave energy of E${\gamma}$/EGW <2.6x10-5 . Using the INTEGRAL results, we
can not confirm the ${\gamma}$-ray proposed counterpart to GW170104 by the AGILE team with the MCAL
instrument. The reported flux of the AGILE/MCAL event, E2, is not compatible with the INTEGRAL upper
limits within most of the 90% LIGO localization region. There is only a relatively limited portion
of the sky where the sensitivity of the INTEGRAL instruments was not optimal and the lowest allowed
fluence estimated for E2 would still be compatible with the INTEGRAL results. This region was also
observed independently by Fermi/GBM and AstroSAT, from which, as far as we are aware, there are no
reports of any significant detection of a prompt high-energy event.
