ALMA is providing us essential information on where certain molecules form. Observing where these
molecules emission arises from, the physical conditions of the gas, and how this relates with the
presence of other species allows us to understand the formation of many species, and to significantly
improve our knowledge of the chemistry that occurs in the space. We studied the molecular distribution
of NaCN around IRC +10216, a molecule detected previously, but whose origin is not clear. High angular
resolution maps allow us to model the abundance distribution of this molecule and check suggested
formation paths. We modeled the emission of NaCN assuming local thermal equilibrium (LTE) conditions.
These profiles were fitted to azimuthal averaged intensity profiles to obtain an abundance distribution
of NaCN. We found that the presence of NaCN seems compatible with the presence of CN, probably as a
result of the photodissociation of HCN, in the inner layers of the ejecta of IRC +10216. However,
similar as for CH 3 CN, current photochemical models fail to reproduce this CN reservoir. We also
found that the abundance peak of NaCN appears at a radius of 3 x 10 15 cm, approximately where the abundance
of NaCl, suggested to be the parent species, starts to decay. However, the abundance ratio shows
that the NaCl abundance is lower than that obtained for NaCN. We expect that the LTE assumption might
result in NaCN abundances higher than the real ones. Updated photochemical models, collisional
rates, and reaction rates are essential to determine the possible paths of the NaCN formation.
