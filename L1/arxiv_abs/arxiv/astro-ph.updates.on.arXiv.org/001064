We have observed the Galactic Center (GC) region at 0.154 and 0.255 GHz with the GMRT. A total of 62
compact likely extragalactic sources are detected. Their scattering sizes go down linearly with
increasing angular distance from the GC up to about 1 deg. The apparent scattering sizes of sources
are more than an order of magnitude down than predicted earlier by the NE2001 model of Galactic electron
distribution within 359.5 deg < l < 0.5 deg and -0.5 deg <b <0.5 deg (Hyperstrong scattering
region) of the Galaxy. High free-free optical depths are observed towards most of the extended nonthermal
sources within 0.6 deg from the GC. Significant variation of optical depth indicate the absorbing
medium is patchy at an angular scale of 10' and electron density is ~10 per cc that matches with the
NE2001 model. This model predicts the extragalactic (EG) sources to be resolved out from 1.4 GHz
interferometric surveys. However, 8 likely EG sources out of 10 expected in the region are present
in 1.4 GHz catalog. Ionized interfaces of dense molecular clouds to the ambient medium are most likely
responsible for strong scattering and low radio frequency absorption. However, dense GC clouds
traced by CS $J=1-0$ emission are found to have a narrow distribution of ~0.2 deg across the Galactic
plane. Angular distribution of most of the EG sources seen through the so called Hyperstrong scattering
region are random in $b$, and typically ~7 out of 10 sources will not be seen through to the dense molecular
clouds, and it explains why most of them are not scatter broadened at 1.4 GHz.
