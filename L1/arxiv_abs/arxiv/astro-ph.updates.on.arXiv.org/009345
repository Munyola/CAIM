Kiloparsec-scale dual active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are active supermassive black hole pairs
co-rotating in galaxies with separations of less than a few kpc. Expected to be a generic outcome
of hierarchical galaxy formation, their frequency and demographics remain uncertain. We have
carried out an imaging survey with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) of
AGNs with double-peaked narrow [O III] emission lines. HST/WFC3 offers high image quality in the
near-infrared (NIR) to resolve the two stellar nuclei, and in the optical to resolve [O III] from
ionized gas in the narrow-line regions. This combination has proven to be key in sorting out alternative
scenarios. With HST/WFC3 we are able to explore a new population of close dual AGNs at more advanced
merger stages than can be probed from the ground. Here we show that the AGN SDSS J0924+0510, which
had previously shown two stellar bulges, contains two spatially distinct [O III] regions consistent
with a dual AGN. While we cannot completely exclude cross-ionization from a single central engine,
the nearly equal ratios of [O III] strongly suggest a dual AGN with a projected angular separation
of 0."4, corresponding to a projected physical separation of $r_p$ = 1 kpc at redshift z = 0.1495.
This serves as a proof of principle for combining high-resolution NIR and optical imaging to identify
close dual AGNs. Our result suggests that studies based on low-resolution and/or low-sensitivity
observations may miss close dual AGNs and thereby may underestimate their occurrence rate on $\lesssim$
kpc scales.
