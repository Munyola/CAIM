An HI mass function (HIMF) was derived for 751 galaxies selected from the deep Parkes HI survey across
the Zone of Avoidance (HIZOA). HIZOA contains both the Great Attractor Wall and the Local Void, two
of the most extreme environments in the local Universe, making the sample eminently suitable to
explore the overall HIMF as well as its dependence on local environment. To avoid any selection bias
because of the different distances of these large-scale structures, we first used the two-dimensional
stepwise maximum-likelihood method for the definition of an average HIMF. The resulting parameters
of a Schechter-type HIMF for the whole sample are $\alpha = -1.33\pm0.05$, $\log(M_{\rm HI}^*/M_{\odot})=9.93\pm0.04$,
and $\phi^* = (3.9\pm0.6)\times 10^{-3}$ Mpc$^{-3}$. We then used the $k$-th nearest-neighbour
method to subdivide the sample into four environments of decreasing local density and derived the
Schechter parameters for each subsample. A strong trend is observed, for the slope $\alpha$ of the
low-mass end of the HIMF. The slope changes from being nearly flat, i.e. $\alpha = -0.99\pm0.19$
for galaxies residing in the densest bin, to the steep value of $\alpha = -1.31\pm0.10$ in the lowest
density bin. The characteristic mass, however, does not show a clear trend between the highest and
lowest density bins. We find similar trends in the low-mass slope when we compare the results for
a region dominated by the Great Attractor, and the Local Void, which are found to be over-, respectively
underdense by 1.35 and 0.59 compared to the whole sample.
