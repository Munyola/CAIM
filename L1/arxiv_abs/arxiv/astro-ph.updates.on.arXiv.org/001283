We report a 4.8 sigma detection of water absorption features in the day side spectrum of the hot Jupiter
HD 189733 b. We used high-resolution (R~100,000) spectra taken at 3.2 microns with CRIRES on the
VLT to trace the radial-velocity shift of the water features in the planet's day side atmosphere
during 5 h of its 2.2 d orbit as it approached secondary eclipse. Despite considerable telluric contamination
in this wavelength regime, we detect the signal within our uncertainties at the expected combination
of systemic velocity (Vsys=-3 +5-6 km/s) and planet orbital velocity (Kp=154 +14-10 km/s), and
determine a H2O line contrast ratio of (1.3+/-0.2)x10^-3 with respect to the stellar continuum.
We find no evidence of significant absorption or emission from other carbon-bearing molecules,
such as methane, although we do note a marginal increase in the significance of our detection to 5.1
sigma with the inclusion of carbon dioxide in our template spectrum. This result demonstrates that
ground-based, high-resolution spectroscopy is suited to finding not just simple molecules like
CO, but also to more complex molecules like H2O even in highly telluric contaminated regions of the
Earth's transmission spectrum. It is a powerful tool that can be used for conducting an immediate
census of the carbon- and oxygen-bearing molecules in the atmospheres of giant planets, and will
potentially allow the formation and migration history of these planets to be constrained by the
measurement of their atmospheric C/O ratios.
