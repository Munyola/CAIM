A new analysis of the dataset from the Pierre Auger Observatory provides evidence for anisotropy
in the arrival directions of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays on an intermediate angular scale, which
is indicative of excess arrivals from strong, nearby sources. The data consist of 5514 events above
20 EeV with zenith angles up to 80 deg recorded before 2017 April 30. Sky models have been created for
two distinct populations of extragalactic gamma-ray emitters: active galactic nuclei from the
second catalog of hard Fermi-LAT sources (2FHL) and starburst galaxies from a sample that was examined
with Fermi-LAT. Flux-limited samples, which include all types of galaxies from the Swift-BAT and
2MASS surveys, have been investigated for comparison. The sky model of cosmic-ray density constructed
using each catalog has two free parameters, the fraction of events correlating with astrophysical
objects and an angular scale characterizing the clustering of cosmic rays around extragalactic
sources. A maximum-likelihood ratio test is used to evaluate the best values of these parameters
and to quantify the strength of each model by contrast with isotropy. It is found that the starburst
model fits the data better than the hypothesis of isotropy with a statistical significance of 4.0
sigma, the highest value of the test statistic being for energies above 39 EeV. The three alternative
models are favored against isotropy with 2.7-3.2 sigma significance. The origin of the indicated
deviation from isotropy is examined and prospects for more sensitive future studies are discussed.
