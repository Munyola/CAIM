A jet is a considerable amount of plasma being ejected from the chromosphere or lower corona into
the higher corona and is a common phenomenon. Usually, a jet is triggered by a brightening or a flare,
which provides the first driving force to push plasma upward. In this process, magnetic reconnection
is thought to be the mechanism to convert magnetic energy into thermal, nonthermal, and kinetic
energies. However, most jets could reach an unusual high altitude and end much later than the end
of its associated flare. This fact implies that there is another way to continuously transfer magnetic
energy into kinetic energy even after the reconnection. The picture described above is well known
in the community, but how and how much magnetic energy is released through a way other than reconnection
is still unclear. By studying a prominence-like jet observed by SDO/AIA and STEREO-A/EUVI, we find
that the continuous relaxation of the post-reconnection magnetic field structure is an important
process for a jet to climb up higher than it could through only reconnection. The kinetic energy of
the jet gained through the relaxation is 1.6 times that gained from the reconnection. The resultant
energy flux is hundreds of times larger than the flux required for the local coronal heating, suggesting
that such jets are a possible source to keep the corona hot. Furthermore, rotational motions appear
all the time during the jet. Our analysis suggests that torsional Alfv\'en waves induced during
reconnection could not be the only mechanism to release magnetic energy and drive jets.
