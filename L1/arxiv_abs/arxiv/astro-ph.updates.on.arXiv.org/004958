The progenitors of low-luminosity Type II-Plateau supernovae (SNe II-P) are believed to be red
supergiant (RSG) stars, but there is much disparity in the literature concerning their mass at core
collapse and therefore on the main sequence. Here, we model the SN radiation arising from the low-energy
explosion of RSG stars of 12, 25, and 27 M$_{\odot}$ on the main sequence and formed through single
star evolution. Despite the narrow range in ejecta kinetic energy (2.5$-$4.2$\times$10$^{50}$
erg) in our model set, the SN observables from our three models are significantly distinct, reflecting
the differences in progenitor structure (e.g., surface radius, H-rich envelope mass, He-core
mass). Our higher mass RSG stars give rise to Type II SNe that tend to have bluer colors at early times,
a shorter photospheric phase, and a faster declining $V$-band light curve (LC) more typical of Type
II-linear SNe, in conflict with the LC plateau observed for low-luminosity SNe II. The complete
fallback of the CO core in the low-energy explosions of our high mass RSG stars prevents the ejection
of any ${}^{56}$Ni (nor any core O or Si), in contrast to low-luminosity SNe II-P, which eject at least
0.001 M$_{\odot}$ of ${}^{56}$Ni. In contrast to observations, type II SN models from higher mass
RSGs tend to show an H$\alpha$ absorption that remains broad at late times (due to a larger velocity
at the base of the H-rich envelope). In agreement with the analyses of pre-explosion photometry,
we conclude that low-luminosity SNe II-P likely arise from low-mass rather than high-mass RSG stars.
