The Great Andromeda Galaxy (M31) is the nexus of the near-far galaxy evolution connection and a principal
data point for near-field cosmology. Due to its proximity (780 kpc), M31 can be resolved into individual
stars like the Milky Way (MW). Unlike the MW, we have the advantage of a global view of M31, enabling
M31 to be observed with techniques that also apply to more distant galaxies. Moreover, recent evidence
suggests that M31 may have survived a major merger within the last several Gyr, shaping the morphology
of its stellar halo and triggering a starburst, while leaving the stellar disk largely intact. The
MW and M31 thus provide complementary opportunities for in-depth studies of the disks, halos, and
satellites of L* galaxies. Our understanding of the M31 system will be transformed in the 2020s if
they include wide field facilities for both photometry (HST-like sensitivity and resolution)
and spectroscopy (10-m class telescope, >1 sq. deg. field, highly multiplexed, R~ 3000 to 6000).
We focus here on the power of these facilities to constrain the past, present, and future merger history
of M31, via chemo-dynamical analyses and star formation histories of phase-mixed stars accreted
at early times, as well as stars in surviving tidal debris features, M31's extended disk, and intact
satellite galaxies that will eventually be tidally incorporated into the halo. This will yield
an unprecedented view of the hierarchical formation of the M31 system and the subhalos that built
it into the L* galaxy we observe today.
