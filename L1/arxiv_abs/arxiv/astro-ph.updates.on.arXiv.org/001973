We explore the regular or chaotic nature of orbits moving in the meridional plane of an axially symmetric
galactic gravitational model with a disk, a dense spherical nucleus and some additional perturbing
terms corresponding to influence from nearby galaxies. In order to obtain this we use the Smaller
ALingment Index (SALI) technique integrating extensive samples of orbits. Of particular interest
is the study of distant, remote stars moving in large galactocentric orbits. Our extensive numerical
experiments indicate that the majority of the distant stars perform chaotic orbits. However, there
are also distant stars displaying regular motion as well. Most distant stars are ejected into the
galactic halo on approaching the dense and massive nucleus. We study the influence of some important
parameters of the dynamical system, such as the mass of the nucleus and the angular momentum, by computing
in each case the percentage of regular and chaotic orbits. A second order polynomial relationship
connects the mass of the nucleus and the critical angular momentum of the distant star. Some heuristic
semi-theoretical arguments to explain and justify the numerically derived outcomes are also given.
Our numerical calculations suggest that the majority of distant stars spend their orbital time
in the halo where it is easy to be observed. We present evidence that the main cause for driving stars
to distant orbits is the presence of the dense nucleus combined with the perturbation caused by nearby
galaxies. The origin of young O and B stars observed in the halo is also discussed.
