We present optical and near-IR Integral Field Unit (IFU) and ALMA band 6 observations of the nearby
dual Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) Mrk 463. At a distance of 210 Mpc, and a nuclear separation of $\sim$4
kpc, Mrk 463 is an excellent laboratory to study the gas dynamics, star formation processes and supermassive
black hole (SMBH) accretion in a late-stage gas-rich major galaxy merger. The IFU observations
reveal a complex morphology, including tidal tails, star-forming clumps, and emission line regions.
The optical data, which map the full extent of the merger, show evidence for a biconical outflow and
material outflowing at $>$600 km s$^{-1}$, both associated with the Mrk 463E nucleus, together
with large scale gradients likely related to the ongoing galaxy merger. We further find an emission
line region $\sim$11 kpc south of Mrk 463E that is consistent with being photoionized by an AGN. Compared
to the current AGN luminosity, the energy budget of the cloud implies a luminosity drop in Mrk 463E
by a factor 3-20 over the last 40,000 years. The ALMA observations of $^{12}$CO(2-1) and adjacent
1mm continuum reveal the presence of $\sim$10$^{9}$M$_\odot$ in molecular gas in the system. The
molecular gas shows velocity gradients of $\sim$800 km/s and $\sim$400 km/s around the Mrk 463E
and 463W nuclei, respectively. We conclude that in this system the infall of $\sim$100s $M_\odot$/yr
of molecular gas is in rough balance with the removal of ionized gas by a biconical outflow being fueled
by a relatively small, $<$0.01% of accretion onto each SMBH.
