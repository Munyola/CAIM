We use Murchison Widefield Array observations of interplanetary scintillation (IPS) to determine
the source counts of point ($<$0.3 arcsecond extent) sources and of all sources with some subarcsecond
structure, at 162 MHz. We have developed the methodology to derive these counts directly from the
IPS observables, while taking into account changes in sensitivity across the survey area. The counts
of sources with compact structure follow the behaviour of the dominant source population above
$\sim$3 Jy but below this they show Euclidean behaviour. We compare our counts to those predicted
by simulations and find a good agreement for our counts of sources with compact structure, but significant
disagreement for point source counts. Using low radio frequency SEDs from the GLEAM survey, we classify
point sources as Compact Steep-Spectrum (CSS), flat spectrum, or peaked. If we consider the CSS
sources to be the more evolved counterparts of the peaked sources, the two categories combined comprise
approximately 80% of the point source population. We calculate densities of potential calibrators
brighter than 0.4 Jy at low frequencies and find 0.2 sources per square degrees for point sources,
rising to 0.7 sources per square degree if sources with more complex arcsecond structure are included.
We extrapolate to estimate 4.6 sources per square degrees at 0.04 Jy. We find that a peaked spectrum
is an excellent predictor for compactness at low frequencies, increasing the number of good calibrators
by a factor of three compared to the usual flat spectrum criterion.
