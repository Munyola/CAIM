In the past five years, the number of known double neutron stars (DNS) in the Milky Way has roughly
doubled. We argue that the observed sample can be split into three distinct sub-populations based
on their orbital characteristics: (i) short-period, low-eccentricity binaries; (ii) wide binaries;
and (iii) short-period, high-eccentricity binaries. These sub-populations also exhibit distinct
spin period and spindown rate properties. We focus on sub-population (iii), which contains the
Hulse-Taylor binary. Contrary to previous analysis, we demonstrate that, if they are the product
of primordial binary evolution, the $P_{\rm orb}$ and $e$ distribution of these systems requires
that the second-born NSs must have been formed with small natal kicks ($\lesssim$25 km s$^{-1}$)
and have pre-SN masses narrowly distributed around 3.2 M$_{\odot}$. These constraints challenge
binary evolution theory and further predict closely aligned spin and orbital axes, inconsistent
with the Hulse-Taylor binary's measured spin-orbit misalignment angle of $\approx$20$^{\circ}$.
Motivated by the similarity of these DNSs to B2127+11C, a DNS residing in the globular cluster M15,
we argue that this sub-population is consistent with being formed in, and then ejected from, globular
clusters. This scenario provides a pathway for the formation and merger of DNSs in stellar environments
without recent star formation, as observed in the host galaxy population of short gamma ray bursts
and the recent detection by LIGO of a merging DNS in an old stellar population.
