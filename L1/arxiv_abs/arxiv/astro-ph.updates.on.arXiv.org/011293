We present the full public release of all data from the TNG100 and TNG300 simulations of the IllustrisTNG
project. IllustrisTNG is a suite of large volume, cosmological, gravo-magnetohydrodynamical
simulations run with the moving-mesh code Arepo. TNG includes a comprehensive model for galaxy
formation physics, and each TNG simulation self-consistently solves for the coupled evolution
of dark matter, cosmic gas, luminous stars, and supermassive blackholes from early time to the present
day, z=0. Each of the flagship runs -- TNG50, TNG100, and TNG300 -- are accompanied by lower-resolution
and dark-matter only counterparts, and we discuss scientific and numerical cautions and caveats
relevant when using TNG. Full volume snapshots are available at 100 redshifts; halo and subhalo
catalogs at each snapshot and merger trees are also released. The data volume now directly accessible
online is ~750 TB, including 1200 full volume snapshots and ~80,000 high time-resolution subbox
snapshots. This will increase to ~1.1 PB with the future release of TNG50. Data access and analysis
examples are available in IDL, Python, and Matlab. We describe improvements and new functionality
in the web-based API, including on-demand visualization and analysis of galaxies and halos, exploratory
plotting of scaling relations and other relationships between galactic and halo properties, and
a new JupyterLab interface. This provides an online, browser-based, near-native data analysis
platform which supports user computation with fully local access to TNG data, alleviating the need
to download large simulated datasets.
