Radiation pressure (RP; or photon momentum absorbed by gas) is important in a tremendous range of
astrophysical systems. But we show the usual method for assigning absorbed photon momentum to gas
in numerical radiation-hydrodynamics simulations (simply integrating over cell volumes or evaluating
at cell/particle centers) can severely under-estimate the correct RP force around sources, unless
photon mean-free-paths are highly-resolved in the fluid grid. The existence of this error is independent
of the numerical radiation transfer (RT) method (even in exact ray-tracing/Monte-Carlo methods),
because it depends on how the RT solution is interpolated back onto fluid elements. Brute-force
convergence (resolving mean-free paths) is impossible in many cases (especially where high-opacity
UV/ionizing photons are involved). Instead, we show a 'face-integrated' method -- integrating
and applying the momentum fluxes at interfaces between fluid elements -- reproduces the correct
solution at all resolution levels. The 'fix' is simple and we provide example implementations for
ray-tracing, Monte-Carlo, and moments RT methods in both grid and mesh-free fluid schemes. We consider
an example problem of star formation in a molecular cloud with single-scattering UV/ionizing RP.
At state-of-the-art resolution, cell-integrated methods under-estimate the effects of RP by
an order of magnitude, leading (incorrectly) to the conclusion that RP is unimportant, while face-integrated
methods predict strong self-regulation of star formation and rapid cloud destruction via RP.
