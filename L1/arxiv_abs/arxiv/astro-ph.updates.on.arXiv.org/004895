Extended gaps in the debris disks of both Vega and Fomalhaut have been observed. These structures
have been attributed to tidal perturbations by multiple super-Jupiter gas giant planets. Within
the current observational limits, however, no such massive planets have been detected. Here we
propose a less stringent `lone-planet' scenario to account for the observed structure with a single
eccentric gas giant and suggest that clearing of these wide gaps is induced by its sweeping secular
resonance. During the depletion of the disk gas, the planet's secular resonance propagates inward
and clears a wide gap over an extended region of the disk. Although some residual intermediate-size
planetesimals may remain in the gap, their surface density is too low to either produce super-Earths
or lead to sufficiently frequent disruptive collisions to generate any observable dusty signatures.
The main advantage of this lone-planet sweeping-secular-resonance model over the previous multiple
gas giant tidal truncation scenario is the relaxed requirement on the number of gas giants. The observationally
inferred upper mass limit can also be satisfied provided the hypothetical planet has a significant
eccentricity. A significant fraction of solar or more massive stars bear gas giant planets with
significant eccentricities. If these planets acquired their present-day kinematic properties
prior to the depletion of their natal disks, their sweeping secular resonance would effectively
impede the retention of neighboring planets and planetesimals over a wide range of orbital semi-major
axes.
