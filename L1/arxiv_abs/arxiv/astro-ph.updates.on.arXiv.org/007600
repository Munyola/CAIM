We present a reanalysis of five transit and eight eclipse observations of the ultra-short period
super-Earth 55 Cancri e observed using the Spitzer Space Telescope during 2011-2013. We use pixel-level
decorrelation to derive accurate transit and eclipse depths from the Spitzer data, and we perform
an extensive error analysis. We focus on determining possible variability in the eclipse data,
as was reported in Demory et al. 2016a. From the transit data, we determine updated orbital parameters,
yielding T0 = 2455733.0037 $\pm$ 0.0002, P = 0.7365454 $\pm$ 0.0000003 days, i = 83.5 $\pm$ 1.3 degrees,
and $R_p$ = 1.89 $\pm$ 0.05 $R_\oplus$. Our transit results are consistent with a constant depth,
and we conclude that they are not variable. We find a significant amount of variability between the
eight eclipse observations, and confirm agreement with Demory et al. 2016a through a correlation
analysis. We convert the eclipse measurements to brightness temperatures, and generate and discuss
several heuristic models that explain the evolution of the planet's eclipse depth versus time.
The eclipses are best modeled by a year-to-year variability model, but variability on shorter timescales
cannot be ruled out. The derived range of brightness temperatures can be achieved by a dark planet
with inefficient heat redistribution intermittently covered over a large fraction of the sub-stellar
hemisphere by reflective grains, possibly indicating volcanic activity or cloud variability.
This time-variable system should be observable with future space missions, both planned (JWST)
and proposed (i.e. ARIEL).
