We carry out magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of the quasi-static evolution and eruption
of a twisted coronal flux rope under a coronal streamer built up by an imposed flux emergence at the
lower boundary. The MHD model incorporates a simple empirical coronal heating, optically thin
radiative cooling, and field aligned thermal conduction, and thus allows the formation of prominence
condensations. We find that during the quasi-static evolution, prominence/filament condensations
of an elongated, sigmoid morphology form in the dips of the significantly twisted field lines of
the emerged flux rope due to run-away radiative cooling. A prominence cavity also forms surrounding
the prominence, which is best observed above the limb with the line-of-sight nearly along the length
of the flux rope, as shown by synthetic SDO/AIA EUV images. The magnetic field supporting the prominence
is significantly non-force-free despite the low plasma-beta. By comparing with a simulation that
suppresses prominence formation, we find that the prominence weight is dynamically important
and can suppress the onset of the kink instability and hold the flux rope in equilibrium for a significantly
long time, until draining of the prominence plasma develops and lightens the prominence weight.
The flux rope eventually develops the kink instability and erupts, producing a prominence eruption.
The synthetic AIA 304 angstrom images show that the prominence is lifted up into an erupting loop,
exhibiting helical features along the loop and substantial draining along the loop legs, as often
seen in observations.
