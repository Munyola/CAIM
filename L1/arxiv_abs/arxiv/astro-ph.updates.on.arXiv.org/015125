We present a study of a sample of 223 radio-loud quasars (up to redshift $<$0.3) in order to investigate
their spectral properties. Twenty-six of these radio-loud quasars are identified as Flat Spectrum
Radio Quasars (FSRQs) and fifty-four are identified as Steep Spectrum Radio Quasars (SSRQs) based
on their radio spectral index. We study the [O III] line properties of these quasars to investigate
the origin and properties of blue wings (shift of the profile towards lower wavelengths) and blue
outliers (shift of the whole spectroscopic feature). Most of the quasars show blue wings with velocities
up to 420 km $s^{-1}$. We find that around 17\% of the quasars show outliers with velocities spanning
419 to -315 km $s^{-1}$. Finally, we revisit the $\it M_{\rm BH} - \sigma$ relation of our sample using
[S II]$\lambda$6716, 6731 and [O III] linewidths as surrogates for stellar velocity dispersions,
$\sigma$, to investigate their location on the $\it M_{\rm BH} - \sigma$ relation for quiescent
galaxies. Due to the strong blending of [S II] with $\rm H_{\alpha}$, we could estimate $\sigma_{[\rm
SII]}$ of only 123 quasars. We find that the radio-loud quasars do not show a relationship between
$\it M_{\rm BH}$ and $\sigma_{\rm [SII]/[OIII]}$ up to a redshift of 0.3, although they cluster
around the local relation. We find an overall offset of 0.12$\pm$0.05 dex of our sample of radio-loud
quasars from the $\it M_{\rm BH} - \sigma$ relation of quiescent galaxies. Quasars in our highest
redshift bin (z=0.25-0.3) show a deviation of $\sim$0.33 $\pm$ 0.06 dex with respect to the local
relation.
