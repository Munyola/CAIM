We present an analysis of the chemical abundances and kinematics of six low-mass dwarf stars, previously
claimed to be candidate hypervelocity stars (HVSs). We obtained moderate-resolution ($R\sim$
6000) spectra of these stars to estimate their abundances of several chemical elements (Mg, Si,
Ca, Ti, Cr, Fe, and Ni), and derived their space velocity components and orbital parameters using
proper motions from \gaia\ Data Release 2. All six stars are shown to be bound to the Milky Way, and
in fact are not even considered high-velocity stars with respect to the Galactic rest frame. Nevertheless,
we attempt to characterize their parent Galactic stellar components by simultaneously comparing
their abundance patterns and orbital parameters with those expected from various Galactic stellar
components. We find that two of our program stars are typical disk stars. For four of the program stars,
even though their kinematic probabilistic membership assignment suggests membership in the Galactic
disk, based on their distinct orbital properties and chemical characteristics, we cannot rule
out the exotic origins of these objects, as follows. Two stars appear to be runaway stars from the
Galactic disk. One program star has possibly been accreted from a disrupted dwarf galaxy or dynamically
heated from a birthplace in the Galactic bulge. The last object may be either a runaway disk star or
has been dynamically heated. Spectroscopic follow-up observations with higher resolution for
these curious objects will provide a better understanding of their origin.
