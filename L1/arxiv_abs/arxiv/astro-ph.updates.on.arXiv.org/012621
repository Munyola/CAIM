It has been known for 20 years that the absorbing gas in broad absorption line quasars does not completely
cover the continuum emission region, and that partial covering must be accounted for to accurately
measure the column density of the outflowing gas. However, the nature of partial covering itself
is not understood. Extrapolation of the SimBAL spectral synthesis model of the HST COS UV spectrum
from SDSS J0850+4451 reported by Leighly et al. 2018 to non-simultaneous rest-frame optical and
near-infrared spectra reveals evidence that the covering fraction has wavelength dependence,
and is a factor of 2.5 times higher in the UV than in the optical and near-infrared bands. Analysis
of the spectral energy distribution and an HST near-infrared image shows that the contribution
of the host galaxy to the near-infrared continuum is negligible. Observed absorption line variability
trends show that physical changes between observations is probably not responsible for the effect
either. The difference in covering fraction can be explained if the outflow consists of clumps that
are small and either structured or clustered relative to the projected size of the UV continuum emission
region, and have a more diffuse distribution on size scales comparable to the near-infrared continuum
emission region size. This experiment demonstrates that we can compare rest-frame UV and near-infrared
absorption lines, specifically HeI*10830 to place constraints on the uniformity of absorption
gas in broad absorbing line quasars.
