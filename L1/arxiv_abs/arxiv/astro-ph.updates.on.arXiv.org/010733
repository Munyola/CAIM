Using a Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) L-band (1-2 GHz) survey covering $\sim100$\,deg$^2$
of the Stripe 82 field, we have obtained a catalogue of 2716 radio AGN. For these AGN, we investigate
the impact of galaxy density on 1.4 GHz radio luminosity ($L_{1.4}$). We determine their close environment
densities using the surface density parameter, $\Sigma_N,$ for $N=2$ and $N=5,$ which we bin by
redshift to obtain a pseudo-3D galaxy density measure. Matching the radio AGN to sources without
radio detections in terms of redshift, $K-$band magnitude and ($g-K$)-colour index, we obtain
samples of control galaxies and determine whether radio AGN environments differ from this general
population. Our results indicate that the environmental density of radio AGN and their radio luminosity
are not correlated up to $z$ $\sim0.8$, over the luminosity range $10^{23} < (L_{1.4} / $W~Hz$^{-1})
< 10^{26}$. We also find that, when using a control sample matched in terms of redshift, $K-$band
magnitude and colour, environments of radio AGN are similar to those of the control sample but with
an excess of overdense regions in which radio AGN are more prevalent. Our results suggest that the
$<1$ Mpc-scale galaxy environment plays some role in determining whether a galaxy produces a radio
AGN. The jet power, however, does not correlate with environment. From this, we infer that secular
processes e.g. accretion flows of cold gas to the central black-hole are more critical in fuelling
radio AGN activity than radio jet power.
