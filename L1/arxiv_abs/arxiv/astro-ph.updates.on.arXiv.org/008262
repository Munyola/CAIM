We search for signatures of a distant planet around the two-million-year-old classical T-Tauri
star CI Tau hosting a hot Jupiter candidate (M_{p} sin{i} ~ 8.1 M_{Jupiter}) in an eccentric orbit
(e ~0.3). To probe the existence of an outer perturber, we reanalyzed 1.3 mm dust continuum observations
of the protoplanetary disk around CI Tau obtained by the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter
Array. We found a gap structure at ~0".8 in CI Tau's disk. Our visibility fitting assuming an axisymmetric
surface brightness profile suggested that the gap is located at a deprojected radius of 104.5+/-1.6
au and has a width of 36.9+/-2.9 au. The brightness temperature around the gap was calculated to be
~2.3 K lower than that of the ambient disk. Gap-opening mechanisms such as secular gravitational
instability and dust trapping can explain the gap morphology in the CI Tau disk. The scenario that
an unseen planet created the observed gap structure cannot be ruled out, although the coexistence
of an eccentric hot Jupiter and a distant planet around the young CI Tau would be challenging for gravitational
scattering scenarios. The mass of the planet was estimated to be between ~0.25 M_{Jupiter} and ~0.8
M_{Jupiter} from the gap width and depth (0.41 +0.04/-0.06) in the modeled surface brightness image,
which is lower than the current detection limits of high-contrast direct imaging. The young classical
T-Tauri CI Tau may be a unique system to explore the existence of a potential distant planet as well
as the origin of an eccentric hot Jupiter.
