We present a detailed study of the integrated total hydrostatic mass profiles of the five most massive
($M^{\mathrm{SZ}}_{500} > 5 \times 10^{14}$ M$_{\odot}$) galaxy clusters selected at $z\sim1$
via the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect. These objects represent an ideal laboratory to test structure
formation models where the primary driver is gravity. Optimally exploiting spatially-resolved
spectroscopic information from XMM-Newton and Chandra observations, we used both parametric
(forward, backward) and non-parametric methods to recover the mass profiles, finding that the
results are extremely robust when density and temperature measurements are both available. Our
X-ray masses at $R_{500}$ are higher than the weak lensing masses obtained from the Hubble Space
Telescope (HST), with a mean ratio of $1.39^{+0.47}_{-0.35}$. This offset goes in the opposite
direction to that expected in a scenario where the hydrostatic method yields a biased, underestimated,
mass. We investigated halo shape parameters such as sparsity and concentration, and compared to
local X-ray selected clusters, finding hints for evolution in the central regions (or for selection
effects). The total baryonic content is in agreement with the cosmic value at $R_{500}$. Comparison
with numerical simulations shows that the mass distribution and concentration are in line with
expectations. These results illustrate the power of X-ray observations to probe the statistical
properties of the gas and total mass profiles in this high-mass, high-redshift regime.
