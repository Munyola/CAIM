Since its launch in 2009, the Kepler telescope has found thousands of planets with radii between
that of Earth and Neptune. Recent studies of the distribution of these planets have revealed a rift
in the population near 1.5-2.0$R_{\bigoplus}$, informally dividing these planets into "super-Earths"
and "sub-Neptunes". The origin of this division is not well understood, largely because the majority
of planets found by Kepler orbit distant, dim stars and are not amenable to radial velocity follow-up
or transit spectroscopy, making bulk density and atmospheric measurements difficult. Here, we
present the discovery and validation of a newly found $2.03^{+0.08}_{-0.07}~R_{\bigoplus}$
planet in direct proximity to the radius gap, orbiting the bright ($J=8.32$~mag), nearby ($D=44.5$~pc)
high proper motion star Wolf 503 (EPIC 212779563). We classify Wolf 503 as a K3.5V star and member
of the thick disc population. We determine the possibility of a companion star and false positive
detection to be extremely low using both archival images and high-contrast adaptive optics images
from the Palomar observatory. The brightness of the host star makes Wolf 503b a prime target for prompt
radial velocity follow-up, HST transit spectroscopy, as well as detailed atmospheric characterization
with JWST. With its measured radius near the gap in the planet radius and occurrence rate distribution,
Wolf 503b offers a key opportunity to better understand the origin of this radius gap as well as the
nature of the intriguing populations of "super-Earths" and "sub-Neptunes" as a whole.
