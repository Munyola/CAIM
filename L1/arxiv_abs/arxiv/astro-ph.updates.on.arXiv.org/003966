The nearby dwarf galaxy NGC404 harbors a low-luminosity active galactic nucleus (AGN) powered
by the lowest-mass (< 150,000 solar-masses) central massive black hole (MBH) with a dynamical mass
constraint currently known, thus providing a rare low-redshift analog to the MBH "seeds" that formed
in the early Universe. Here, we present new imaging of the nucleus of NGC404 at 12-18 GHz with the Karl
G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) and observations of the CO(2-1) line with the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter
Array (ALMA). For the first time, we have successfully resolved the nuclear radio emission, revealing
a centrally peaked, extended source spanning 17 pc. Combined with previous VLA observations, our
new data place a tight constraint on the radio spectral index and indicate an optically-thin synchrotron
origin for the emission. The peak of the resolved radio source coincides with the dynamical center
of NGC404, the center of a rotating disk of molecular gas, and the position of a compact, hard X-ray
source. We also present evidence for shocks in the NGC404 nucleus from archival narrowband HST imaging,
Chandra X-ray data, and Spitzer mid-infrared spectroscopy, and discuss possible origins for the
shock excitation. Given the morphology, location, and steep spectral index of the resolved radio
source, as well as constraints on nuclear star formation from the ALMA CO(2-1) data, we find the most
likely scenario for the origin of the radio source in the center of NGC404 to be a radio outflow associated
with a confined jet driven by the active nucleus.
