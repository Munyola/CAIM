We examine the consistency of the unified scheme of radio galaxies and quasars with their observed
number and size distributions in the 3CRR sample. We have separated the low-excitation galaxies
from the high-excitation ones, as the former might not harbour a quasar within and thus may not be
partaking in the unified scheme models. It comes out that in the updated 3CRR sample, at low redshifts
(z<0.5), the relative number of high-excitation galaxies and quasars roughly match the expectations
from the popular orientation-based unified scheme model. However, a foreshortening in the observed
sizes of quasars, a must in the orientation-based model, is not seen with respect to radio galaxies
even when the low-excitation galaxies are excluded. This dashes the hope that the unified scheme
might still work if one includes only the high-excitation galaxies. Even in the high redshift range
(z>1), though there seems a foreshortening in the quasar sizes, the number of quasars there is
too high compared with radio galaxies (all high-excitation ones only at those redshifts) than would
be expected in unified scheme. Further we find that the relative number and size distributions of
high-excitation galaxies and quasars in the 3CRR sample vary heavily over the sky. A Kolmogorov-Smirnov
test shows that we can rule out at a 95% confidence level the null-hypothesis that the two types of
sources (high excitation radio galaxies and quasars) belong to the same parent population, which
we find to be very damaging evidence against unified scheme.
