Despite 50 years of extensive binary research we have to conclude that the Roche lobe overflow/mass
transfer process that governs close binary evolution is still poorly understood. It is the scope
of the present paper to lift a tip of the veil by studying the spin-up and spin-down processes of the
O-type components of WR+O binaries. We critically analyze the available observational data of
rotation speeds of the O-type components in WR+O binaries. By combining a binary evolutionary code
and a formalism that describes the effects of tides in massive stars with an envelope in radiative
equilibrium, we compute the corresponding rotational velocities during the Roche lobe overflow
of the progenitor binaries. In all the studied WR+O binaries, we find that the O-type stars were affected
by accretion of matter during the RLOF of the progenitor. This means that common envelope evolution
which excludes any accretion onto the secondary O-star, has not played an important role to explain
the WR+O binaries. Moreover, although it is very likely that the O-type star progenitors were spun-up
by the mass transfer, many ended the RLOF/mass transfer phase with a rotational velocity that is
significantly smaller than the critical rotation speed. This may indicate that during the mass
transfer phase there is a spin-down process which is of the same order as, although significantly
less than that of the spin-up process. We propose a Spruit-Tayler type dynamo spin-down suggested
in the past to explain the rotation speeds of the mass gainers in long-period Algols.
