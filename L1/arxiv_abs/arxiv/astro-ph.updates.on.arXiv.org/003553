Water ice is one of the most abundant materials in dense molecular clouds and in the outer reaches
of protoplanetary disks. In contrast to other materials (e.g., silicates) water ice is assumed
to be stickier due to its higher specific surface energy, leading to faster or more efficient growth
in mutual collisions. However, experiments investigating the stickiness of water ice have been
scarce, particularly in the astrophysically relevant micrometer-size region and at low temperatures.
In this work, we present an experimental setup to grow aggregates composed of $\mathrm{\mu}$m-sized
water-ice particles, which we used to measure the sticking and erosion thresholds of the ice particles
at different temperatures between $114 \, \mathrm{K}$ and $260 \, \mathrm{K}$. We show with our
experiments that for low temperatures (below $\sim 210 \, \mathrm{K}$), $\mathrm{\mu}$m-sized
water-ice particles stick below a threshold velocity of $9.6 \, \mathrm{m \, s^{-1}}$, which is
approximately ten times higher than the sticking threshold of $\mathrm{\mu}$m-sized silica particles.
Furthermore, erosion of the grown ice aggregates is observed for velocities above $15.3 \, \mathrm{m
\, s^{-1}}$. A comparison of the experimentally derived sticking threshold with model predictions
is performed to determine important material properties of water ice, i.e., the specific surface
energy and the viscous relaxation time. Our experimental results indicate that the presence of
water ice in the outer reaches of protoplanetary disks can enhance the growth of planetesimals by
direct sticking of particles.
