Snowlines of major volatiles regulate the gas and solid C/N/O ratios in the planet-forming midplanes
of protoplanetary disks. Snow surfaces are the 2D extensions of snowlines in the outer disk regions,
where radiative heating results in a decreasing temperature with disk height. CO and N$_2$ are two
of the most abundant carriers of C, N and O. N$_2$H$^+$ can be used to probe the snow surfaces of both
molecules, because it is destroyed by CO and formed from N$_2$. Here we present Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter
Array (ALMA) observations of N$_2$H$^+$ at 0.2$''$-0.4$''$ resolution in the disks around LkCa
15, GM Aur, DM Tau, V4046 Sgr, AS 209, and IM Lup. We find two distinctive emission morphologies: N$_2$H$^+$
is either present in a bright, narrow ring surrounded by extended tenuous emission, or in a broad
ring. These emission patterns can be explained by two different kinds of vertical temperature structures.
Bright, narrow N$_2$H$^+$ rings are expected in disks with a thick Vertically Isothermal Region
above the Midplane (VIRaM) layer (LkCa 15, GM Aur, DM Tau) where the N$_2$H$^+$ emission peaks between
the CO and N$_2$ snowlines. Broad N$_2$H$^+$ rings come from disks with a thin VIRaM layer (V4046
Sgr, AS 209, IM Lup). We use a simple model to extract the first sets of CO and N$_2$ snowline pairs and
corresponding freeze-out temperatures towards the disks with a thick VIRaM layer. The results
reveal a range of N$_2$ and CO snowline radii towards stars of similar spectral type, demonstrating
the need for empirically determined snowlines in disks.
