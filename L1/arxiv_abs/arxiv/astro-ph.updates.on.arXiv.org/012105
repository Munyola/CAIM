We report ALMA observations of CO(3-2) emission in a sample of 7 Seyfert/LINER galaxies at the unprecedented
spatial resolution of 0.1'' = 4-9 pc. Our aim is to explore the close environment of AGN, and the dynamical
structures leading to its fueling. The selected galaxies host low-luminosity AGN, and have a wide
range of activity types, and barred or ringed morphologies. The observed maps reveal the existence
of circum-nuclear disk structures, defined by their morphology and decoupled kinematics. We call
these structures "molecular tori", even though they appear often as disks, without holes in the
center. They have varied orientations, unaligned with their host galaxy. The radius of the tori
ranges from 6 to 27 pc, and their mass from 0.7 10$^7$ to 3.9 10$^7$ Msun. At larger scale, the gas is
always piled up in a few 100~pc scale resonant rings, that play the role of a reservoir to fuel the nucleus.
In some cases, a trailing spiral is observed inside the ring, providing evidence for feeding processes.
Most frequently, the torus and the AGN are slightly off-centered, with respect to the bar-resonant
ring position, implying that the black hole is wandering by a few 10~pc amplitude around the center
of mass of the galaxy. Our spatial resolution allows us to measure gas velocities inside the sphere
of influence of the central black holes. By fitting the observations with different simulated cubes,
varying the torus inclination and the black hole mass, it is possible to estimate the mass of the central
black hole, which is in general difficult for such late-type galaxies, with only a pseudo-bulge.
