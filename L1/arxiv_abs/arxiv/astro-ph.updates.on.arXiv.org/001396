As a continuation of a previous work, in which we found strong evidence of massive molecular outflows
towards a massive star forming site, we present a new study of this region based on very high angular
resolution observations with the aim of discovering the outflow driven mechanism. Using near-IR
data acquired with Gemini-NIRI at the broad H- and Ks-bands, we study a region of 22" x 22" around the
UCHII region G045.47+0.05, a massive star forming site at the distance of about 8 kpc. To image the
source with the highest spatial resolution possible we employed the adaptative optic system ALTAIR,
achieving an angular resolution of about 0.15". We discovered a cone-like shape nebula with an opening
angle of about 90 degree extending eastwards the IR source 2MASS J19142564+1109283, a very likely
MYSO. This morphology suggests a cavity that was cleared in the circumstellar material and its emission
may arise from scattered continuum light, warm dust, and likely emission lines from shock-excited
gas. The nebula, presenting arc-like features, is connected with the IR source through a jet-like
structure, which is aligned with the blue shifted CO outflow found in a previous study. The near-IR
structure lies ~3" north of the radio continuum emission, revealing that it is not spatially coincident
with the UCHII region. The observed morphology and structure of the near-IR nebula strongly suggest
the presence of a precessing jet. In this study we have resolved the circumstellar ambient (in scale
of a thousand A.U.) of a distant MYSO, indeed one of the farthest cases.
