The extended jet structures of radio galaxies (RGs) represent an ideal acceleration site for High
Energy Cosmic Rays (HECRs) and a recent model showed that the HECR data can be explained by these sources,
if the arrival directions of HECRs at energies $\lesssim 8\,\text{EeV}$ from a certain RG, Cygnus
A, are isotropized. First, this work introduces the inverted simulation setup in order to probe
the isotropy assumption. Here, different extragalactic magnetic field models are compared showing
that either a magnetic field of primordial origin that yields a high field strength in the large scale
structures of the Universe is needed, or a significant contribution by a multitude of isotropically
distributed sources. Secondly, the HECRs contribution by the bulk of RGs of different Fanaroff-Riley
(FR) type is determined. Here, the most recent FR-type dependent radio-to-CR correlations $Q_{\rm
cr}\propto L_{\rm radio}^{\beta_L}$ are used, and the impact of the slope $\beta_L$ on the HECRs
is analyzed in detail. Finally, it is carved out that FR-II RGs provide a promising spectral behavior
at the hardening part of the CR flux, between about $3\,\text{EeV}$ and $30\,\text{EeV}$, but most
likely not enough CR power. At these energies, FR-I RGs can only provide an appropriate flux in the
case of a high acceleration efficiency and $\beta_L\gtrsim 0.9$, otherwise these sources rather
contribute below $3\,\text{EeV}$. Further, the required acceleration efficiency for a significant
HECR contribution is exposed dependent on $\beta_L$ and the CR spectrum at the acceleration site.
