The interiors of mature neutron stars are expected to be superfluid. Superfluidity of matter on
the microscopic scale can have a number of large scale, potentially observable consequences, as
the superfluid component of the star can now flow relative to the `normal' component that is tracked
by electromagnetic emission. The most spectacular of such phenomena are pulsar glitches, sudden
spin-ups observed in many pulsars. A background flow of a normal-fluid component with respect to
the superfluid is also known to lead to a number of instabilities in laboratory superfluids, possibly
leading to turbulence and modifying the nature of the mutual friction coupling between the two fluids.
In this paper we consider modes of oscillation in the crust and core of a superfluid neutron star,
by conducting a plane-wave analysis. We explicitly account for a background flow between the two
components (as would be expected in the presence of pinning) and the entrainment, and we consider
both standard (Hall-Vinen) and isotropic (Gorter-Mellink) forms of the mutual friction. We find
that for standard mutual friction there are families of unstable inertial and sound waves both in
the case of a counter-flow along the superfluid vortex axis and for counterflow perpendicular to
the vortex axis and find that entrainment leads to a quantitative difference between instabilities
in the crust and core of the star. For isotropic mutual friction we find no unstable modes, and speculate
that instabilities in a straight vortex array may be linked to glitching behaviour, which then ceases
until the turbulence has decayed.
