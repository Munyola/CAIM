We present the earliest X-ray observations of the 2018 outburst of XTE J1810-197, the first outburst
since its 2003 discovery as the prototypical transient and radio-emitting anomalous X-ray pulsar
(AXP). The Monitor of All-sky X-ray Image (MAXI) detected XTE J1810-197 immediately after a November
20-26 visibility gap, contemporaneous with its reactivation as a radio pulsar, first observed
on December 8. On December 13 the Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NUSTAR) detected X-ray
emission up to at least 30 keV, with a spectrum well-characterized by a blackbody plus power-law
model with temperature kT = 0.74+/-0.02 keV and photon index Gamma = 4.4+/-0.2 or by a two-blackbody
model with kT = 0.59+/-0.04 keV and kT = 1.0+/-0.1 keV, both including an additional power-law component
to account for emission above 10 keV, with Gamma_h = -0.2+/-1.5 and Gamma_h = 1.5+/-0.5, respectively.
The latter index is consistent with hard X-ray flux reported for the non-transient magnetars. In
the 2-10 keV bandpass, the absorbed flux is 2E-10 erg/s/cm^2, a factor of 2 greater than the maximum
flux extrapolated for the 2003 outburst. The peak of the sinusoidal X-ray pulse lags the radio pulse
by approx. 0.13 cycles, consistent with their phase relationship during the 2003 outburst. This
suggests a stable geometry in which radio emission originates on magnetic field lines containing
currents that heat a spot on the neutron star surface. However, a measured energy-dependent phase
shift of the pulsed X-rays suggests that all X-ray emitting regions are not precisely co-aligned.
