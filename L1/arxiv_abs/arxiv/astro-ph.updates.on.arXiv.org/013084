X-ray emission from AGN is believed to be produced via Comptonization of optical/UV seed photons
emitted by the accretion disk, up-scattered by hot electrons in a corona surrounding the black hole.
A critical compactness vs. temperature threshold is predicted above which any increase in the source
luminosity, for a fixed size, would then generate positron-electron pairs rather than continue
heating the coronal plasma. Current observations seem to confirm that all AGN populate the region
below this critical line. These models, however, have never been probed by observations in the high-luminosity
regime, where the critical line is expected to reach low temperatures. To fill this observational
gap, we selected two luminous ($log(L_{bol})>47.5$ erg/s) quasars, 2MASSJ1614346+470420 ($z=1.86$)
and B1422+231 ($z=3.62$), and obtained XMM-Newton and NuSTAR deep observations for them. We performed
detailed spectral analysis of their quasi-simultaneous soft and hard X-ray data, in order to constrain
the parameters of their coronae. Using a phenomenological cut-off power-law model, with the inclusion
of a reflection component, we derived rest-frame values of the high energy cut-off of $E_{cut}=106^{+102}_{-37}$
keV and $E_{cut}=66^{+17}_{-12}$ keV, respectively. Comptonization models consistently give
as best-fit parameters electron temperatures of $\sim45$ keV and $\sim28$ keV, respectively,
and optically thick coronae ($\tau>1$). These low coronal temperatures fall in the limited region
allowed at these luminosities to avoid runaway pair production.
