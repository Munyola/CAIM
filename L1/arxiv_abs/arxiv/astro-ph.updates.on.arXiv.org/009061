We study the relation between the metallicity of quasar broad line region (BLR) and black hole (BH)
mass ($10^{7.5}M_{\odot} \sim 10^{10}M_{\odot}$) and quasar bolometric luminosity ($10^{44.6}erg/s
\sim 10^{48} erg/s$) using a sample of $\sim$130,000 quasars at $2.25\leq z\leq 5.25$ from Sloan
Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 12 (DR12). We generate composite spectra by stacking individual
spectra in the same BH mass (bolometric luminosity) and redshift bins and then estimate the metallicity
of quasar BLR using metallicity-sensitive broad emission-line flux ratios based on the photoionization
models. We find a significant correlation between quasar BLR metallicity and BH mass (bolometric
luminosity) but no correlation between quasar BLR metallicity and redshift. We also compare the
metallicity of quasar BLR and that of host galaxies inferred from the mass-metallicity relation
of star-forming galaxy at $z\sim2.3$ and $z\sim3.5$. We find quasar BLR metallicity is 0.3 $\sim$
1.0 dex higher than their host galaxies. This discrepancy cannot be interpreted by the uncertainty
due to different metallicity diagnostic methods, mass-metallicity relation of galaxy, metallicity
gradient in quasar host galaxies, BH mass estimation, the effect of different spectral energy distribution
(SED) models, and a few other potential sources of uncertainties. We propose a possibility that
the high metallicity in quasar BLR might be caused by metal enrichment from massive star formation
in the nucleus region of quasars or even the accretion disk.
