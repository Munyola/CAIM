During the last decades, rapid progress has been made in measurements of the rest-frame ultraviolet
(UV) luminosity function (LF) for high-redshift galaxies ($z \geq 6$). The faint-end of the galaxy
LF at these redshifts provides powerful constraints on different dark matter models that suppress
small-scale structure formation. In this work we perform full hydrodynamical cosmological simulations
of galaxy formation using an alternative DM model composed of extremely light bosonic particles
($m \sim 10^{-22}$ eV), also known as fuzzy dark matter (FDM), and examine the predictions for the
galaxy stellar mass function and luminosity function at $z \geq 6$ for a range of FDM masses. We find
that for FDM models with bosonic mass $m = 5\times10^{-22}$ eV, the number density of galaxies with
stellar mass $\rm M_* \sim 10^7 M_{\odot}$ is suppressed by $\sim 40\%$ at z = 9, $\sim 20\%$ at z = 5,
and the UV LFs within magnitude range of -16 < $M_{\rm UV}$ < -14 is suppressed by $\sim 60\%$ at $z =
9$, $\sim 20\%$ at $z = 5$ comparing to the CDM counterpart simulation. Comparing our predictions
with current measurements of the faint-end LFs ($-18 \leqslant M_{\rm UV} \leqslant -14$), we find
that FDM models with $m_{22} < 5\times10^{-22}$ are ruled out at $3\sigma$ confidence level. We
expect that future LF measurements by James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), which will extend down
to $M_{\rm UV} \sim -13$ for $z \lesssim 10$, with a survey volume that is comparable to the Hubble
Ultra Deep Field (HUDF) would have the capability to constrain FDM models to $m\; \gtrsim 10^{-21}$
eV.
