We present a spatially resolved stellar population study of the inner $\sim$200\,pc radius of NGC4303
based on near-infrared integral field spectroscopy with SINFONI/VLT at a spatial resolution of
40-80pc and using the STARLIGHT code. We found the distribution of the stellar populations presents
a spatial variation, suggesting an age stratification. Three main structures stand out. Two nuclear
blobs, one composed by young stars (t $\leq$ 50Myr) and one with intermediate-age stars (50Myr $<$
t $\leq$ 2Gyr) both shifted from the centre. The third one is an internal intermediate-age spiral
arm-like structure, surrounding the blob of young stars. Our results indicate star formation has
occurred through multiple bursts in this source. Furthermore, the youngest stellar populations
(t $\lesssim$ 2Gyr) are distributed along a circumnuclear star-forming ring with r$\sim$250pc.
The ring displays star formation rates (SFRs) in the range of 0.002-0.14M$_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$,
favoring the `pearls-on-a-string' scenario. The old underlying bulge stellar population component
(t $>$ 2Gyr) is distributed outside the two blob structures. For the nuclear region (inner $\sim$60pc
radius) we derived a SFR of 0.43\,M$_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$ and found no signatures of non-thermal
featureless continuum and hot dust emission, supporting the scenario in which a LLAGN/LINER-like
source is hidden in the centre of NGC4303. Thus, our results reveal a rather complex star formation
history in NGC4303, with different stellar population components coexisting with a low efficiency
accreting black hole in its centre.
