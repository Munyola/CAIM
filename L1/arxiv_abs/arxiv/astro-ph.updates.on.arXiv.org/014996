A framework is developed to perform Fourier-domain timing analysis on X-ray light curves with gaps,
employing Gaussian processes to model the probability distribution underlying the observed time
series from which continuous samples can be drawn. A technique is developed to measure X-ray reverberation
from the inner regions of accretion discs around black holes in the low frequency components of the
variability, on timescales longer than can be probed employing standard Fourier techniques. This
enables X-ray reverberation experiments to be performed using data from satellites in low-Earth
orbit such as NICER, NuSTAR and the proposed X-ray timing mission STROBE-X, and enables long timescale
reverberation around higher mass AGN to be measured by combining multiple observations. Gaussian
processes are applied to observations of the broad line radio galaxy 3C120 spanning two orbits with
XMM-Newton to measure the relative time lags of successive X-ray energy bands. The lag-energy spectrum
between 5E-6 and 3E-5Hz, estimated using Gaussian processes, reveals X-ray reverberation from
the inner accretion disc for the first time in this radio-loud AGN. Time lags in the relativistically
broadened iron K line are significantly detected. The core of the line lags behind the continuum
by (3800 +/- 1500)s, suggesting a scale height of the corona of (13 +/- 8)rg above the disc. The ability
to compare the structure of coronae in radio loud AGN to their radio quiet counterparts will yield
important insight into the mechanisms by which black holes are able to launch jets.
