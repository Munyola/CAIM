We study the relationship between dense gas and star formation in the Antennae galaxies by comparing
ALMA observations of dense gas tracers (HCN, HCO$^+$, and HNC $\mathrm{J}=1-0$) to the total infrared
luminosity ($\mathrm{L_{TIR}}$) calculated using data from the \textit{Herschel} Space Observatory
and the \textit{Spitzer} Space Telescope. We compare the luminosities of our SFR and gas tracers
using aperture photometry and employing two methods for defining apertures. We taper the ALMA dataset
to match the resolution of our $\mathrm{L_{TIR}}$ maps and present new detections of dense gas emission
from complexes in the overlap and western arm regions. Using OVRO CO $\mathrm{J}=1-0$ data, we compare
with the total molecular gas content, $\mathrm{M(H_2)_{tot}}$, and calculate star formation
efficiencies and dense gas mass fractions for these different regions. We derive HCN, HCO$^+$ and
HNC upper limits for apertures where emission was not significantly detected, as we expect emission
from dense gas should be present in most star-forming regions. The Antennae extends the linear $\mathrm{L_{TIR}-L_{HCN}}$
relationship found in previous studies. The $\mathrm{L_{TIR}-L_{HCN}}$ ratio varies by up to
a factor of $\sim$10 across different regions of the Antennae implying variations in the star formation
efficiency of dense gas, with the nuclei, NGC 4038 and NGC 4039, showing the lowest SFE$_\mathrm{dense}$
(0.44 and 0.70 $\times10^{-8}$ yr$^{-1}$). The nuclei also exhibit the highest dense gas fractions
($\sim 9.1\%$ and $\sim7.9\%$).
