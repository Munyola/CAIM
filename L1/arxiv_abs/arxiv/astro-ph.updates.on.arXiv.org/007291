We applly a simple axisymmetric disc model to 174 Galactic Cepheids, to measure the local circular
velocity, its radial gradient and the other Galactic parameters, such as the Sun's proper motion
in the Galactic rest frame, the solar radius and the velocity dispersion of the tracer populations.
Accurate measurements of the distance and velocities for the Cepheids are obtained by cross-matching
the existing Cepheids catalogue with the Tycho-Gaia astrometric solution (TGAS) catalogue. Our
axisymmetric disc model fit to the kinematic data of the Cepheids determines the local circular
velocity at the Sun's location, $V_\mathrm{circ}(R_0)=236\pm 3$ km s$^{-1}$ and the Sun's azimuthal
and radial proper motions of $V_\mathrm{\odot}=12.5\pm0.8$ km s$^{-1}$ and $U_\mathrm{ \odot}=7.7\pm1.0$
km s$^{-1}$, respectively, with strong priors of the solar radius, $R_0=8.2\pm0.1$ kpc, and angular
rotation velocity of the Sun, $\Omega_\mathrm{\odot}=30.24\pm0.12$ km s$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-1}$.
To understand what these measurements from the local stellar tracers mean in terms of the local and
global Galactic parameters, we also applied the axisymmetric model to the N-body/hydrodynamic
simulation data of a Milky Way-like galaxy with a bar and spiral arms by sampling the young and old
disc star particles within the distance of 3 kpc from the observer placed at $R=8$ kpc, but at different
azimuthal angles. Our axisymmetric model fitting to the young stars recovers the local circular
velocity, defined with the radial gravitational force, reasonably well, even in the face of significant
non-axisymmetry in the forces.
