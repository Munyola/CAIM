We perform halo occupation distribution (HOD) modeling of the projected two-point correlation
function (2PCF) of high-redshift (z~1.2) X-ray-bright active galactic nuclei (AGN) in the XMM-COSMOS
field measured by Allevato et al. The HOD parameterization is based on low-luminosity AGN in cosmological
simulations. At the median redshift of z~1.2, we derive a median mass of (1.02+0.21/-0.23)x10^{13}
Msun/h for halos hosting central AGN and an upper limit of ~10% on the AGN satellite fraction. Our
modeling results indicate (at the 2.5-sigma level) that X-ray AGN reside in more massive halos compared
to more bolometrically luminous, optically-selected quasars at similar redshift. The modeling
also yields constraints on the duty cycle of the X-ray AGN, and we find that at z~1.2 the average duration
of the X-ray AGN phase is two orders of magnitude longer than that of the quasar phase. Our inferred
mean occupation function of X-ray AGN is similar to recent empirical measurements with a group catalog
and suggests that AGN halo occupancy increases with increasing halo mass. We project the XMM-COSMOS
2PCF measurements to forecast the required survey parameters needed in future AGN clustering studies
to enable higher precision HOD constraints and determinations of key physical parameters like
the satellite fraction and duty cycle. We find that N^{2}/A~5x10^{6} deg^{-2} (with N the number
of AGN in a survey area of A deg^{2}) is sufficient to constrain the HOD parameters at the 10% level,
which is easily achievable by upcoming and proposed X-ray surveys.
