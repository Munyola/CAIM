With the accumulation of big data of CME observations by coronagraphs, automatic detection and
tracking of CMEs has proven to be crucial. The excellent performance of convolutional neural network
in image classification, object detection and other computer vision tasks motivates us to apply
it to CME detection and tracking as well. We have developed a new tool for CME Automatic detection
and tracking with MachinE Learning (CAMEL) techniques. The system is a three-module pipeline.
It is first a supervised image classification problem. We solve it by training a neural network LeNet
with training labels obtained from an existing CME catalog. Those images containing CME structures
are flagged as CME images. Next, to identify the CME region in each CME-flagged image, we use deep
descriptor transforming to localize the common object in an image set. A following step is to apply
the graph cut technique to finely tune the detected CME region. To track the CME in an image sequence,
the binary images with detected CME pixels are converted from cartesian to polar coordinate. A CME
event is labeled if it can move in at least two frames and reach the edge of coronagraph field of view.
For each event, a few fundamental parameters are derived. The results of four representative CMEs
with various characteristics are presented and compared with those from four existing automatic
and manual catalogs. We find that CAMEL can detect more complete and weaker structures, and has better
performance to catch a CME as early as possible.
