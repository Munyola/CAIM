We perform the non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) calculations for Ca I-II with the updated
model atom that includes new quantum-mechanical rate coefficients for Ca I + H I collisions from
two recent studies, that is, by Barklem and by Mitrushchenkov, Guitou, Belyaev, Yakovleva, Spielfiedel,
and Feautrier, and investigate the accuracy of calcium abundance determinations using the Sun,
Procyon, and five metal-poor (MP) stars with well-determined stellar parameters. We show that
both collisional recipes lead to very similar NLTE results. When using the subordinate lines of
Ca I and the high-excitation lines of Ca II, NLTE provides the smaller line-to-line scatter compared
with the LTE case for each star. For Procyon, NLTE removes a steep trend with line strength among strong
Ca I lines seen in LTE and leads to consistent [Ca/H] abundances from the two ionisation stages. In
the MP stars, the NLTE abundance from Ca II 8498 A agrees well with that from the Ca I subordinate lines.
NLTE largely removes abundance discrepancies between the high-excitation lines of Ca I and Ca II
8498 A obtained for our four [Fe/H] < -2 stars under the LTE assumption. We investigate the formation
of the Ca I resonance line in the [Fe/H] < -2 stars. Consistent NLTE abundances from the Ca I resonance
line and the Ca II lines are found for two hyper metal-poor stars HE0107-5240 and HE1327-2326. We
provide the NLTE abundance corrections for 28 lines of Ca I in a grid of model atmospheres suitable
for abundance analysis of FGK-type dwarfs and subgiants.
