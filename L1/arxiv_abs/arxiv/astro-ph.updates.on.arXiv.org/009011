We investigate how to recover the spectral properties of underlying magnetohydrodynamic (MHD)
turbulence using fluctuation statistics of synchrotron polarization radiation, based on the
synthetic observations. Taking spatially coincident, separated, and compounded synchrotron
emission and Faraday rotation regions into account, we extract the power spectrum of synchrotron
polarization intensities integrated along the line of sight. Our results demonstrate that in the
short wavelength range, the power spectra reflect fluctuation statistics of the perpendicular
component of turbulent magnetic fields, and the spectra at long wavelengths reveal the fluctuation
of the Faraday rotation density, which is a product of the parallel component of magnetic field and
thermal electron density. We find that our numerical results (in the case of spatially coincident
regions) are in agreement with the analytical prediction in Lazarian \& Pogosyan (2016), and this
theoretical prediction is applicable to more complicated settings, i.e., the spatially separated
and compounded regions. We simulate telescopic observations that incorporate the effects of telescope
angular resolution and noise, and find that statistics of underlying MHD turbulence can be recovered
successfully. We expect that the technique can be applied to a variety of astrophysical environments,
with existing synchrotron data cubes and a large number of forthcoming data sets from such as the
LOw-Frequency Array for Radio astronomy (LOFAR), the Square Kilometer Array (SKA) and the Five-hundred-meter
Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST).
