We present results from LOFAR and GMRT observations of the galaxy cluster MACS$\,$J0717.5$+$3745.
The cluster is undergoing a violent merger involving at least four sub-clusters, and it is known
to host a radio halo. LOFAR observations reveal new sources of radio emission in the Intra-Cluster
Medium: (i) a radio bridge that connects the cluster to a head-tail radio galaxy located along a filament
of galaxies falling into the main cluster, (ii) a 1.9 Mpc radio arc, that is located North West of the
main mass component, (iii) radio emission along the X-ray bar, that traces the gas in the X-rays South
West of the cluster centre. We use deep GMRT observations at 608 MHz to constrain the spectral indices
of these new radio sources, and of the emission that was already studied in the literature at higher
frequency. We find that the spectrum of the radio halo and of the relic at LOFAR frequency follows
the same power law as observed at higher frequencies. The radio bridge, the radio arc, and the radio
bar all have steep spectra, which can be used to constrain the particle acceleration mechanisms.
We argue that the radio bridge could be caused by the re-acceleration of electrons by shock waves
that are injected along the filament during the cluster mass assembly. Despite the sensitivity
reached by our observations, the emission from the radio halo does not trace the emission of the gas
revealed by X-ray observations. We argue that this could be due to the difference in the ratio of kinetic
over thermal energy of the intra-cluster gas, suggested by X-ray observations.
