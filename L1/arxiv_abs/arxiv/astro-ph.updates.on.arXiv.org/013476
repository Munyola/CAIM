We study the internal radial gradients of the stellar populations in a sample comprising 522 early-type
galaxies (ETGs) from the SAMI (Sydney- AAO Multi-object Integral field spectrograph) Galaxy Survey.
We stack the spectra of individual spaxels in radial bins, and derive basic stellar population properties:
total metallicity ([Z/H]), [Mg/Fe], [C/Fe] and age. The radial gradient ($\nabla$) and central
value of the fits (evaluated at R$_e$/4) are compared against a set of six possible drivers of the
trends. We find that velocity dispersion ($\sigma$) - or, equivalently gravitational potential
- is the dominant driver of the chemical composition gradients. Surface mass density is also correlated
with the trends, especially with stellar age. The decrease of $\nabla$[Mg/Fe] with increasing
$\sigma$ is contrasted by a rather shallow dependence of $\nabla$[Z/H] with $\sigma$ (although
this radial gradient is overall rather steep). This result, along with a shallow age slope at the
massive end, imposes stringent constraints on the progenitors of the populations that contribute
to the formation of the outer envelopes of ETGs. The SAMI sample is split between a 'field' sample
and a cluster sample. Only weak environment-related differences are found, most notably a stronger
dependence of central total metallicity ([Z/H]$_{e4}$) with $\sigma$, along with a marginal trend
of $\nabla$[Z/H] to steepen in cluster galaxies, a result that is not followed by [Mg/Fe]. The results
presented here serve as constraints on numerical models of the formation and evolution of ETGs.
