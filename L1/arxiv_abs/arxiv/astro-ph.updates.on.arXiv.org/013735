Stars passing too close to a black hole can produce tidal disruption events (TDEs), when the tidal
force across the star exceeds the gravitational force that binds it. TDEs have usually been discussed
in relation to massive black holes that reside in the centres of galaxies or lurk in star clusters.
In this paper, we investigate the possibility that triple stars hosting a stellar black hole (SBH)
may be sources of TDEs. We start from a triple system made up of three main sequence (MS) stars and model
the supernova (SN) kick event that led to the production of an inner binary comprised of a SBH. We evolve
these triples in isolation with a high precision $N$-body code and study their TDEs as a result of
Kozai-Lidov oscillations. We explore a variety of distributions of natal kicks imparted during
the SN event, various maximum initial separations for the triples, and different distributions
of eccentricities. We show that the main parameter that governs the properties of the SBH-MS binaries
which produce a TDE in triples is the mean velocity of the natal kick distribution. Smaller $\sigma$'s
lead to larger inner and outer semi-major axes of the systems that undergo a TDE, smaller SBH masses,
and longer timescales. We find that the fraction of systems that produce a TDE is roughly independent
of the initial conditions, while estimate a TDE rate of $7.3\times 10^{-5}-4.1 \ \mathrm{yr}^{-1}$,
depending on the prescriptions adopted for the SBH natal kicks. This rate is almost comparable to
the expected TDE rate for massive black holes.
