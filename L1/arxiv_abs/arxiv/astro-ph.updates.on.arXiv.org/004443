In this paper we study the morphological properties of spiral galaxies, including measurements
of spiral arm number and pitch angle. Using Galaxy Zoo 2, a stellar mass-complete sample of 6,222
SDSS spiral galaxies is selected. We use the machine vision algorithm SpArcFiRe to identify spiral
arm features and measure their associated geometries. A support vector machine classifier is employed
to identify reliable spiral features, with which we are able to estimate pitch angles for half of
our sample. We use these machine measurements to calibrate visual estimates of arm tightness, and
hence estimate pitch angles for our entire sample. The properties of spiral arms are compared with
respect to various galaxy properties. The star formation properties of galaxies vary significantly
with arm number, but not pitch angle. We find that galaxies hosting strong bars have spiral arms substantially
($4-6^\mathrm{o}$) looser than unbarred galaxies. Accounting for this, spiral arms associated
with many-arm structures are looser (by 2$^\mathrm{o}$) than those in two-arm galaxies. In contrast
to this average trend, galaxies with greater bulge-to-total stellar mass ratios display both fewer
and looser spiral arms. This effect is primarily driven by the galaxy disc, such that galaxies with
more massive discs contain more spiral arms with tighter pitch angles. This implies that galaxy
central mass concentration is not the dominant cause of pitch angle and arm number variations between
galaxies, which in turn suggests that not all spiral arms are governed by classical density waves
or modal theories.
