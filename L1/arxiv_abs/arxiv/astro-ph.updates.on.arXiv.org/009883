The presence of companion stars, whether bound or unbound, make correct identification of the planetary
hosting star difficult when a planet has been detected through a photometrically blended transiting
event. We present an approach that uses a combination of light curve analysis and stellar modeling
to disentangle 8 K2 photometrically blended binary systems that have either a confirmed or suspected
planet to identify the probable host star. The key to our approach is the use of the mean stellar density,
calculated using the transit geometry, as a discriminator. The approach is strongly dependent
on the difference in magnitude between the stars and the observed transit depth, which is corrected
by the flux ratio between the two stars. While our approach does not lead to a definitive result for
all systems, we were able to determine for the 8 systems in this case study: two systems where the primary
was highly likely to be the planet hosting star ($>$ 90\% likelihood); three systems where the primary
was likely to be the hosting star ($>$ 55\% likelihood); one system where the secondary was likely
to be the planet hosting star ($>$ 55\% likelihood); and two systems where we were uncertain which
star was the planet hosting star ($\approx$ 50\% likelihood to be either the primary or the secondary).
Two systems, denoted by their EPIC number, EPIC 201546283 and EPIC 201862715, had confirmed planets,
K2-27b and K2-94b respectively, with radii of $\mathrm{4.0 \pm 0.1}$ and $\mathrm{16.4 \pm 2.9}$
$\mathrm{R_\oplus}$ respectively.
