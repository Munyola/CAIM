In the context of core-collapse supernova explosions (CCSNe), the interaction of standing accretion
shocks with upstream vorticity perturbations is investigated by linear theory analysis. The endothermic
effect associated to the nuclear dissociation, which takes place right behind the shock wave, affects
the amplitude of the perturbations amplified/generated across the front. For upstream disturbances
whose characteristic size is much larger than the post-shock dissociation-layer thickness, the
effect of nuclear dissociation can be reduced to that of considering the global endothermic effect
that scales with the inflow energy flux. The present study focuses on perturbation fields that are
not isotropic, which mimic the perturbations in collapsing convective shells of massive stars.
The linear interaction of the shock with bidimensional mono-frequency vorticity perturbations
is theoretically addressed, with the limit of highly-stretched vortices being analyzed in detail.
The exact spatial distribution of the rotational and acoustic perturbations generated in the post-shock
flow are provided along with the transient evolution of the shock front. It is found that nuclear
dissociation contributes to stabilize the shock oscillations, but increases the amplitude of
the density perturbations downstream. An extension of this work that addresses the interaction
with tridimensional isotropic turbulent flows can be found in reference Huete, C., et al. 2018,
MNRAS, 475, 3305-3323, which analyzes the effect of the post-shock flow on the critical conditions
that ultimately trigger explosion.
