We have obtained a firm detection of Cyg X-1 during its hard and intermediate spectral states in the
energy range of 40 MeV--60 GeV based on observations by the Fermi Large Area Telescope, confirming
the independent results at $\geq$60MeV of a previous work. The detection significance is $\simeq\!8\sigma$
in the 0.1--10 GeV range. In the soft state, we have found only upper limits on the emission at energies
$\gtrsim$0.1 MeV. However, we have found emission with a very soft spectrum in the 40--80 MeV range,
not detected previously. This is likely to represent the high-energy cutoff of the high-energy
power-law tail observed in the soft state. Similarly, we have detected a $\gamma$-ray soft excess
in the hard state, which appears to be of similar origin. We have also confirmed the presence of an
orbital modulation of the detected emission in the hard state, expected if the $\gamma$-rays are
from Compton upscattering of stellar blackbody photons. However, the observed modulation is significantly
weaker than that predicted if the blackbody upscattering were the dominant source of $\gamma$-rays.
This argues for a significant contribution from $\gamma$-rays produced by the synchrotron-self-Compton
process. We have found that such strong contribution is possible if the jet is strongly clumped.
We reproduce the observed hard-state average broad-band spectrum using a self-consistent jet
model, taking into account all the relevant emission processes, e$^\pm$ pair absorption, and clumping.
This model also reproduces the amplitude of the observed orbital modulation.
