In a two component advective flow around a compact object, a high viscosity Keplerian disk is flanked
by a low angular momentum and low viscosity flow which forms a centrifugal pressure supported shock
wave close to the black hole. The post-shock region which behaves as a Compton cloud becomes progressively
smaller during the outburst as the spectra change from the hard state to the soft state in order to
satisfy Rankine-Hugoniot relation in presence of cooling. The resonance oscillation of the shock
wave which causes low frequency quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) also allows us to obtain the
shock location from each observed QPO frequency. Applying the theory of transonic flow with Compton
cooling and viscosity, we obtain the viscosity parameter $\alpha_{SK}$ required for the shock
to form at those places in the low-Keplerian component. When we compare the evolution of $\alpha_{SK}$
for each outburst, we arrive at a major conclusion: In each source, the advective flow component
typically requires exactly a similar value of $\alpha_{SK}$ when transiting from one spectral
state to another (e.g., from hard state to soft state through intermediate states and the other way
around in the declining phase). Most importantly, these $\alpha_{SK}$ values in the low-angular
momentum advective component are fully self-consistent in the sense that they remain below critical
value $\alpha_{cr}$ required to form a Keplerian disk. For a further consistency check, we compute
the $\alpha_K$ of the Keplerian component, and find that in each of the objects, $\alpha_{SK}$ $<$
$\alpha_{cr}$ $<$ $\alpha_K$.
