We present the initial-final mass relation (IFMR) based on the self-consistent analysis of Sirius
B and 79 white dwarfs from 13 star clusters. We have also acquired additional signal on eight white
dwarfs previously analyzed in the NGC 2099 cluster field, four of which are consistent with membership.
These reobserved white dwarfs have masses ranging from 0.72 to 0.97 M$_\odot$, with initial masses
from 3.0 to 3.65 M$_\odot$, where the IFMR has an important change in slope that these new data help
to observationally confirm. In total, this directly measured IFMR has small scatter ($\sigma$
= 0.06 M$_\odot$) and spans from progenitors of 0.85 to 7.5 M$_\odot$. Applying two different stellar
evolutionary models to infer two different sets of white dwarf progenitor masses shows that when
the same model is also used to derive the cluster ages, the resulting IFMR has weak sensitivity to
the adopted model at all but the highest initial masses ($>$5.5 M$_\odot$). The non-linearity of
the IFMR is also clearly observed with moderate slopes at lower masses (0.08 M$_{\rm final}$/M$_{\rm
initial}$) and higher masses (0.11 M$_{\rm final}$/M$_{\rm initial}$) that are broken up by a steep
slope (0.19 M$_{\rm final}$/M$_{\rm initial}$) between progenitors from 2.85 to 3.6 M$_\odot$.
This IFMR shows total stellar mass loss ranges from 33\% of M$_{\rm initial}$ at 0.83 M$_\odot$ to
83\% of M$_{\rm initial}$ at 7.5 M$_\odot$. Testing this total mass loss for dependence on progenitor
metallicity, however, finds no detectable sensitivity across the moderate range of -0.15 $<$ [Fe/H]
$<$ +0.15.
