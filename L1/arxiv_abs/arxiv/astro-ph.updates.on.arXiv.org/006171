This paper briefly reviews past, current, and future efforts to image black holes in the radio regime.
Black holes seem like mystical objects, but they are an integral part of current astrophysics and
are at the center of attempts to unify quantum physics and general relativity. Yet, nobody has ever
seen a black hole. What do they look like? Initially, this question seemed more of an academic nature.
However, this has changed over the past two decades. Observations and theoretical considerations
suggest that the supermassive black hole, Sgr A*, in the center of our Milky Way is surrounded by a
compact, foggy emission region radiating at and above 230 GHz. It has been predicted that the event
horizon of Sgr A* should cast its shadow onto that emission region, which could be detectable with
a global VLBI array of radio telescopes. In contrast to earlier pictures of black holes, that dark
feature is not supposed to be due to a hole in the accretion flow, but would represent a true negative
image of the event horizon. Currently, the global Event Horizon Telescope consortium is attempting
to make such an image. In the future those images could be improved by adding more telescopes to the
array, in particular at high sites in Africa. Ultimately, a space array at THz frequencies, the Event
Horizon Imager, could produce much more detailed images of black holes. In combination with numerical
simulations and precise measurements of the orbits of stars - ideally also of pulsars - these images
will allow us to study black holes with unprecedented precision.
