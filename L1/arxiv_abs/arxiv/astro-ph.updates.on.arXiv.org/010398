We investigate the evolution in colour and morphology of the progenitors of red-sequence galaxies
in the EAGLE cosmological hydrodynamical simulation. We quantify colours with $u^{*}-r^{*}$
intrinsic magnitudes and morphologies with a measure of the stellar kinematics. The time when galaxies
moved onto the red sequence depends on their morphology. Disc-type galaxies tend to have become
red during the last 3 Gyr, while elliptical-type galaxies joined the red sequence earlier, with
half the sample already being red 5 Gyr ago. The time-scale, $\tau_{\rm{Green}}$, of colour transition
through the `green valley' depends weakly on the galaxy's morphological type. Elliptical-type
galaxies cross the green valley slightly faster ($\tau_{\rm{Green}}{\approx}1$ Gyr) than disc-type
galaxies ($\tau_{\rm{Green}}{\approx}$1.5 Gyr). While $\tau_{\rm{Green}}$ is similar for
central and satellite galaxies, for satellites $\tau_{\rm{Green}}$ decreases with increasing
stellar mass to host-halo mass ratio. Coupled with our finding that galaxies tend to become green
after becoming satellites, this indicates that satellite-specific processes are important for
quenching red-sequence galaxies. The last time central, elliptical-type red-sequence galaxies
left the blue cloud is strongly correlated with the time the luminosity of the central black hole
peaked, but this is not the case for discs. This suggests that AGN feedback is important for quenching
ellipticals, particularly centrals, but not for discs. We find only a weak connection between transformations
in colour and morphology.
