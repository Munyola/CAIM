We have developed a semi-analytic framework to model the large-scale evolution of the first Population
III (Pop III) stars and the transition to metal-enriched star formation. Our model follows dark
matter halos from cosmological N-body simulations, utilizing their individual merger histories
and three-dimensional positions, and applies physically motivated prescriptions for star formation
and feedback from Lyman-Werner (LW) radiation, hydrogen ionizing radiation, and external metal
enrichment due to supernovae winds. This method is intended to complement analytic studies, which
do not include clustering or individual merger histories, and hydrodynamical cosmological simulations,
which include detailed physics, but are computationally expensive and have limited dynamic range.
Utilizing this technique, we compute the cumulative Pop III and metal-enriched star formation
rate density (SFRD) as a function of redshift at $z \geq 20$. We find that varying the model parameters
leads to significant qualitative changes in the global star formation history. The Pop III star
formation efficiency and the delay time between Pop III and subsequent metal-enriched star formation
are found to have the largest impact. The effect of clustering (i.e. including the three-dimensional
positions of individual halos) on various feedback mechanisms is also investigated. The impact
of clustering on LW and ionization feedback is found to be relatively mild in our fiducial model,
but can be larger if external metal enrichment can promote metal-enriched star formation over large
distances.
