Simultaneous XMM-Newton, NuSTAR and HST observations, performed in March 2017, of the nearby ($z=0.184$)
luminous quasar PDS 456 are presented. PDS 456 had a low X-ray flux compared to past observations,
where the first of the two new XMM-Newton observations occurred during a pronounced dip in the X-ray
lightcurve. The broad-band X-ray spectrum is highly absorbed, attenuated by a soft X-ray absorber
of column density $N_{\rm H}=6\times10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$. An increase in obscuration occurs during
the dip, which may be due to an X-ray eclipse. In addition, the persistent, fast Fe K outflow is present,
with velocity components of $-0.25c$ and $-0.4c$. The soft absorber is less ionized ($\log\xi=3$)
compared to the iron K outflow ($\log\xi=5$) and is outflowing with a velocity of approximately
$-0.2c$. A soft X-ray excess is present below 1 keV against the highly absorbed continuum and can
be attributed to the re-emission from a wide angle wind. The complex X-ray absorption present in
PDS 456 suggests that the wind is inhomogeneous, whereby the soft X-ray absorber originates from
denser clumps or filaments which may form further out along the outflow. In contrast to the X-ray
observations, the simultaneous UV spectrum of PDS 456 is largely unabsorbed, where only a very weak
broad absorption trough is present bluewards of Ly$\alpha$, compared to a past observation in 2000
when the trough was significantly stronger. The relative weakness of the UV absorption may be due
to the soft X-ray absorber being too highly ionized and almost transparent in the UV band.
