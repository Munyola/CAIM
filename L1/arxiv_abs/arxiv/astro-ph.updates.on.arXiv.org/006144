Stars form in molecular complexes that are visible as giant clouds ($\sim 10^{5-6} \mathrm{M}_\odot$)
in nearby galaxies and as giant clumps ($\sim 10^{8-9}\mathrm{M}_\odot$) in galaxies at redshifts
$z\approx1$$-$$3$. Theoretical inferences on the origin and evolution of these complexes often
require robust measurements of their characteristic size, which is hard to measure at limited resolution
and often ill-defined due to overlap and quasi-fractal substructure. We show that maximum and luminosity-weighted
sizes of clumps seen in star formation maps (e.g.\ H$\alpha$) can be recovered statistically using
the two-point correlation function (2PCF), if an approximate stellar surface density map is taken
as the normalizing random field. After clarifying the link between Gaussian clumps and the 2PCF
analytically, we design a method for measuring the diameters of Gaussian clumps with realistic
quasi-fractal substructure. This method is tested using mock images of clumpy disk galaxies at
different spatial resolutions and perturbed by Gaussian white noise. We find that the 2PCF can recover
the input clump scale at $\sim20\%$ accuracy, as long as this scale is larger than the spatial resolution.
We apply this method to the local spiral galaxy NGC 5194, as well as to three clumpy turbulent galaxies
from the DYNAMO-HST sample. In both cases, our statistical H$\alpha$-clump size measurements
agree with previous measurements and with the estimated Jeans lengths. However, the new measurements
are free from subjective choices when fitting individual clumps.
