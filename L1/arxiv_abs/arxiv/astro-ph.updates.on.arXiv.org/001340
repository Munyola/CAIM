We use our Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) cosmological particle-mesh N-body code to investigate
the feasibility of structure formation in a framework involving MOND and light sterile neutrinos
in the mass range 11 - 300 eV: always assuming that \Omega_{\nu_s}=0.225 for H_o=72 \kms Mpc^{-1}.
We run a suite of simulations with variants on the expansion history, cosmological variation of
the MOND acceleration constant, different normalisations of the power spectrum of the initial
perturbations and interpolating functions. Using various box sizes, but typically with ones of
length 256 Mpc/h, we compare our simulated halo mass functions with observed cluster mass functions
and show that (i) the sterile neutrino mass must be larger than 30 eV to account for the low mass (M_{200}<10^{14.6}
solar masses) clusters of galaxies in MOND and (ii) regardless of sterile neutrino mass or any of
the variations we mentioned above, it is not possible to form the correct number of high mass (M_{200}>10^{15.1}
solar masses) clusters of galaxies: there is always a considerable over production. This means
that the ansatz of considering the weak-field limit of MOND together with a component of light sterile
neutrinos to form structure from z ~ 200 fails. If MOND is the correct description of weak-field gravitational
dynamics, it could mean that subtle effects of the additional fields in covariant theories of MOND
render the ansatz inaccurate, or that the gravity generated by light sterile neutrinos (or by similar
hot dark matter particles) is different from that generated by the baryons.
