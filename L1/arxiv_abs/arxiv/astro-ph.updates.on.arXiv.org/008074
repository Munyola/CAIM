The Galactic halo contains a complex ecosystem of multiphase intermediate-velocity and high-velocity
gas clouds whose origin has defied clear explanation. They are generally believed to be involved
in a Galaxy-wide recycling process, either through an accretion flow or a large-scale fountain
flow, or both. Here we examine the evolution of these clouds in light of recent claims that they may
trigger condensation of gas from the Galactic corona as they move through it. Specifically, we measure
gas condensation along a cloud's wake, with and without the presence of an ambient magnetic field,
using two- and three-dimensional, high-resolution Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR) simulations.
We find that three-dimensional simulations are essential to capture the condensation even when
no magnetic field is included. Magnetic fields significantly inhibit condensation in the wake
of clouds at $t \gtrsim 25$ Myr, preventing the sharp upturn in cold gas mass seen in previous non-magnetic
studies. The magnetic field suppresses the onset of the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability which is
responsible for the ablation and consequent mixing of cloud and halo gas that drives the condensation.
This effect is universal across different properties of the cloud (density, metallicity, and velocity)
and of the magnetic field (strength and orientation), with exception of weak fields parallel to
the cloud's motion. Our results show that an ambient magnetic field drastically lowers the efficiency
of fountain-driven accretion and the efficiency of recycling and accretion from condensation
around high-velocity clouds.
