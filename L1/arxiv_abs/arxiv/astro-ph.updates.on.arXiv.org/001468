We model the photometry of RS CVn star $\sigma$ Geminorum to obtain new information on the changes
of the surface starspot distribution, i.e., activity cycles, differential rotation and active
longitudes. We use the previously published Continuous Periods Search-method (CPS) to analyse
V-band differential photometry obtained between the years 1987 and 2010 with the T3 0.4 m Automated
Telescope at the Fairborn Observatory. The CPS-method divides data into short subsets and then
models the light curves with Fourier-models of variable orders and provides estimates of the mean
magnitude, amplitude, period and light curve minima. These light curve parameters are then analysed
for signs of activity cycles, differential rotation and active longitudes. We confirm the presence
of two previously found stable active longitudes, synchronised with the orbital period $P_{\rm{orb}}=19.60$d
and find eight events where the active longitudes are disrupted. The epochs of the primary light
curve minima rotate with a shorter period $P_{\rm{min,1}}=19.47$d than the orbital motion. If
the variations in the photometric rotation period were to be caused by differential rotation, this
would give a differential rotation coefficient of $\alpha \ge 0.103$. The presence of two slightly
different periods of active regions may indicate a superposition of two dynamo modes, one stationary
in the orbital frame and the other one propagating in the azimuthal direction. Our estimate of the
differential rotation is much higher than previous results. However, simulations show that this
can be caused by insufficient sampling in our data.
