Gamma-ray burst (GRB) central engines and jet production mechanisms are still open questions.
Assuming that the shallow decay segments of canonical X-ray afterglow lightcurves of {\em Swift}
GRBs are attributed to the magnetic dipole (MD) radiations of newly-born magnetars, we derive the
parameters of the magnetars and explore their possible relations to jet and MD wind emission. We
show that the magnetar initial spin period ($P_0$) are tightly correlated with the jet energy ($E_{\rm
jet}$), which is almost proportional to the wind energy ($E_{\rm wind}$). Our least square fits
yield $P_0\propto E^{-0.36\pm 0.03}_{\rm jet}$ and $E_{\rm wind}\propto E^{0.91\pm 0.07}_{\rm
jet}$. These relations may imply that a magnetar with faster rotating speed can power a more energetic
GRB, and energy partition between the jet and wind may be quasi-universal. Although the $P_0-E_{\rm
jet}$ relation is driven by a few sub-energetic GRBs in our sample, our Monte Carlo simulation analysis
shows that sample selection biases from instrumental flux limits and contaminations of the bright
jet afterglows cannot make this correlation. Within this jet-wind paradigm, we propose that GRB
101225A-like ultra-long GRBs, whose prompt gamma-ray/X-ray lightcurves are featured as a long-lasting
plateau with a sharp drop, may be the orphan MD wind emission being due to misalignment of their jet
axis to the light of sight. Brief discussion on the orphan MD wind emission and its association with
the gravitational wave radiation of newly-born magnetars is presented.
