RX J0046.5$-$7308 is a shell-type supernova remnant (SNR) in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC).
We carried out new $^{12}$CO($J$ = 1-0, 3-2) observations toward the SNR using Mopra and ASTE. We
found eight molecular clouds (A-H) along the X-ray shell of the SNR. The typical cloud size and mass
are $\sim$10-15 pc and $\sim$2000-5000 $M_{\odot}$, respectively. The X-ray shell is slightly
deformed and has the brightest peak in the southwestern shell where two molecular clouds A and B are
located. The four molecular clouds A, B, F, and G have high intensity ratios of $^{12}$CO($J$ = 3-2)
/ $^{12}$CO($J$ = 1-0) $> 1.2$, not attributable to any identified internal infrared sources or
high-mass stars. The HI cavity and its expanding motion are found toward the SNR, which are likely
created by strong stellar winds from a massive progenitor. We suggest that the molecular clouds
A-D, F, G, and HI clouds within the wind-blown cavity at $V_\mathrm{LSR} = 117.1$-122.5 km s$^{-1}$
are to be associated with the SNR. The X-ray spectroscopy reveals the dynamical age of $26000^{+1000}_{-2000}$
yr and the progenitor mass of $\gtrsim 30$ $M_{\odot}$, which is also consistent with the proposed
scenario. We determine physical conditions of the giant molecular cloud LIRS 36A using the large
velocity gradient analysis with archival datasets of ALMA; the kinematic temperature is $72^{+50}_{-37}$
K and the number density of molecular hydrogen is $1500^{+600}_{-300}$ cm$^{-3}$. Next generation
of $\gamma$-ray observations will allow us to study the pion-decay $\gamma$-rays from the molecular
clouds in the SMC SNR.
