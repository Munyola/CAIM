Phosphorus nitride (PN) is the P-bearing species with the highest number of detections in star-forming
regions. Multi-line studies of the molecule have shown that the excitation temperature of PN is
usually lower than the gas kinetic temperature, suggesting that PN is likely in conditions of sub-thermal
excitation. We present an analysis of PN which takes the possible sub-thermal excitation conditions
into account in a sample of 24 massive star-forming regions. We observed PN (2-1), (3-2), (4-3),
and (6-5) with the IRAM-30m and APEX telescopes and detected PN lines in 15 of them. Together with
9 similar sources detected in PN in previous works, we have analysed the largest sample of star-forming
regions to date, made of 33 sources with 24 detections in total (among which 13 are new detections).
Hence, we have increased the number of star-forming regions detected in PN by more than a factor 2.
Our analysis indicates that the PN lines are indeed sub-thermally excited, but well described by
a single excitation temperature. We have compared line profiles and fractional abundances of PN
and SiO, a typical shock tracer, and found that almost all objects detected in PN have high-velocity
SiO wings. Moreover, the SiO and PN abundances with respect to H2 are correlated over several orders
of magnitude, and uncorrelated with gas temperature. This clearly shows that the production of
PN is strongly linked to the presence of shocked gas, and rules out alternative scenarios based on
thermal evaporation from iced grain mantles.
