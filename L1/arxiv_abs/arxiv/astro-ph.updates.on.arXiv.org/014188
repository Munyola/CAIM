Radio minihalos are diffuse synchrotron sources of unknown origin found in the cool cores of some
galaxy clusters. We use GMRT and VLA data to expand the sample of minihalos by reporting three new
minihalo detections (A 2667, A 907 and PSZ1 G139.61+24.20) and confirming minihalos in five clusters
(MACS J0159.8-0849, MACS J0329.6-0211, RXC J2129.6+0005, AS 780 and A 3444). With these new detections
and confirmations, the sample now stands at 23, the largest sample to date. For consistency, we also
reanalyze archival VLA 1.4 GHz observations of 7 known minihalos. We revisit possible correlations
between the non-thermal emission and the thermal properties of their cluster hosts. Consistently
with our earlier findings from a smaller sample, we find no strong relation between the minihalo
radio luminosity and the total cluster mass. Instead, we find a strong positive correlation between
the minihalo radio power and X-ray bolometric luminosity of the cool core (r<70 kpc). This supplements
our earlier result that most if not all cool cores in massive clusters contain a minihalo. Comparison
of radio and Chandra X-ray images indicates that the minihalo emission is typically confined by
concentric sloshing cold fronts in the cores of most of our clusters, supporting the hypothesis
that minihalos arise from electron reacceleration by turbulence caused by core gas sloshing. Taken
together, our findings suggest that the origin of minihalos should be closely related to the properties
of thermal plasma in cluster cool cores.
