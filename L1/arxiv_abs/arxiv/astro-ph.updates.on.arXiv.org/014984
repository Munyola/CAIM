When planets receive insolation above a certain critical value called the runaway threshold, liquid
surface water vaporizes completely, which forms the inner edge of the habitable zone. Because land
planets can emit a large amount of radiation from the dry tropics, they have a higher runaway threshold
than aqua planets do. Here we systematically investigated the runaway threshold for various surface
water distributions using a three-dimensional dynamic atmosphere model. The runaway threshold
for the meridionally uniform surface water distribution increases from the typical value for the
aqua-planet regime (~130% S0) to one for the land-planet regime (~155% S0) as the dry surface area
increases, where S0 is the present Earth's insolation. Although this result is similar to the previous
work considering zonally uniform surface water distributions, the runaway threshold for the land-planet
regime is quite low compared to that of the previous work. This is because a part of the tropical atmosphere
is always wet for the meridionally uniform case. We also considered the surface water distributions
determined by the Earth's, Mars' and Venus' topographies. We found that their runaway thresholds
are close to that for the meridionally uniform cases, and the amount of water at the boundary between
an aqua- and land-planet regime is around 10% of the Earth's ocean. This clearly shows that the runaway
threshold is not determined uniquely by the luminosity of the central star, but it has a wide range
caused by the surface water distribution of the terrestrial water planet itself.
