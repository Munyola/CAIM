We perform a comprehensive analysis of the planetary nebula (PN) NGC6781 to investigate the physical
conditions of each of its ionized, atomic, and molecular gas and dust components and the object's
evolution, based on panchromatic observational data ranging from UV to radio. Empirical nebular
elemental abundances, compared with theoretical predictions via nucleosynthesis models of asymptotic
giant branch (AGB) stars, indicate that the progenitor is a solar-metallicity, 2.25-3.0 Msun initial-mass
star. We derive the best-fit distance of 0.46 kpc by fitting the stellar luminosity (as a function
of the distance and effective temperature of the central star) with the adopted post-AGB evolutionary
tracks. Our excitation energy diagram analysis indicate high excitation temperatures in the photodissociation
region (PDR) beyond the ionized part of the nebula, suggesting extra heating by shock interactions
between the slow AGB wind and the fast PN wind. Through iterative fitting using the Cloudy code with
empirically-derived constraints, we find the best-fit dusty photoionization model of the object
that would inclusively reproduce all of the adopted panchromatic observational data. The estimated
total gas mass (0.41 Msun) corresponds to the mass ejected during the last AGB thermal pulse event
predicted for a 2.5 Msun initial-mass star. A significant fraction of the total mass (about 70 percent)
is found to exist in the PDR, demonstrating the critical importance of the PDR in PNe that are generally
recognized as the hallmark of ionized/H+ regions.
