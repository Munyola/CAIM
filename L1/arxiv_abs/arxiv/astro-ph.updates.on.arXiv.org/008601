We measure the projected galaxy clustering and galaxy-galaxy lensing signals using the Galaxy
And Mass Assembly (GAMA) survey and Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS) to study galaxy bias. We use the concept
of non-linear and stochastic galaxy biasing in the framework of halo occupation statistics to constrain
the parameters of the halo occupation statistics and to unveil the origin of galaxy biasing. The
bias function $\Gamma_{\text{gm}}(r_{\text{p}})$, where $r_{\text{p}}$ is the projected comoving
separation, is evaluated using the analytical halo model from which the scale dependence of $\Gamma_{\text{gm}}(r_{\text{p}})$,
and the origin of the non-linearity and stochasticity in halo occupation models can be inferred.
Our observations unveil the physical reason for the non-linearity and stochasticity, further
explored using hydrodynamical simulations, with the stochasticity mostly originating from the
non-Poissonian behaviour of satellite galaxies in the dark matter haloes and their spatial distribution,
which does not follow the spatial distribution of dark matter in the halo. The observed non-linearity
is mostly due to the presence of the central galaxies, as was noted from previous theoretical work
on the same topic. We also see that overall, more massive galaxies reveal a stronger scale dependence,
and out to a larger radius. Our results show that a wealth of information about galaxy bias is hidden
in halo occupation models. These models should therefore be used to determine the influence of galaxy
bias in cosmological studies.
