Previous X-ray observations toward the Nuclear Star Cluster (NSC) at the Galactic center have discovered
thousands of point sources, most of which were believed to be cataclysmic variables (CVs), i.e.,
a white dwarf (WD) accreting from a low-mass companion. However, the population properties of these
CVs remain unclear, which otherwise contain important information about the evolutionary history
of the NSC. In this work we utilize ultradeep archival \textit{Chandra} observations to study the
spectral properties of the NSC CVs, in close comparison with those in the Solar vicinity. We find
that the NSC CVs have strong Fe XXV and Fe XXVI lines (both of which show equivalent widths $\sim200-300$
eV), indicating metal-rich companions. Moreover, their Fe XXVI to Fe XXV line flux ratio is used
to diagnose the characteristic white dwarf mass ($M_{\rm WD}$) of NSC CVs. The results show that
the CVs with $L_{\rm 2-10 keV}>6\times10^{31}$ erg s$^{-1}$ have a mean $M_{\rm WD}$ of $\sim0.6/1.0\,M_{\odot}$
if they are magnetic/non-magnetic CVs; while those with $L_{\rm 2-10 keV}$ between $1-6\times10^{31}$
erg s$^{-1}$ have a mean $M_{\rm WD}$ of $\sim0.8/1.2\,M_{\odot}$ if they are magnetic/non-magnetic
CVs. All these \textit{Chandra}-detected CVs collectively contribute $\sim$30-50\% of the unresolved
20-40 keV X-ray emission from the NSC. The CV population with massive (i.e., $M_{\rm WD}\sim1.2M_{\odot}$)
WDs have not been observed in the Solar vicinity or the Galactic bulge, and they might have been formed
via dynamical encounters in the NSC.
