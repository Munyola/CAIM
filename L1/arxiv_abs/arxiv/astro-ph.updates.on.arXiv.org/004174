We revisit the estimation of the combined mass of the Milky Way and Andromeda (M31), which dominate
the mass of the Local Group. We make use of an ensemble of 30,190 halo pairs from the Small MultiDark
simulation, assuming a $\Lambda$CDM (Cosmological Constant with Cold Dark Matter) cosmology,
to investigate the relationship between the bound mass and parameters characterising the orbit
of the binary and their local environment with the aid of machine learning methods (artificial neural
networks, ANN). Results from the ANN are most successful when information about the velocity shear
is provided, which demonstrates the flexibility of machine learning to model physical phenomena
and readily incorporate new information as it becomes available. The resulting estimate for the
Local Group mass, when shear information is included, is $4.9 \times 10^{12} M_\odot$, with an error
of $\pm0.8 \times 10^{12} M_\odot$ from the 68% uncertainty in observables, and a 68% confidence
interval of $^{+1.3}_{-1.4} \times 10^{12}M_\odot$ from the intrinsic scatter from the differences
between the model and simulation masses. We also consider a recently reported large transverse
velocity of M31 relative to the Milky Way, and produce an alternative mass estimate of $3.6\pm0.3\pm1.4
\times 10^{12}M_\odot$. Although different methods predict similar values for the most likely
mass of the LG, application of ANN compared to the Timing Argument reduces the scatter in the log mass
by over half when tested on samples from the simulation.
