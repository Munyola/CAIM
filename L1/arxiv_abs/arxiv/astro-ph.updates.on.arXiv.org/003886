We present experimental constraints on the insertion of oxygen atoms into methane to form methanol
in astrophysical ice analogs. In gas-phase and theoretical studies this process has previously
been demonstrated to have a very low or non-existent energy barrier, but the energetics and mechanisms
have not yet been characterized in the solid state. We use a deuterium UV lamp filtered by a sapphire
window to selectively dissociate O2 within a mixture of O2:CH4 and observe efficient production
of CH3OH via O(1D) insertion. CH3OH growth curves are fit with a kinetic model, and we observe no temperature
dependence of the reaction rate constant at temperatures below the oxygen desorption temperature
of 25K. Through an analysis of side products we determine the branching ratio of ice-phase oxygen
insertion into CH4: ~65% of insertions lead to CH3OH with the remainder leading instead to H2CO formation.
There is no evidence for CH3 or OH radical formation, indicating that the fragmentation is not an
important channel and that insertions typically lead to increased chemical complexity. CH3OH
formation from O2 and CH4 diluted in a CO-dominated ice similarly shows no temperature dependence,
consistent with expectations that insertion proceeds with a small or non-existent barrier. Oxygen
insertion chemistry in ices should therefore be efficient under low-temperature ISM-like conditions,
and could provide an important channel to complex organic molecule formation on grain surfaces
in cold interstellar regions such as cloud cores and protoplanetary disk midplanes.
