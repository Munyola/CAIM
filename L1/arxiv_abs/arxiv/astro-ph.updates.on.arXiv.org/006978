In symbiotic binaries, jets and disk winds may be integral to the physics of accretion onto white
dwarfs from cool giants. The persistent outflow from symbiotic star MWC 560 (=V694 Mon) is known
to manifest as low-ionization broad absorption lines (BALs), most prominently at the Balmer transitions,
and as high-ionization BALs from metastable He I*. We report the detection of higher-ionization
BALs from C IV, Si IV, N V, and He II in International Ultraviolet Explorer spectra obtained on 1990
April 29-30, when an optical outburst temporarily erased the obscuring 'iron curtain' of absorption
troughs from Fe II and similar ions. The C IV and Si IV BALs reached maximum radial velocities at least
1000 km/s faster than contemporaneous Mg II and He II BALs; the same behaviors occur in the winds of
quasars and cataclysmic variables. An iron curtain lifts to unveil high-ionization BALs during
the P Cygni phase observed in some novae, suggesting by analogy a temporary switch in MWC 560 from
persistent outflow to discrete mass ejection. At least three more symbiotic stars exhibit broad
absorption with blue edges faster than 1500 km/s; exclusively high-ionization BALs have been reported
in AS 304 (=V4018 Sgr), while instead transient Balmer BALs have been reported in Z And and CH Cyg.
These BAL-producing fast outflows can have wider opening angles than has been previously supposed.
BAL symbiotics are short-timescale laboratories for their giga-scale analogs, broad absorption
line quasars (BALQSOs), which display a similarly wide range of ionization states in their winds.
