Using the disc instability model for dwarf novae and soft X-ray transients, we investigate the stability
of accretion discs in long-period binary systems. We simulate outbursts due to this thermal-viscous
instability for two symbiotic systems, RS~Ophiuchi and Z~Andromedae. The outburst properties
deduced from our simulations suggest that, although the recurrent nova events observed in RS~Oph
are due to a thermonuclear runaway at the white dwarf surface, these runaways are triggered by accretion
disc instabilities. In quiescence, the disc builds up its mass and it is only during the disc-instability
outburst that mass is accreted on to the white dwarf at rates comparable to or larger than the mass-transfer
rate. For a mass-transfer rate in the range $10^{-8}$ to $10^{-7}~{\rm M}_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$,
the accretion rate and the mass accreted are sufficient to lead to a thermonuclear runaway during
one of a series of a few dwarf nova outbursts, barely visible in the optical, but easily detectable
in X-rays. In the case of Z~And, persistent irradiation of the disc by the very hot white-dwarf surface
strongly modifies the dwarf-nova outburst properties, making them significant only for very high
mass-transfer rates, of the order of $10^{-6}~{\rm M}_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$, much higher than the
expected secular mean in this system. It is thus likely that the so-called `combination nova' outburst
observed in years 2000 to 2002 was triggered not by a dwarf-nova instability but by a mass-transfer
enhancement from the giant companion, leading to an increase in nuclear burning at the accreting
white-dwarf surface.
