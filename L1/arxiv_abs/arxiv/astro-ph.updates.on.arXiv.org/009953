We investigate the alignment of haloes with the filaments of the cosmic web using an unprecedently
large sample of dark matter haloes taken from the P-Millennium $\Lambda$CDM cosmological N-body
simulation. We use the state-of-the-art NEXUS morphological formalism which, due to its multiscale
nature, simultaneously identifies structures at all scales. We find strong and highly significant
alignments, with both the major axis of haloes and their peculiar velocity tending to orient along
the filament. However, the spin - filament alignment displays a more complex trend changing from
preferentially parallel at low masses to preferentially perpendicular at high masses. This "spin
flip" occurs at an average mass of $5\times10^{11}~h^{-1}M_\odot$. This mass increases with increasing
filament diameter, varying by more than an order of magnitude between the thinnest and thickest
filament samples. We also find that the inner parts of haloes have a spin flip mass that is several
times smaller than that of the halo as a whole. These results confirm that recent accretion is responsible
for the complex behaviour of the halo spin - filament alignment. Low-mass haloes mainly accrete
mass along directions perpendicular to their host filament and thus their spins tend to be oriented
along the filaments. In contrast, high-mass haloes mainly accrete along their host filaments and
have their spins preferentially perpendicular to them. Furthermore, haloes located in thinner
filaments are more likely to accrete along their host filaments than haloes of the same mass located
in thicker filaments.
