Phyllosilicates are hydrous minerals formed by interaction between rock and liquid water and are
commonly found in meteorites originating in the asteroid belt. Collisions between asteroids contribute
to zodiacal dust, which therefore reasonably could include phyllosilicates. Collisions between
planetesimals in protoplanetary disks may also produce dust containing phyllosilicates. These
minerals possess characteristic emission features in the mid-infrared and could be detectable
in extrasolar protoplanetary disks. Here we determine whether phyllosilicates in protoplanetary
disks are detectable in the infrared using instruments such as those on board the Spitzer Space Telescope
and SOFIA (Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy). We calculate opacities for the
phyllosilicates most common in meteorites and compute the emission of radiation from a protoplanetary
disk using a 2-layer radiative transfer model. We find that phyllosilicates present at the 3% level
lead to observationally significant differences in disk spectra, and should therefore be detectable
using infrared observations and spectral modeling. Detection of phyllosilicates in a protoplanetary
disk would be diagnostic of liquid water in planetesimals in that disk and would demonstrate similarity
to our own Solar System. We also discuss use of phyllosilicate emission to test the "waterworlds"
hypothesis, which proposes that liquid water in planetesimals should correlate with the inventory
of short-lived radionuclides in planetary systems, especially 26Al.
