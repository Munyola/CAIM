We report first results from a large project to measure black hole (BH) mass in high accretion rate
active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Such objects may be different from other AGNs in being powered by
slim accretion disks and showing saturated accretion luminosities, but both not yet fully understood.
The results are part of a large reverberation mapping (RM) campaign using the 2.4-m Shangri-La telescope
at the Yunnan Observatory in China. The goals are to investigate the gas distribution near the BH
and the properties of the central accretion disks, to measure BH mass and Edddington rates, and to
test the feasibility of using such objects as a new type of cosmological candles. The paper presents
results for three objects, Mrk 335, Mrk 142 and IRAS F12397+3333 with H$\beta$ time lags relative
to the 5100\AA\ continuum of $10.6^{+1.7}_{-2.9}$, $6.4^{+0.8}_{-2.2}$ and $11.4^{+2.9}_{-1.9}$
days, respectively. The corresponding BH masses are $(6.0_{-2.0}^{+1.5})\times 10^6M_{\odot}$,
$(3.4_{-1.4}^{+0.8})\times 10^6M_{\odot}$ and $(4.6_{-1.2}^{+1.5})\times 10^6M_{\odot}$,
and the lower limits on the Eddington rates 1.1, 2.2, and 12.7 for the minimal radiative efficiency
of 0.038. Mrk 142 and IRAS F12397+333 (extinction corrected) clearly deviate from the currently
known relation between H$\beta$ lag and continuum luminosity. The three Eddington rates are beyond
the values expected in thin accretion disks and two of them are the largest measured so far among objects
with RM-based BH masses. We briefly discuss implications for slim disks, BH growth and cosmology.
