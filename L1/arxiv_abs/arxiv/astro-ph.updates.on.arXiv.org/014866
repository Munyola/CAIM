CO is the most widely used gas tracer of protoplanetary disks. Its abundance is usually assumed to
be an interstellar ratio throughout the warm molecular layer of the disk. But recent observations
of low CO gas abundance in many protoplanetary disks challenge our understanding of physical and
chemical evolutions in disks. Here we investigate the CO abundance structures in four well-studied
disks and compare their structures with predictions of chemical processing of CO and transport
of CO ice-coated dust grains in disks. We use spatially resolved CO isotopologue line observations
and detailed thermo-chemical models to derive CO abundance structures. We find that the CO abundance
varies with radius by an order of magnitude in these disks. We show that although chemical processes
can efficiently reduce the total column of CO gas within 1 Myr under an ISM level of cosmic-ray ionization
rate, the depletion mostly occurs at the deep region of a disk. Without sufficient vertical mixing,
the surface layer is not depleted enough to reproduce weak CO emissions observed. The radial profiles
of CO depletion in three disks are qualitatively consistent with predictions of pebble formation,
settling, and drifting in disks. But the dust evolution alone cannot fully explain the high depletion
observed in some disks. These results suggest that dust evolution may play a significant role in
transporting volatile materials and a coupled chemical-dynamical study is necessary to understand
what raw materials are available for planet formation at different distances from the central star.
