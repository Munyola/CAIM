Studying bright ($M_B<-20$), intermediate-redshift ($0.4<z<1.0$), disc dominated ($n_B<2.5$)
galaxies from HST/ACS and WFC3 in Chandra Deep Field South, in rest-frame B and I-band, we found a
new class of bulges which is brighter and more compact than ellipticals. We refer to them as "Bright,
Compact Bulges" (BCBs) - they resemble neither classical nor pseudo-bulges and constitute $\sim12$%
of the total bulge population at these redshifts. Examining free-bulge $+$ disc decomposition
sample and elliptical galaxy sample from Simard et al. (2011), we find that only $\sim0.2$% of the
bulges can be classified as BCBs in the local Universe. Bulge to total ratio $(B/T)$ of disc galaxies
with BCBs is (at $\sim0.4$) a factor of $\sim2$ and $\sim4$ larger than for those with classical and
pseudo bulges. BCBs are $\sim2.5$ and $\sim6$ times more massive than classical and pseudo bulges.
Although disc galaxies with BCBs host the most massive and dominant bulge type, their specific star
formation rate is $1.5-2$ times higher than other disc galaxies. This is contrary to the expectations
that a massive compact bulge would lead to lower star formation rates. We speculate that our BCB host
disc galaxies are descendant of massive, compact and passive elliptical galaxies observed at higher
redshifts. Those high redshift ellipticals lack local counterparts and possibly evolved by acquiring
a compact disc around them. The overall properties of BCBs supports a picture of galaxy assembly
in which younger discs are being accreted around massive pre-existing spheroids.
