We report on discovery results from a quasar lens search in the ATLAS public footprint, extending
quasar lens searches to a regime without $u-$band or fiber-spectroscopic information, using a
combination of data mining techniques on multi-band catalog magnitudes and image-cutout modelling.
Spectroscopic follow-up campaigns, conducted at the 2.6m Nordic Optical Telescope (La Palma)
and 3.6m New Technology Telescope (La Silla) in 2016, yielded seven pairs of quasars exhibiting
the same lines at the same redshift and monotonic flux-ratios with wavelength (hereafter NIQs,
Nearly Identical Quasar pairs). The quasar redshifts range between $\approx1.2$ and $\approx
2.7;$ contaminants are typically pairs of bright blue stars, quasar-star alignments along the
line of sight, and narrow-line galaxies at $0.3<z<0.7.$ Magellan data of A0140-1152 (01$^h$40$^m$03.0$^s$-11$^d$52$^m$19.0$^s$,
$z_{s}=1.807$) confirm it as a lens with deflector at $z_{l}=0.277$ and Einstein radius $\theta_{\rm
E}=(0.73\pm0.02)^\ase$. We show the use of spatial resolution from the Gaia mission to select lenses
and list additional systems from a WISE-Gaia-ATLAS search, yielding three additional lenses (02$^h$35$^m$27.4$^s$-24$^d$33$^m$13.2$^s$,
02$^h$59$^m$33.$^s$-23$^d$38$^m$01.8$^s$, 01$^h$46$^m$32.9$^s$-11$^d$33$^m$39.0$^s$).
The overall sample consists of 11 lenses/NIQs, plus three lenses known before 2016, over the ATLAS-DR3
footprint ($\approx3500$~deg$^2$). Finally, we discuss future prospects for objective classification
of pair/NIQ/contaminant spectra.
