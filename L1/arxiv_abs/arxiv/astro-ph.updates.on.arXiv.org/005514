A more fine-tuned method for probing planet-forming regions, such as protoplanetary discs, could
be rovibrational molecular spectroscopy observation of particular premineral molecules instead
of more common but ultimately less related volatile organic compounds. Planets are created when
grains aggregate, but how molecules form grains is an ongoing topic of discussion in astrophysics
and planetary science. Using the spectroscopic data of molecules specifically involved in mineral
formation could help to map regions where planet formation is believed to be occurring in order to
examine the interplay between gas and dust. Four atoms are frequently associated with planetary
formation: Fe, Si, Mg, and O. Magnesium, in particular, has been shown to be in higher relative abundance
in planet-hosting stars. Magnesium oxide crystals comprise the mineral periclase making it the
chemically simplest magnesium-bearing mineral and a natural choice for analysis. The monomer,
dimer, and trimer forms of (MgO)_n with n = 1 - 3 are analyzed in this work using high-level quantum
chemical computations known to produce accurate results. Strong vibrational transitions at 12.5
{\mu}m, 15.0 {\mu}m, and 16.5 {\mu}m are indicative of magnesium oxide monomer, dimer, and trimer
making these wavelengths of particular interest for the observation of protoplanetary discs and
even potentially planet-forming regions around stars. If such transitions are observed in emission
from the accretion discs or absorptions from stellar spectra, the beginning stages of mineral and,
subsequently, rocky body formation could be indicated.
