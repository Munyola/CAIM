We study the interstellar medium (ISM) properties of three heavily reddened quasars at $z\sim2.5$
as well as three millimetre-bright companion galaxies near these quasars. New JVLA and ALMA observations
constrain the CO(1-0), CO(7-6) and [CI]$^3$P$_2-^3$P$_1$ line emission as well as the far infrared
to radio continuum. The gas excitation and physical properties of the ISM are constrained by comparing
our observations to photo-dissociation region (PDR) models. The ISM in our high-redshift quasars
is composed of very high-density, high-temperature gas which is already highly enriched in elements
like carbon. One of our quasar hosts is shown to be a close-separation ($<$2 arcsec) major merger
with different line emission properties in the millimeter-bright galaxy and quasar components.
Low angular resolution observations of high-redshift quasars used to assess quasar excitation
properties should therefore be interpreted with caution as they could potentially be averaging
over multiple components with different ISM conditions. Our quasars and their companion galaxies
show a range of CO excitation properties spanning the full extent from starburst-like to quasar-like
spectral line energy distributions. We compare gas masses based on CO, CI and dust emission, and
find that these can disagree when standard assumptions are made regarding the values of $\alpha_{\rm{CO}}$,
the gas-to-dust ratio and the atomic carbon abundances. We conclude that the ISM properties of our
quasars and their companion galaxies are diverse and likely vary spatially across the full extent
of these complex, merging systems.
