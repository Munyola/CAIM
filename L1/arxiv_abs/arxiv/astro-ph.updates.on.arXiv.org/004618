The velocity and density distribution of $e^\pm$ in the pulsar wind are crucial distinction among
magnetosphere models, and contains key parameters determining the high energy emission of pulsar
binaries. In this work, a direct method is proposed, which might probe the properties of the wind
from one pulsar in a double-pulsar binary. When the radio signals from the first-formed pulsar travel
through the relativistic $e^\pm$ flow in the pulsar wind from the younger companion, the components
of different radio frequencies will be dispersed. It will introduce an additional frequency-dependent
time-of-arrival delay of pulses, which is function of the orbital phase. In this paper, we formulate
the above-mentioned dispersive delay with the properties of the pulsar wind. As examples, we apply
the formula to the double pulsar system PSR J0737-3039A/B and the pulsar-neutron star binary PSR
B1913+16. For PSR J0737-3039A/B, the time delay in 300\,MHz is $\lesssim10\mu$s near the superior-conjunction,
under the optimal pulsar wind parameters, which is $\sim$ half of the current timing accuracy. For
PSR B1913+16, with the assumption that the neutron star companion has a typical spin down luminosity
of $10^{33}$\,ergs/s, the time delay is as large as $10\sim20\mu$s in 300\,MHz. The best timing
precision of this pulsar is $\sim5\mu$s in 1400\,MHz. Therefore, it is possible that we can find
this signal in archival data. Otherwise, we can set an upper-limit on the spin down luminosity. Similar
analysis can be apply to other eleven known pulsar-neutron star binaries
