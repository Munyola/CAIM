MRT unstable plumes are observed in a loop-like eruptive prominence using SDO/AIA observations.
The small-scale cavities are developed within the prominence, where perturbations trigger dark
plumes (P1 \& P2) propagating with the speed of 35-46 km s$^{-1} $. The self-similar plume formation
shows initially the growth of linear MRT unstable plume (P1), and thereafter the evolution of non-linear
single mode MRT unstable second plume (P2). The Differential Emission Measure (DEM) analysis shows
that plumes are less denser and hotter than the prominence. We have estimated the observational
growth rate for both plumes as 1.32$\pm$0.29$\times$ 10$^{-3}$ s$^{-1}$ and 1.48$\pm$0.29$\times$
10$^{-3}$ s$^{-1}$ respectively, which are comparable to the estimated theoretical growth rate
(1.95$\times$ 10$^{-3}$ s$^{-1}$) . The nonlinear phase of an MRT unstable plume (P2) may collapse
via Kelvin-Helmholtz vortex formation in the downfalling plasma. Later, a plasma thread has been
evident in the rising segment of this prominence. It may be associated with the tangled field and
Rayleigh-Taylor instability. The tangled field initiates shearing at the prominence-cavity
boundary. Due to this shear motion, the plasma downfall has occurred at the right part of the prominence-cavity
boundary. It triggers the characteristic of KH unstable vortices and MRT unstable plasma bubbles
propagating at different speeds and merging with each other. The shear motion and lateral plasma
downfall may initiate hybrid KH-RT instability there.
