NU Ori is a massive spectroscopic and visual binary in the Orion Nebula Cluster, with 4 components:
Aa, Ab, B, and C. The B0.5 primary (Aa) is one of the most massive B-type stars reported to host a magnetic
field. We report the detection of a spectroscopic contribution from the C component in high-resolution
ESPaDOnS spectra, which is also detected in a Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI) dataset.
Radial velocity (RV) measurements of the inner binary (designated Aab) yield an orbital period
of 14.3027(7) d. The orbit of the third component (designated C) was constrained using both RVs and
interferometry. We find C to be on a mildly eccentric 476(1) d orbit. Thanks to spectral disentangling
of mean line profiles obtained via least-squares deconvolution we show that the Zeeman Stokes $V$
signature is clearly associated with C, rather than Aa as previously assumed. The physical parameters
of the stars were constrained using both orbital and evolutionary models, yielding $M_{\rm Aa}
= 14.9 \pm 0.5 M_\odot$, $M_{\rm Ab} = 3.9 \pm 0.7 M_\odot$, and $M_{\rm C} = 7.8 \pm 0.7 M_\odot$. The
rotational period obtained from longitudinal magnetic field $\langle B_z \rangle$ measurements
is $P_{\rm rot} = 1.09468(7)$ d, consistent with previous results. Modeling of $\langle B_z \rangle$
indicates a surface dipole magnetic field strength of $\sim 8$ kG. NU Ori C has a magnetic field strength,
rotational velocity, and luminosity similar to many other stars exhibiting magnetospheric H$\alpha$
emission, and we find marginal evidence of emission at the expected level ($\sim$1% of the continuum).
