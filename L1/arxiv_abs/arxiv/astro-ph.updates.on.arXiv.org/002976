We study the H$\alpha$ and Ca II 8542 \r{A} line spectra of four typical Ellerman bombs (EBs) in active
region NOAA 11765 on 2013 June 6, observed with the Fast Imaging Solar Spectrograph installed at
the 1.6 meter New Solar Telescope at Big Bear Solar Observatory. Considering that EBs may occur in
a restricted region in the lower atmosphere, and that their spectral lines show particular features,
we propose a two-cloud model to fit the observed line profiles. The lower cloud can account for the
wing emission, and the upper cloud is mainly responsible for the absorption at line center. After
choosing carefully the free parameters, we get satisfactory fitting results. As expected, the
lower cloud shows an increase of the source function, corresponding to a temperature increase of
400--1000 K in EBs relative to the quiet Sun. This is consistent with previous results deduced from
semi-empirical models and confirms that a local heating occurs in the lower atmosphere during the
appearance of EBs. We also find that the optical depths can increase to some extent in both the lower
and upper clouds, which may result from either a direct heating in the lower cloud, or illumination
by an enhanced radiation on the upper cloud. The velocities derived from this method, however, are
different from those obtained using the traditional bisector method, implying that one should
be cautious when interpreting this parameter. The two-cloud model can thus be used as an efficient
method to deduce the basic physical parameters of EBs.
