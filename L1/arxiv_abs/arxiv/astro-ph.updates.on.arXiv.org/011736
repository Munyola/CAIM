Asteroseismic analysis of solar-like stars allows us to determine physical parameters such as
stellar mass, with a higher precision compared to most other methods. Even in a well-studied cluster
such as the Hyades, the masses of the red giant stars are not well known, and previous mass estimates
are based on model calculations (isochrones). The four known red giants in the Hyades are assumed
to be clump (core-helium-burning) stars based on their positions in colour-magnitude diagrams,
however asteroseismology offers an opportunity to test this assumption. Using asteroseismic
techniques combined with other methods, we aim to derive physical parameters and the evolutionary
stage for the planet hosting star epsilon Tau, which is one of the four red giants located in the Hyades.
We analysed time-series data from both ground and space to perform the asteroseismic analysis.
By combining high signal-to-noise (S/N) radial-velocity data from the ground-based SONG network
with continuous space-based data from the revised Kepler mission K2, we derive and characterize
27 individual oscillation modes for epsilon Tau, along with global oscillation parameters such
as the large frequency separation and the ratio between the amplitude of the oscillations measured
in radial velocity and intensity as a function of frequency. The latter has been measured previously
for only two stars, the Sun and Procyon. Combining the seismic analysis with interferometric and
spectroscopic measurements, we derive physical parameters for epsilon Tau, and discuss its evolutionary
status.
