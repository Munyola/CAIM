We use 25 simulated galaxies from the NIHAO project to define and characterize a variety of kinematic
stellar structures: thin and thick discs, large scale single discs, classical and pseudo bulges,
spheroids, inner discs, and stellar haloes. These structures have masses, spins, shapes and rotational
support in good agreement with theoretical expectations and observational data. Above a dark matter
halo mass of $2.5\times10^{\rm~11}M_{\rm\odot}$, all galaxies have a classical bulge and 70\%
have a thin and thick disc. The kinematic (thin) discs follow a power-law relation between angular
momentum and stellar mass $J_{\rm *}=3.4M_{\rm *}^{\rm1.26\pm0.06}$, in very good agreement
with the prediction based on the empirical stellar-to-halo mass relation in the same mass range,
and show a strong correlation between maximum `observed' rotation velocity and dark matter halo
circular velocity $v_{\rm c}=6.4v_{\rm max}^{0.64\pm0.04}$. Tracing back in time these structures'
progenitors, we find all to lose a fraction $1-f_j$ of their maximum angular momentum. Thin discs
are significantly better at retaining their high-redshift spins ($f_j\sim0.70$) than thick ones
($f_j\sim0.40$). Stellar haloes have their progenitor baryons assembled the latest ($z_{\rm~1/2}\sim1.1$)
and over the longest timescales ($\tau\sim6.2$~Gyr), and have the smallest fraction of stars born
in-situ ($f_{\rm in-situ}=0.35\pm0.14$). All other structures have $1.5\lesssim z_{\rm1/2}\lesssim3$,
$\tau=4\pm2$~Gyr and $f_{\rm in-situ}\gtrsim0.9$.
