Narrowband imaging is a highly successful approach for finding large numbers of high redshift Lya
emitting galaxies (LAEs) up to z~6.6. However, at z>~7 there are as yet only 3 narrowband selected
LAEs with spectroscopic confirmations (two at z ~ 6.9-7.0, one at z ~ 7.3), which hinders extensive
studies on cosmic re-ionization and galaxy evolution at this key epoch. We have selected 23 candidate
z ~ 6.9 LAEs in COSMOS field with the large area narrowband survey LAGER (Lyman-Alpha Galaxies at
the End of Reionization). In this work we present spectroscopic followup observations of 12 candidates
using IMACS on Magellan. For 9 of these, the observations are sufficiently deep to detect the expected
lines. Lya emission lines are identified in six sources (yielding a success rate of 2/3), including
3 luminous LAEs with Lya luminosities of L(Lya) ~ 10^{43.4} erg/s. This triples the sample size of
spectroscopically confirmed narrowband selected LAEs at z>~7, and confirms the bright end bump
in the Lya luminosity function we previously derived based on the photometric sample, supporting
a patchy re-ionization scenario. Two luminous LAEs appear physically linked with projected distance
of 1.1 pMpc and velocity difference of ~ 170 km/s. They likely sit in a common ionized bubble produced
by themselves or with close neighbors, which reduces the IGM attention to Lya. A tentative narrow
NV{\lambda}1240 line is seen in one of the source, hinting activity of the central massive black
hole with metal rich line emitting gas.
