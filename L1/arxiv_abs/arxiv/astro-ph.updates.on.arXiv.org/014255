We search for host galaxy candidates of nearby fast radio bursts (FRBs), FRB 180729.J1316+55, FRB
171020, FRB 171213, FRB 180810.J1159+83, and FRB 180814.J0422+73 (the second repeating FRB source).
We compare these candidates with that of the first repeating FRB source, FRB 121102, in absolute
magnitudes and the expected host dispersion measure $\rm DM_{host}$. We find that the hosts of nearby
FRBs are not similar to that of FRB 121102. They tend to have either a smaller $\rm DM_{host}$ or be
fainter. Based on the host galaxy star formation rate (SFR), radius, and offsets, we also estimate
the contribution of $\rm DM_{host}$ from the host of long gamma ray bursts (LGRBs) and superluminous
supernovae (SLSNe), the proposed progenitor systems of FRB 121102. The FRB 121102 host is consistent
with those of LGRBs and SLSNe, whereas the nearby FRB host candidates either have a smaller $\rm DM_{host}$
or are fainter than the hosts of LGRBs and SLSNe. In order to avoid the uncertainty in estimating $\rm
DM_{host}$ due to the line-of-sight effect, we propose a galaxy-group-based method to estimate
the electron density in the inter-galactic regions, and hence, $\rm DM_{IGM}$. The result strengthens
our conclusion that the host galaxies of nearby FRBs, at least for FRB 180729.J1316+55, FRB 171020,
and FRB180814.J0422+73, are not similar to that of FRB 121102 or the typical hosts of LGRBs and SLSNe.
We conclude that the host galaxy of FRB 121102 is atypical and LGRBs and SLSNe are likely not the progenitor
systems of at least most nearby FRB sources.
