We investigate the general constraints that differential interferometry (DI) can yield on BLRs
and discuss the signatures of different BLR parameters, such as black hole mass, BLR size, thickness,
distribution of clouds, local micro or macroturbulence versus global velocity, rotation versus
inflow and outflow, and cloud optical thickness, on both DI and reverberation mapping (RM) observables,
describing a 3D geometrical and kinematic BLR model that can simulate all DI and RM observables.
Combination of DI and RM not only constrain the BLR geometry and kinematics, but also provide a way
to use BLRs as standard candles. It appears that DI can constrain the RM projection factor and decrease
the number of fixed model parameters. We use a SNR analysis of DI, updated and calibrated on our actual
3C273 data, to evaluate the number of targets accessible to current (AMBER+), upcoming (GRAVITY)
and possible VLTI instruments, that suggest the full potential of the VLTI exceeds 60 targets with
known improvements of instruments and fringe trackers. Using a MCMC algorithm on simulated data
we found that DI under RM constraints yields mass accuracies between 0.06 and 0.13 dex that is better
than the 0.44 dex in the current mass-luminosity fits. The combination of DI and RM on such a target
set, that covers a $10^{4}$ to $10^{5}$ luminosity range, should allow a decisive improvement in
RM mass-luminosity and size-luminosity laws and permit to evaluate a larger unification scheme
relating the main BLR characteristics to the luminosity of the central source.
