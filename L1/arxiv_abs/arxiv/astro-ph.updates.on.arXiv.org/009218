We present milliarcsecond (mas) angular resolution observations of the gravitationally lensed
radio source MG J0751+2716 (at z=3.2) obtained with global Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI)
at 1.65 GHz. The background object is highly resolved in the tangential and radial directions, showing
evidence of both compact and extended structure across several gravitational arcs that are 200
to 600~mas in size. By identifying compact sub-components in the multiple images, we constrain
the mass distribution of the foreground z=0.35 gravitational lens using analytic models for the
main deflector [power-law elliptical mass model; $\rho(r) \propto r^{-\gamma}$, where $\gamma=2$
corresponds to isothermal] and for the members of the galaxy group. Moreover, our mass models with
and without the group find an inner mass-density slope steeper than isothermal for the main lensing
galaxy, with $\gamma_1 = 2.08 \pm 0.02$ and $\gamma_2 = 2.16 \pm 0.02$ at the 4.2$\sigma$ level and
6.8$\sigma$ level, respectively, at the Einstein radius ($b_1 = 0.4025 \pm 0.0008$ and $b_2 = 0.307
\pm 0.002$ arcsec, respectively). We find randomly distributed image position residuals of about
3 mas, which are much larger that the measurement errors ($40$ $\mu$as on average). This suggests
that at the mas level, the assumption of a smooth mass distribution fails, requiring additional
structure in the model. However, given the environment of the lensing galaxy, it is not clear whether
this extra mass is in the form of sub-haloes within the lens or along the line of sight, or from a more
complex halo for the galaxy group.
