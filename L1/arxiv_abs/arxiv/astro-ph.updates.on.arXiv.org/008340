We present the first statistical study on the intrinsic three-dimensional (3D) shape of a sample
of 83 galactic bars extracted from the CALIFA survey. We use the galaXYZ code to derive the bar intrinsic
shape with a statistical approach. The method uses only the geometric information (ellipticities
and position angles) of bars and discs obtained from a multi-component photometric decomposition
of the galaxy surface-brightness distributions. We find that bars are predominantly prolate-triaxial
ellipsoids (68%), with a small fraction of oblate-triaxial ellipsoids (32%). The typical flattening
(intrinsic C/A semiaxis ratio) of the bars in our sample is 0.34, which matches well the typical intrinsic
flattening of stellar discs at these galaxy masses. We demonstrate that, for prolate-triaxial
bars, the intrinsic shape of bars depends on the galaxy Hubble type and stellar mass (bars in massive
S0 galaxies are thicker and more circular than those in less massive spirals). The bar intrinsic
shape correlates with bulge, disc, and bar parameters. In particular with the bulge-to-total (B/T)
luminosity ratio, disc g-r color, and central surface brightness of the bar, confirming the tight
link between bars and their host galaxies. Combining the probability distributions of the intrinsic
shape of bulges and bars in our sample we show that 52% (16%) of bulges are thicker (flatter) than the
surrounding bar at 1$\sigma$ level. We suggest that these percentages might be representative
of the fraction of classical and disc-like bulges in our sample, respectively.
