The Arizona Robotic Telescope Network (ARTN) project is a long term effort to develop a system of
telescopes to carry out a flexible program of PI observing, survey projects, and time domain astrophysics
including monitoring, rapid response, and transient/target-of-opportunity followup. Steward
Observatory operates and shares in several 1-3m class telescopes with quality sites and instrumentation,
largely operated in classical modes. Science programs suited to these telescopes are limited by
scheduling flexibility and people-power of available observers. Our goal is to adapt these facilities
for multiple co-existing queued programs, interrupt capability, remote/robotic operation,
and delivery of reduced data. In the long term, planning for the LSST era, we envision an automated
system coordinating across multiple telescopes and sites, where alerts can trigger followup,
classification, and triggering of further observations if required, such as followup imaging
that can trigger spectroscopy. We are updating telescope control systems and software to implement
this system in stages, beginning with the Kuiper 61'' and Vatican Observatory 1.8-m telescopes.
The Kuiper 61'' and its Mont4K camera can now be controlled and queue-scheduled by the RTS2 observatory
control software, and operated from a remote room at Steward. We discuss science and technical requirements
for ARTN, and some of the challenges in adapting heterogenous legacy facilities, scheduling, data
pipelines, and maintaining capabilities for a diverse user base.
