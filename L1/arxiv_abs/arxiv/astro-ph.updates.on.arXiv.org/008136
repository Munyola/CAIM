There are two outstanding issues regarding the neutron-star merger event GW170817: the nature
of the compact remnant and the interstellar shock. The mass of the remnant of GW170817, $\sim$2.7
$M_\odot$, implies the remnant could be either a massive, rotating, neutron star, or a black hole.
We report Chandra Director's Discretionary Time observations made in 2017 December and 2018 January,
and we reanalyze earlier observations from 2017 August and 2017 September, in order to address these
unresolved issues. We estimate the X-ray flux from a neutron star remnant and compare that to the
measured X-ray flux. If we assume that the spin-down luminosity of any putative neutron star is converted
to pulsar wind nebula X-ray emission in the 0.5-8 keV band with an efficiency of $10^{-3}$, for a dipole
magnetic field with $3 \times 10^{11}$ G < $B$ < $10^{14}$ G, a rising X-ray signal would result and
would be brighter than that observed by day 107, we therefore conclude that the remnant of GW170817
is most likely a black hole. Independent of any assumptions of X-ray efficiency, however, if the
remnant is a rapidly-rotating, magnetized, neutron star, the total energy in the external shock
should rise by a factor $\sim$$10^2$ (to $\sim$$10^{52}$ erg) after a few years, therefore, Chandra
observations over the next year or two that do not show substantial brightening will rule out such
a remnant. The same observations can distinguish between two different models for the relativistic
outflow, either an angular or radially varying structure.
