The rotation axis of the Sun is misaligned from the mean angular momentum plane of the Solar system
by about 6 degrees. This obliquity significantly exceeds the ~1-2 degree distribution of inclinations
among the planetary orbits and therefore requires a physical explanation. In concert, Sun-like
stars are known to spin down by an order of magnitude throughout their lifetimes. This spin-down
is driven by the stellar wind, which carries angular momentum from the star. If the mean angular momentum
axis of the stellar wind deviates from that of the stellar spin axis, it will lead to a component of
the spin-down torque that acts to tilt the star. Here, we show that Solar-like tilts of 6 degrees naturally
arise during the first 10-100 Myr after planet formation as a result of stellar winds that deviate
by about 10 degrees from the star's spin axis. These results apply to the idealized case of a dipolar
field, mildly inclined to the spin axis. Time-variability in the misalignment between the magnetic
and spin poles is modeled as stochastic fluctuations, autocorrelated over timescales comparable
to the primordial spin-down time of several million years. In addition to wind direction, time-variability
in mass-loss rate and magnetic topology over the stellar lifetime may alternatively generate obliquity.
We hypothesize that the gaseous environments of young, open clusters may provide forcing over sufficient
timescales to tilt the astrospheres of young stars, exciting modest obliquities. The more extreme,
retrograde stellar obliquities of extrasolar planetary systems likely arise through separate
mechanisms.
