HI self absorption (HISA) clouds are clumps of cold neutral hydrogen (HI) visible in front of warm
background gas, which makes them ideal places to study the properties of the cold atomic component
of the interstellar medium (ISM). The Riegel-Crutcher (R-C) cloud is the most striking HISA feature
in the Galaxy. It is one of the closest HISA clouds to us and is located in the direction of the Galactic
Centre, which provides a bright background. High-resolution interferometric measurements have
revealed the filamentary structure of this cloud, however it is difficult to accurately determine
the temperature and the density of the gas without optical depth measurements. In this paper we present
new HI absorption observations with the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) against 46 continuum
sources behind the Riegel-Crutcher cloud to directly measure the optical depth of the cloud. We
decompose the complex HI absorption spectra into Gaussian components using an automated machine
learning algorithm. We find 300 Gaussian components, from which 67 are associated with the R-C cloud
(0 < v_{LSR} < 10 kms, FWHM < 10 kms). Combining the new HI absorption data with HI emission data from
previous surveys we calculate the spin temperature and find it to be between 20 and 80 K. Our measurements
uncover a temperature gradient across the cloud with spin temperatures decreasing towards positive
Galactic latitudes. We also find three new OH absorption lines associated with the cloud, which
support the presence of molecular gas.
