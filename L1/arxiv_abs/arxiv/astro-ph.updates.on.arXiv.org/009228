We present the ATLAS discovery and initial analysis of the first 18 days of the unusual transient
event, ATLAS18qqn/AT2018cow. It is characeterized by a high peak luminosity ($\sim 1.7\times10^{44}$
erg s$^{-1}$), rapidly evolving light curves ($>$5 mag rise in $\sim$3 days), hot blackbody spectra,
peaking at $\sim$27000 K that are relatively featureless and unchanging over the first two weeks.
The bolometric light curve cannot be powered by radioactive decay under realistic assumptions.
The detection of high-energy emission may suggest a central engine as the powering source. Using
a magnetar model, we estimated an ejected mass of $0.1 - 0.4$ M$_\odot$, which lies between that of
low-energy core-collapse events and the kilonova, AT2017gfo. The spectra of AT2018cow showed
a number of shallow features overlying a blackbody continuum. The spectra cooled rapidly from 27000
to 15000 K in just over 2 weeks but the positions of shallow bumps in the spectra did not evolve, suggesting
that they are produced in a shell or are potentially emission features. Using spectral modelling,
we tentatively identify some features as being due to He I and He II and rule out that the features in
the spectra are due to most elements up to and including the Fe-group. The presence of r-process elements
cannot be ruled out. If these lines are due to He, then we suggest a low-mass star with residual He as
a potential progenitor. Alternatively, models of magnetars formed in neutron-star mergers give
plausible matches to the data.
