We present a new method to model a HST/COS spectrum, aimed to analyze intrinsic UV absorption from
the outflow of Mrk 290, a Seyfert I galaxy. We use newly updated XSTAR to generate photoionization
models for the intrinsic absorption from the AGN outflow, the line emission from the AGN broad and
narrow line regions, and the local absorption from high velocity clouds and Galactic interstellar
medium. The combination of these physical models accurately fit the COS spectrum. Three intrinsic
absorbers outflowing with velocities ~500 km/s are identified, two of which are found directly
from two velocity components of the N V and C IV doublets, while the third is required by the extra absorption
in the Lyman alpha. Their outflow velocities, ionization states and column densities are consistent
with the lowest and moderately ionization warm absorbers (WAs) in the X-ray domain found by Chandra
observations, suggesting an one-to-one correspondence between the absorbing gas in the UV and
X-ray bands. The small turbulent velocities of the WAs (v_turb~<100 km/s) support our previous
argument from the X-ray study that the absorbers originate from the inner side of the torus due to
thermal evaporation. Given the covering fractions of ~65% for the three WAs, we deduce that the lengths
and the thicknesses of the WAs are comparable, which indicates that the geometry of WAs are more likely
clouds rather than flat and thin layers. In addition, the modeling of the broad line emission suggests
a higher covering fraction of clouds when they are very closer to the black hole.
