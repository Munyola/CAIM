In the first paper of this series, a comprehensive approach has been provided for the study of S-type
and P-type habitable regions in stellar binary systems, which was, however, restricted to circular
orbits of the stellar components. Fortunately, a modest modification of the method also allows
for the consideration of elliptical orbits, which of course entails a much broader range of applicability.
This augmented method is presented here, and numerous applications are conveyed. In alignment
with Paper I, the selected approach considers a variety of aspects, which comprise the consideration
of a joint constraint including orbital stability and a habitable region for a putative system planet
through the stellar radiative energy fluxes (radiative habitable zone; RHZ). The devised method
is based on a combined formalism for the assessment of both S-type and P-type habitability; in particular,
mathematical criteria are deduced for which kinds of systems S-type and P-type habitable zones
are realized. If the RHZs are truncated by the additional constraint of orbital stability, the notation
of ST-type and PT-type habitability applies. In comparison to the circular case, it is found that
in systems of higher eccentricity, the range of the RHZs is significantly reduced. Furthermore,
the orbital stability constraint again impacts S-type and P-type habitability in an unfavorable
manner. Nonetheless, S-, P-, ST-, and PT-type habitability is identified for a considerable set
of system parameters. The method as presented is utilized for BinHab, a black box code available
at The University of Texas at Arlington.
