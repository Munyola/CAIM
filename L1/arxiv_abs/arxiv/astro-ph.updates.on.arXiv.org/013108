We report on the optical properties of infrared (IR)-bright dust-obscured galaxies (DOGs) that
are defined as (i-[22])_AB > 7.0. Because supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in IR-bright DOGs are
expected to be rapidly growing in the major merger scenario, they provide useful clues for understanding
the co-evolution of SMBHs and their host galaxies. However, the optical properties of IR-bright
DOGs remain unclear because the optical emission of a DOG is very faint. By combining ~ 105 deg^2 images
of the optical, near-IR, and mid-IR data obtained from the Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) survey,
the VISTA VIKING survey, and the WISE all-sky survey, respectively, 571 IR-bright DOGs were selected.
We found that IR-bright DOGs show a redder (g-z)_AB color than other populations of dusty galaxies,
such as ultra-luminous IR galaxies (ULIRGs) at a similar redshift, with a significantly large dispersion.
Among the selected DOGs, star-formation (SF) dominated DOGs show a relatively red color, while
active galactic nucleus (AGN) dominated DOGs show a rather blue color in optical. This result is
consistent with the idea that the relative AGN contribution in the optical emission becomes more
significant at a later stage in the major merger scenario. We discovered eight IR-bright DOGs showing
a significant blue excess in blue HSC bands (BluDOGs). This blue excess can be interpreted as a leaked
AGN emission that is either a directly leaking or a scattered AGN emission, as proposed for some blue-excess
Hot DOGs in earlier studies.
