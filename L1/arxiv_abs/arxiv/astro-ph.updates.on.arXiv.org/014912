We present time-resolved 10.4-m GTC and 4.2-m WHT intermediate resolution spectroscopy of the
X-ray transient MAXI J1820+070 (=ASASSN-18ey) obtained during its decline to the quiescent state.
Cross-correlation of the 21 individual spectra against late-type templates reveals a sinusoidal
velocity modulation with a period of 0.68549 +/- 0.00001 d and semi-amplitude of 417.7 +/- 3.9 km/s.
We derive a mass function f(M) = 5.18 +/- 0.15 Msun, dynamically confirming the black hole nature
of the compact object. Our analysis of the stellar absorption features supports a K3-5 spectral
classification for the donor star, which contributes 20% of the total flux at 5200-6800 Angs. The
photometric 0.703 +/- 0.003 d periodicity observed during outburst is 2.6% longer than the orbital
period supporting the presence of a superhump modulation in the outburst lightcurves. In line with
this interpretation, we constrain the binary mass ratio to be q=0.12. In addition, we observe a sharp
increase in the Halpha emission line equivalent width during inferior conjunction of the donor
star that we interpret as a grazing eclipse of the accretion disc and allows us to constrain the binary
inclination to > 69 deg. On the other hand, the absence of X-ray eclipses during outburst imply i <
77 deg. These inclination limits, together with our dynamical solution, lead to a black hole mass
in the range 7-8 Msun. We also measure a systemic velocity = -21.6 +/- 2.3 km/s which, combined with
the Gaia DR2 proper motion and parallax, implies a large peculiar velocity of 100 km/s.
