The ionosphere is the main driver of a series of systematic effects that limit our ability to explore
the low frequency (<1 GHz) sky with radio interferometers. Its effects become increasingly important
towards lower frequencies and are particularly hard to calibrate in the low signal-to-noise ratio
regime in which low-frequency telescopes operate. In this paper we characterize and quantify the
effect of ionospheric-induced systematic errors on astronomical interferometric radio observations
at ultra-low frequencies (<100 MHz). We also provide guidelines for observations and data reduction
at these frequencies with the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR) and future instruments such as the Square
Kilometre Array (SKA). We derive the expected systematic error induced by the ionosphere. We compare
our predictions with data from the Low Band Antenna (LBA) system of LOFAR. We show that we can isolate
the ionospheric effect in LOFAR LBA data and that our results are compatible with satellite measurements,
providing an independent way to measure the ionospheric total electron content (TEC). We show how
the ionosphere also corrupts the correlated amplitudes through scintillations. We report values
of the ionospheric structure function in line with the literature. The systematic errors on the
phases of LOFAR LBA data can be accurately modelled as a sum of four effects (clock, ionosphere 1st,
2nd, and 3rd order). This greatly reduces the number of required calibration parameters, and therefore
enables new efficient calibration strategies.
