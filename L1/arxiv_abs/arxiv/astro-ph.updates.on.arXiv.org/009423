Torsional motions are ubiquitous in the solar atmosphere. In this work, we perform 3D numerical
simulations which mimic a vortex-type photospheric driver with a Gaussian spatial profile. This
driver is implemented to excite MHD waves in an axially symmetric, 3D magnetic flux tube embedded
in a realistic solar atmosphere. The Gaussian width of the driver is varied and the resulting perturbations
are compared. Velocity vectors were decomposed into parallel, perpendicular and azimuthal components
with respect to pre-defined magnetic flux surfaces. These components correspond broadly to the
fast, slow and Alfven modes, respectively. From these velocities the corresponding wave energy
fluxes are calculated, allowing us to estimate the contribution of each mode to the energy flux.
For the narrowest driver ($0.15$ Mm) the parallel component accounts for $\sim 55 - 65\%$ of the flux.
This contribution increases smoothly with driver width up to nearly $90\%$ for the widest driver
($0.35$ Mm). The relative importance of the perpendicular and azimuthal components decrease at
similar rates. The azimuthal energy flux varied between $\sim 35\%$ for the narrowest driver and
$< 10\%$ for the widest one. Similarly, the perpendicular flux was $\sim 25 - 10\%$. We also demonstrate
that the fast mode corresponds to the sausage wave in our simulations. Our results therefore show
that the fast sausage wave is easily excited by this driver and that it carries the majority of the
energy transported. For this vortex-type driver the Alfven wave does not contribute a significant
amount of energy.
