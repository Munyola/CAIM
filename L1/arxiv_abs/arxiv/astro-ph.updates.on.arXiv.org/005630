We investigate the star formation processes operating in a mid-infrared bubble N49 site, which
harbors an O-type star in its interior, an ultracompact HII region, and a 6.7 GHz methanol maser at
its edges. The 13CO line data reveal two velocity components (at velocity peaks ~88 and ~95 km/sec)
in the direction of the bubble. An elongated filamentary feature (length >15 pc) is investigated
in each molecular cloud component, and the bubble is found at the interface of these two filamentary
molecular clouds. The Herschel temperature map traces all these structures in a temperature range
of ~16-24 K. In the velocity space of 13CO, the two molecular clouds are separated by ~7 km/sec, and
are interconnected by a lower intensity intermediate velocity emission (i.e. a broad bridge feature).
A possible complementary molecular pair at [87, 88] km/sec and [95, 96] km/sec is also observed in
the velocity channel maps. These observational signatures are in agreement with the outcomes of
simulations of the cloud-cloud collision process. There are also noticeable embedded protostars
and Herschel clumps distributed toward the filamentary features including the intersection zone
of the two molecular clouds. In the bubble site, different early evolutionary stages of massive
star formation are also present. Together, these observational results suggest that in the bubble
N49 site, the collision of the filamentary molecular clouds appears to be operated about 0.7 Myr
ago, and may have triggered the formation of embedded protostars and massive stars.
