We investigate the relationship between colour and structure within galaxies using a large, volume-limited
sample of bright, low-redshift galaxies with optical to near-infrared imaging from the GAMA survey.
We fit single-component, wavelength-dependent, elliptical S\'ersic models to all passbands
simultaneously, using software developed by the MegaMorph project. Dividing our sample by S\'ersic
index and colour, the recovered wavelength variations in effective radius (R_e) and S\'ersic index
(n) reveal the internal structure, and hence formation history, of different types of galaxies.
All these trends depend on n; some have an additional dependence on galaxy colour. Late-type galaxies
(n_r < 2.5) show a dramatic increase in S\'ersic index with wavelength. This might be a result
of their two-component (bulge-disk) nature, though stellar population gradients within each
component and dust attenuation are likely to play a role. All galaxies show a substantial decrease
in R_e with wavelength. This is strongest for early-types (n_r > 2.5), even though they maintain
constant n with wavelength, revealing that ellipticals are a superimposition of different stellar
populations associated with multiple collapse and merging events. Processes leading to structures
with larger R_e must be associated with lower metallicity or younger stellar populations. This
appears to rule out the formation of young cores through dissipative gas accretion as an important
mechanism in the recent lives of luminous elliptical galaxies.
