Weak gravitational lensing measurements based on photometry are limited by shape noise, the variance
in the unknown pre-lensing orientations of the source galaxies. If the source is a disk galaxy with
a well-ordered velocity field, however, velocity field data can support simultaneous inference
of the shear, inclination, and position angle, virtually eliminating shape noise. We use the Fisher
Information Matrix formalism to forecast the precision of this method in the idealized case of a
perfectly ordered velocity field defined on an infinitesimally thin disk. For nearly face-on targets
one shear component, $\gamma_\times$, can be constrained to $0.003\frac{90}{I_0}\frac{25}{n_{\rm
pix}}$ where $I_0$ is the S/N of the central intensity pixel and $n_{\rm pix}$ is the number of pixels
across a diameter enclosing enclosing 80% of the light. The other shear component, $\gamma_+$,
is degenerate with the magnification $\mu$ but with a loose prior ($\sigma_\mu=1$) it can reach
$0.009\frac{90}{I_0}\frac{25}{n_{\rm pix}}$. These constraints, however, degrade quickly
at higher inclinations. We show that in general these constraints apply not to the shear components
themselves but to two eigenvectors in the $(\gamma_\times,\gamma_+,\mu)$ space, with the third
(usually $\mu$-like) eigenvector nearly unconstrained. We also forecast the potential of less
expensive partial observations of the velocity field such as slit spectroscopy. We conclude by
outlining some ways in which real galaxies depart from our idealized model, which may present barriers
to practical implementation.
