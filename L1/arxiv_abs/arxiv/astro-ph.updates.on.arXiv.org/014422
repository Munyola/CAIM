Short gamma-ray bursts require a rotating black hole, surrounded by a magnetized relativistic
accretion disk, such as the one formed by coalescing binary neutron stars or neutron star - black
hole systems. The accretion onto a Kerr black hole is the mechanism of launching a baryon-free relativistic
jet. An additional uncollimated outflow, consisting of sub-relativistic neutron-rich material
which becomes unbound by thermal, magnetic and viscous forces, is responsible for blue and red kilonova.
We explore the formation, composition and geometry of the secondary outflow by means of simulating
accretion disks with relativistic magneto-hydrodynamics and employing realistic nuclear equation
of state. We calculate the nucleosynthetic r-process yields by sampling the outflow with a dense
set of tracer particles. Nuclear heating from the residual r-process radioactivities in the freshly
synthesized nuclei is expected to power a red kilonova, contributing independently from the dynamical
ejecta component, launched at the time of merger, and neutron-poor broad polar outflow, launched
from the surface of the hypermassive neutron star by neutrino wind. Our simulations show that both
magnetisation of the disk and high black hole spin are able to launch fast wind outflows ($v/c\sim
0.11-0.23$) with a broad range of electron fraction $Y_{\rm e}\sim 0.1-0.4$, and help explain the
multiple components observed in the kilonova lightcurves. The total mass loss from the post-merger
disk via unbound outflows is between 2\% and 17\% of the initial disk mass.
