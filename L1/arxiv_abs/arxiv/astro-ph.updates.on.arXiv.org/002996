We performed a deep search for radio synchrotron emissions induced by weakly interacting massive
particles (WIMPs) annihilation or decay in six dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxies of the Local Group.
Observations were conducted with the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) at 16 cm wavelength,
with an rms sensitivity better than 0.05 mJy/beam in each field. In this work, we first discuss the
uncertainties associated with the modeling of the expected signal, such as the shape of the dark
matter (DM) profile and the dSph magnetic properties. We then investigate the possibility that
point-sources detected in the proximity of the dSph optical center might be due to the emission from
a DM cuspy profile. No evidence for an extended emission over a size of few arcmin (which is the DM halo
size) has been detected. We present the associated bounds on the WIMP parameter space for different
annihilation/decay final states and for different astrophysical assumptions. If the confinement
of electrons and positrons in the dSph is such that the majority of their power is radiated within
the dSph region, we obtain constraints on the WIMP annihilation rate which are well below the thermal
value for masses up to few TeV. On the other hand, for conservative assumptions on the dSph magnetic
properties, the bounds can be dramatically relaxed. We show however that, within the next 10 years
and regardless of the astrophysical assumptions, it will be possible to progressively close in
on the full parameter space of WIMPs by searching for radio signals in dSphs with SKA and its precursors.
