While the importance of detecting the Global spectral signatures of the red-shifted 21-cm line
of atomic hydrogen from the very early epochs cannot be overstated, the associated challenges primarily
include isolating the weak signal of interest from the orders of magnitude brighter foregrounds,
and extend equally to reliably establishing the origin of the {\it apparent} global signal to the
very early epochs. This letter proposes a critical dipole test that the measurements of the monopole
component of the spectrum of interest should necessarily pass. Our criterion is based on a unique
correspondence between the intrinsic monopole spectrum and the differential spectrum as an imprint
of dipole anisotropy resulting from motion of observer with respect to the rest frame of our source
(such as that of our Solar system, interpreted from the dipole anisotropy in CMBR). More importantly,
the spectral manifestation of the dipole anisotropy gets {\it amplified} by a significant factor,
depending on the monopole spectral slopes, rendering it feasible to measure. We describe details
of such a test, and illustrate its application with the help of simulations. The letter also alludes
to a novel model-independent path toward isolating the foreground contribution, using the diurnal
pattern readily apparent in drift-scan observations. Such dipole qualifier for the monopole spectrum,
when combined with reliable foreground estimation, is expected to pave way for in situ validation
of spectral signatures from early epochs, important to presently reported and future detections
of EoR signal.
