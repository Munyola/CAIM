The IceCube Neutrino Observatory is a large Cherenkov detector instrumenting $1\,\mathrm{km}^3$
of Antarctic ice. The detector can be used to search for signatures of particle physics beyond the
Standard Model. Here, we describe the search for non-relativistic, magnetic monopoles as remnants
of the GUT (Grand Unified Theory) era shortly after the Big Bang. These monopoles may catalyze the
decay of nucleons via the Rubakov-Callan effect with a cross section suggested to be in the range
of $10^{-27}\,\mathrm{cm^2}$ to $10^{-21}\,\mathrm{cm^2}$. In IceCube, the Cherenkov light
from nucleon decays along the monopole trajectory would produce a characteristic hit pattern.
This paper presents the results of an analysis of first data taken from May 2011 until May 2012 with
a dedicated slow-particle trigger for DeepCore, a subdetector of IceCube. A second analysis provides
better sensitivity for the brightest non-relativistic monopoles using data taken from May 2009
until May 2010. In both analyses no monopole signal was observed. For catalysis cross sections of
$10^{-22}\,(10^{-24})\,\mathrm{cm^2}$ the flux of non-relativistic GUT monopoles is constrained
up to a level of $\Phi_{90} \le 10^{-18}\,(10^{-17})\,\mathrm{cm^{-2}s^{-1}sr^{-1}}$ at a 90%
confidence level, which is three orders of magnitude below the Parker bound. The limits assume a
dominant decay of the proton into a positron and a neutral pion. These results improve the current
best experimental limits by one to two orders of magnitude, for a wide range of assumed speeds and
catalysis cross sections.
