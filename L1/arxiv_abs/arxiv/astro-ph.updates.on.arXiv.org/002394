We have conducted a spectral line survey in the 3 mm and 2 mm bands toward two positions in a spiral arm
of M51 (NGC 5194) with the IRAM 30 m telescope. In this survey, we have identified 13 molecular species,
including CN, CCH, N2H+, HNCO, and CH3OH. Furthermore, 6 isotopologues of the major species have
been detected. On the other hand, SiO, HC3N, CH3CN, and the deuterated species such as DCN and DCO+
are not detected. The deuterium fractionation ratios are evaluated to be less than 0.8 % and 1.2 %
for DCN/HCN and DCO+/HCO+, respectively. By comparing the results of the two positions with different
star formation activities, we have found that the observed chemical compositions do not strongly
depend on star formation activities. They seem to reflect a chemical composition averaged over
the 1-kpc scale region including many giant molecular clouds. Among the detected molecules CN,
CCH, and CH3OH are found to be abundant. High abundances of CN, and CCH are consistent with the above
picture of a wide spread distribution of molecules, because they can be produced by photodissociation.
On the other hand, it seems likely that CH3OH is liberated into the gas phase by shocks associated
with large scale phenomena such as cloud-cloud collisions and/or by non-thermal desorption processes
such as photoevaporation due to cosmic-ray induced UV photons. The present result demonstrates
a characteristic chemical composition of a giant molecular cloud complex in the spiral arm, which
can be used as a standard reference for studying chemistry in AGNs and starbursts.
