Like the magnetised planets in our Solar System, magnetised exoplanets should emit strongly at
radio wavelengths. Radio emission directly traces the planetary magnetic fields and radio detections
can place constraints on the physical parameters of these features. Large comparative studies
of predicted radio emission characteristics for the known population of exoplanets help to identify
what physical parameters could be key for producing bright, observable radio emission. Since the
last comparative study, many thousands of exoplanets have been discovered. We report new estimates
for the radio flux densities and maximum emission frequencies for the current population of known
exoplanets orbiting pre-main sequence and main-sequence stars with spectral types F-M. The set
of exoplanets predicted to produce observable radio emission are Hot Jupiters orbiting young stars.
The youth of these system predicts strong stellar magnetic fields and/or dense winds, which are
key for producing bright, observable radio emission. We use a new all-sky circular polarisation
Murchison Widefield Array survey to place sensitive limits on 200 MHz emission from exoplanets,
with $3\sigma$ values ranging from 4.0 - 45.0 mJy. Using a targeted Giant Metre Wave Radio Telescope
observing campaign, we also report a $3\sigma$ upper limit of 4.5 mJy on the radio emission from V830
Tau b, the first Hot Jupiter to be discovered orbiting a pre-main sequence star. Our limit is the first
to be reported for the low-frequency radio emission from this source.
