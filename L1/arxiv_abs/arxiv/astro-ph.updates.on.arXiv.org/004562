In this study we investigate jet interaction at a microscopic level in a cosmological environment,
which responds to a key open question in the study of relativistic jets. Using small simulation systems
during prior research, we initially studied the evolution of both electron-proton and electron-positron
relativistic jets containing helical magnetic fields, by focusing on their interactions with
an ambient plasma. Here, using larger jet radii, we have performed simulations of global jets containing
helical magnetic fields in order to examine how helical magnetic fields affect kinetic instabilities
such as the Weibel instability, the kinetic Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (kKHI) and the Mushroom
instability (MI). We found that the evolution of global jets strongly depends on the size of the jet
radius. For example, phase bunching of jet electrons, in particular in the electron-proton jet,
is mixed with larger jet radius due to the more complicated structures of magnetic fields with excited
kinetic instabilities. In our simulation study these kinetic instabilities lead to new types of
instabilities in global jets. In the electron-proton jet simulation a modified recollimation
occurs and jet electrons are strongly perturbed. In the electron-positron jet simulation mixed
kinetic instabilities occur at early times followed by a turbulence-like structure. Simulations
using much larger (and longer) systems are further required in order to thoroughly investigate
the evolution of global jets containing helical magnetic fields.
