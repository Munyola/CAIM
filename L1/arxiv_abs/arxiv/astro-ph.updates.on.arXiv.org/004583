Recent radio observations towards nearby galaxies started to map the whole disk and to identify
giant molecular clouds (GMCs) even in the regions between galactic spiral structures. Observed
variations of GMC mass functions in different galactic environment indicates that massive GMCs
preferentially reside along galactic spiral structures whereas inter-arm regions have many small
GMCs. Based on the phase transition dynamics from magnetized warm neutral medium to molecular clouds,
Kobayashi et al. 2017 proposes a semi-analytical evolutionary description for GMC mass functions
including cloud-cloud collision (CCC) process. Their results show that CCC is less dominant in
shaping the mass function of GMCs compared with the accretion of dense HI gas driven by the propagation
of supersonic shock waves. However, their formulation does not take into account the possible enhancement
of star formation by CCC. Radio observations within the Milky Way indicate the importance of CCC
for the formation of star clusters and massive stars. In this article, we reformulate the time evolution
equation largely modified from Kobayashi et al. 2017 so that we additionally compute star formation
subsequently taking place in CCC clouds. Our results suggest that, although CCC events between
smaller clouds outnumber the ones between massive GMCs, CCC-driven star formation is mostly driven
by massive GMCs > 10^5.5 Msun (where Msun is the solar mass). The resultant cumulative CCC-driven
star formation may amount to a few 10 percent of the total star formation in the Milky Way and nearby
galaxies.
