We investigate how Einstein rings and magnified arcs are affected by small-mass dark-matter haloes
placed along the line-of-sight to gravitational lens systems. By comparing the gravitational
signature of line-of-sight haloes with that of substructures within the lensing galaxy, we derive
a mass-redshift relation that allows us to rescale the detection threshold (i.e. lowest detectable
mass) for substructures to a detection threshold for line-of-sight haloes at any redshift. We then
quantify the line-of-sight contribution to the total number density of low-mass objects that can
be detected through strong gravitational lensing. Finally, we assess the degeneracy between substructures
and line-of-sight haloes of different mass and redshift to provide a statistical interpretation
of current and future detections, with the aim of distinguishing between CDM and WDM. We find that
line-of-sight haloes statistically dominate with respect to substructures, by an amount that
strongly depends on the source and lens redshifts, and on the chosen dark matter model. Substructures
represent about 30 percent of the total number of perturbers for low lens and source redshifts (as
for the SLACS lenses), but less than 10 per cent for high redshift systems. We also find that for data
with high enough signal-to-noise ratio and angular resolution, the non-linear effects arising
from a double-lens-plane configuration are such that one is able to observationally recover the
line-of-sight halo redshift with an absolute error precision of 0.15 at the 68 per cent confidence
level.
