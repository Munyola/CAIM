To deepen the analysis of the photometric properties of the umbra of a sunspot, we study proper motions
of small features such as umbral dots (UDs) inside a single sunspot observed by the Solar Optical
Telescope of Hinode close to the disk center. We consider horizontal flows with high precision and
details to study the transient motion behavior of UDs in short time intervals. Blue continuum images
were first deconvolved with the point-spread function, such that the stray light is precisely removed
and the original resolution is improved. Several images were co-added to improve the signal-to-noise
ratio, keeping a reasonable temporal resolution and checking that the results are reproducible.
The Fourier local correlation tracking technique is applied to the new corrected time sequence
of images, and horizontal velocity maps were obtained both for the whole umbra and for a high-resolution
small region of the umbra to study the smallest details of the velocity fields. We used two different
Gaussian tracking windows (0.8arcsec and 0.2arcsec), which reveals two types of horizontal motions
for umbral features. First, a global inner penumbra and peripheral umbra inward motion directed
to the central parts is revealed as an overall proper motion of bright peripheral fine structures.
Second, motions matching small cells inside the darkest parts of the umbra with apparent sink and
source areas are revealed, suggesting possible upflows and downflows appearing in different bright
and dark locations without a definite answer regarding their brightness identification with a
convective or a buoyant cell.
