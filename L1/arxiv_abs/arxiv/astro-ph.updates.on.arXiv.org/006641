To confirm the nature of the donor star in the ultra-compact X-ray binary candidate 47 Tuc X9, we obtained
optical spectra (3,000$-$10,000 {\AA}) with the Hubble Space Telescope / Space Telescope Imaging
Spectrograph. We find no strong emission or absorption features in the spectrum of X9. In particular,
we place $3\sigma$ upper limits on the H$\alpha$ and HeII $\lambda 4686$ emission line equivalent
widths $-$EW$_{\mathrm{H\alpha}} \lesssim 14$ {\AA} and $-$EW$_{\mathrm{HeII}} \lesssim 9$
{\AA}, respectively. This is much lower than seen for typical X-ray binaries at a similar X-ray luminosity
(which, for $L_{\mathrm{2-10 keV}} \approx 10^{33}-10^{34}$ erg s$^{-1}$ is typically $-$EW$_{\mathrm{H\alpha}}
\sim 50$ {\AA}). This supports our previous suggestion (by Bahramian et al.) of an H-poor donor in
X9. We perform timing analysis on archival far-ultraviolet, $V$ and $I$-band data to search for
periodicities. In the optical bands we recover the seven-day superorbital period initially discovered
in X-rays, but we do not recover the orbital period. In the far-ultraviolet we find evidence for a
27.2 min period (shorter than the 28.2 min period seen in X-rays). We find that either a neutron star
or black hole could explain the observed properties of X9. We also perform binary evolution calculations,
showing that the formation of an initial black hole / He-star binary early in the life of a globular
cluster could evolve into a present-day system such as X9 (should the compact object in this system
indeed be a black hole) via mass-transfer driven by gravitational wave radiation.
