Models have long predicted that the frequency-averaged masses of white dwarfs in Galactic classical
novae are twice as large as those of field white dwarfs. Only a handful of dynamically well-determined
nova white dwarf masses have been published, leaving the theoretical predictions poorly tested.
The recurrence time distributions and mass accretion rate distributions of novae are even more
poorly known. To address these deficiencies, we have combined our extensive simulations of nova
eruptions with the Strope et al (2010) and Schaefer et al (2010) databases of outburst characteristics
of Galactic classical and recurrent novae to determine the masses of 92 white dwarfs in novae. We
find that the mean mass (frequency averaged mean mass) of 82 Galactic classical novae is 1.06 (1.13)
Msun, while the mean mass of 10 recurrent novae is 1.31 Msun. These masses, and the observed nova outburst
amplitude and decline time distributions allow us to determine the long-term mass accretion rate
distribution of classical novae. Remarkably, that value is just 1.3 x 10^{-10} Msun/yr, which is
an order of magnitude smaller than that of cataclysmic binaries in the decades before and after classical
nova eruptions. This predicts that old novae become low mass transfer rate systems, and hence dwarf
novae, for most of the time between nova eruptions. We determine the mass accretion rates of each
of the 10 known Galactic RN, finding them to be in the range 10^{-7} - 10^{-8} $ Msun/yr. We are able
to predict the recurrence time distribution of novae and compare it with the predictions of population
synthesis models.
