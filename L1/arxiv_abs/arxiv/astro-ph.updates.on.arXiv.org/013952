The determination of the speed of Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) is usually done by tracking brighter
features (such as the CME front and core) in visible light coronagraphic images and by deriving unidimensional
profiles of the CME speed as a function of altitude or time. Nevertheless, CMEs are usually characterized
by the presence of significant density inhomogeneities propagating outward with different radial
and latitudinal projected speeds, resulting in a complex evolution eventually forming the Interplanetary
CME. In this work, we demonstrate for the first time how coronagraphic image sequences can be analyzed
with cross-correlation technique to derive 2D maps of the almost instantaneous plasma speed distribution
within the body of CMEs. The technique is first tested with the analysis of synthetic data, and then
applied to real observations. Results from this work allow to characterize the distribution and
time evolution of kinetic energy inside CMEs, as well as the mechanical energy (combined with the
kinetic and potential energy) partition between the core and front of the CME. In the future, CMEs
will be observed by two channels (VL and UV Ly-$\alpha$) coronagraphs, such as Metis on-board ESA
Solar Orbiter mission as well as Ly-$\alpha$ Solar Telescope (LST) on-board Chinese Advanced Space-based
Solar Observatory (ASO-S) mission. Our results will help the analysis of these future observations,
helping in particular to take into account the 2D distribution of Ly-$\alpha$ Doppler dimming effect.
