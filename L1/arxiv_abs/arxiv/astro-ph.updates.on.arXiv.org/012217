Globular clusters represent stellar laboratories where observations can be used to validate models
of stellar evolution. In this study, we put forth new ultraviolet (UV) photometric results of stars
in the Galactic globular cluster NGC 2808. NGC 2808 is known to host multiple stellar populations
that include at least four distinct groups of horizontal Branch (HB) stars. We have observed this
cluster with the AstroSat-UltraViolet Imaging Telescope in two far-UV (FUV) and five near-UV (NUV)
filters, respectively. These UV filters enable the identification of HB populations of stars.
The results from four NUV filters exhibit bimodal distributions in magnitude histograms. The nature
of bimodality has been investigated on the basis of distinct stellar types contributing to those
bands. The color-magnitude diagrams constructed using FUV and NUV filters enable the location
of hot stellar populations, viz. stars belonging to Red HB (RHB), Blue HB, Extreme HB, Blue Hook branch
and post-Asymptotic Giant Branch. Prominent gaps are observed in the UV color-magnitude diagrams.
We report for the first time, a photometric gap in a NUV color-magnitude diagram, that segregates
the RHB population of this cluster into two groups, that are likely to be associated with distinct
generations of stars. We have constructed and examined the GAIA color-magnitude diagram of the
optical counterparts of the hot UV stars. We also investigate the spatial density distributions
of various groups of stars in the cluster and comment on the proposed formation models of multiple
populations.
