The hard X-ray continuum and gamma-ray lines from a Type Ia supernova dominate its integrated photon
emissions and can provide unique diagnostics of the mass of the ejecta, the $^{56}$Ni yield and spatial
distribution, its kinetic energy and expansion speed, and the mechanism of explosion. Such signatures
and their time behavior "X-ray" the bulk debris field in direct fashion, and do not depend upon the
oftimes problematic and elaborate UV, optical, and near-infrared spectroscopy and radiative
transfer that have informed the study of these events for decades. However, to date no hard photons
have ever been detected from a Type Ia supernova in explosion. With the advent of the supernova SN
2014J in M82, at a distance of $\sim$3.5 Mpc, this situation may soon change. Both NuSTAR and INTEGRAL
have the potential to detect SN 2014J, and, if spectra and light curves can be measured, would usefully
constrain the various explosion models published during the last $\sim$thirty years. In support
of these observational campaigns, we provide predictions for the hard X-ray continuum and gamma-line
emissions for fifteen Type Ia explosion models gleaned from the literature. The model set, containing
as it does deflagration, delayed detonation, merger detonation, pulsational delayed detonation,
and sub-Chandrasekhar helium detonation models, collectively spans a wide range of properties
and, hence, signatures. We provide a brief discussion of various diagnostics (with examples),
but importantly make the spectral and line results available electronically to aid in the interpretation
of the anticipated data.
