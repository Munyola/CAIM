We investigate the ability of current and third-generation gravitational wave (GW) detectors
to determine the delay time distribution (DTD) of binary neutron stars (BNS) through a direct measurement
of the BNS merger rate as a function of redshift. We assume that the DTD follows a power law distribution
with a slope $\Gamma$ and a minimum merger time $t_{\rm min}$, and also allow the overall BNS formation
efficiency per unit stellar mass to vary. By convolving the DTD and mass efficiency with the cosmic
star formation history, and then with the GW detector capabilities, we explore two relevant regimes.
First, for the current generation of GW detectors, which are only sensitive to the local universe,
but can lead to precise redshift determinations via the identification of electromagnetic counterparts
and host galaxies, we show that the DTD parameters are strongly degenerate with the unknown mass
efficiency and therefore cannot be determined uniquely. Second, for third-generation detectors
such as Einstein Telescope (ET) and Cosmic Explorer (CE), which will detect BNS mergers at cosmological
distances, but with a redshift uncertainty inherent to GW-only detections ($\delta(z)/z\approx
0.1z$), we show that the DTD and mass efficiency can be well-constrained to better than 10\% with
a year of observations. This long-term approach to determining the DTD through a direct mapping
of the BNS merger redshift distribution will be supplemented by more near term studies of the DTD
through the properties of BNS merger host galaxies at $z\approx 0$ (Safarzadeh & Berger 2019).
