We perform numerical simulations of the TRAPPIST-1 system of seven exoplanets orbiting a nearby
M dwarf, starting with a previously suggested stable configuration. The long-term stability of
this configuration is confirmed, but the motion of planets is found to be chaotic. The eccentricity
values are found to vary within finite ranges. The rates of tidal dissipation and tidal evolution
of orbits are estimated, assuming an Earth-like rheology for the planets. We find that under this
assumption the planets b, d, e were captured in the 3:2 or higher spin-orbit resonances during the
initial spin-down but slipped further down into the 1:1 resonance. Dependent on its rheology, the
innermost planet b may be captured in a stable pseudosynchronous rotation. Non-synchronous rotation
ensures higher levels of tidal dissipation and internal heating. The positive feedback between
the viscosity and the dissipation rate -- and the ensuing runaway heating -- are terminated by a few
self-regulation processes. When the temperature is high and the viscosity is low enough, the planet
spontaneously leaves the 3:2 resonance. Further heating is stopped either by passing the peak dissipation
or by the emergence of partial melt in the mantle. In the post-solidus state, the tidal dissipation
is limited to the levels supported by the heat transfer efficiency. The tides on the host star are
unlikely to have had a significant dynamical impact. The tides on the synchronized inner planets
tend to reduce these planets' orbital eccentricity, possibly contributing thereby to the system's
stability.
