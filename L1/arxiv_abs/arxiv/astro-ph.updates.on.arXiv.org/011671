When investigating the sizes of galaxies it is standard practice to use the half-light radius, $r_{50}$.
Here we explore the effects of the size definition on the distribution of galaxies in the size -- stellar
mass plane. Specifically, we consider $r_{20}$ and $r_{80}$, the radii that contain 20% and 80%
of a galaxy's total luminosity, as determined from a Sersic profile fit, for galaxies in the 3D-HST/CANDELS
and COSMOS-DASH surveys. These radii are calculated from size catalogs based on a simple calculation
assuming a Sersic profile. We find that the size-mass distributions for $r_{20}$ and $r_{80}$ are
markedly different from each other and also from the canonical $r_{50}$ distribution. The most
striking difference is in the relative sizes of star forming and quiescent galaxies at fixed stellar
mass. Whereas quiescent galaxies are smaller than star forming galaxies in $r_{50}$, this difference
nearly vanishes for $r_{80}$. By contrast, the distance between the two populations increases
for $r_{20}$. Considering all galaxies in a given stellar mass and redshift bin we detect a significant
bimodality in the distribution of $r_{20}$, with one peak corresponding to star forming galaxies
and the other to quiescent galaxies. We suggest that different measures of the size are tracing different
physical processes within galaxies; $r_{20}$ is closely related to processes controlling the
star formation rate of galaxies and $r_{80}$ may be sensitive to accretion processes and the relation
of galaxies with their halos.
