Ridge lines on the pc-scale jet of the active galactic nucleus BL Lac display transverse patterns
that move superluminally downstream. The patterns are not ballistic, but are analogous to waves
on a whip. Their apparent speeds $\beta_\mathrm{app}$ (units of $c$) range from 4.2 to 13.5, corresponding
to $\beta_\mathrm{wave}^\mathrm{gal}= 0.981 - 0.998$ in the galaxy frame. We show that the magnetic
field in the jet is well-ordered with a strong transverse component, and assume that it is helical
and that the transverse patterns are longitudinal Alfv\'en waves. The wave-induced transverse
speed of the jet is non-relativistic ($\beta_\mathrm{tr}^\mathrm{gal}\sim 0.09$) and in agreement
with our assumption of low-amplitude waves. In 2010 the wave activity subsided and the jet displayed
a mild wiggle that had a complex oscillatory behavior. The waves are excited by changes in the position
angle of the recollimation shock, in analogy to exciting a wave on a whip by shaking it. Simple models
of the system are presented; the preferred one assumes that the sound speed in the plasma is $\rm\beta_s=0.3$
and this, combined with the measured speeds of the Alfv\'en wave and a component that is assumed to
be an MHD slow wave, results in Lorentz factor of the jet $\Gamma_\mathrm{jet}\sim 2.8$, pitch angle
of the helix (in the jet frame) $\alpha\sim 43\deg$, Alfv\'en speed $\beta_\mathrm{A}\sim 0.86$,
and magnetosonic Mach number $M_\mathrm{ms}\sim 1.5$. This describes a plasma in which the magnetic
field is dominant but not overwhelmingly so, and the field is in a moderate helix.
