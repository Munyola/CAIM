We show that the stellar specific angular momentum j_*, mass M_*, and bulge fraction beta_* of normal
galaxies of all morphological types are consistent with a simple model based on a linear superposition
of independent disks and bulges. In this model, disks and bulges follow scaling relations of the
form j_*d ~ M_*d^alpha and j_*b ~ M_*b^alpha with alpha = 0.67 +/- 0.07 but offset from each other by
a factor of 8 +/- 2 over the mass range 8.9 <= log M_*/M_Sun <= 11.8. Separate fits for disks and bulges
alone give alpha = 0.58 +/- 0.10 and alpha = 0.83 +/- 0.16, respectively. This model correctly predicts
that galaxies follow a curved 2D surface in the 3D space of log j_*, log M_*, and beta_*. We find no statistically
significant indication that galaxies with classical and pseudo bulges follow different relations
in this space, although some differences are permitted within the observed scatter and the inherent
uncertainties in decomposing galaxies into disks and bulges. As a byproduct of this analysis, we
show that the j_*--M_* scaling relations for disk-dominated galaxies from several previous studies
are in excellent agreement with each other. In addition, we resolve some conflicting claims about
the beta_*-dependence of the j_*--M_* scaling relations. The results presented here reinforce
and extend our earlier suggestion that the distribution of galaxies with different beta_* in the
j_*--M_* diagram constitutes an objective, physically motivated alternative to subjective classification
schemes such as the Hubble sequence.
