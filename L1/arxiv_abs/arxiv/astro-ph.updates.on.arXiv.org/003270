We study the Lya profiles of 36 spectroscopically-detected Lya-emitters (LAEs) at z2-3, using
Keck MOSFIRE to measure systemic redshifts and velocity dispersions from rest-frame optical nebular
emission lines. The sample has a median optical magnitude R=26.0, and ranges from R23 to R>27,
corresponding to rest-frame UV absolute magnitudes M_UV-22 to M_UV>-18.2. Dynamical masses
range from M_dyn<1.3e8 Msun to M_dyn=6.8e9 Msun, with a median value of M_dyn=6.3e8 Msun. Thirty
of the 36 Lya emission lines are redshifted with respect to the systemic velocity with at least 1 sigma
significance, and the velocity offset with respect to systemic dv_Lya is correlated with R-band
magnitude, M_UV, and the velocity dispersion measured from nebular emission lines with >3 sigma
significance: brighter galaxies with larger velocity dispersions tend to have larger values of
dv_Lya. We also make use of a comparison sample of 122 UV-color-selected R<25.5 galaxies at z2,
all with Lya emission and systemic redshifts measured from nebular emission lines. Using the combined
LAE and comparison samples for a total of 158 individual galaxies, we find that dv_Lya is anti-correlated
with the Lya equivalent width with 7 sigma significance. Our results are consistent with a scenario
in which the Lya profile is determined primarily by the properties of the gas near the systemic redshift;
in such a scenario, the opacity to Lya photons in lower mass galaxies may be reduced if large gaseous
disks have not yet developed and if the gas is ionized by the harder spectrum of young, low metallicity
stars.
