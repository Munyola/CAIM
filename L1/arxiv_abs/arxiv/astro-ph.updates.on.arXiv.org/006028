One unsettled problem in cosmology is that the baryon fractions identified as stars and cold gas
in halos of galaxies and galaxy groups are lower than the universal fraction. The detection of the
missing baryon component and the study of its properties are crucial for understanding how physical
processes produce the galaxy population we observe. Numerical simulations show that part of the
missing baryons are in a warm-hot circum-galactic medium (CGM). Such a gas component, predominantly
ionized, can be investigated via its thermal and kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effects (tSZE and
kSZE), the distortions of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) spectrum by free electrons in thermal
and bulk motions, respectively. Detection of kSZE has been reported recently at $2-4\sigma$ level
based on the collective signals associated with large-scale structure traced by galaxies. However,
it is difficult to explain the results in terms of baryons associated with galaxy systems of different
masses, and so their implication for the missing baryon problem in halos is uncertain. Here we present
the first measurement of kSZE as a function of mass of galaxy groups down to $\sim10^{12.3}{\rm M_\odot}$,
from about 40,000 galaxy groups with known masses and peculiar velocities, using the Planck CMB
maps. The gas fractions in galaxy groups are inferred to be comparable to the cosmic fraction, indicating
that the missing baryons are found. Combined with tSZE measurements, our results imply that the
CGM is warm-hot, with effective temperatures about $10^5$ - $10^6{\rm K}$.
