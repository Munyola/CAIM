We study the orbital evolution of hierarchical quadruple systems composed of two binaries on a long
mutual orbit, where each binary acts as a Kozai-Lidov (KL) perturber on the other. We find that the
coupling between the two binaries qualitatively changes the behavior of their KL cycles. The binaries
can experience coherent eccentricity oscillations as well as excursions to very high eccentricity
that occur over a much larger fraction of the parameter space than in triple systems. For a ratio of
outer to inner semi-major axes of 10 to 20, about 30 to 50% of equal-mass quadruples reach eccentricity
1-e < 10^{-3} in one of the binaries. This is about 4 to 12 times more than for triples with equivalent
parameters. Orbital "flips" and collisions without previous tidal interaction are similarly
enhanced in quadruples relative to triples. We argue that the frequency of evolutionary paths influenced
by KL cycles is comparable in the triple and quadruple populations even though field quadruples
are a factor of ~5 less frequent than triples. Additionally, quadruples might be a non-negligible
source of triples and provide fundamentally new evolutionary outcomes involving close binaries,
mergers, collisions, and associated transients, which occur without any fine tuning of parameters.
Finally, we study the perturbations to a planetary orbit due to a distant binary and we find that the
fraction of orbital flips is a factor of 3 to 4 higher than for the corresponding triple system given
our fiducial parameters with implications for hot Jupiters and star-planet collisions.
