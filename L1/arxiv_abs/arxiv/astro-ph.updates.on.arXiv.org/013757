Terzan 5 is the only Galactic globular cluster that has plausibly been detected at very-high energies
by the High Energy Stereoscopic System. It has an unexpectedly asymmetric very-high-energy morphology
that is offset from the cluster center, in addition to a large-scale, offset radio structure and
compact diffuse X-ray emission associated with this cluster. We present new data from the Fermi
Large Area Telescope on this source. We model the updated broadband spectral energy distribution,
attributing this to cumulative pulsed emission from a population of embedded millisecond pulsars
as well as unpulsed emission from the interaction of their leptonic winds with the ambient magnetic
and soft-photon fields. In particular, our model invokes unpulsed synchrotron and inverse Compton
components to model the radio and TeV data, cumulative pulsed curvature radiation to fit the Fermi
data, and explains the hard Chandra X-ray spectrum via a "new" cumulative synchrotron component
from electron-positron pairs within the pulsar magnetospheres that has not been implemented before.
We find reasonable spectral fits for plausible model parameters. We also derive constraints on
the millisecond pulsar luminosity function using the diffuse X-ray data and the Chandra sensitivity.
Future higher-quality spectral and spatial data will help discriminate between competing scenarios
(such as dark matter annihilation, white dwarf winds or hadronic interactions) proposed for the
broadband emission as well as constrain degenerate model parameters.
