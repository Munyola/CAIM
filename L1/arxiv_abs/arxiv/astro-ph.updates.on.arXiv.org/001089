Lower bounds are derived on the amplitude B of intergalactic magnetic fields (IGMFs) in the region
between Galaxy and the blazar Mrk 421, from constraints on the delayed GeV pair-echo flux that are
emitted by secondary e^-e^+ produced in \gamma\gamma interactions between primary TeV gamma-rays
and the cosmic infrared background. The distribution of galaxies mapped by the Sloan Digital Sky
Survey shows that this region is dominated by a large intergalactic void. We utilize data from long-term,
simultaneous GeV-TeV observations by the Fermi Large Area Telescope and the ARGO-YBJ experiment
extending over 850 days. For an assumed value of B, we evaluate the daily GeV pair-echo flux expected
from the TeV data, select the dates where this exceeds the Fermi 2-\sigma sensitivity, compute the
probability that this flux is excluded by the Fermi data for each date, and then combine the probabilities
using the inverse normal method. Consequently, we exclude B < 10^{-20.5} G for a field coherence
length of 1 kpc at 4- \sigma level, as long as plasma instabilities are unimportant for cooling of
the pair beam. This is much more significant than the 2-\sigma bounds we obtained previously from
observations of Mrk 501, by virtue of more extensive data from the ARGO-YBJ, as well as improved statistical
analysis. Compared with most other studies of IGMF bounds, the evidence we present here for a non-zero
IGMF is more robust as it does not rely on unproven assumptions on the primary TeV emission during
unobserved periods.
