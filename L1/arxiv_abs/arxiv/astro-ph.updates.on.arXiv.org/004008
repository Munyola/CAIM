XB 1254-690 is a dipping low mass X-ray binary system hosting a neutron star and showing type I X-ray
bursts. We aim at obtaining more accurate orbital ephemeris and at constraining the orbital period
derivative of the system for the first time. In addition, we want to better constrain the distance
to the source in order to locate the system in a well defined evolutive scenario. We apply for the first
time an orbital timing technique to XB 1254-690, using the arrival times of the dips present in the
light curves that have been collected during 26 years of X-ray pointed observations performed from
different space missions. We estimate the dip arrival times using a statistical method that weights
the count-rate inside the dip with respect to the level of the persistent emission outside the dip.
We fit the obtained delays as a function of the orbital cycles both with a linear and a quadratic function.
We infer the orbital ephemeris of XB 1254-690 improving the accuracy of the orbital period with respect
to previous estimates. We infer a mass of M$_{2}=0.42\pm 0.04$ M$_{\odot}$ for the donor star, in
agreement with the estimations already present in literature, assuming that the star is in thermal
equilibrium while it transfers part of its mass via the inner Lagrangian point, and assuming a neutron
star mass of 1.4 M$_{\odot}$. Using these assumptions, we also constrain the distance to the source,
finding a value of 7.6$\pm 0.8$ kpc. Finally, we discuss the evolution of the system suggesting that
it is compatible with a conservative mass transfer driven by magnetic braking.
