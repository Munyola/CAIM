The Galactic transient black hole candidate H 1743--322 exhibited a long duration outburst in 2003
after more than two and a half decades of inactivity. The 2003 event was extensively studied in multi-wavelength
bands by many groups. The striking feature is that the total energy released is extremely high as
compared to that in tens of outbursts which followed. In this paper, we look at this event and study
both the spectral and temporal properties of the source using two component advective flow (TCAF)
paradigm. We extract accretion flow parameters for each observation from spectral properties
of the decay phase and determine the mass of the black hole. We computed the energy released during
all the known outbursts since 2003 and showed that on an average, the energy release in an outburst
is proportional to the duration of the quiescent state just prior to it, with the exception of the
2004 outburst. A constant rate of supply of matter from the companion cannot explain the energy release
in 2004 outburst. However, if the energy release of 2003 is incomplete and the leftover is released
in 2004, then the companion's rate of matter supply can be constant since 1977 till date. We believe
that erratic behaviour of viscosity at the accumulation radius $X_p$ of matter as well as location
the $X_p$ itself, rather than the random variation of mass transfer rate from the companion, could
be responsible for non-uniformity in outburst pattern. We discuss several factors on which the
waiting time and duration of the next outburst could depend.
