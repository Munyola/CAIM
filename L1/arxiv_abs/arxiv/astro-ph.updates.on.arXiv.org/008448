Pulsar glitches provide a unique way to study neutron star microphysics because short post-glitch
dynamics are directly linked to strong frictional processes on small scales. To illustrate this
connection between macroscopic observables and microphysics, we review calculations of vortex
interactions focusing on Kelvin wave excitations and determine the corresponding mutual friction
strength for realistic microscopic parameters in the inner crust. These density-dependent crust-coupling
profiles are combined with a simplified treatment of the core coupling and implemented in a three-component
neutron star model to construct a predictive framework for glitch rises. As a result of the density-dependent
dynamics, we find the superfluid to transfer angular momentum to different parts of the crust and
the core on different timescales. This causes the spin frequency change to become non-monotonic
in time and allows for a maximum value much larger than the measured glitch size, as well as a significant
delay in recovery. The exact shape of the calculated glitch rise is strongly dependent on the relative
strength between the crust and core mutual friction, providing the means to probe not only the crustal
superfluid but also the deeper neutron star interior. To demonstrate the potential of this approach,
we compare our predictive model with the first pulse-to-pulse observations recorded during the
December 2016 glitch of the Vela pulsar. Our preliminary analysis suggests that strong friction
prevails in the inner crust, while core mutual friction is relatively weak.
