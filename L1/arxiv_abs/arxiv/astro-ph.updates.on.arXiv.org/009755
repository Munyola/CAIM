We investigate the value of the near-infrared imaging from upcoming surveys for constraining the
ellipticities of galaxies. We select galaxies between 0.5 < z < 3 that are brighter than expected
Euclid sensitivity limits from the GOODS-S and N fields in CANDELS. The co-added CANDELS/HST V+I
and J+H images are degraded in resolution and sensitivity to simulate Euclid-quality optical and
near-infrared (NIR) images. We then run GALFIT on these simulated images and find that optical and
NIR provide similar performance in measuring galaxy ellipticities at redshifts 0.5 < z < 3. At z >
1.0, the NIR-selected source density is higher by a factor of 1.4 and therefore the standard error
in NIR-derived ellipticities is about 30% smaller, implying a more precise ellipticity measurement.
The good performance of the NIR is mainly because galaxies have an intrinsically smoother light
distribution in the NIR bands than in the optical, the latter tracing the clumpy star-forming regions.
In addition, the NIR bands have a higher surface brightness per pixel than the optical images, while
being less affected by dust attenuation. Despite the worse spatial sampling and resolution of Euclid
NIR compared to optical, the NIR approach yields equivalent or more precise galaxy ellipticity
measurements. If systematics that affect shape such as dithering strategy and point spread function
undersampling can be mitigated, inclusion of the NIR can improve galaxy ellipticity measurements
over all redshifts. This is particularly important for upcoming weak lensing surveys, such as with
Euclid and WFIRST.
