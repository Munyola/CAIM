We argue that photoionisation feedback from massive stars is very efficient at driving outflows
from molecular clouds in cases where the peaked density structure around young massive stars is
considered at radii between $\sim$0.1 and 10-100 pc. Winds, radiation pressure and other processes
are the principal drivers out to $\sim$0.1 pc. We a) develop algebraic models to describe the expansion
of photoionised HII regions under the influence of gravity and accretion in power-law density fields
with $\rho \propto r^{-w}$, b) determine when terms describing winds, radiation pressure, gravity
and photon breakout become significant enough to affect the dynamics of the HII region, and c) solve
these expressions for a set of physically-motivated conditions. In steep density profiles ($w
> 3/2$), the typical ``stall'' radius becomes an unstable ``launching'' radius, outside which
the HII region accelerates in a champagne flow over a timescale governed by the freefall time of the
cloud. Winds and radiation pressure are most important at high densities, either close to the star
or in very dense clouds such as those in the Central Molecular Zone of the Milky Way. Their contributions
to the dynamics of HII regions are generally below 10% under more typical conditions. These processes
set the initial radius of the HII region. Photoionisation is stronger in all other cases, especially
at lower metallicity, where the ionised gas temperature is higher. Winds and radiation pressure
still shape the observable structure of the HII region even in cases where they are not dynamically
important.
