Despite their activity, low-mass stars are of particular importance for the search of exoplanets
by the means of Doppler spectroscopy, as planets with lower masses become detectable. We report
on the discovery of a planetary companion around HD 180617, a bright J = 5.58 mag, low-mass M = 0.45
M_{sun} star of spectral type M2.5 V. The star, located at a distance of 5.9 pc, is the primary of the
high proper motion binary system containing vB 10, a star with one of the lowest masses known in most
of the twentieth century. Our analysis is based on new radial velocity (RV) measurements made at
red-optical wavelengths provided by the high-precision spectrograph CARMENES, which was designed
to carry out a survey for Earth-like planets around M dwarfs. The available CARMENES data are augmented
by archival Doppler measurements from HIRES and HARPS. Altogether, the RVs span more than 16 years.
The modeling of the RV variations, with a semi-amplitude of K = 2.85-0.25/+0.16m/s yields a Neptune-like
planet with a minimum mass of 12.2-1.4/+1.0 M_{Earth} on a 105.90-0.10/+0.09d circumprimary orbit,
which is partly located in the host star's habitable zone. The analysis of time series of common activity
indicators does not show any dependence on the detected RV signal. The discovery of HD 180617 b not
only adds information to a currently hardly filled region of the mass-period diagram of exoplanets
around M dwarfs, but the investigated system becomes the third known binary consisting of M dwarfs
and hosting an exoplanet in an S-type configuration. Its proximity makes it an attractive candidate
for future studies.
