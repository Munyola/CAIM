The reionization optical depth is the most poorly determined of the six $\Lambda$CDM parameters
fit to CMB anisotropy data. Instrumental noise and systematics have prevented uncertainties from
reaching their cosmic variance limit. At present, the datasets providing the most statistical
constraining power are the WMAP, Planck LFI, and Planck HFI full-sky polarization maps. As the reprocessed
HFI data with reduced systematics are not yet publicly unavailable, we examine determinations
of $\tau$ using 9-year WMAP and 2015 Planck LFI data, with an emphasis on characterizing potential
systematic bias resulting from foreground template and masking choices. We find evidence for a
low-level systematic in the LFI polarization data with a roughly common-mode morphology across
the LFI frequencies and a spectrum consistent with leakage of intensity signal into the polarization
channels. We demonstrate significant bias in the optical depth derived when using the LFI 30 GHz
map as a template to clean synchrotron from WMAP data, and recommend against use of the 2015 LFI 30
GHz polarization data as a foreground template for non-LFI datasets. We find an inconsistency between
versions of the 2015 polarized 353 GHz dust templates reconstructed from the Planck likelihood
and those from delivered maps, which can affect $\tau$ at the 1$\sigma$ level. The spread in $\tau$
values over the ensemble of data combinations we study suggests that systematic uncertainties
still contribute significantly to the current uncertainty in $\tau$, but all values are consistent
with the range of $\tau$ = 0.07 +/- 0.02.
