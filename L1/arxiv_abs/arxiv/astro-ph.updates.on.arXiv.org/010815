By means of post-processed cosmological Hydrodynamics simulations we explore the ability of the
fossil record method to recover the stellar mass, age gradients, and global/radial star formation
and mass growth histories of galaxies observed with an optical Integral Field Unity. We use two simulations
of representative Milky Way-sized galaxies, one disk dominated and another bulge-dominated.
We generate data cubes emulating MaNGA/SDSS-IV instrumental and observational conditions, and
analyze them using the Pipe3D pipeline. For optimal MaNGA instrumental/observational setups,
the global masses, ages, and dust extinctions of both galaxies are well recovered within the uncertainties,
while for the radial distributions, the trend is to get slightly flatter age gradients and weaker
inside-out growth modes than the true ones. The main bias is in recovering younger stellar populations
in the inner, older regions, and slightly older stellar populations in the outer, younger regions,
as well as lower global stellar masses. These trends are enhanced as lower is the spatial sampling/resolution
(less number of fibers), more inclined and dust-attenuated is the observed galaxy, lower is the
signal-to-noise ratio, and worse is the seeing. The recovered properties and histories are more
affected for the disk-dominated galaxy with a prominent inside-out growth mode than for the bulge-dominated
galaxy assembled earlier and more coherently. We make publicly available the code and the mock IFU
datacubes used in this paper.
