We consider three extensions of the Navarro, Frenk and White (NFW) profile and investigate the intrinsic
degeneracies among the density profile parameters on the gravitational lensing effect of satellite
galaxies on highly magnified Einstein rings. In particular, we find that the gravitational imaging
technique can be used to exclude specific regions of the considered parameter space, and therefore,
models that predict a large number of satellites in those regions. By comparing the lensing degeneracy
with the intrinsic density profile degeneracies, we show that theoretical predictions based on
fits that are dominated by the density profile at larger radii may significantly over- or underestimate
the number of satellites that are detectable with gravitational lensing. Finally, using the previously
reported detection of a satellite in the gravitational lens system JVAS B1938+666 as an example,
we derive for this detected satellite values of r_max and v_max that are, for each considered profile,
consistent within 1sigma with the parameters found for the luminous dwarf satellites of the Milky
Way and with a mass density slope gamma < 1.6. We also find that the mass of the satellite within
the Einstein radius as measured using gravitational lensing is stable against assumptions on the
substructure profile. In the future thanks to the increased angular resolution of very long baseline
interferometry at radio wavelengths and of the E-ELT in the optical we will be able to set tighter
constraints on the number of allowed substructure profiles.
