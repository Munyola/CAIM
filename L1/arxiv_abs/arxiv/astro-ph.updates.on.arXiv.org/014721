We use global magnetohydrodynamic simulations to study the influence of net vertical magnetic
fields on the structure of geometrically thin ($H/r \approx 0.05$) accretion disks in the Newtonian
limit. We consider initial mid-plane gas to magnetic pressure ratios $\beta_0 = 1000,\, 300$ and
$100$, spanning the transition between weakly and strongly magnetized accretion regimes. We find
that magnetic pressure is important for the disks' vertical structure in all three cases, with accretion
occurring at $z/R\approx 0.2$ in the two most strongly magnetized models. The disk midplane shows
outflow rather than accretion. Accretion through the surface layers is driven mainly by stress
due to coherent large scale magnetic field rather than by turbulent stress. Equivalent viscosity
parameters measured from our simulations show similar dependencies on initial $\beta_0$ to those
seen in shearing box simulations, though the disk midplane is not magnetic pressure dominated even
for the strongest magnetic field case. Winds are present but are not the dominant driver of disk evolution.
Over the (limited) duration of our simulations, we find evidence that the net flux attains a quasi-steady
state at levels that can stably maintain a strongly magnetized disk. We suggest that geometrically
thin accretion disks in observed systems may commonly exist in a magnetically ``elevated'' state,
characterized by non-zero but modest vertical magnetic fluxes, with potentially important implications
for disk phenomenology in X-ray binaries (XRBs) and active galactic nuclei (AGN).
