The existence of Planet Nine has been suggested to explain the pericenter clustering of extreme
trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs). However, the underlying dynamics involving Planet Nine, test
particles and Neptune is rich, and it remains unclear which dynamical processes lead to the alignment
and how they depends on the properties of Planet Nine. Here, we investigate the secular interactions
between an eccentric outer perturber and TNOs starting in a near-coplanar configuration. We find
that a large number of TNOs could survive outside of mean motion resonances at 4Gyr, which differs
from previous results obtained in the exact coplanar case with Neptune being treated as a quadrupole
potential. In addition, secular dynamics leads to the orbital clustering seen in N-body simulations.
We find that a near coplanar Planet Nine can flip TNO orbital planes, and when this happens, the geometrical
longitudes of pericenter of the TNOs librate around $180^\circ$ during the flip. Orbital precession
caused by the inner giant planets can suppress the flips while keeping the longitude of pericenter
librating when $30\lesssim r_p \lesssim 80$ AU $\&$ $a\gtrsim 250$ AU. This results in the alignment
of the pericenter of the low inclination TNOs ($i \lesssim 40^\circ$). We find the anti-aligned
population and the flipped orbits could be produced by an eccentric ($e_9 \gtrsim 0.4$) outer planet
of $\sim 10M_{\oplus}$ in a wide $a_9 \gtrsim 400 \sim 800$ AU orbit. Future surveys on the high inclination
TNOs will help further constrain the properties of possible outer planets.
