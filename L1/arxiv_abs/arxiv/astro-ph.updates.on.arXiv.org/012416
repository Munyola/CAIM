We present a photometric and dynamical study of comet C/2010 U3 (Boattini), which was seen active
in prediscovery data as early as 2005 November at a new inbound record heliocentric distance $r_{\rm
H} = 25.8$ au. Two outburst events around 2009 and 2017 were observed. The coma and tail of the comet
consist of dust grains of $\sim$10 $\mu$m in radius, ejected protractedly at speeds $\lesssim$50
m s$^{-1}$ near the subsolar point, and are subjected to the Lorentz force, solar gravitation and
radiation pressure force altogether. The prolonged activity indicates that sublimation of supervolatiles
(e.g., CO, CO$_2$) is at play, causing a net mass-loss rate $\gtrsim$1 kg s$^{-1}$. To sustain the
mass loss, the nucleus radius has to be $\gtrsim$0.1 km. The color of the cometary dust, similar to
other long-period comets, is redder than the solar colors, but we also observed potential color
variations when the comet was at $10 < r_{\rm H} < 15$ au, concurrent with the onset of crystallisation
of amorphous water ice, if at all. Using publicly available and our refined astrometric measurements,
we estimated the precise trajectory of the comet and propagated it backward to its previous perihelion.
We found that the comet has visited the planetary region $1.96 \pm 0.04$ Myr ago, with barycentric
perihelion distance $q = 8.364 \pm 0.004$ au. Thus, C/2010 U3 (Boattini) is almost certainly a dynamically
old comet from the Oort cloud, and the observed activity cannot be caused by retained heat from the
previous apparition.
