The metal-rich and old bulge globular cluster (GC) NGC 6388 is one of the most massive Galactic GCs
(M ~ 10^6 Msun). However, the spectroscopic properties of its multiple stellar populations rested
only on 32 red giants (only seven of which observed with UVES, the remaining with GIRAFFE), given
the difficulties in observing a rather distant cluster, heavily contaminated by bulge and disc
field stars. We bypassed the problem using the largest telescope facility ever: the European Southern
Observatory (ESO) archive. By selecting member stars identified by other programmes, we derive
atmospheric parameters and the full set of abundances for 15 species from high resolution UVES spectra
of another 17 red giant branch stars in NGC 6388. We confirm that no metallicity dispersion is appreciable
in this GC. About 30% of stars show the primordial composition of first generation stars, about 20%
present an extremely modified second generation composition, and half of the stars has an intermediate
composition. The stars clearly distribute in the Al-O and Na-O planes into three discrete groups.
We find substantial hints that more than a single class of polluters is required to reproduce the
composition of the intermediate component in NGC 6388. In the heavily polluted component the sum
Mg+Al increases as Al increases. The sum Mg+Al+Si is constant, and is the fossil record of hot H-burning
at temperatures higher than about 70 MK in the first generation polluters that contributed to form
multiple populations in this cluster.
