In X-ray binary star systems consisting of a compact object that accretes material from an orbiting
secondary star, there is no straightforward means to decide if the compact object is a black hole
or a neutron star. To assist this classification, we develop a Bayesian statistical model that makes
use of the fact that X-ray binary systems appear to cluster based on their compact object type when
viewed from a 3-dimensional coordinate system derived from X-ray spectral data. The first coordinate
of this data is the ratio of counts in mid to low energy band (color 1), the second coordinate is the
ratio of counts in high to low energy band (color 2), and the third coordinate is the sum of counts in
all three bands. We use this model to estimate the probabilities that an X-ray binary system contains
a black hole, non-pulsing neutron star, or pulsing neutron star. In particular, we utilize a latent
variable model in which the latent variables follow a Gaussian process prior distribution, and
hence we are able to induce the spatial correlation we believe exists between systems of the same
type. The utility of this approach is evidenced by the accurate prediction of system types using
Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer All Sky Monitor data, but it is not flawless. In particular, non-pulsing
neutron systems containing "bursters" that are close to the boundary demarcating systems containing
black holes tend to be classified as black hole systems. As a byproduct of our analyses, we provide
the astronomer with public R code that can be used to predict the compact object type of X-ray binaries
given training data.
