String theory suggests a unique and unambiguous modification to General Relativity: the symmetry
of $\mathbf{O}(D,D)$ T-duality promotes the entire closed-string massless NS-NS sector to stringy
graviton fields. The symmetry fixes the couplings to other matter fields unambiguously and the
Einstein field equations are enriched to comprise $D^{2}+1$ components, dubbed recently as the
Einstein Double Field Equations. Here we explore the cosmological implications of this `Stringy
Gravity'. We derive the most general homogeneous and isotropic ansatzes for both stringy graviton
fields and the stringy energy-momentum tensor. Substituting them into the Einstein Double Field
Equations, we obtain the $\mathbf{O}(D,D)$ completion of the Friedmann equations along with a
generalized continuity equation. We discuss how this gives an enriched and novel framework beyond
typical string cosmology, with solutions that may be characterized by two equation-of-state parameters,
$w$ (conventional) and $\lambda$ (new). When $\lambda+3w=1$, the dilaton remains constant throughout
the cosmological evolution, and one recovers the standard Friedmann equations for generic matter
content (i.e. for any $w$), an improvement over conventional string cosmology where this occurs
only for a radiation equation of state ($w=1/3$). We further point out that, in contrast to General
Relativity, in Stringy Gravity there is no de Sitter solution arising from either an $\mathbf{O}(D,D)$-symmetric
cosmological constant or scalar field with positive energy density.
