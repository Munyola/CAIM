We present a survey for the tightest visual binaries among 0.3-2 Msun members the Orion Nebula Cluster
(ONC). Among 42 targets, we discovered 13 new 0.025-0.15" companions. Accounting for the Branch
bias, we find a companion star fraction (CSF) in the 10-60 au range of 21+8/-5%, consistent with that
observed in other star-forming regions (SFRs) and twice as high as among field stars; this excess
is found with a high level of confidence. Since our sample is dominated by disk-bearing targets,
this indicates that disk disruption by close binaries is inefficient, or has not yet taken place,
in the ONC. The resulting separation distribution in the ONC drops sharply outside 60\,au. These
findings are consistent with a scenario in which the initial multiplicity properties, set by the
star formation process itself, are identical in the ONC and in other SFRs and subsequently altered
by the cluster's dynamical evolution. This implies that the fragmentation process does not depend
on the global properties of a molecular cloud, but on the local properties of prestellar cores, and
that the latter are self-regulated to be nearly identical in a wide range of environments. These
results, however, raise anew the question of the origin of field stars as the tight binaries we have
discovered will not be destroyed as the ONC dissolves into the galactic field. It thus appears that
most field stars formed in regions differ from well-studied SFRs in the Solar neighborhood, possibly
due to changes in core fragmentation on Gyr timescales.
