We present early optical photometry and spectroscopy of the afterglow and host galaxy of the bright
short-duration gamma-ray burst \grb. Using our target-of-opportunity program on the Gemini South
telescope, our prompt optical spectra reveal a strong trace from the afterglow superimposed on
continuum and emission lines from the $z = 0.3568 \pm 0.0005$ host galaxy. The combination of a relatively
bright optical afterglow ($r^{\prime} = 21.52$ at $\Delta t = 8.4$\,hr), together with an observed
offset of 0\farcs9 from the host nucleus (4.8 kpc projected distance at $z = 0.3568$), allow us to
extract a relatively clean spectrum dominated by afterglow light -- the first \textit{bona fide}
short-duration GRB for which this has been possible. Furthermore, the spatially resolved spectrum
allows us to constrain the properties of the explosion site directly, and compare these with the
host galaxy nucleus, as well as other short-duration GRB host galaxies. We find that while the host
is a relatively luminous ($L \approx 0.8 L^{*}_{B}$), star-forming (SFR $\gtrsim 1.3$\,M${_\odot}$\,yr$^{-1}$)
galaxy with almost solar metallicity, the spectrum of the afterglow exhibits neither emission
nor absorption features. The explosion site therefore appears to lack evidence of recent star formation,
consistent with the relatively long delay time distribution expected in a compact binary merger
scenario. The star formation rate (both in an absolute sense and normalized to the luminosity) and
metallicity of the host are both consistent with the known sample of short-duration GRB hosts.
