Analyses of data from spectroscopic and astrometric surveys have led to conflicting results concerning
the vertical characteristics of the Milky Way. Ages are often used to provide clarity, but typical
uncertainties of $>$ 40\,\% restrict the validity of the inferences made. Using the \textit{Kepler}
APOKASC sample for context, we explore the global population trends of two K2 campaign fields (3
and 6), which extend further vertically out of the Galactic plane than APOKASC. We analyse the properties
of red giant stars utilising three asteroseismic data analysis methods to cross-check and validate
detections. The Bayesian inference tool PARAM is used to determine the stellar masses, radii and
ages. Evidence of a pronounced red giant branch bump and an [$\alpha$/Fe] dependence on the position
of the red clump is observed from the radii distribution of the K2 fields. Two peaks in the age distribution
centred at $\sim$5 and and $\sim$12 Gyr are found using a sample with $\sigma_{\rm{age}}$ $<$ 35\,\%.
In a comparison with \textit{Kepler}, we find the older peak to be more prominent for K2. This age
bimodality is also observed based on a chemical selection of low- ($\leq$ 0.1) and high- ($>$ 0.1)
[$\alpha$/Fe] stars. As a function of vertical distance from the Galactic mid-plane ($|Z|$), the
age distribution shows a transition from a young to old stellar population with increasing $|Z|$
for the K2 fields. Further coverage of campaign targets with high resolution spectroscopy is required
to increase the yield of precise ages achievable with asteroseismology.
