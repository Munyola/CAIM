We present a new analysis of the interstellar protons toward the TeV $\gamma$-ray SNR RX J0852.0$-$4622
(G266.2$-$1.2, Vela Jr.). We used the NANTEN2 $^{12}$CO($J$ = 1-0) and ATCA & Parkes HI datasets
in order to derive the molecular and atomic gas associated with the TeV $\gamma$-ray shell of the
SNR. We find that atomic gas over a velocity range from $V_\mathrm{LSR}$ = $-4$ km s$^{-1}$ to 50 km
s$^{-1}$ or 60 km s$^{-1}$ is associated with the entire SNR, while molecular gas is associated with
a limited portion of the SNR. The large velocity dispersion of the HI is ascribed to the expanding
motion of a few HI shells overlapping toward the SNR but is not due to the Galactic rotation. The total
masses of the associated HI and molecular gases are estimated to be $\sim2.5 \times 10^4 $ $M_{\odot}$
and $\sim10^3$ $M_{\odot}$, respectively. A comparison with the H.E.S.S. TeV $\gamma$-rays indicates
that the interstellar protons have an average density around 100 cm$^{-3}$ and shows a good spatial
correspondence with the TeV $\gamma$-rays. The total cosmic ray proton energy is estimated to be
$\sim10^{48}$ erg for the hadronic $\gamma$-ray production, which may still be an underestimate
by a factor of a few due to a small filling factor of the SNR volume by the interstellar protons. This
result presents a third case, after RX J1713.7$-$3946 and HESS J1731$-$347, of the good spatial
correspondence between the TeV $\gamma$-rays and the interstellar protons, lending further support
for a hadronic component in the $\gamma$-rays from young TeV $\gamma$-ray SNRs.
