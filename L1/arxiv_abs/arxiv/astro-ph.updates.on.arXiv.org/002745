We present the results of a search for galaxy substructures in a sample of 11 gravitational lens galaxies
from the Sloan Lens ACS Survey. We find no significant detection of mass clumps, except for a luminous
satellite in the system SDSS J0956+5110. We use these non-detections, in combination with a previous
detection in the system SDSS J0946+1006, to derive constraints on the substructure mass function
in massive early-type host galaxies with an average redshift z ~ 0.2 and an average velocity dispersion
of 270 km/s. We perform a Bayesian inference on the substructure mass function, within a median region
of about 32 kpc squared around the Einstein radius (~4.2 kpc). We infer a mean projected substructure
mass fraction $f = 0.0076^{+0.0208}_{-0.0052}$ at the 68 percent confidence level and a substructure
mass function slope $\alpha$ < 2.93 at the 95 percent confidence level for a uniform prior probability
density on alpha. For a Gaussian prior based on Cold Dark Matter (CDM) simulations, we infer $f = 0
.0064^{+0.0080}_{-0.0042}$ and a slope of $\alpha$ = 1.90$^{+0.098}_{-0.098}$ at the 68 percent
confidence level. Since only one substructure was detected in the full sample, we have little information
on the mass function slope, which is therefore poorly constrained (i.e. the Bayes factor shows no
positive preference for any of the two models).The inferred fraction is consistent with the expectations
from CDM simulations and with inference from flux ratio anomalies at the 68 percent confidence level.
