The high ionization-state ions trace the hot gases in the universe, of which gaseous halos around
galaxies are a major contributor. Following Qu & Bregman (2018), we calculate the gaseous halo contribution
to the observed column density distributions for these ions by convolving the gaseous halo model
with the observed stellar mass function. The predicted column density distribution reproduces
the general shape of the observed column density distribution -- a broken power law with the break
point at $\log N=14.0$ for {\OVI}. Our modeling suggests that the high column density systems originate
from galaxies for which the virial temperature matches the temperature of the ionization fraction
peak. Specifically, this mass range is $\log M_\star=8.5-10$ for {\OVI}, $\log M_\star=9.5-10.5$
for {\NeVIII}, and higher for higher ionization state ions (assuming $T_{\rm max}=2T_{\rm vir}$).
A comparison with the observed {\OVI} column density distribution prefers a large radius model,
where the maximum radius is twice the virial radius. This model may be in conflict with the more poorly
defined {\NeVIII} column density distribution, suggesting further observations are warranted.
The redshift evolution of the high column density systems is dominated by the change of the cosmic
star formation rate, which decreases from $z=1.0$ to the local universe. Some differences at lower
columns between our models and observations indicate that absorption by the intra-group (cluster)
medium and intergalactic medium are also contributors to the total column density distributions.
