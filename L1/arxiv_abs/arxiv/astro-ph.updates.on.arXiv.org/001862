Nitrogen is thought to have both primary and secondary origins depending on whether the seed carbon
and oxygen are produced by the star itself (primary) or already present in the interstellar medium
(secondary) from which star forms. DLA and sub-DLA systems with typical metallicities of -3.0<Z/Z_sun<-0.5
are excellent tools to study nitrogen production. We made a search for nitrogen in the ESO-UVES advanced
data products (EUADP) database. In the EUADP database, we find 10 new measurements and 9 upper limits
of nitrogen. We further compiled DLA/sub-DLA data from the literature with estimates available
of nitrogen and alpha-elements. This yields a total of 98 systems, i.e. the largest nitrogen abundance
sample investigated so far. In agreement with previous studies, we indeed find a bimodal [N/alpha]
behaviour: three-quarter systems show a mean value of [N/alpha]=-0.87 with a scatter of 0.21 dex
and one-quarter shows ratios clustered at [N/alpha]=-1.43 with a lower dispersion of 0.13 dex.
The high [N/alpha] group is consistent with the blue compact dwarves and dwarf irregular galaxies,
suggesting primary nitrogen production. The low [N/alpha] group is the lowest ever observed in
any astrophysical site and probably provides an evidence of the primary production by fast rotating
massive stars in young sites. Moreover, we find a transition between the two [N/alpha] groups around
[N/H]=-2.5. The transition is not abrupt and there are a few systems lying in the transition region.
Additional observations of DLAs/sub-DLAs below [N/H]<-2.5 would provide more clues.
