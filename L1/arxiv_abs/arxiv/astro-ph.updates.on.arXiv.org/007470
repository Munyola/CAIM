We present a technique to determine the polarization properties of a telescope through observations
of spectral lines that have no intrinsic linear polarization signals. For such spectral lines,
any observed linear polarization must be induced by the telescope optics. We apply the technique
to observations taken with the SPINOR at the DST and demonstrate that we can retrieve the characteristic
polarization properties of the DST at three wavelengths of 459, 526, and 615 nm. We determine the
amount of crosstalk between the intensity Stokes I and the linear and circular polarization states
Stokes Q, U, and V, and between Stokes V and Stokes Q and U. We fit a set of parameters that describe the
polarization properties of the DST to the observed crosstalk values. The values for the ratio of
reflectivities X and the retardance tau match those derived with the telescope calibration unit
within the error bars. Residual crosstalk after applying a correction for the telescope polarization
stays at a level of 3-10%. We find that it is possible to derive the parameters that describe the polarization
properties of a telescope from observations of spectral lines without intrinsic linear polarization
signal. Such spectral lines have a dense coverage (about 50 nm separation) in the visible part of
the spectrum (400-615 nm), but none were found at longer wavelengths. Using spectral lines without
intrinsic linear polarization is a promising tool for the polarimetric calibration of current
or future solar telescopes such as DKIST.
