We have carried out a statistical study of the average orientation of the magnetic field in solar
filaments with respect to their axes for more than 400 samples, based on data taken with daily full-Sun,
full-Stokes spectropolarimetric observations using the He I 1083.0 nm line. The major part of the
samples are the filaments in the quiet areas, but those in the active areas are included as well. The
average orientation of the magnetic field in filaments shows a systematic property depending on
the hemisphere; the direction of the magnetic field in filaments in the northern (southern) hemisphere
mostly deviates clockwise (counterclockwise) from their axes, which run along the magnetic polarity
inversion line. The deviation angles of the magnetic field from the axes, are concentrated between
10--30 deg. This hemispheric pattern is consistent with that revealed for chirality of filament
barbs, filament channels and for other solar features found to possess chirality. For some filaments
it was confirmed that their magnetic field direction is locally parallel to their structure seen
in Halpha images. Our results for the first time confirmed this hemispheric pattern with the direct
observation of the magnetic field in filaments. Interestingly, the filaments which show the opposite
magnetic field deviation to the hemispheric pattern, are in many cases found above the polarity
inversion line whose ambient photospheric magnetic field has the polarity alignment being opposite
to that of active regions following the Hale-Nicholson law.
