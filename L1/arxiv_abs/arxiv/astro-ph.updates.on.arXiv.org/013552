The mergers of compact binaries with at least one neutron star component have been recently recognized
as the potential leading sites of the production and ejection of r-process elements. Discoveries
of galactic binary pulsars, short gamma-ray bursts and gravitational wave detections have all
been constraining the rate of these events while the gravitational wave plus broad-band electromagnetic
coverage of binary neutron-star merger (GW170817) has also placed constraints on the properties
(mass and composition) of the merger ejecta. But uncertainties and ambiguities in modeling the
optical and infra-red emission make it difficult to definitively measure the distribution of heavy
isotopes in these mergers. In contrast, gamma-rays emitted in the decay of these neutron-rich ejecta
may provide a more direct measurement of the yields. We calculate the gamma production in remnants
of neutron star mergers, considering two epochs: a kilonova epoch, lasting about two weeks, and
a much later epoch of tens and hundreds of thousands of years after the merger. For the kilonova epoch,
when the expanding ejecta is still only partially transparent to gamma radiation, we use 3D radiative
transport simulations to produce the spectra. We show that the gamma-ray spectra associated with
beta- and alpha-decay provide a fingerprint of the ejecta properties and, for a sufficiently nearby
remnant, may be detectable, even for old remnants. We compare our gamma spectra to the potential
detection limits of next generation detectors, including LOX, AMEGO and COSI.
