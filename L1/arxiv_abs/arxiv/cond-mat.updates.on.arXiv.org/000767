The energy-dependent scattering of fermions from a localized orbital at an energy-dependent rate
\$ \Gamma(\epsilon)\propto |\epsilon|^r \$ gives rise to quantum critical points (QCPs) in the
pseudo-gap single impurity Anderson model separating a local moment phase with an unscreened spin
moment from a strong-coupling phase which slightly deviates from the screened phase of standard
Kondo problem. Using the time-dependent numerical renormalization group (TD-NRG) approach we
show that local dynamic properties always equilibrate towards a steady-state value even for quenches
across the QCP but with systematic deviations from the thermal equilibrium depending on the distance
to the critical coupling. Local non-equilibrium properties are presented for interaction quenches
and hybridization quenches. We augment our numerical data by an analytical calculation that becomes
exact at short times and find excellent agreement between the numerics and the analytical theory.
For interaction quenches within the screened phase we find an universal function for the time-dependent
local double occupancy. We trace back the discrepancy between our results and the data obtained
by a time-dependent Gutzwiller variational approach to restrictions of the wave-function ansatz
in the Gutzwiller theory: while the NRG ground states properly account for the formation of an extended
spin moment which decouples from the system in the unscreened phase, the Gutzwiller ansatz only
allows the formation of the spin moment on the local impurity orbital.
