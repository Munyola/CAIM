In quantum critical heavy fermion systems, local moments are coupled to both collective spin fluctuations
and conduction electrons. As such, the Bose-Fermi Kondo model, describing the coupling of a local
moment to both a bosonic and a fermionic bath, has been of extensive interest. For the model in the
presence of SU(2) spin rotational symmetry, questions have been raised about its phase diagram.
Here we develop a version of continuous-time Quantum Monte Carlo (CT-QMC) method suitable for addressing
this issue; this procedure can reach sufficiently low temperatures while preserving the SU(2)
symmetry. Using this method for the Bose-Fermi Anderson model, we clarify the renormalization-group
fixed points and the phase diagram for the case with a constant fermionic-bath density of states
and a power-law bosonic-bath spectral function $\rho_{b}(\omega) \propto \omega^{s}$ ($0<s<1$).
We find two types of Kondo destruction QCP, depending on the power-law exponent $s$ in the bosonic
bath spectrum. For $s^{*}<s<1$, both types of QCPs exist and, in the parameter regime accessible
by an analytical $\epsilon$-expansion renormalization-group calculation (here $\epsilon=1-s$),
the CT-QMC result is fully consistent with prior predictions by the latter method. For $s<s^{*}$,
there is only one type of QCP. At both type of Kondo destruction QCPs, we find that the exponent of the
local spin susceptibility $\eta$ obeys the relation $\eta=\epsilon$, which has important implications
for Kondo destruction QCP in the Kondo lattice problem.
