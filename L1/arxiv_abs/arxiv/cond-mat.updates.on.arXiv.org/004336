We classify symmetry fractionalization and anomalies in a (3+1)d U(1) gauge theory enriched by
a global symmetry group $G$. We find that, in general, a symmetry-enrichment pattern is specified
by 4 pieces of data: $\rho$, a map from $G$ to the duality symmetry group of this $\mathrm{U}(1)$ gauge
theory which physically encodes how the symmetry permutes the fractional excitations, $\nu\in\mathcal{H}^2_{\rho}[G,
\mathrm{U}_\mathsf{T}(1)]$, the symmetry actions on the electric charge, $p\in\mathcal{H}^1[G,
\mathbb{Z}_\mathsf{T}]$, indication of certain domain wall decoration with bosonic integer
quantum Hall (BIQH) states, and a torsor $n$ over $\mathcal{H}^3_{\rho}[G, \mathbb{Z}]$, the
symmetry actions on the magnetic monopole. However, certain choices of $(\rho, \nu, p, n)$ are not
physically realizable, i.e. they are anomalous. We find that there are two levels of anomalies.
The first level of anomalies obstruct the fractional excitations being deconfined, thus are referred
to as the deconfinement anomaly. States with these anomalies can be realized on the boundary of a
(4+1)d long-range entangled state. If a state does not suffer from a deconfinement anomaly, there
can still be the second level of anomaly, the more familiar 't Hooft anomaly, which forbids certain
types of symmetry fractionalization patterns to be implemented in an on-site fashion. States with
these anomalies can be realized on the boundary of a (4+1)d short-range entangled state. We apply
these results to some interesting physical examples.
