We have investigated the effects of number of layers on the structural, vibrational, electronic
and optical properties of $\alpha$-PbO using first principles calculations. Our theoretical
calculations have shown that four Raman active modes of $\alpha$-PbO tend to red-shift from bulk
to monolayer due to decreasing of force constants and increasing of bond lengths. It has been shown
that while bulk and multilayer $\alpha$-PbO have an indirect band gap, monolayer form has a direct
band gap value of 2.59 eV. Although lead atoms have 5d states, spin-orbit coupling does not significantly
affect the band structure of $\alpha$-PbO. The computed cleavage energy value (0.67 J/m$^2$) confirms
that monolayer PbO can be easily obtained from its bulk counterpart by exfoliation methods. In addition
to the band structure, we also calculated the optical properties and absorbed photon flux $J_{abs}$
of $\alpha$-PbO structures to investigate the possibility of solar absorption. Our calculations
reveal that while monolayer and bilayer PbO have relatively larger band gaps and lower absorption
coefficients, their $J_{abs}$ values are not ideal for solar absorption devices. In contrast,
the multilayer and bulk phases of the $\alpha$-PbOs show good overlap with the solar spectrum and
yield high electrical current values. Our calculations have indicated that ultrathin films of
$\alpha$-PbO (such as 3nm thickness) could be excellent candidates for solar cells. We believe
that our work can be utilized to improve electronic and optical devices based on lead oxide structures.
