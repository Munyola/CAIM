The bosonic t-J model is a strong-on-site repulsion limit of the two-component Bose-Hubbard model
and is expected to be realized by experiments of two-component cold atoms in an optical lattice.
In the previous papers, we studied the bosonic t-J model by both analytical methods and numerical
Monte-Carlo (MC) simulations and obtained interesting phase diagram and revealed properties
of low-energy excitations. However for the case of finite $J_z$, where $J_z$ is the $z$-component
coupling constant of the nearest-neighbor pseudo-spin interaction, phase diagram of the model
was investigated by assuming the checkerboard type of the boson densities. This analysis predicts
the existence of a supersolid (SS) for moderate value of $J_z$. In the present paper, we shall continuum
the previous studies and clarify the phase diagram etc of the bosonic t-J model by using both the Gross-Pitaevskii
(GP) theory and the MC simulations in which boson numbers at each site are treated as dynamical or
variational variables. These two methods are complementary with each other in the present analysis
and give quite reliable results. We show that as the value of $J_z$ is increased, the superfluid state
with both bosons' Bose-Einstein condensate will evolves into the SS and furthermore into the solid
with the checkerboard symmetry. In the present study, we propose a method how to identify quantum
phase transitions in the GP equations. We also study the finite-temperature phase transitions
of the superfluidity and the diagonal solid order in the SS by the MC simulations.
