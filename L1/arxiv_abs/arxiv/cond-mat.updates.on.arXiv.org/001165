Superconductivity has been the focus of enormous research effort since its discovery more than
a century ago. Yet, some features of this unique phenomenon remain poorly understood; prime among
these is the connection between superconductivity and chemical/structural properties of materials.
To bridge the gap, several machine learning methods are developed herein to model the critical temperatures
of the 12,000+ known superconductors available via the SuperCon database. Materials are first
divided into two classes based on their Tc's, above and below 10 K, and a classification model predicting
this label is trained. The model uses coarse-grained features based only on the chemical compositions.
It shows strong predictive power, with out-of-sample accuracy of about 92%. Separate regression
models are developed to predict the values of Tc for cuprate, iron-based, and "low-Tc" compounds.
These models also demonstrate good performance, with learned predictors offering important insights
into the mechanisms behind superconductivity in different families of materials. To improve the
accuracy and interpretability of these models, new features are incorporated using materials
data from the AFLOW Online Repositories. Finally, the classification and regression models are
combined into a single integrated pipeline and employed to search the entire Inorganic Crystallographic
Structure Database (ICSD) for potential new superconductors. We identify about 30 non-cuprate
and non-iron-based oxides as candidate materials.
