Van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures constructed with two-dimensional (2D) materials have attracted
great interests, due to their fascinating properties and potential for novel applications. While
earlier efforts have advanced the understanding of the ultrafast cross-layer charge transfer
process in 2D heterostructures, mechanisms for the interfacial photocarrier recombination remain,
to a large extent, unclear. Here, we investigate a heterostructure comprised of black phosphorus
(BP) and molybdenum disulfide (MoS2), with a type-II band alignment. Interestingly, it is found
that the photo-generated electrons in MoS2 (transferred from BP) exhibit an ultrafast lifetime
of about 5 ps, significantly shorter than those of the constituent materials. By corroborating
with the relaxation of photo-excited holes in BP, it is revealed that the ultrafast time constant
is as a result of efficient Langevin recombination, where the high hole mobility of BP facilitates
a large recombination coefficient (approximately 2x10^-10 m^2/s). In addition, broadband transient
absorption spectroscopy confirms that the hot electrons transferred to MoS2 distribute over a
broad energy range following an ultrafast thermalization. The rate of the interlayer Langevin
recombination is found to exhibit no energy level dependence. Our findings provide essential insights
into the fundamental photo-physics in type-II 2D heterostructures, and also provide useful guidelines
for customizing photocarrier lifetimes of BP for high-speed photo-sensitive devices.
