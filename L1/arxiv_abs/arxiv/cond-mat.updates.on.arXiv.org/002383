We present here a detailed investigation into the magnetic ordering of full Heusler alloy Ga$_2$MnCo
using dc, ac magnetization measurements, neutron diffraction and neutron depolarization experiments.
Crystal structure at room temperature was first confirmed to be L2$_1$ using the highly intense
synchrotron X-ray diffraction (XRD) technique. Temperature dependent magnetization reveals
that Ga$_2$MnCo enters a ferromagnetic (FM) state at $T_C = $154 K, characterized by a sharp increase
in magnetization and a plateau-like region hereafter. As the temperature is decreased further,
a sharp drop in magnetization is observed at $T_f$ = 50 K, hinting towards an antiferromagnetic (AFM)
phase change. Neutron diffraction (ND) recorded over the range of temperature from 6 to 300 K, provides
combined information regarding crystal as well as magnetic structure. Accordingly, an increase
in the intensity of the ND pattern is seen at 150 K, signaling onset of long range FM order. However,
there is no sign of appearance of superlattice reflections corresponding to the AFM phase, in the
patterns recorded below 50 K. An unusual discontinuity in the unit cell volume is seen around $T_f$
indicating a coupling of this second transition with the contraction of the lattice. Attempts to
unravel this interesting magnetic behaviour using ac susceptibility measurements lead to the
existence of glassy magnetism below $T_f$. Systematic analysis of the susceptibility results
along with neutron depolarization measurement, identifies the low temperature phase as a reentrant
cluster glass.
