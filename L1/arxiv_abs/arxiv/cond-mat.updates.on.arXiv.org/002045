We present a theoretical description of energy transfer processes between two noncontact quasi-
twodimensional crystals separated by distance a, oscillating with frequency omega0 and amplitude
rho0 , and compare it with the case of two quasi-twodimensional crystals in uniform parallel motion.
We apply the theory to calculate van der Waals energy and dissipated energy in two oscillating slabs
where each slab consists of a graphene monolayer deposited on SiO2 substrate. The graphene dielectric
response is determined from first principles, and SiO2 surface response is described using empirical
local dielectric function. We studied the modification of vdW attraction as function of the driving
frequency and graphene doping. We propose the idea of controlling the sticking and unsticking of
slabs by tuning the graphene dopings EF i and driving frequency omega0 . We found simple rho02 dependence
of vdW and dissipated energy. As the Dirac plasmons are the dominant channels through which the energy
between slabs can be transferred, the dissipated power in equally doped EF1 = EF2 = 0 graphenes shows
strong omega0 = 2omegap peak. This peak is substantially reduceed when graphenes are deposited
on SiO2 substrate. If only one graphene is pristine (EFi = 0) the 2omegap peak disappears. For larger
separations a the phononic losses also become important and the doping causes shifts, appearance
and disappearance of many peaks originating from resonant coupling between hybridized electronic-phononic
excitations in graphene-substrate slabs.
