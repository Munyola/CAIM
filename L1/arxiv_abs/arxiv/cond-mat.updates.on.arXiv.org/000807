SrTiO$_{3}$ undergoes a cubic-to-tetragonal phase transition at 105K. This antiferrodistortive
transition is believed to be in competition with incipient ferroelectricity. Substituting strontium
by isovalent calcium induces a ferroelectric order. Introducing mobile electrons to the system
by chemical non-isovalent doping, on the other hand, leads to the emergence of a dilute metal with
a superconducting ground state. The link between superconductivity and the other two instabilities
is an open question, which gathers momentum in the context of the growing popularity of the paradigm
linking unconventional superconductors and quantum critical points. We present a set of specific-heat,
neutron-scattering and dielectric permittivity and polarization measurements on Sr$_{1-x}$Ca$_{x}$TiO$_{3}$
($0<x<0.009$) and a low-temperature electric conductivity in Sr$_{0.9978}$Ca$_{0.0022}$TiO$_{3-\delta}$.
Calcium substitution was found to enhance the transition temperature for both anti-ferrodistortive
and ferroelectric transitions. Moreover, we find that Sr$_{0.9978}$Ca$_{0.0022}$TiO$_{3-\delta}$
has a superconducting ground state. The critical temperature in this rare case of a superconductor
with a ferroelectric parent, is slightly lower than in SrTiO$_{3-\delta}$ of comparable carrier
concentration. A three-dimensional phase diagram for Sr$_{1-x}$Ca$_{x}$TiO$_{3-\delta}$
tracking the three transition temperatures as a function of x and $\delta$ results from this study,
in which ferroelectric and superconducting ground states are not immediate neighbours.
