A single-sample synthesis concept based on multi-element ceramic samples can produce a variety
of local products. When applied to cuprate superconductors (SC), statistical modelling predicts
the occurrence of possible compounds in a concentration range of about 50 ppm. In samples with such
low concentrations, determining which compositions are superconducting is a challenging task
and requires local probes or separation techniques. Here, we report results from samples with seven
components: BaO2, CaCO3, SrCO3, La2O3, PbCO3, ZrO2 and CuO oxides and carbonates, starting from
different grain sizes. The reacted ceramics show different phases, particular grain growth, as
well as variations in homogeneity and superconducting properties. High-Tc superconductivity
up to 118 K was found. Powder x-ray diffraction (XRD) in combination with energy-dispersive spectroscopy
(EDS), scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) can assign Pb1223 and (Sr,Ca,Ba)0.7-1.0CuO2
phases in inhomogeneous samples milled with 10 mm ball sizes. Rather uniform samples featuring
strong grain growth were obtained with 3 mm ball sizes, resulting in Tc =70 K superconductivity of
the La(Ba,Ca)2Cu3Ox based phase. Scanning SQUID microscopy (SSM) establishes locally formed
superconducting areas at a level of a few microns in inhomogeneous superconducting particles captured
by a magnetic separation technique. The present results demonstrate a new synthetic approach for
attaining high-Tc superconductivity in compounds without Bi, Tl, Hg, or the need for high-pressure
synthesis.
