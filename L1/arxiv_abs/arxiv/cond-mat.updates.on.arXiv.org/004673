Vanadium dioxide is one of the most studied strongly correlated materials. Nonetheless, the intertwining
between electronic correlation and lattice effects has precluded a comprehensive description
of the rutile metal to monoclinic insulator transition, in turn triggering a longstanding "the
chicken or the egg" debate about which comes first, the Mott localisation or the Peierls distortion.
Here, we show that this problem is in fact ill-posed: the electronic correlations and the lattice
vibrations conspire to stabilise the monoclinic insulator, and so they must be treated on equal
footing not to miss relevant pieces of the VO$_2$ physics. Specifically, we design a minimal model
for VO$_2$ that includes all the important physical ingredients: the electronic correlations,
the multi-orbital character, and the two components antiferrodistortive mode that condenses
in the monoclinic insulator. We solve this model by dynamical mean-field theory within the adiabatic
Born-Oppenheimer approximation. Consistently with the first-order character of the metal-insulator
transition, the Born-Oppenheimer potential has a rich landscape, with minima corresponding to
the undistorted phase and to the four equivalent distorted ones, and which translates into an equally
rich thermodynamics that we uncover by the Monte Carlo method. Remarkably, we find that a distorted
metal phase intrudes between the low-temperature distorted insulator and high-temperature undistorted
metal, which sheds new light on the debated experimental evidence of a monoclinic metallic phase.
