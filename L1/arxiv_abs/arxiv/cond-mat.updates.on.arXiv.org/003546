Equilibrium director structures in two thin hybrid planar films of biaxial nematics are investigated
through Markov chain Monte Carlo simulations based on a lattice Hamiltonian model within the London
dispersion approximation. While the substrates of the two films induce similar anchoring influences
on the long axes of the liquid crystal molecules (viz. planar orientation at one end and perpendicular,
or homeotropic, orientations at the other), they differ in their coupling with the minor axes of
the molecules. In Type-A film the substrates do not interact with the minor axes at all (which is experimentally
relatively more amenable), while in Type-B, the orientations of the molecular axes at the surface
layer are influenced as well by their biaxial coupling with the surface. Both films exhibit expected
bending of the director associated with ordering of the molecular long axes due to surface anchoring.
Simulation results indicate that the Type-A film hosts stable and noise free director structures
in the biaxial nematic phase of the LC medium, resulting from dominant ordering of one of the minor
axes in the plane of the substrates. High degree of this stable order thus developed could be of practical
interest for in-plane switching applications with an external field. Type-B film, on the other
hand, experiences competing interactions among the minor axes, due to incompatible anchoring
influences at the bounding substrates, apparently leading to frustration, and hence to noisy equilibrium
director structures.
