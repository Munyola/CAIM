Moment equations in a general dimension d for a dilute granular gas composed of Maxwell molecules
are derived from the inelastic Boltzmann equation by employing the Grad moment method. The homogeneous
cooling state of a freely cooling granular gas is investigated with the derived moment equations
and it is shown that the granular temperature in this state decays obeying Haff's law while the higher
moments decay faster than the granular temperature. The derived moment equations are then exploited
to determine the Navier--Stokes-level constitutive relations for the stress and heat flux appearing
in the system of mass, momentum and energy balance equations. In the case of inelastic Maxwell molecules,
the Navier--Stokes-level constitutive relations from the Grad moment theories are found to be
exactly the same as those obtained by means of the Chapman--Enskog expansion. A linear stability
analysis in the vicinity of the homogeneous cooling state is performed on the derived systems of
moment equations by decomposing each moment system into the longitudinal and transverse systems.
Similar to previous studies, it is found that a heat mode from the longitudinal system and a shear
mode from the transverse system are unstable for granular gases. The latter is shown to be responsible
for the onset of instability in a system. The critical system size for the onset of instability is
estimated through the derived moment equations. The results on critical system size from moment
theories are found to be in reasonably good agreement with those from simulations.
