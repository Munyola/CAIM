Curvature and mechanics are intimately connected for thin materials, and this coupling between
geometry and physical properties is readily seen in folded structures from intestinal villi and
pollen grains, to wrinkled membranes and programmable metamaterials. While the well-known rules
and mechanisms behind folding a flat surface have been used to create deployable structures and
shape transformable materials, folding of curved shells is still not fundamentally understood.
Curved shells naturally deform by simultaneously bending and stretching, and while this coupling
gives them great stability for engineering applications, it makes folding a surface of arbitrary
curvature a non-trivial task. Here we discuss the geometry of folding a creased shell, and demonstrate
theoretically the conditions under which it may fold continuously. When these conditions are violated
we show, using experiments and simulations, that shells undergo rapid snapping motion to fold from
one stable configuration to another. Although material asymmetry is a proven mechanism for creating
this bifurcation of stability, for the case of a creased shell, the inherent geometry itself serves
as a barrier to folding. We discuss here how two fundamental geometric concepts, creases and curvature,
combine to allow rapid transitions from one stable state to another. Independent of material system
and length scale, the design rule that we introduce here explains how to generate snapping transitions
in arbitrary surfaces, thus facilitating the creation of programmable multi-stable materials
with fast actuation capabilities.
