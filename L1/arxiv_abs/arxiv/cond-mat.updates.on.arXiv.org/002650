SrRuO$_3$ presents a rare example of ferromagnetism among the 4$d$ based oxides. While the nature
of magnetic state in SrRuO$_3$ is mostly believed to be of itinerant type, recent studies suggest
a coexistence of both itinerant and localized model of magnetism in this material. Here, we have
investigated the evolution of magnetic state in doped SrRu$_{1-x}$Ti$_x$O$_3$ through studying
the critical behavior using standard techniques such as, modified Arrott plot, Kouvel-Fisher
plot and critical isotherm analysis across the magnetic transition temperature $T_c$. The substitution
of nonmagnetic Ti$^{4+}$ (3$d^{0}$) for Ru$^{4+}$ (4$d^4$) would simply dilute the magnetic system
apart from modifying the electron correlation effect and the density of states at Fermi level. Surprisingly,
$T_c$ does not change with $x$. Moreover, our analysis show the exponent $\beta$ related to spontaneous
magnetization increases while the exponents $\gamma$ and $\delta$ related to initial inverse
susceptibility and critical magnetization, respectively decrease with Ti substitution. The
estimated exponents do not match with any established theoretical models for universality classes,
however, the exponent obey the Widom relation and the scaling behavior. Interestingly, this particular
evolution of exponents in present series has similarity with that in isoelectronic doped Sr$_{1-x}$Ca$_x$RuO$_3$.
We believe that site dilution by Ti leads to formation magnetic clusters which causes this specific
changes in critical exponents.
