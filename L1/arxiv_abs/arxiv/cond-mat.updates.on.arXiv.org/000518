In order to gain an insight into the connection between vibrational dynamics of a liquid and the atomic
level Green-Kubo stress correlation function, we consider a simple model. Assuming that vibrations
are plane waves, we derive analytical expressions for the atomic level stress correlation functions
in the classical limit and analyze them. These results provide a recipe for analysis of the atomic
level stress correlation functions (obtained, for example, in MD simulations) in Fourier space
and extraction of the wavevector and frequency dependent information. We also evaluate the energies
of the atomic level stresses. Obtained energies are significantly smaller than the energies that
were obtained in MD simulations of liquids previously. This result suggests that the average energies
of the atomic level stresses in liquids and glasses are largely determined by the structural disorder.
We discuss this result in the context of equipartition of the atomic level stress energies. Analysis
of the previously published data suggests that it is possible to speak about configurational and
vibrational contributions to the average energies of the atomic level stresses in a glass state.
However, this separation in a liquid state is problematic. We also consider peak broadening in the
pair distribution function with increase of distance. We find that peak broadening (by $\approx
40%$) occurs due to the transverse vibrational modes, while contribution from the longitudinal
modes does not change with distance. Finally, we introduce and consider atomic level transverse
current correlation functions.
