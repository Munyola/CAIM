In vivo, DNA forms loops over a broad range of length scales: from several thousand base pairs (bp)
down to about 100 bp. In loops shorter than the DNA persistence length (150 bp), thermal fluctuations
can be neglected, and the molecule assumes approximately its minimal-energy shape. It is well-known
that for a simple isotropic wormlike chain model, the minimal-energy shape of a loop can be derived
exactly and is expressed as a combination of inverse elliptic integrals. Here, we construct a simple
explicit two-parameter variational solution, referred to as harmonic loop, which reproduces
the exact loop energy up to the fourth significant digit. The harmonic-loop solution is easier to
handle than the exact one, simplifying the analytical calculation of several quantities. We generalize
this solution to a twistable DNA model with anisotropic bending and twist-bend coupling, and show
that the loop shape thus derived is in excellent agreement with simulations of two different coarse-grained
DNA models. As recently found for DNA minicircles and observed in nucleosomal DNA data, twist-bend
coupling induces twist oscillations in bent DNA. Here, we show that twist waves in DNA loops have
a modulated amplitude, which is maximal in the middle of the loop and decaying at the loop edges, following
the curvature modulation. We, finally, simulate the loop dynamics at room temperature, and show
that the twist waves are robust against thermal fluctuations, and perform a normal diffusive motion,
whose origin is briefly discussed.
