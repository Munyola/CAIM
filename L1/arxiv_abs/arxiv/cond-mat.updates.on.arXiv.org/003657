In a recently developed microscopic mean field theory, we have shown that the dynamics of a system,
when described only in terms of its pair structure, can predict the correct dynamical transition
temperature. Further, the theory predicted the difference in dynamics of two systems (the Lennard-Jones
and the WCA) despite them having quite similar structures. This is in contrast to the Schweizer-Saltzman
(SS) formalism which predicted the dynamics of these two systems to be similar. The two theories
although similar in spirit have certain differences. Here we present a comparative study of these
two formalisms to find the origin of the difference in their predictive power. We show that not only
the dynamics in the potential energy surface, as described by our earlier study, but also that in
the free energy surface, like in the SS theory, can predict the correct dynamical transition temperature.
Even an approximate one component version of our theory, similar to the system used in the SS theory,
can predict the transition temperature reasonably well. According to our analysis, the absence
of the Vineyard approximation in the SS formalism led it to predict similar dynamics for the two systems.
Interestingly, we show here that despite the above mentioned shortcomings the SS theory can actually
predict the correct transition temperatures. Thus microscopic mean field theories of this class
which express dynamics in terms of the pair structure of the liquid while being unable to predict
the actual dynamics of the system are successful in predicting the correct dynamical transition
temperature.
