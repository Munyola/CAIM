The fundamental building blocks of modern silicon-based microelectronics, such as double gate
transistors in non-volatile Flash memories, are based on the control of electrical resistance
by electrostatic charging. Flash memories could soon reach their miniaturization limits mostly
because reliably keeping enough electrons in an always smaller cell size will become increasingly
difficult . The control of electrical resistance at the nanometer scale therefore requires new
concepts, and the ultimate resistance-change device is believed to exploit a purely electronic
phase change such as the Mott insulator to insulator transition [2]. Here we show that application
of short electric pulses allows to switch back and forth between an initial high-resistance insulating
state ("0" state) and a low-resistance "metallic" state ("1" state) in the whole class of Mott Insulator
compounds AM4X8 (A = Ga, Ge; M= V, Nb, Ta; X = S, Se). We found that electric fields as low as 2 kV/cm induce
an electronic phase change in these compounds from a Mott insulating state to a metallic-like state.
Our results suggest that this transition belongs to a new class of resistive switching and might
be explained by recent theoretical works predicting that an insulator to metal transition can be
achieved by a simple electric field in a Mott Insulator. This new type of resistive switching has
potential to build up a new class of Resistive Random Access Memory (RRAM) with fast writing/erasing
times (50 ns to 10 {\mu}s) and resistance ratios \Delta R/R of the order of 25% at room temperature.
