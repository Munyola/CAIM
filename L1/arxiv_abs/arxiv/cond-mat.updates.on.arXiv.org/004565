The origin of simultaneous electronic, structural and magnetic transitions in bulk rare-earth
nickelates ($RE$NiO$_3$) remains puzzling with multiple conflicting reports on the nature of
these entangled phase transitions. Heterostructure engineering of these materials offers unique
opportunity to decouple metal-insulator transition (MIT) from the magnetic transition. However,
the evolution of underlying electronic properties across these decoupled transitions remains
largely unexplored. In order to address this, we have measured Hall effect on a series of epitaxial
NdNiO$_3$ films, spanning a variety of electronic and magnetic phases. We find that the MIT results
in only partially gapped Fermi surface, whereas full insulating phase forms below the magnetic
transition. In addition, we also find a systematic reduction of the Hall coefficient ($R_H$) in
the metallic phase of these films with epitaxial strain and also a surprising transition to negative
value at large compressive strain. Partially gapped weakly insulating, paramagnetic phase is
reminiscence of pseudogap behavior of high $T_c$ cuprates. The precursor metallic phase, which
undergoes transition to insulating phase is a non-Fermi liquid with the temperature exponent ($n$)
of resistivity of 1, whereas the exponent increases to 4/3 in the non-insulating samples. Such nickelate
phase diagram with sign-reversal of $R_H$, pseudo-gap phase and non Fermi liquid behavior are intriguingly
similar to high $T_c$ cuprates, giving important guideline to engineer unconventional superconductivity
in oxide heterostructure.
