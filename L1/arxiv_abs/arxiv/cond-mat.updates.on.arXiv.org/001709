We study the non-equilibrium properties of non interacting active Ornstein-Uhlenbeck particles
(AOUP) subject to an external nonuniform field using a Fokker-Planck approach with a focus on the
linear response and time-correlation functions. In particular, we compare different methods
to compute these functions including the unified colored noise approximation (UCNA). The AOUP
model, described by the position of the particle and the active force acting on it, is usually mapped
into a Markovian process, describing the motion of a fictitious passive particle in terms of its
position and velocity, where the effect of the activity is transferred into a position-dependent
friction. We show that the form of the response function of the AOUP depends on whether we put the perturbation
on the position and keep unperturbed the active force in the original variables or perturb the position
and maintain unperturbed the velocity in the transformed variables. Indeed, as a result of the change
of variables the perturbation on the position becomes a perturbation both on the position and on
the fictitious velocity. We test these predictions by considering the response for three types
of convex potentials: quadratic, quartic and double-well potential. Moreover, by comparing the
response of the AOUP model with the corresponding response of the UCNA model we conclude that although
the stationary properties are fairly well approximated by the UCNA, the non equilibrium properties
are not, an effect which is not negligible when the persistence time is large.
