In 1980 Binnig et al. reported tunneling measurements on Nb-doped SrTiO3, and interpreted their
results as indicating two-band superconductivity in the bulk of SrTiO3. However: (1) Effective
masses determined from tunneling results in the normal state by Sroubek in 1969 and 1970 are much
smaller than those determined by most other methods. The much smaller masses were attributed to
properties of a surface layer by the present author in 1971; (2) The only other reports of two-band
superconductivity in bulk SrTiO3 can be used to infer much smaller values of band separations than
found by Binnig et al.. In this paper we give an alternative explanation of the results of Binnig et
al. in terms of superconductivity in a surface layer. We obtain fair fits to the band gaps versus Fermi
energy for the two bands in three samples where two surface subbands are occupied and to the temperature
dependence of the gaps in one crystal, using a model with three adjustable interaction parameters,
an adjustable energy for the phonons which dominate the pairing, and an adjustable ratio for the
mean-field Tc to the actual Tc. We show results for a combined fit to the low-temoerature band gaps
and to the T-dependence in one crystal. The phonon energy which gives the best fit is 21 meV. This is
probably an appropriate average over the three longitudinal polar modes and acoustic modes in the
material. A large value of about two is found for the ratio T_(cmf}/Tc, and we conjecture that this
arises because a band with a small Fermi energy not seen in the tunneling results plays a part in increasing
T_{cmf}/Tc.
