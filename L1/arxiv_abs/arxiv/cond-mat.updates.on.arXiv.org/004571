In this paper, we apply machine learning methods to study phase transitions in certain statistical
mechanical models on the two dimensional lattices, whose transitions involve non-local or topological
properties, including site and bond percolations, the XY model and the generalized XY model. We
find that using just one hidden layer in a fully-connected neural network, the percolation transition
can be learned and the data collapse by using the average output layer gives correct estimate of the
critical exponent $\nu$. We also study the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition, which
involves binding and unbinding of topological defects---vortices and anti-vortices, in the classical
XY model. The generalized XY model contains richer phases, such as the nematic phase, the paramagnetic
and the quasi-long-range ferromagnetic phases, and we also apply machine learning method to it.
We obtain a consistent phase diagram from the network trained with only data along the temperature
axis at two particular parameter $\Delta$ values, where $\Delta$ is the relative weight of pure
XY coupling. Besides using the spin configurations (either angles or spin components) as the input
information in a convolutional neural network, we devise a feature engineering approach using
the histograms of the spin orientations in order to train the network to learn the three phases in
the generalized XY model and demonstrate that it indeed works. The trained network by using system
size $L\times L$ can be used to the phase diagram for other sizes ($L'\times L'$, where $L'\ne L$)
without any further training.
