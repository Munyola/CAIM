The thermodynamic properties of the Shastry-Sutherland model have posed one of the longest-lasting
conundrums in frustrated quantum magnetism. Over a wide range on both sides of the quantum phase
transition (QPT) from the dimer-product to the plaquette-based ground state, neither analytical
nor any available numerical methods have come close to reproducing the physics of the excited states
and thermal response. We solve this problem in the dimer-product phase by introducing two qualitative
advances in computational physics. One is the use of thermal pure quantum (TPQ) states to augment
dramatically the size of clusters amenable to exact diagonalization. The second is the use of tensor-network
methods, in the form of infinite projected entangled pair states (iPEPS), for the calculation of
finite-temperature quantities. We demonstrate convergence as a function of system size in TPQ
calculations and of bond dimension in our iPEPS results, with complete mutual agreement even extremely
close to the QPT. Our methods reveal a remarkably sharp and low-lying feature in the magnetic specific
heat around the QPT, whose origin appears to lie in a proliferation of excitations composed of two-triplon
bound states. The surprisingly low energy scale and apparently extended spatial nature of these
states explain the failure of less refined numerical approaches to capture their physics. Both
of our methods will have broad and immediate application in addressing the thermodynamic response
of a wide range of highly frustrated magnetic models and materials.
