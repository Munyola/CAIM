The weak itinerant magnetism has been investigated in $A_2$Ni$_7$ compounds with $\textit{A}$
= {La,Y} using electronic band structure calculations. Y$_2$Ni$_7$ is formed in a ferromagnetic
(FM) rhombohedral Gd$_2$Co$_7$ structure, whereas La$_2$Ni$_7$ crystallizes in an antiferromagnetic
(AFM) hexagonal Ce$_2$Ni$_7$ structure. Both compounds present an electronic density of state
with a sharp and narrow peak centered at the Fermi level in non-spin polarized state. This induces
a magnetic instability and both compounds are more stable in a FM order compared to a paramagnetic
state ($\Delta \textit{E}$ = -5 meV/Ni). However for La$_2$Ni$_7$, an AFM structure is found 1.7
meV/Ni more stable that the FM state. This AFM structure is described by two FM unit blocs of opposite
Ni spin sign separated by a non-magnetic layer at $z = 0$ and $\frac12$. The Ni ($2a$) atoms belonging
to this intermediate layer are located at a center of symmetry of the hexagonal cell where the resultant
molecular field is cancelled. Further non-collinear spin calculations have been performed to
determine the Ni moment orientations which are found preferentially parallel to the $c$ axis. This
study reveals that the magnetic properties of these weak itinerant magnets depend both on the electronic
and crystal structures. Indeed, the hexagonal symmetry of La$_2$Ni$_7$, resulting of the stacking
of two units blocks (2 $AB_5$ + 1 $AB_2$) favors an AFM ordering whereas the rhombohedral one, resulting
of three blocks, explains the preferential FM state for Y$_2$Ni$_7$.
