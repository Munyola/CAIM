Quantum spin systems such as magnetic insulators usually show classical magnetic order, but such
classical states can give way to quantum liquids with exotic entanglement through two known mechanisms
of frustration: geometric frustration in lattices with triangle motifs, and spin-orbit-coupling
frustration in the exactly solvable quantum liquid of Kitaev's honeycomb lattice. Here we present
the experimental observation of a new kind of frustrated quantum liquid arising in an unlikely place:
the magnetic insulator Ba4Ir3O10 where Ir3O12 trimers form an unfrustrated square lattice. Experimentally
we find a quantum liquid state persisting down to 0.2 K that is stabilized by strong antiferromagnetic
interaction with Curie-Weiss temperature - 766 K. The astonishing frustration parameter of 3800
is beyond any known iridate thus far. Heat capacity and thermal conductivity are both linear at low
temperatures, a familiar feature in metals but here in an insulator pointing to an exotic quantum
liquid state. A mere 2% Sr substitution for Ba produces long-range order at 130 K and destroys the
linear-T features. Although the Ir4+(5d5) ions in Ba4Ir3O10 appear to form Ir3O12 trimers of face-sharing
IrO6 octahedra, we propose that intra-trimer exchange is reduced and the lattice recombines into
an array of coupled 1D chains with additional spins. An extreme limit of decoupled 1D chains can explain
most but not all of the striking experimental observations, indicating that the inter-chain coupling
plays an important role in the novel frustration mechanism leading to this quantum liquid.
