We describe a scheme to engineer non-Abelian gauge potentials on a square optical lattice using
laser-induced transitions. We emphasize the case of two-electron atoms, where the electronic
ground state g is laser coupled to a metastable state e within a state-dependent optical lattice.
In this scheme, the alternating pattern of lattice sites hosting g and e states depict a checkerboard
structure, allowing for laser-assisted tunneling along both spatial directions. In this configuration,
the nuclear spin of the atoms can be viewed as a "flavor" quantum number undergoing non-Abelian tunneling
along nearest-neighbor links. We show that this technique can be useful to simulate the equivalent
of the Haldane quantum Hall model using cold atoms trapped in square optical lattices, offering
an interesting route to realize Chern insulators. The emblematic Haldane model is particularly
suited to investigate the physics of topological insulators, but requires, in its original form,
complex hopping terms beyond nearest-neighboring sites. In general, this drawback inhibits a
direct realization with cold atoms, using standard laser-induced tunneling techniques. We demonstrate
that a simple mapping allows to express this model in terms of matrix hopping operators, that are
defined on a standard square lattice. This mapping is investigated for two models that lead to anomalous
quantum Hall phases. We discuss the practical implementation of such models, exploiting laser-induced
tunneling methods applied to the checkerboard optical lattice.
