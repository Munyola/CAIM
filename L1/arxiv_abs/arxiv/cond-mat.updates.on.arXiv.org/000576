The carbon isotope $^{13}$C, in contrast to $^{12}$C, possesses a nuclear magnetic moment and can
induce electron spin dephasing in graphene. This effect is usually neglected due to the low abundance
of $^{13}$C in natural carbon allotropes ($\sim$1 %). Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) allows for
artificial synthesis of graphene solely from a $^{13}$C precursor, potentially amplifying the
influence of the nuclear magnetic moments. In this work we study the effect of hyperfine interactions
in pure $^{13}$C-graphene on its spin transport properties. Using Hanle precession measurements
we determine the spin relaxation time and observe a weak increase of $\tau_{s}$ with doping and a
weak change of $\tau_{s}$ with temperature, as in natural graphene. For comparison we study spin
transport in pure $^{12}$C-graphene, also synthesized by CVD, and observe similar spin relaxation
properties. As the signatures of hyperfine effects can be better resolved in oblique spin-valve
and Hanle configurations, we use finite-element modeling to emulate oblique signals in the presence
of a hyperfine magnetic field for typical graphene properties. Unlike in the case of GaAs, hyperfine
interactions with $^{13}$C nuclei influence electron spin transport only very weakly, even for
a fully polarized nuclear system. Also, in the measurements of the oblique spin-valve and Hanle
effects no hyperfine features could be resolved. This work experimentally confirms the weak character
of hyperfine interactions and the negligible role of $^{13}$C atoms in the spin dephasing processes
in graphene.
