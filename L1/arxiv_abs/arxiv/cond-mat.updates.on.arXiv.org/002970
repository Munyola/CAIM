The complex morphologies exhibited by spatially confined thin objects have long challenged human
efforts to understand and manipulate them, from the representation of patterns in draped fabric
in Renaissance art to current day efforts to engineer flexible sensors that conform to the human
body. We introduce a mathematical principle, broadly generalizing Euler's elastica -- a core concept
of continuum mechanics that invokes the energetic preference of bending over straining a thin solid
object and has been widely applied to classical and modern studies of beams and rods. We define a class
of {\emph{geometrically incompatible confinement}} problems, whereby the topography imposed
on a thin solid body is incompatible with its intrinsic ("target") metric and, as a consequence of
Gauss' Theorema Egregium, induces strain. Focusing on a prototypical example of a sheet attached
to a spherical substrate, numerical simulations and analytical study demonstrate that the mechanics
is governed by a variational principle, which we call the "Gauss-Euler elastica". This emergent
rule states that -- despite the unavoidable strain in such an incompatible confinement -- the ratio
between the energies stored in straining and bending the solid may be arbitrarily small. The Gauss-Euler
elastica underlies a theoretical framework that greatly simplifies the daunting task of solving
the highly nonlinear equations that describe thin solids at mechanical equilibrium. This development
thus opens new possibilities for attacking a broad class of phenomena governed by the coupling of
geometry and mechanics.
