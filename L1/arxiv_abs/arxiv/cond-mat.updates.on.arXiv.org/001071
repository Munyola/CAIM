Two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors isoelectronic to phosphorene has been drawing much attention
recently due to their promising applications for next-generation (opt)electronics. This family
of 2D materials contains more than 400 members, including (a) elemental group-V materials, (b)
binary III-VII and IV-VI compounds, (c) ternary III-VI-VII and IV-V-VII compounds, making materials
design with targeted functionality unprecedentedly rich and extremely challenging. To shed light
on rational functionality design with this family of materials, we systemically explore their
fundamental band gaps and alignments using hybrid density functional theory (DFT) in combination
with machine learning. First, GGA-PBE and HSE calculations are performed as a reference. We find
this family of materials share similar crystalline structures, but possess largely distributed
band-gap values ranging approximately from 0 to 8 eV. Then, we apply machine learning methods, including
Linear Regression (LR), Random Forest Regression (RFR), and Support Vector Machine Regression
(SVR), to build models for prediction of electronic properties. Among these models, SVR is found
to have the best performance, yielding the root mean square error (RMSE) less than 0.15 eV for predicted
band gaps, VBMs, and CBMs when both PBE results and elemental information are used as features. Thus,
we demonstrate machine learning models are universally suitable for screening 2D isoelectronic
systems with targeted functionality and especially valuable for the design of alloys and heterogeneous
systems.
