We study the micro-structure of computationally generated amorphous silicon ($a$-Si) and hydrogenated
amorphous silicon ($a$-Si:H) as a function of density. We use the WWW Monte Carlo method with the
Keating potential, using different fixed densities in the generation process. We find a smooth
evolution in bond lengths, bond angles, and bond angle deviations $\Delta \theta$ as the density
is changed around the equilibrium value of $4.9\times10^{22}\ $atoms/cm$^3$ to higher and lower
values. A significant change occurs at densities below $4.3\times10^{22}\ $atoms/cm$^3$ with
an onset of void formation, which is associated with a drop in negative pressure, akin to a cavitation
process in liquids. We find both small voids (radius $\sim$ 3 Angstroms) and larger ones (up to 7 Angstroms),
as in previous computational studies, which compare well with available experimental data. The
voids have an influence on atomic structure up to 4 Angstroms beyond the void surface, and are associated
with decreasing structural order, measured by $\Delta\theta$. We also observe an increasing medium-range
dihedral order with increasing density. The method used to generate structures with voids does
not rely on expensive density functional theory molecular dynamics, and allow voids to form naturally
by a physical process, without needing any scheme for adding or removing atoms or an a priori idea
of void structure. This work provides a set of void structures for further studies of properties
such as the Staebler-Wronski effect.
