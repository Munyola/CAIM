Symmetry principles play a critical role in formulating the fundamental laws of nature$^{1}$,
with a large number of symmetry-protected topological states identified in recent studies of quantum
materials$^{2,3}$. As compelling examples, massless Dirac fermions are jointly protected by
the space inversion symmetry $P$ and time reversal symmetry $T$ supplemented by additional crystalline
symmetry$^{4-8}$, while evolving into Weyl fermions when either $P$ or $T$ is broken$^{4,9-11}$.
Strikingly, such massless Dirac fermions are expected to survive when each of the $P$ and $T$ symmetries
is individually broken but the combined $PT$ symmetry is preserved$^{12}$. To date, this conceptually
intriguing prediction remains to be experimentally validated. Here, based on angle-resolved
photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) aided by first-principles calculations, we present the first
experimental observation of massless Dirac fermions in a layered FeSn crystal containing antiferromagnetically
coupled ferromagnetic Fe kagome layers. In this system, each of the $P$ and $T$ symmetries is individually
broken, but the stable Dirac points are protected by the combined $PT$ symmetry with additional
non-symmorphic $S_{2z}$ symmetry. We further demonstrate that by breaking the $PT$ or $S_{2z}$
symmetry, we can transform the massless Dirac fermions into massless Weyl or massive Dirac fermions.
The present study substantially enriches our fundamental understanding of the intricate connections
between symmetries and topologies of matter, especially with the spin degree of freedom playing
a vital role.
