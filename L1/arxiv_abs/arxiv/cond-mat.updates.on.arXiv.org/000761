We report the crystal structure, magnetization and neutron scattering measurements on the double
perovskite Ba$_2$YOsO$_6$. The $Fm\overline{3}m$ space group is found both at 290~K and 3.5~K
with cell constants $a_0 = 8.3541(4)$~{\AA} and $8.3435(4)$~\AA, respectively. Os$^{5+}$ ($5d^3$)
ions occupy a non-distorted, geometrically frustrated face-centered-cubic (FCC) lattice. A
Curie-Weiss temperature $\theta = -772$~K suggests the presence of a large antiferromagnetic
interaction and a high degree of magnetic frustration. A magnetic transition to long range antiferromagnetic
order, consistent with a Type I FCC state below $T_{\rm N} \sim 69$~K, is revealed by magnetization,
Fisher heat capacity and elastic neutron scattering, with an ordered moment of 1.65(6)~$\mu_B$
on Os$^{5+}$. The ordered moment is much reduced from either the expected spin only value of $\sim
3 \mu_B$ or the value appropriate to $4d^3$ Ru$^{5+}$ in isostructural Ba$_2$YRuO$_6$ of 2.2(1)~$\mu_B$,
suggesting a role for spin orbit coupling (SOC). Triple axis neutron scattering measurements of
the order parameter suggest an additional first-order transition at $T = 67.45$~K, and the existence
of a second ordered state. % Time-of-flight inelastic neutron results reveal a large spin gap $\Delta
\sim 17$~meV, unexpected for an orbitally quenched, $d^3$ electronic configuration. We discuss
this in the context of the $\sim 5$~meV spin gap observed in the related Ru$^{5+}$, $4d^3$ cubic double
perovskite Ba$_2$YRuO$_6$, and attribute the $\sim 3$ times larger gap to stronger SOC present
in this heavier, $5d$, osmate system.
