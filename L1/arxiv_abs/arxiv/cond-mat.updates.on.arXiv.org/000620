Anisotropic thermoelectrics is a very interesting topic among recent research. The transport
distribution function plays the central role on modeling the anisotropic thermoelectrics. The
methodology of numerical integrations is used in previous literature on anisotropic transport,
which does not capture the sharp change of transport distribution function and density of states
at band edges. However, the sharp change of transport distribution function and density of states
at band edges plays the central role in enhancing the thermoelectric performance. Thus, an analytical
methodology that is robust on modeling the sharp change of transport distribution function and
density of states at a band edges is needed. To our best knowledge, there has not been a paper giving
the systematic study on the analytical models of anisotropic transport distribution function
for different kinds of band valleys in different dimensions under different assumptions. Therefore,
the main focus of this present paper is to develop such a robust analytical methodology on modeling
the anisotropic transport distribution function. So our contributions are 1) we have developed
a systematic method on model the anisotropic transport distribution function, for 3D, 2D and 1D
systems, in parabolic, non-parabolic and linear dispersion relations, under both the relaxation
time approximation and the mean free path approximation; 2) we have found that the Onsage's relation
of transport can be violated under certain conditions; 3) we have compared our newly developed methodology
with the traditional used numerical methodology.
