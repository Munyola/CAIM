Periodically driven quantum many-body systems support anomalous topological phases of matter,
which cannot be realized by static systems. In many cases, these anomalous phases can be many-body
localized, which implies that they are stable and do not heat up as a result of the driving. What types
of anomalous topological phenomena can be stabilized in driven systems, and in particular, can
an anomalous phase exhibiting non-Abelian anyons be stabilized? We address this question using
an exactly solvable, stroboscopically driven 2D Kitaev spin model, in which anisotropic exchange
couplings are boosted at consecutive time intervals. The model shows a rich phase diagram which
contains anomalous topological phases. We characterize these phases using weak and strong scattering-matrix
invariants defined for the fermionic degrees of freedom. Of particular importance is an anomalous
phase whose zero flux sector exhibits fermionic bands with zero Chern numbers, while a vortex binds
a pair of Majorana modes, which as we show support non-Abelian braiding statistics. We further show
that upon adding disorder, the zero flux sector of the model becomes localized. However, the model
does not remain localized for a finite density of vortices. Hybridization of Majorana modes bound
to vortices form "vortex bands", which delocalize by either forming Chern bands or a thermal metal
phase. We conclude that while the model cannot be many-body localized, it may still exhibit long
thermalization times, owing to the necessity to create a finite density of vortices for delocalization
to occur.
