Radiation-enhanced precipitation of Cr-rich {\alpha}' in irradiated Fe-Cr alloys, which results
in hardening and embrittlement, depends on the irradiating particle and the displacement per atom
(dpa) rate. Here, we utilize a Cahn-Hilliard phase-field based approach, that includes simple
models for nucleation, irradiating particle and rate dependent radiation-enhanced diffusion
and cascade mixing to simulate {\alpha}' evolution under neutrons, heavy ions, and electron irradiations.
Different irradiating particles manifest very different cascade mixing efficiencies. The model
was calibrated using neutron data. For cascade inducing neutron/heavy-ion dpa rates at 300 {\deg}C
between 10^-^8 and 10^-^6 dpa/s the model predicts approximately constant number density, decreasing
radius, decreasing {\alpha}' Cr composition, and lower {\alpha}' volume fraction. The model then
predicts a dramatic transition to no {\alpha}' formation above approximately 10^-^5 dpa/s, while
electron irradiation, with weak mixing, had little effect at dpa rates up to 10^-^3 dpa/s. These
model predictions are consistent with experiments. We explain the results in terms of the flux dependence
of the radiation enhanced diffusion, cascade mixing, and their ratio, which all vary significantly
in relevant flux ranges for neutron and cascade inducing ion irradiations. These results show that
both cascade mixing and radiation enhanced diffusion must be accounted for when attempting to emulate
neutron-irradiation effects using accelerated ion irradiations.
