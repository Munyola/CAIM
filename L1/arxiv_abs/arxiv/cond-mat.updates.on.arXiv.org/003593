We show that flat bands can be categorized into two distinct classes, that is, singular and nonsingular
flat bands, by exploiting the singular behavior of their Bloch wave functions in momentum space.
In the case of a singular flat band, its Bloch wave function possesses immovable discontinuities
generated by the band-crossing with other bands, and thus the vector bundle associated with the
flat band cannot be defined. This singularity precludes the compact localized states from forming
a complete set spanning the flat band. Once the degeneracy at the band crossing point is lifted, the
singular flat band becomes dispersive and can acquire a finite Chern number in general, suggesting
a new route for obtaining a nearly flat Chern band. On the other hand, the Bloch wave function of a nonsingular
flat band has no singularity, and thus forms a vector bundle. A nonsingular flat band can be completely
isolated from other bands while preserving the perfect flatness. All one-dimensional flat bands
belong to the nonsingular class. We show that a singular flat band displays a novel bulk-boundary
correspondence such that the presence of the robust boundary mode is guaranteed by the singularity
of the Bloch wave function. Moreover, we develop a general scheme to construct a flat band model Hamiltonian
in which one can freely design its singular or nonsingular nature. Finally, we propose a general
formula for the compact localized state spanning the flat band, which can be easily implemented
in numerics and offer a basis set useful in analyzing correlation effects in flat bands.
