Distant spreading of primary lesions is modulated by the vascular dynamics of circulating tumor
cells (CTCs) and their ability to establish metastatic niches. While the mechanisms regulating
CTC homing in specific tissues are yet to be elucidated, it is well documented that CTCs possess different
size, biological properties and deformability. A computational model is presented to predict
the vascular transport and adhesion of CTCs in whole blood. A Lattice-Boltzmann method, which is
employed to solve the Navier-Stokes equation for the plasma flow, is coupled with an Immersed Boundary
Method. The vascular dynamics of a CTC is assessed in large and small microcapillaries. The CTC shear
modulus k ctc is varied returning CTCs that are stiffer, softer and equally deformable as compared
to RBCs. In large microcapillaries, soft CTCs behave similarly to RBCs and move away from the vessel
walls; whereas rigid CTCs are pushed laterally by the fast moving RBCs and interact with the vessel
walls. Three adhesion behaviors are observed, firm adhesion, rolling and crawling over the vessel
walls, depending on the CTC stiffness. On the contrary, in small microcapillaries, rigid CTCs are
pushed downstream by a compact train of RBCs and cannot establish any firm interaction with the vessel
walls; whereas soft CTCs are squeezed between the vessel wall and the RBC train and rapidly establish
firm adhesion. These findings document the relevance of cell deformability in CTC vascular adhesion
and provide insights on the mechanisms regulating metastasis formation in different vascular
districts.
