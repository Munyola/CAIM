We study colloidal particles with chemically inhomogeneous surfaces suspended in a critical binary
liquid mixture. The inhomogeneous particle surface is composed of patches with alternating adsorption
preferences for the two components of the binary solvent. By describing the binary liquid mixture
\emph{at} its consolute point in terms of the critical Ising model we exploit its conformal invariance
in two spatial dimension. This allows us to determine exactly the universal profiles of the order
parameter, the energy density, and the stress tensor as well as some of their correlation functions
around a single particle for various shapes and configurations of the surface patches. The formalism
encompasses several interesting configurations, including Janus particles of circular and needle
shapes with dipolar symmetry and a circular particle with quadrupolar symmetry. From these single-particle
properties we construct the so-called small particle operator expansion (SPOE), which enables
us to obtain asymptotically exact expressions for the position- and orientation-dependent critical
Casimir interactions of the particles with distant objects, such as another particle or the confining
walls of a half plane, strip, or wedge, with various boundary conditions for the order parameter.
In several cases we compare the interactions at large distances with the ones at close distance (but
still large on the molecular scale). We also compare our analytical results for two Janus particles
with recent simulation data.
