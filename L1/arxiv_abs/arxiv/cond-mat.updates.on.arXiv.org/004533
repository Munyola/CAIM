We study numerically mixing-demixing and spontaneous symmetry breaking in Bose-Fermi mixtures
in spherically-symmetric and quasi-one-dimensional traps while the intra-species Bose and Fermi
interactions are varied from weak-coupling to strong-coupling limits. The usual treatment of
a Bose-Fermi mixture relies on weak-coupling Gross-Pitaevskii (GP) and density-functional (DF)
Lagrangians, often including the more realistic perturbative Lee-Huang-Yang (LHY) corrections.
We suggest analytic non-perturbative beyond-mean-field Bose and Fermi Lagrangians valid along
the crossover from weak- to strong-coupling limits of intra-species interactions consistent
with the LHY corrections and the strong-coupling (unitarity) limit for small and large scattering
lengths $|a|$, respectively, and use these to study the Bose-Fermi mixture. The LHY correction
is appropriate for medium to weak atomic interactions and diverges for stronger interactions (large
scattering length $|a|$), whereas the present beyond-mean-field Lagrangian is finite in the unitarity
limit ($|a|\to \infty$). We illustrate our results using the Bose-Fermi $^7$Li-$^6$Li mixture
under a spherically-symmetric and a quasi-one-dimensional trap. The results obtained with the
present model for density distribution of the Bose-Fermi mixture along the crossover could be qualitatively
different from the usual GP-DF Lagrangian with or without LHY corrections. Specifically, we identified
spontaneous symmetry breaking and demixing in the present model not found in the usual model with
the same values of the parameters.
