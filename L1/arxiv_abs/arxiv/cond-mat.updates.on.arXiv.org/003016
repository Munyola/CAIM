Information processing devices operating in the quantum mechanical regime strongly rely on the
quantum coherence of charge carriers. Studies of electronic dephasing in conventional metallic
and semiconductor systems have not only paved the way towards high coherence quantum electronics,
but also led to fundamental new insights in condensed matter physics. In this work, we perform a spatially
resolved study of electronic dephasing in three dimensional topological insulators by exploiting
an edge versus surface contacted measurement scheme. Unlike conventional two dimensional systems
that are characterized by a single dephasing mechanism, we find that dephasing in our samples evolves
from a variable-range-hopping type mechanism on the sample surface to a Nyquist type electron-electron
interaction mechanism in the sub-surface layers. This is confirmed independently by the temperature
and chemical potential dependence of the dephasing length, and gate dependent suppression/enhancement
of the weak anti-localization effect. Our devices are fabricated using bulk insulating topological
insulator BiSbTe$_{1.25}$Se$_{1.75}$ capped with hexagonal-Boron Nitride in an inert environment,
ruling out any extrinsic effects and confirming the topological surface state origin of our results.
Our work introduces the idea of spatially resolved electronic dephasing and reveals a new regime
of coherent transport in perhaps the most important topological insulator discovered so far. Our
edge-vs-surface scheme may be applied to dephasing studies in a wide class of 2D materials.
