The investigation of thermal properties of recently emerged two-dimensional (2D) materials is
a necessary step towards fulfilling their potential applications in nano-electronics devices.
In this study, the thermal conductivity of novel \b{eta}-NX (X=P, As, Sb) monolayers are investigated
using a first-principles density functional theory (DFT) study based on the full solution of the
linearized Peierls-Boltzmann transport equation (PBTE). The results show that the room temperature
thermal conductivities of \b{eta}-NP, \b{eta}-NAs, and \b{eta}-NSb are about 1.1, 5.5, and 34.0
times higher than those of single-element \b{eta}-P, \b{eta}-As, and \b{eta}-Sb monolayers,
respectively. The phonon transport analysis reveals that higher phonon group velocities as well
as phonon lifetimes are responsible for such an enhancement in the lattice thermal conductivities
of \b{eta}-NX (X=P, As, Sb) binary compounds compared to single-element group-VA monolayers.
We found that \b{eta}-NP has the minimum thermal conductivity among \b{eta}-NX (X=P, As, Sb) monolayers,
while it has the minimum average atomic mass, which is in contrast with the common assumption that
lower mass systems exhibit higher thermal conductivities. This work demonstrates the trade-off
between harmonic and anharmonic phonon properties in determining the variation of the thermal
conductivity among \b{eta}-NX (X=P, As, Sb) monolayers. The higher anharmonicity in \b{eta}-NP
is found to be responsible for the lower thermal conductivity of this monolayer.
