Electronic phase separation is crucial for the fascinating macroscopic properties of the LaAlO3/SrTiO3
(LAO/STO) paradigm oxide interface, including the coexistence of superconductivity and ferromagnetism.
We investigate this phenomenon using angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy (ARPES) in the
soft-X-ray energy range, where the enhanced probing depth combined with resonant photoexcitation
allow access to fundamental electronic structure characteristics (momentum-resolved spectral
function, dispersions and ordering of energy bands, Fermi surface) of buried interfaces. Our experiment
uses X-ray irradiation of the LAO/STO interface to tune its oxygen deficiency, building up a dichotomic
system where mobile weakly correlated Ti t2g-electrons co-exist with localized strongly correlated
Ti eg-ones. The ARPES spectra dynamics under X-ray irradiation shows a gradual intensity increase
under constant Luttinger count of the Fermi surface. This fact identifies electronic phase separation
(EPS) where the mobile electrons accumulate in conducting puddles with fixed electronic structure
embedded in an insulating host phase, and allows us to estimate the lateral fraction of these puddles.
We discuss the physics of EPS invoking a theoretical picture of oxygen-vacancy clustering, promoted
by the magnetism of the localized Ti eg-electrons, and repelling of the mobile t2g-electrons from
these clusters. Our results on the irradiation-tuned EPS elucidate the intrinsic one taking place
at the stoichiometric LAO/STO interfaces.
