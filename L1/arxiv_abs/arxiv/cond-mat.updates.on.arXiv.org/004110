Here, we report the catalytic degradation of organic compounds by exploiting the magnetoelectric
(ME) nature of cobalt ferrite-bismuth ferrite (CFO-BFO) core-shell nanoparticles. The combination
of magnetostrictive CFO with the multiferroic BFO gives rise to a magnetoelectric engine that purifies
water under wireless magnetic fields via advanced oxidation processes, without involvement of
any sacrificial molecules or co-catalysts. Magnetostrictive CoFe2O4 nanoparticles are fabricated
using hydrothermal synthesis, followed by sol-gel synthesis to create the multiferroic BiFeO3
shell. We perform theoretical modeling to study the magnetic field induced polarization on the
surface of magnetoelectric nanoparticles. The results obtained from these simulations are consistent
with the experimental findings of the piezo-force microscopy analysis, where we observe changes
in the piezoresponse of the nanoparticles under magnetic fields. Next, we investigate the magnetoelectric
effect induced catalytic degradation of organic pollutants under AC magnetic fields and obtained
97% removal efficiency for synthetic dyes and over 85% removal efficiency for routinely used pharmaceuticals.
Additionally, we perform trapping experiments to elucidate the mechanism behind the magnetic
field induced catalytic degradation of organic pollutants by using scavengers for each of the reactive
species. Our results indicate that hydroxyl and superoxide radicals are the main reactive species
in the magnetoelectrically induced catalytic degradation of organic compounds.
