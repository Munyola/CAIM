A basic paradigm underlying the Hookean mechanics of amorphous, isotropic solids is that small
deformations are proportional to the magnitude of external forces. However, slender bodies may
undergo large deformations even under minute forces, leading to nonlinear responses rooted in
purely geometric effects. Here we identify stiffening and softening as two prominent motifs of
such a material-independent, geometrically-nonlinear response of thin sheets, and we show how
both effects emanate from the nontrivial yet generic features of the stress and displacement fields.
Our insights are borne out of studying the indentation of a polymer film on a liquid bath, using experiments,
simulations, and theory. Starting at small displacement, the first nonlinearity occurs when radial
retraction of the film begins to reduce azimuthal stresses --- this underlies a wrinkling instability
and causes the effective spring constant of the system to stiffen as radial forces are transmitted
more effectively through the sheet. The response then softens when the sheet reaches large slopes,
indicating a second nonlinearity that is accompanied by localization of the vertical profile.
We thus find that stiffening is due to growing anisotropy of the stress field whereas softening is
due to changes in the overall shape. These general mechanisms should apply to any sufficiently thin
sheet, and we discuss similarities with the mechanics of fiber networks, suggesting that our results
are relevant to a wide range of two- and three-dimensional materials.
