An approximate analytical solution to the fluctuation potential problem in the modified Poisson-Boltzmann
theory of electrolyte solutions in the restricted primitive model is presented. The solution is
valid for all inter-ionic distances, including contact values. The fluctuation potential solution
is implemented in the theory to describe the structure of the electrolyte in terms of the radial distribution
functions, and to calculate some aspects of thermodynamics, viz., configurational reduced energies,
and osmotic coefficients. The calculations have been made for symmetric valence 1:1 systems at
the physical parameters of ionic diameter $4.25 \times 10^{-10}$ m, relative permittivity 78.5,
absolute temperature 298 K, and molar concentrations 0.1038, 0.425, 1.00, and 1.968. Radial distribution
functions are compared with the corresponding results from the symmetric Poisson-Boltzmann,
and the conventional and modified Poisson-Boltzmann theories. Comparisons have also been done
for the contact values of the radial distributions, reduced configurational energies, and osmotic
coefficients as functions of electrolyte concentration. Some Monte Carlo simulation data from
the literature are also included in the assessment of the thermodynamic predictions. Results show
a very good agreement with the Monte Carlo results and some improvement for osmotic coefficients
and radial distribution functions contact values relative to these theories. The reduced energy
curve shows excellent agreement with Monte Carlo data for molarities up to 1 mol/dm$^{3}$.
