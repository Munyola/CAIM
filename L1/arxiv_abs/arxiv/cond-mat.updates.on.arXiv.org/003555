Shape memory alloys (SMAs) have been intensively investigated as actuators for the past several
decades. Due to their high actuation energy density compared to other active materials, their current
and potential applications in engineering fields are expanding rapidly. Prior to being used as
actuators, SMAs are usually subjected to a training process to stabilize their behavior. During
the training process, permanent changes are introduced in the microstructure of the material which
results in the generation of internal stresses and a large amount of irrecoverable Transformation
Induced Plastic strain (TRIP). The generated internal stresses along with a potential thermal
loading provide the driving force to induce the oriented phase transformation so that the SMA-based
actuators are able to exhibit the Two-Way Shape Memory Effect (TWSME) without applying external
bias load. To predict this intrinsic phenomenon, a three-dimensional phenomenological constitutive
model for untrained SMAs is presented. The proposed model utilizes the martensitic volume fraction,
transformation strain, TRIP strain, and internal stress as internal state variables so that it
is able to account for the evolution of TRIP strain and the TWSME for untrained SMAs under cyclic thermomechanical
loading conditions. In the end, boundary value problems considering an untrained SMA material
under isothermal/isobaric cyclic loading are solved and the predicted cyclic response is compared
against available experimental data to demonstrate the proposed capabilities.
