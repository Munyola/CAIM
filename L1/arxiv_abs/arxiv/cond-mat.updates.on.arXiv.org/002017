2D hybrid organic-inorganic semiconductors (HOIS) are low-cost, self-assembled semiconductors
that have proven to be vital for novel optoelectronic devices due to their inherent stable excitons
even at room temperature. 2D HOIS are chemically stable with respect to the 3D analogues, but their
inherent anisotropy complicates their implementation in devices, including electroluminescence
(EL) devices. We report on the synthesis, characterization, cathodoluminescence and EL of a new
2D HOIS, (4-fluoro phenethylamine-H)2PbBr4, and its defect variations (DVs). The latter, in contrast
to the pristine material, allow for the first time the simple fabrication of a prototype blue EL device
by coating DVs on a conducting anode substrate and using a Ga/In droplet cathode. DVs' optimization
can lead to improved light emitting devices (LEDs) and the work here is expected to provide the incentive
for utilizing HOIS DVs, as these are compatible with industrial scale synthesis. In contrast to
the pristine iodine analogue, whose thin films readily provide EL, only the DVs or mixtures with
MoS2 nano-sized platelets provide EL, after careful deposition. These exhibit defects that disrupt
the planar non-conductive nature of the micrometric 2D HOIS platelets, usually aligned parallel
to the substrate, thus, providing mechanisms for current flow. Finally, the choice of the fluorine-modified
amine enhances the functionality of the DVs as LED materials compared to using unmodified amine
due to the repulsion among the amine tails, leading to stable decorated 2D inorganic sheets that
are weakly bound.
