Exchange coupling between a magnetic impurity and a superconducting substrate results in the formation
of Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) bound states, which have been recently used in artificial designer structures
to realize exotic quasiparticles known as Majorana fermions. At strong coupling, the energies
of YSR states are deep in the superconducting gap, and the impurity can even undergo a transition
from high-spin to low-spin magnetic state by trapping one or several Bogoliubov quasiparticles
from the bulk. At weak coupling, the YSR states migrate towards the superconducting gap edge. Additional
spectral features can appear in the presence of magnetic anisotropy with spin $S\geqslant 1$, in
particular spin-flip excitations outside the superconducting gap. Despite extensive experiments
on magnetic impurities that exhibit separately either spin-flip excitations or YSR states, these
phenomena have not been observed simultaneously. Here, we investigate the spectral evolution
in different metal phthalocyanine molecules on NbSe$_2$ surface as a function of the coupling with
the substrate. Using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), we tune the exchange coupling strength
and for manganese phthalocyanine (MnPc) we demonstrate a smooth spectral crossover from the YSR
states to intrinsic quantum spin states. These results provide crucial insight into the fundamental
behaviour of magnetic/superconducting hybrid systems and could have significant ramifications
for the design and control of atomic scale magnetic devices.
