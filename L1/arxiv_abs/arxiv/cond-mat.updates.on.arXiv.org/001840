Magnetic insulators (MIs) attract tremendous interest for spintronic applications due to low
Gilbert damping and absence of Ohmic loss. Magnetic order of MIs can be manipulated and even switched
by spin-orbit torques (SOTs) generated through spin Hall effect and Rashba-Edelstein effect in
heavy metal/MI bilayers. SOTs on MIs are more intriguing than magnetic metals since SOTs cannot
be transferred to MIs through direct injection of electron spins. Understanding of SOTs on MIs remains
elusive, especially how SOTs scale with the film thickness. Here, we observe the critical role of
dimensionality on the SOT efficiency by systematically studying the MI layer thickness dependent
SOT efficiency in tungsten/thulium iron garnet (W/TmIG) bilayers. We first show that the TmIG thin
film evolves from two-dimensional to three-dimensional magnetic phase transitions as the thickness
increases, due to the suppression of long-wavelength thermal fluctuation. Then, we report the
significant enhancement of the measured SOT efficiency as the thickness increases. We attribute
this effect to the increase of the magnetic moment density in concert with the suppression of thermal
fluctuations. At last, we demonstrate the current-induced SOT switching in the W/TmIG bilayers
with a TmIG thickness up to 15 nm. The switching current density is comparable with those of heavy
metal/ferromagnetic metal cases. Our findings shed light on the understanding of SOTs in MIs, which
is important for the future development of ultrathin MI-based low-power spintronics.
