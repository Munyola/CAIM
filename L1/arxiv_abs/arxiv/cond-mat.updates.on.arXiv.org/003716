Quasiparticles and collective modes are two fundamental aspects that characterize a quantum matter
in addition to its ground state features. For example, the low energy physics for Fermi liquid phase
in He-III was featured not only by Fermionic quasiparticles near the chemical potential but also
by fruitful collective modes in the long-wave limit, including several different sound waves that
can propagate through it under different circumstances. On the other hand, it is very difficult
for sound waves to be carried by the electron liquid in the ordinary metals, due to the fact that long-range
Coulomb interaction among electrons will generate plasmon gap for ordinary electron density fluctuation
and thus prohibits the propagation of sound waves through it. In the present paper, we propose a unique
type of acoustic collective modes in Weyl semimetals under the magnetic field called chiral zero
sound. The chiral zero sound can be stabilized under so-called "chiral limit", where the intra-valley
scattering time is much shorter than the inter-valley one, and only propagates along an external
magnetic field for Weyl semimetals with multiple-pairs of Weyl points. The sound velocity of the
chiral zero sound is proportional to the field strength in the weak field limit, whereas it oscillates
dramatically in the strong field limit, generating an entirely new mechanism for quantum oscillations
through the dynamics of neutral bosonic excitation, which may manifest itself in the thermal conductivity
measurements under magnetic field.
