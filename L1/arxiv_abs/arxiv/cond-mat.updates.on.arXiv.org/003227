We develop theory models for both ballistic and disordered superconducting black phosphorus devices
in the presence of magnetic exchange field and stress. The ballistic case is studied through a microscopic
Bogoliubov-de Gennes formalism while for the disordered case we formulate a quasiclassical model.
Utilizing the two models, we theoretically study the response of supercurrent to an externally
applied magnetic field in two-dimensional black phosphorus Josephson junctions. Our results
demonstrate that the response of the supercurrent to a perpendicular magnetic field in ballistic
samples can deviate from the standard Fraunhofer interference pattern when the Fermi level and
mechanical stress are varied. This finding suggests the combination of chemical potential and
strain as an efficient external knob to control the current response in high-sensitive strain-effect
transistors and SQUIDs. We also study the supercurrent in a superconductor-ferromagnet-ferromagnet-superconductor
junction where the magnetizations of the two adjacent magnetized regions are uniform with misaligned
orientations. We show that the magnetization misalignment can control the excitation of higher
harmonics than the first harmonic $\sin \varphi$ (in which $\varphi$ is the phase difference between
the superconductors) in supercurrent and constitutes a full spin switching current element. Finally,
we discuss possible experimental implementations of our findings. We foresee our models and discussions
can provide guidelines to experimentalists in designing devices and future investigations.
