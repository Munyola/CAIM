Optimization of power loss in soft magnetic components basis on the choice of the best technological
parameters values. Therefore, the power losses have been measured in Somaloy 500 samples for a wide
range of frequency and magnetic induction. These samples have been prepared under a wide range of
the hardening temperatures and pressures. The power loss characteristics have been derived by
assuming that investigated samples obeyed the scaling law. Agreement obtained between experimental
data and the scaling theory has confirmed this assumption. Moreover, the experimental data of the
given sample have been collapsed to a single curve which represented measurements for all values
of frequency an magnetic induction pick. Therefore, the scaling transforms the losses characteristics
from the two dimensional surfaces to the one dimensional curves. The samples were produced according
two methods: for different pressures with constant temperature and at different temperatures
with constant pressure. In both cases the power losses decrease with increasing pressure and with
increasing temperature. These trends in decreasing losses stopped for certain critical values
of pressure and temperature, respectively. Above these values the power losses increase suddenly.
Therefore, the mentioned above the critical pressure and the critical temperature are sought after
solutions for optimal values. In order to reduce the parameters values set the limit curve in the
pressure-temperature plane has been derive. This curve constitutes a separation curve between
the parameters values corresponding to high and low losses.
