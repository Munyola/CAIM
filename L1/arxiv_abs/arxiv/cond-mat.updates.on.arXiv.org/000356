Starting with a formally exact diagrammatic kinetic theory for the equilibrium correlation functions
of particle density and current fluctuations for a monatomic liquid, we develop a theory for high
density liquids whose interatomic potential has a strongly repulsive short ranged part. We assume
that interparticle collisions via this short ranged part of the potential are sufficient to randomize
the velocities of the particles on a very small time scale compared with the fundamental time scale
defined as the particle diameter divided by the mean thermal velocity. When this is the case, the
graphical theory suggests that both the particle current correlation functions and the memory
function of the particle density correlation function evolve on two distinct time scales, the very
short time scale just mentioned and another that is much longer than the fundamental time scale.
The diagrams that describe the motion on each of these time scales are identified. When the two time
scales are very different, a dramatic simplification of the diagrammatic theory at long times takes
place. We identify an irreducible memory function and a more basic function, which we call the irreducible
memory kernel. This latter function evolves on the longer time scale only and determines the time
dependence of the density and current correlation functions of interest at long times. In the following
paper, a simple one-loop approximation for the irreducible memory kernel is used to calculate correlation
functions for a Lennard-Jones fluid at high density and a variety of temperatures.
