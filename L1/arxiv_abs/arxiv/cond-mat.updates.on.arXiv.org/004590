Hexagonal boron nitride is a promising material for many applications ranging from deep UV emission
to an ideal substrate for other two dimensional crystals. Although efforts towards the growth of
wafer-scale, high quality material strongly increased in recent years, the understanding of the
actual growth mechanism still remains fragmentary and premature. Here, we unveil fundamental
growth mechanisms by investigating the growth of hBN by metalorganic vapor phase epitaxy (MOVPE)
in a wide range of growth conditions. The obtained results contradict the widespread opinion about
the importance of parasitic gas-phase reactions decreasing the growth efficiency. Two different
growth mechanisms that depend on ammonia flow and reactor pressure can be distinguished. Both mechanisms
are effective in the case of polycrystalline growth, but the growth of highly ordered, flat layers,
is strongly hindered. The problem is caused by a low efficiency of boron chemisorption on N-terminated
edges of sp2-BN sheets forming the atomic steps on the surface of the layer. Two-dimensional growth
can be activated and sustained by the flow modulation epitaxy (FME) method, an alternate switching
of ammonia and TEB flows. The success of the FME method is explained in terms of periodic changes between
N- and B-terminated reconstructions at the edges of sp2- BN sheets, which restore boron chemisorption.
The presented results identify the fundamental growth mechanisms, which is the prerequisite for
any further deterministic development of efficient, high-quality, large-scale hBN growth with
MOVPE.
