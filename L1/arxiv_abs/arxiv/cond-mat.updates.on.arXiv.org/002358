The solidification theory has been accepted as a thermodynamically sound way to describe the creep
reduction due to deposition of hydrated material in the pores of concrete. The concept of self-equilibrated
nanoscale microprestress has been accepted as a viable model for marked multi-decade decline of
creep viscosity after the hydration effect became too feeble, and for increase of creep viscosity
after any sudden change of pore humidity or temperature. Recently, though, it appeared that the
original microprestress-solidification theory (MPS) predicts incorrectly the diffusion size
effect on drying creep and the delay of drying creep behind drying shrinkage. Presented here is an
extension (XMPS) that overcomes both problems and also improves a few other features of the model
response. To this end, different nano- and macro-scale viscosities are distinguished. The aforementioned
incorrect predictions are overcome by a dependence of the macro-scale viscosity on the rate of pore
humidity change, which is a new feature inspired by previous molecular dynamics (MD) simulations
of a molecular layer of water moving between two parallel sliding C-S-H sheets. The aging is based
on calculating the hydration degree, and the temperature change effect on pore relative humidity
is taken into account. Empirical formula for estimating the parameters of permeability dependence
on pore humidity from concrete mix composition are also developed. Extensive validations by pertinent
test data from the literature are demonstrated.
