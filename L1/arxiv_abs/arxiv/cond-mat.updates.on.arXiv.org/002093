An approach to non-adiabatic dynamics of atoms in molecular and condensed matter systems under
general non-equilibrium conditions is proposed. In this method interaction between nuclei and
electrons is considered explicitly up to the second order in atomic displacements defined with
respect to the mean atomic trajectory. This method enables one to consider movement of atoms beyond
their simple vibrations. Both electrons and nuclei are treated fully quantum-mechanically using
a combination of path integrals applied to nuclei and non-equilibrium Green's functions (NEGF)
to elections. Our method is partition-less: initially, the entire system is coupled and assumed
to be at thermal equilibrium. Then, the exact application of the Hubbard-Stratanovich transformation
in mixed real and imaginary times enables us to obtain, without doing any additional approximations,
an exact expression for the reduced density matrix for nuclei and hence an effective quantum Liouville
equation for them, both containing Gaussian noises. It is shown that the time evolution of the expectation
values for atomic positions is described by an infinite hierarchy of stochastic differential equations
for atomic positions and momenta and their various fluctuations. The actual dynamics is obtained
by sampling all stochastic trajectories. It is expected that applications of the method may include
photo-induced chemical reactions (e.g. dissociation), electromigration, atomic manipulation
in scanning tunneling microscopy, to name just a few.
