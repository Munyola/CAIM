The generation and control of quantum states of spatially-separated qubits distributed in different
cavities constitute fundamental tasks in cavity quantum electrodynamics. An interesting question
in this context is how to prepare entanglement and realize quantum information transfer between
qubits located at different cavities, which are important in large-scale quantum information
processing. In this paper, we consider a physical system consisting of two cavities and three qubits.
Two of the qubits are placed in two different cavities while the remaining one acts as a coupler, which
is used to connect the two cavities. We propose an approach for generating quantum entanglement
and implementing quantum information transfer between the two spatially-separated intercavity
qubits. The quantum operations involved in this proposal are performed by a virtual photon process,
and thus the cavity decay is greatly suppressed during the operations. In addition, to complete
the present tasks, only one coupler qubit and one operation step are needed. Moreover, there is no
need of applying classical pulses, so that the engineering complexity is much reduced and the operation
procedure is greatly simplified. Finally, our numerical results illustrate that high-fidelity
implementation of this proposal using superconducting phase qubits and one-dimenstion transmision
line resonators is feasible for current circuit QED implementations. This proposal can also be
applied to other types of superconducting qubits, including flux and charge qubits.
