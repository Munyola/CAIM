The impact of local and non-local density-density interactions on the electronic instabilities
in the honeycomb lattice is widely investigated. Some of early studies proposed the emergence of
interaction-induced topologically non-trivial phases, but recently it is denied in several works
including renormalization group calculations with refined momentum resolution. We use the truncated
unity functional renormalization group to study the many-body instabilities of electrons on the
half-filled honeycomb lattice focusing on effect of the exchange interaction. We show that varying
the next-nearest-neighbor repulsion and nearest-neighbor exchange integral can lead to diverse
ordered phases, namely, the quantum spin Hall, the spin-Kekul\'{e} and some spin- and charge-density-wave
phases. The quantum spin Hall phase can be induced by a combination of the ferromagnetic exchange
and pair hopping interactions. Another exotic phase, the spin-Kekul\'{e} phase develops in a very
small region of the parameter space considered. We encounter three-sublattice charge-density-wave
phase in a large part of the parameter space. It is replaced by the incommensurate charge density
wave when increasing the exchange integral. In order to reduce the computational effort, we derive
the explicit symmetry relations for the bosonic propagators of the effective interaction and propose
a linear-response based approach for identifying the form factor of order parameter. Their efficiencies
are confirmed by numerical calculations in our work.
