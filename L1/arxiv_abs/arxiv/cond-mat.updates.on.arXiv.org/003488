In this work, a numerical study of the superconducting specific heat of the unconventional multiband
superconductor Strontium Ruthenate is performed. Two band gaps models are employed, and the results
rendered for each of them are compared. One of the models, previously proposed by one of the authors
to explain the experimental temperature behavior of the ultrasound attenuation, considers two
gaps with point nodes of different magnitude on different gap surface sheets, while the other one
is an isotropic and line node model, reported in the literature for describing quantitatively experimental
specific heat data. The superconducting density of states DOS is computed by employing these two
models and then, a detailed numerical study of the electronic specific heat, that includes the contribution
from the different Fermi sheets, is carried out. It is found that the calculated point node model
specific heat temperature behavior shows an excellent agreement with the existent Sr$_2$RuO$_4$
experimental data at zero field, particularly, it is obtained that the observed specific heat jump
at T$_c$ is precisely reproduced. Also, it is found that the sum of the contributions from the different
bands fits quantitatively the measured specific heat data. The results in this work evidence that
the Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ superconducting states are of unconventional nature, corresponding to those
of a point node superconductor, and show the importance of taking into account the multiband nature
of the material when calculating thermodynamic superconducting quantities.
