The magnetization of thin films of cobalt ferrite frequently falls far below the bulk value of 455
kAm-1, which corresponds to an inverse cation distribution in the spinel structure with a significant
orbital moment of about 0.6 muB that is associated with the octahedrally-coordinated Co2+ ions.
The orbital moment is responsible for the magnetostriction and magnetocrystalline anisotropy,
and its sensitivity to imposed strain. We have systematically investigated the structure and magnetism
of films produced by pulsed-laser deposition on different substrates (TiO2, MgO, MgAl2O4, SrTiO3,
LSAT, LaAlO3) and as a function of temperature (500-700 C) and oxygen pressure (10-4 - 10 Pa). Magnetization
at room-temperature ranges from 60 to 440 kAm-1, and uniaxial substrate-induced anisotropy ranges
from +220 kJm-3 for films on deposited on MgO (100) to -2100 kJm-3 for films deposited on MgAl2O4 (100),
where the room-temperature anisotropy field reaches 14 T. No rearrangement of high-spin Fe3+ and
Co2+ cations on tetrahedral and octahedral sites can reduce the magnetization below the bulk value,
but a switch from Fe3+ and Co2+ to Fe2+ and low-spin Co3+ on octahedral sites will reduce the low-temperature
magnetization to 120 kAm-1, and a consequent reduction of Curie temperature can bring the room-temperature
value to near zero. Possible reasons for the appearance of low-spin cobalt in the thin films are discussed.
