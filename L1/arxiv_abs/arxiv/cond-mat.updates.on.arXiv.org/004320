A major obstacle in understanding the mechanism of Cooper pairing in the cuprates is the existence
of various intertwined orders associated with spin, charge, and Cooper pairs. Of particular importance
is the ubiquitous charge order features that have been observed in a variety of cuprates, especially
in the underdoped regime of the phase diagram. To explain the origin of the charge order and its implication
to the superconducting phase, many theoretical models have been proposed, such as charge stripes,
electronic nematicity, and Fermi surface instability. A highly appealing physical picture is
the so-called pair density wave (PDW), a periodic modulation of Cooper paring in space, which may
also induce a charge order. To elucidate the existence and nature of the PDW order, here we use scanning
tunneling microscopy (STM) to investigate a severely underdoped Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+{\delta}, in
which superconductivity just emerges on top of a pronounced checkerboard charge order. By analyzing
the spatial distribution of the spectral features characteristic of superconductivity, we observe
a periodic modulation of both the superconducting coherence peak and gap depth, demonstrating
the existence of a density wave order of Cooper pairing. The PDW order has the same spatial periodicity
as the charge order, and the amplitudes of the two orders exhibit clear positive correlation. These
results shed important new lights on the origin of and interplay between the charge order and Cooper
pairing modulation in the cuprates.
