In a very recent experiment, an exotic Mott insulating phase has been observed in the ABC-stacked
trilayer graphene-boron nitride Moire superlattice at half-filling. Based on symmetry analysis
and effective band structure calculation, we propose a valley-contrasting chiral tight-binding
model with a local inter-valley Coulomb interaction. By matching the positions of van Hove points
in the low-energy effective band structure, the valley-contrasting flux is determined to be around
$~\pi /2$ per a triangle, which is crucial for the valley correlated physics. From the weak coupling
approach, such a flux induces a perfect nesting between the 1/2 filled Fermi-surfaces, leading
to the inter-valley-spiral order. Moreover, in the strong coupling limit, a Mott gap divides the
valence band into two sub-bands. When the lower sub-bands is fully filled, the flux serves the minimization
of the valley exchange energy. Hence, the ground state at 1/2 filling is characterized by a valley
pseudo-spin 120$^{\circ }$ ordered Mott insulator, which is adiabatically connected to the inter-valley
spiral order state. Furthermore, upon lightly hole doping, the $U(1)_{v}$-symmetric valley exchange
interaction leads to inter-valley topological superconductivity with a mixed order parameter
of valley singlet and triplet pairs. But the pairing symmetry could be either $p\pm ip$ or $d\mp id$,
depending on the detailed structure of the Fermi surfaces. In addition, our minimal model with a
varying flux can also be extended to describe the more general multilayer-graphene Moire superlattices
with a perpendicular electric field.
