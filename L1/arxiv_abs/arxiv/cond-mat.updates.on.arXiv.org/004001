The empirical observation of aggregation of dielectric particles under the influence of electrostatic
forces lies at the origin of the theory of electricity. The growth of clusters formed of small grains
underpins a range of phenomena from the early stages of planetesimal formation to aerosols. However,
the collective effects of Coulomb forces on the nonequilibrium dynamics and aggregation process
in a granular gas -- a model representative of the above physical processes -- have so far evaded theoretical
scrutiny. Here, we establish a hydrodynamic description of aggregating granular gases that exchange
charges upon collisions and interact via the long-ranged Coulomb forces. We analytically derive
the governing equations for the evolution of granular temperature, charge variance, and number
density for homogeneous and quasi-monodisperse aggregation. We find that, once the aggregates
are formed, the system obeys a physical constraint of nearly constant dimensionless ratio of characteristic
electrostatic to kinetic energy $\mathcal{B}(t)\le 1$. This constraint on the collective evolution
of charged clusters is confirmed both by the theory and the detailed molecular dynamics simulations.
The inhomogeneous aggregation of monomers and clusters in their mutual electrostatic field proceeds
in a fractal manner. Our theoretical framework is extendable to more precise charge exchange mechanism,
a current focus of extensive experimentation. Furthermore, it illustrates the collective role
of long-ranged interactions in dissipative gases and can lead to novel designing principles in
particulate systems.
