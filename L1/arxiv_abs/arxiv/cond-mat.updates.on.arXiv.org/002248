V2O3 famously features all four combinations of paramagnetic versus antiferromagnetic, and metallic
versus insulating states of matter in response to %-level doping, pressure in the GPa range, and
temperature below 300 K. Using time-of-flight neutron spectroscopy, we have mapped the inelastic
magnetic neutron scattering cross section over a wide range of energy and momentum transfer in the
chromium stabilized antiferromagnetic and paramagnetic insulating phases (AFI & PI). By fitting
the measured excitation spectrum in the AFI phase, we establish a phenomenological exchange Hamiltonian
and then show density functional theory (DFT) computations can account for the exchange constants
to within the experimental accuracy. We then use DFT and neutron scattering to show the PI phase is
a quasi-two-dimensional honeycomb antiferromagnet with competing near and next nearest neighbor
exchange interactions $(J_2/J_1=0.2)$ that place it near a putative spin liquid phase. Treated
with a Gaussian approximation, the DFT spin Hamiltonian accounts in detail for the short-range
dynamic spin correlations of the PI phase. The magnetic frustration and degeneracy of the PI phase
is relieved by the rhombohedral to monoclinic transition at $T_N=185$ K due to a significant magneto-elastic
coupling. This leads to the recognition that magnetic frustration is an inherent property of the
paramagnetic phase in $\rm (V_{1-x}Cr_x)_2O_3$ and plays an important role in suppressing the
magnetic long range ordering temperature and exposing a large phase space for the Mott metal-insulator
transition.
