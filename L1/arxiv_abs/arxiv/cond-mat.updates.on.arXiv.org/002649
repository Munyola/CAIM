Nanoparticles are often covered in ligand monolayers, which can undergo a temperature-dependent
order-disorder transition that switches the particle-particle interaction from repulsive to
attractive in solution. In this work, we examine how changes in the ligand surface coverage and facet
dimensions affect the ordering of ligands, the arrangement of nearby solvent molecules, and the
interaction between ligand monolayers on different particles. In particular, we consider the
case of strongly bound octadecyl ligands on the (100) facet of CdS in the presence of an explicit n-hexane
solvent. Depending on the facet dimensions and surface coverage, we observe three distinct ordered
states that differ in how the ligands are packed together, and which affect the thickness of the ligand
shell and the structure of the ligand-solvent interface. The temperature dependence of the order-disorder
transition also broadens and shifts to lower temperature in a nonlinear manner as the nanoscale
is approached from above. We find that ligands on nanoscale facets can behave very similarly to those
on macroscopic surfaces in solution, and that some facet dimensions affect the ligand alignment
more strongly than others. As the ligands order, the interaction between opposing monolayers becomes
attractive, even well below full surface coverage. The strength of attraction per unit surface
area is strongly affected by ligand coverage, but only weakly by facet width. Conversely, we find
that bringing two monolayers together just above the order-disorder transition temperature can
induce ordering and attraction.
