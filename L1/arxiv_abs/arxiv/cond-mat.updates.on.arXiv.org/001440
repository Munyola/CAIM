The emergence of complex and fascinating states of quantum matter in the neighborhood of zero temperature
phase transitions suggests that such quantum phenomena should be studied in a variety of settings.
Advanced technologies of the future may be fabricated from materials where the cooperative behavior
of charge, spin and current can be manipulated at cryogenic temperatures. The propagating lattice
dynamics of displacive ferroelectrics make them appealing for the study of quantum critical phenomena
that is characterized by both space- and time-dependent quantities. In this Key Issues article
we aim to provide a self-contained overview of ferroelectrics near quantum phase transitions.
Unlike most magnetic cases, the ferroelectric quantum critical point can be tuned experimentally
to reside at, above or below its upper critical dimension; this feature allows for detailed interplay
between experiment and theory using both scaling and self-consistent field models. Empirically,
the sensitivity of the ferroelectrics $T_c$s to external to chemical pressure gives practical
access to a broad range of temperature behavior over several hundreds of Kelvin. Additional degrees
of freedom like charge and spin can be added and characterized systematically. Satellite memories,
electrocaloric cooling and low-loss phased-array radar are among possible applications of low-temperature
ferroelectrics. We end with open questions for future research that include textured polarization
states and unusual forms of superconductivity that remain to be understood theoretically.
