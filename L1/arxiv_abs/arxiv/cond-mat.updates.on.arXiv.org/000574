We study the transverse spin-Seebeck effect (SSE) on the surface of a three-dimensional topological
insulator (TI) thin film, such as Bi$_2$Se$_3$, which is sandwiched between two normal metal leads.
The temperature bias $\Delta T$ applied between the leads generates surface charge current which
becomes spin-polarized due to strong spin-orbit coupling on the TI surface, with polarization
vector acquiring a component $P_x \simeq 60%$ {\em parallel to the direction of transport}. When
the third nonmagnetic voltage probe is attached to the portion of the TI surface across its width
$L_y$, pure spin current will be injected into the probe where the inverse spin Hall effect (ISHE)
converts it into a voltage signal \mbox{$|V_\mathrm{ISHE}|^\mathrm{max}/\Delta T \simeq 2.5$
$\mu$V/K} (assuming the SH angle of Pt voltage probe and $L_y=1$ mm). The existence of predicted
nonequilibrium spin-polarization parallel to the direction of electronic transport and the corresponding
electron-driven SSE crucially relies on orienting quintuple layers (QLs) of Bi$_2$Se$_3$ {\em
orthogonal} to the TI surface and {\em tilted} by $45^\circ$ with respect to the direction of transport.
Our analysis is based on the Landauer-B\"{u}ttiker-type formula for spin currents in the leads
of a multi-terminal quantum-coherent junction, which is constructed using nonequilibrium Green
function formalism within which we show how to take into account arbitrary orientation of QLs via
the self-energy describing coupling between semi-infinite normal metal leads and TI.
