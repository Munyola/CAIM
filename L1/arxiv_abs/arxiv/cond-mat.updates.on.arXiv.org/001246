We report an experimental and numerical study of femtosecond multi-pulse laser-induced densification
in vitreous silica (v-SiO2) and its signature in Raman spectra. We compare the experimental findings
to recently developed molecular dynamics (MD) approach accounting for bond-breaking due to laser
irradiation, together with a dynamical matrix approach and bond polarizability model based on
first-principle calculations for the estimation of Raman spectra. We observe two stages of the
laser-induced densification and Raman spectrum evolution: growth during several hundreds of
pulses followed by further saturation. At the medium-range, the network connectivity change in
v-SiO2 is expressed in reduction of major ring fractions leading to more compacted structure. With
the help of Sen & Thorpe model, we also study the short-range order transformation and derive the
interbonding Si-O-Si angle change from the Raman measurements. Experimental findings are in excellent
agreement with our MD simulations, and, hence, support bond-breaking mechanism of laser-induced
densification. Thus, our modeling explains well the laser-induced changes both in the short-range
order caused by the appearance of Si-coordination defects and medium-range order connected to
evolution of the ring distribution. Finally, our findings disclose similarities between sheared-,
permanently-densified- and laser-induced-glass and suggest interesting future experiment
in order to clarify the impact of the thermo-mechanical history on glasses under shear, cold- and
hot-compression, and laser-induced densification.
