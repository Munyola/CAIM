Electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) is a well-established method of characterisation for
crystalline materials. This technique can rapidly acquire and index diffraction patterns to provide
phase and orientation information about the crystals on the material surface. The conventional
analysis method uses signal processing based on a Hough/Radon transform to index each diffraction
pattern. This method is limited to the analysis of simple geometric features and ignores subtle
characteristics of diffraction patterns, such as variations in relative band intensities. A second
method, developed to address the shortcomings of the Hough/Radon transform, is based on template
matching of a test experimental pattern with a large library of potential patterns. In the present
work, the template matching approach has been refined with a new cross correlation function that
allows for a smaller library and enables a dramatic speed up in pattern indexing. Refinement of the
indexed orientation is performed with a follow-up step to allow for small alterations to the best
match from the library search. The orientation is further refined with rapid measurement of misorientation
using whole pattern matching. The refined template matching approach is shown to be comparable
in accuracy, precision and sensitivity to the Hough based method, even exceeding it in some cases,
via the use of simulations and experimental data collected from a silicon single crystal and a deformed
{\alpha}-iron sample. The drastic speed up and pattern refinement approaches should increase
the widespread utility of pattern matching approaches.
