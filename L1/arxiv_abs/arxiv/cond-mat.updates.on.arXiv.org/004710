We report on atomic-scale analyses using high-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy
(HR-STEM), atom-probe tomography (APT), and first-principles calculations to study grain-boundary
(GB) segregation behavior of Nb3Sn coatings on Nb, prepared by a vapor-diffusion process for superconducting
radiofrequency (SRF) cavity applications. The results reveal Sn segregation at GBs of some Nb3Sn
coatings, with a Gibbsian interfacial excess of ~10-20 Sn atoms/nm2. The interfacial width of Sn
segregation at a GB is ~3 nm, with a maximum concentration of ~35 at.%. HR-STEM imaging of a selected
[1-20] tilt GB displays a periodic array of the structural unit at the core of the GB, and first-principle
calculations for the GB implies that excess Sn in bulk Nb3Sn may segregate preferentially at GBs
to reduce total internal energy. The amount of Sn segregation is correlated with two factors: (i)
Sn supply; and (ii) the temperatures of the Nb substrate and Sn source, which may affect the overall
kinetics including GB diffusion of Sn and Nb, and the interfacial reaction at Nb3Sn/Nb interfaces.
An investigation of the correlation between the chemistry of GBs and Nb3Sn SRF cavity performance
reveals no significant Sn segregation at GBs of high-performance Nb3Sn SRF cavities, indicating
possible effects of GB segregation on the quality (Q0) factor of Nb3Sn SRF cavities. Our results
suggest that the chemistry of GBs of Nb3Sn coatings for SRF cavities can be controlled by grain-boundary
engineering, and can be used to direct fabrication of high-quality Nb3Sn coatings for SRF cavities.
