We introduce exotic gapless states---`composite Dirac liquids'---that can appear at a strongly
interacting surface of a three-dimensional electronic topological insulator. Composite Dirac
liquids exhibit a gap to all charge excitations but nevertheless feature a single massless Dirac
cone built from emergent electrically neutral fermions. These states thus comprise electrical
insulators that, interestingly, retain thermal properties similar to those of the non-interacting
topological insulator surface. A variety of novel fully gapped phases naturally descend from composite
Dirac liquids. Most remarkably, we show that gapping the neutral fermions via Cooper pairing---which
crucially does not violate charge conservation---yields symmetric non-Abelian topologically
ordered surface phases captured in several recent works. Other (Abelian) topological orders emerge
upon alternatively gapping the neutral Dirac cone with magnetism. We establish a hierarchical
relationship between these descendant phases and expose an appealing connection to paired states
of composite Fermi liquids arising in the half-filled Landau level of two-dimensional electron
gases. To controllably access these states we exploit a quasi-1D deformation of the original electronic
Dirac cone that enables us to analytically address the fate of the strongly interacting surface.
The algorithm we develop applies quite broadly and further allows the construction of symmetric
surface topological orders for recently introduced bosonic topological insulators.
