We present the appearance of nearly flat band states with nonzero Chern numbers in a two-dimensional
"diamond-octagon" lattice model comprising two kinds of elementary plaquette geometries, diamond
and octagon, respectively. We show that the origin of such nontrivial topological nearly flat bands
can be described by a short-ranged tight-binding Hamiltonian. By considering an additional diagonal
hopping parameter in the diamond plaquettes along with an externally fine-tuned magnetic flux,
it leads to the emergence of such nearly flat band states with nonzero Chern numbers for our simple
lattice model. Such topologically nontrivial nearly flat bands can be very useful to realize the
fractional topological phenomena in lattice models when the interaction is taken into consideration.
In addition, we also show that perfect band flattening for certain energy bands, leading to compact
localized states can be accomplished by fine-tuning the parameters of the Hamiltonian of the system.
We compute the density of states and the wavefunction amplitude distribution at different lattice
sites to corroborate the formation of such perfectly flat band states in the energy spectrum. Considering
the structural homology between a diamond-octagon lattice and a kagome lattice, we strongly believe
that one can experimentally realize a diamond-octagon lattice using ultracold quantum gases in
an optical lattice setting. A possible application of our lattice model could be to design a photonic
lattice using single-mode laser-induced photonic waveguides and study the corresponding photonic
flat bands.
