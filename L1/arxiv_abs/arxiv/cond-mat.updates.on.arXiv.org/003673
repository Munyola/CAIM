We study the effect of a perpendicular magnetic field $\mathbf{B}$ on a multinode Weyl semimetal
(mWSM) of arbitrary integer monopole charge $n$, with the two Weyl multinodes separated in $\mathbf{k}$-space.
Besides type-I mWSMs, there exist type-II mWSMs which are characterized by the tilted minimal dispersion
for low-energy excitations; the Weyl points in type-II mWSMs are still protected crossings but
appears at the contact of the electron and hole pockets, after the Lifshitz transition. We find that
the presence of a perpendicular magnetic field destroys this feature due to the Landau quantization.
In this theory, the Hilbert space is spanned by a set of $n$ chiral degenerate ground states, and a
countably infinite number of achiral Landau levels. We calculate the Hall conductivity for the
tilt-symmetric case in the zero frequency limit, and show that the exact $T \rightarrow 0$ expression
generalizes from the formula for elementary ($n=1$) type-I WSMs, using the permutation operator.
Only one of the $n$ zero modes contribute to Hall transport, such that the node separation contribution
is annihilated. We derive a universal expression (valid for arbitrary $n$) for the type-II mWSM
Hall conductivity which is bounded by a Landau level cutoff, introduced on physical grounds and
analogous to the momentum cutoff for the $B = 0$ case. The corresponding thermal Hall and Nernst conductivities
are evaluated and characterized. This work is intended to classify the properties of generic mWSMs
into two equivalence classes, modulo the topological Lifshitz transition.
