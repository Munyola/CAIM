The fluorine-doped rare-earth iron oxypnictide series SmFeAsO$_{1-x}$F$_x$ (0 $\leq x \leq$
0.10) was investigated with high resolution powder x-ray scattering. In agreement with previous
studies, the parent compound SmFeAsO exhibits a tetragonal-to-orthorhombic structural distortion
at T$\rm{_{S}}$~=~130~K which is rapidly suppressed by $x \simeq$ 0.10 deep within the superconducting
dome. The change in unit cell symmetry is followed by a previously unreported magnetoelastic distortion
at 120~K. The temperature dependence of the thermal expansion coefficient $\alpha_{V}$ reveals
a rich phase diagram for SmFeAsO: (i) a global minimum at 125 K corresponds to the opening of a spin-density
wave instability as measured by pump-probe femtosecond spectroscopy whilst (ii) a global maximum
at 110 K corresponds to magnetic ordering of the Sm and Fe sublattices as measured by magnetic x-ray
scattering. At much lower temperatures than T$\rm{_{N}}$, SmFeAsO exhibits a significant negative
thermal expansion on the order of -40~ppm~$\cdot$~K$^{-1}$ in contrast to the behavior of other
rare-earth oxypnictides such as PrFeAsO and the actinide oxypnictide NpFeAsO where the onset of
$\alpha <$ 0 only appears in the vicinity of magnetic ordering. Correlating this feature with the
temperature and doping dependence of the resistivity and the unit cell parameters, we interpret
the negative thermal expansion as being indicative of the possible condensation of itinerant electrons
accompanying the opening of a SDW gap, consistent with transport measurements.
