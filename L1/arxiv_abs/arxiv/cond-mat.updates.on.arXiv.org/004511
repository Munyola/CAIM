In this research, we report on the synthesis and characterization of $La_{0.67}Ca_{0.33}MnO_3$
(LCMO), $La_{0.67}Ba_{0.33}MnO_3$ (LBMO), and $La_{0.67}Sr_{0.33}MnO_3$ (LSMO) perovskites.
Precursor powders for the perovskite samples were prepared using ball mailing technique. The resulting
powder was pressed into disks which were subsequently sintered at 1000 C for 2h. The structural characteristics
of the prepared samples were investigated using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron
microscope (SEM), and the magnetic properties were investigated using vibrating sample magnetometry
(VSM). XRD pattern of LCMO sample revealed a pure perovskite phase with Pnma space group, while the
pattern of LSMO sample revealed a pure perovskite with R3c$^-$ space group. XRD pattern of LBMO sample,
however, demonstrated the presence of a major perovskite phase with R3c$^-$ symmetry, together
with a secondary $BaMnO_3$ phase. This secondary phase disappeared upon sintering LBMO at a higher
temperature of 1100 C. Isothermal magnetic measurements and thermomagnetic curves revealed that
LCMO was paramagnetic at room temperature. However, LSMO exhibited soft ferromagnetic behavior
at room temperature, with Tc = 380 K and Ms = 50.9 emu/g. Also, LBMO sample sintered at 1000 C exhibited
soft ferromagnetic behavior at room temperature, with Curie temperature Tc = 343 K and a rather low
saturation magnetization of Ms = 30.7 emu/g. The higher sintering temperature of LBMO compound
resulted in a significant increase of the saturation magnetization to 50.8 emu/g for the sample
sintered at 1100 C.
