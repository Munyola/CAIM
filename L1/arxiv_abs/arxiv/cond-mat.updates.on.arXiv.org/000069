We present the results of Monte-Carlo simulations of the charge carrier transport in a disordered
molecular system containing spatial and energetic disorders using the dipolar glass model. Model
parameters of the material were chosen to fit a typical polar organic photoconductor polycarbonate
doped with 30% of aromatic hydrazone, whose transport properties are well documented in literature.
Simulated carrier mobility demonstrates a usual Poole-Frenkel field dependence and its slope
is very close to the experimental value without using any adjustable parameter. At room temperature
transients are universal with respect to the electric field and transport layer thickness. At the
same time, carrier mobility does not depend on the layer thickness and transients develop a well-defined
plateau where the current does not depend on time, thus demonstrating a non-dispersive transport
regime. Tails of the transients decay as power law with the exponent close to -2. This particular
feature indicates that transients are close to the boundary between dispersive and non-dispersive
transport regimes. Shapes of the simulated transients are in very good agreement with the experimental
ones. In summary, we provide a first verification of a self-consistency of the dipolar glass transport
model, where major transport parameters, extracted from the experimental transport data, are
then used in the transport simulation, and the resulting mobility field dependence and transients
are in very good agreement with the initial experimental data.
