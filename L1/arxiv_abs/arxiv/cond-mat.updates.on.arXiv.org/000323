We investigate the temperature response of the alkali-metal rattling modes in {\beta}-pyrochlores,
AOs2O6 (A = K, Rb, Cs), from the results of ab initio molecular dynamics (MD) simulations performed
at 20 K, 100 K, and 300 K. Our results show that the temperature response of the T1u mode is clearly different
from that of the T2g mode for all three pyrochlores. In this regard, two features are of particular
note for both K and Rb; (1) the T1u mode exhibits a distinctly stronger softening response with decreasing
temperature compared to the T2g mode, and (2) the T1u mode becomes stronger and sharper with decreasing
temperature. These two findings suggest that the T1u mode is significantly more anharmonic and
sensitive to the cage dynamics than the T2g mode. Examination of the local potentials around the
alkali-metal atoms reveals that K has the flattest and most anharmonic potential at all temperatures
while Cs exhibits the narrowest potential. The temperature dependence of the local potentials
reveals that, for K, the potential at a higher temperature is not a simple extrapolation to higher
energy of that at a lower temperature. Instead, we find significant reconstruction of the potential
at different temperatures. Finally, we explore the temperature response of the coupling between
the alkali metals and find a complex temperature dependence which suggests that the origin of the
coupling may be more complex than a pure Coulomb interaction. We also find an unexpected increase
in the static disorder of the system at low temperatures for the K and Rb pyrochlores.
