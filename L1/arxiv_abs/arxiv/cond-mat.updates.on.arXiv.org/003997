The synthetic actin network arouses great interest as bio-material due to its soft and wet nature
that mimics many biological scaffolding structures. Inside the cell, the actin network is regulated
by tens of actin-binding proteins (ABP's), which make for a highly complex system with several emergent
behaviours. In particular, calponin is an ABP that was identified as an actin stabiliser, but whose
mechanism is still poorly understood. Recent experiments using an in vitro model system of cross-linked
actin with calponin and large deformation bulk rheology, found that networks with basic calponin
exhibited a delayed onset and were able to withstand a higher maximal strain before softening. In
this work, we show that the difference between the two networks, with and without calponin, not only
provides bundle flexibility. But, also encodes alterations in the pre-strain and the regulation
of the crosslinks adhesion energy to define the new yielding point. We verify these effects theoretically
using nonlinear continuum mechanics for the semiflexible and crosslinked network. In addition,
the alterations over the microstructure are described by the definition of an interaction parameter
$\Gamma$ according the formalism of Landau. According to this simple model we demonstrates that
the interaction parameter can describe the experimental observations following an scaling exponent
as $\Gamma \sim \mid c-c_{cr} \mid^{1/2}$, where $c$ is the ratio between concentration of calponin
and actin. This result provides interesting feedback to improve our understanding of several mechano-biological
pathways.
