A quantitative descriptor of local atomic environments is often required for the analysis of atomistic
data. Descriptors of the local atomic environment ideally provide physically and chemically intuitive
insight. This requires descriptors that are low-dimensional representations of the interplay
between atomic geometry and electronic bond formation. The moments of the local density of states
(DOS) relate the atomic structure to the electronic structure and bond chemistry. This makes it
possible to construct electronic structure based descriptors of the local atomic environment
that have an immediate relation to the binding energy. We show that a low-dimensional moments-descriptor
is sufficient as the lowest moments, calculated from the closest atomic neighborhood, carry the
largest contributions to the local bond energy. Here, we construct moments-descriptors that project
the space of local atomic environments on a 2-D map. We discuss in detail the separation of various
atomic environments and their connections in the map. The distances in the map may be related to energy
differences between local atomic environments as we show by analytic considerations based on analytic
bond-order potentials (BOP) and by numerical assessment using TB and density-functional theory
calculations. Possible applications of the proposed moments-descriptors include the classification
of local atomic environments in molecular-dynamic simulations, the selection of structure sets
for developing and testing interatomic potentials, as well as the construction of descriptors
for machine-learning applications.
