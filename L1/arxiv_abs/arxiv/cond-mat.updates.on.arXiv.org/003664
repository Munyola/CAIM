Disordered hyperuniform dispersions are exotic amorphous two-phase materials characterized
by an anomalous suppression of long-wavelength volume-fraction fluctuations, endowing them
with novel physical properties. While such unusual materials have received considerable attention,
a stumbling block has been an inability to create large samples that are truly hyperuniform due to
current computational and experimental limitations. To overcome such barriers, we introduce
a new, simple construction procedure that guarantees perfect hyperuniformity for very large sample
sizes. It involves tessellating space into cells and then inserting a particle into each cell such
that the local-cell particle packing fractions are identical to the global packing fraction. We
analytically prove that such dispersions are perfectly hyperuniform in the infinite-sample-size
limit. Our methodology enables a remarkable mapping that converts a very large nonhyperuniform
disordered dispersion into a perfectly hyperuniform one, which we numerically demonstrate in
two and three dimensions. A similar analysis also establishes the hyperuniformity of the famous
Hashin-Shtrikman multiscale dispersions, which possess optimal transport and elastic properties.
Our hyperuniform designs can be readily fabricated using modern photolithographic and 3D printing
technologies. The exploration of the enormous class of hyperuniform dispersions that can be designed
and tuned by our tessellation-based methodology paves the way for accelerating the discovery of
novel hyperuniform materials.
