Over the past two decades, many quantum systems have been explored as candidate qubits for quantum
information processing. Qubits based on nuclear spins enjoy exceptionally long coherence times,
especially compared to other solid-state platforms. However, this usually comes at the cost of
slow gate operations and weak interqubit interactions, aspects which have so far prevented the
development of multi-qubit processors comprised of solid-state nuclear spins. An exception to
this is the TbPc$_2$ single-molecule magnet, a nuclear spin qubit which features a remarkable combination
of long-lived coherence and fast electrical control. Despite this promise, it has remained an open
question how to couple such qubits together to create the entanglement needed for quantum information
applications. Given the sensitivity of the TbPc$_2$ molecule to electric fields via the hyperfine
Stark effect, it is natural to consider the possibility of using a superconducting transmission
line resonator to mediate a long-distance coupling between multiple TbPc$_2$ qubits. We use recent
experimental results on single-qubit Rabi oscillations to deduce the strength and nature of the
hyperfine Stark effect, information we then use to estimate the qubit-resonator coupling and to
design two-qubit entangling gates with fidelities exceeding 99%. Our results suggest that the
qubit-resonator interaction is near the edge of the strong coupling regime and could potentially
pass into it with further improvements in device designs and components.
