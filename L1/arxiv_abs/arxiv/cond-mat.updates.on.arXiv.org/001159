We report investigations on the magnetotransport in LaSb, which exhibits extremely large magnetoresistance
(XMR). Foremost, we demonstrate that the resistivity plateau can be explained without invoking
topological protection. We then determine the Fermi surface from Shubnikov - de Haas (SdH) quantum
oscillation measurements and find good agreement with the bulk Fermi pockets derived from first
principle calculations. Using a semiclassical theory and the experimentally determined Fermi
pocket anisotropies, we quantitatively describe the orbital magnetoresistance, including its
angle dependence. We show that the origin of XMR in LaSb lies in its high mobility with diminishing
Hall effect, where the high mobility leads to a strong magnetic field dependence of the longitudinal
magnetoconductance. Unlike a one-band material, when a system has two or more bands (Fermi pockets)
with electron and hole carriers, the added conductance arising from the Hall effect is reduced,
hence revealing the latent XMR enabled by the longitudinal magnetoconductance. With diminishing
Hall effect, the magnetoresistivity is simply the inverse of the longitudinal magnetoconductivity,
enabling the differentiation of the electron and hole contributions to the XMR, which varies with
the strength and orientation of the magnetic field. This work demonstrates a convenient way to separate
the dynamics of the charge carriers and to uncover the origin of XMR in multi-band materials with
anisotropic Fermi surfaces. Our approach can be readily applied to other XMR materials.
