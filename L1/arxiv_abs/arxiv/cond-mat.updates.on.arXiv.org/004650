The discovery of superconducting and insulating states in magic angle twisted bilayer graphene
(MATBG) has ignited considerable interest in understanding the nature of electronic interactions
in this chemically pristine material system. The phenomenological similarity of the MATBG transport
properties as a function of doping with those of the high-Tc cuprates and other unconventional superconductors
suggests the possibility that MATBG may be a highly interacting system. However, there have not
been any direct experimental evidence for strong many-body correlations in MATBG. Here we provide
such evidence from using high-resolution spectroscopic measurements, as a function of carrier
density, with a scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). We find MATBG to display unusual spectroscopic
characteristics that can be attributed to electron-electron interactions over a wide range of
doping, including when superconductivity emerges in this system. We show that our measurements
cannot be explained with a mean-field approach for modeling electron-electron interaction in
MATBG. The breakdown of a mean-field approach for understanding the properties of other correlated
superconductors, such as cuprates, has long inspired the study of highly correlated Hubbard model.
We show that a phenomenological extended Hubbard model cluster calculation, motivated by the nearly
localized nature of the relevant electronic states of MATBG produces spectroscopic features similar
to those we observe experimentally. Our findings demonstrate the critical role of many-body correlations
in understanding the properties of MATBG.
