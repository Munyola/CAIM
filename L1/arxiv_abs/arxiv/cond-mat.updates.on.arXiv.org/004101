We study the one-electron spectral properties of one-dimensional interacting electron systems
in which the interactions have finite range. We employ a mobile quantum impurity scheme that describes
the interactions of the fractionalized excitations at energies above the standard Tomonga-Luttinger
liquid limit and show that the phase shifts induced by the impurity describe universal properties
of the one-particle spectral function. We find the explicit forms in terms of these phase shifts
for the momentum dependent exponents that control the behavior of the spectral function near and
at the (k,omega)-plane singularities where most of the spectral weight is located. The universality
arises because the line shape near the singularities is independent of the short-distance part
of the interaction potentials. We apply the theory to the angle-resolved photo-electron spectroscopy
(ARPES) in the highly one-dimensional bismuth-induced anisotropic structure on indium antimonide
Bi/InSb(001). Our theoretical predictions agree quantitatively with both (i) the experimental
value found in Bi/InSb(001) for the exponent alpha that controls the suppression of the density
of states at very small excitation energy omega and (ii) the location in the (k,omega) plane of the
experimentally observed high-energy peaks in the ARPES momentum and energy distributions. We
conclude with a discussion of experimental properties beyond the range of our present theoretical
framework and further open questions regarding the one-electron spectral properties of Bi/InSb(001).
