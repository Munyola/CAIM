The effect of spin-charge separation is known to happen in one-dimensional many-body systems in
the presence of interactions between particles. In a few-body regime, however, little is known
about this phenomenon. To address this problem, we describe the time-evolution of a small system
of strongly interacting fermions with SU(N) symmetry after a sudden change in the trapping geometry.
The presence of strong contact interactions allows for a mapping between a multicomponent repulsive
gas and an effective spin chain, where the internal degrees of freedom of the atoms play the role of
different spin projections. This model captures the dynamical behavior of the system by taking
into account a set of time-dependent exchange coefficients, which are determined by the instantaneous
spatial densities of the system. We show how changing the trapping potential influences the spatial
distribution of each atomic species in the ground state of the spin chain. We then obtain the dynamics
of the spin densities after a sudden change in the trap. Even at the few-body level, the excitation
spectrum for this quantity presents clear separate signatures of both spin and charge dynamics.
Moreover, as the number of internal components is increased, we show that the spin excitations vanish,
and the dynamics can be predicted by the excitation frequencies expected for a gas of impenetrable
bosons. Additionally, we include the description of the dynamics under the same quench protocol
in a system where SU(N) symmetry is broken.
