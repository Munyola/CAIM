Coalescence of tiny particles into extended shapes has been an overlooked phenomenon since long.
Present study discusses the formation of tiny particles and their packing into large-sized particles
under varying concentration of gold precursor in homemade built pulse-based electronphoton-solution
interface process. Under fixed ratio of bipolar pulse OFF to ON time, different kind tiny particles
develop while varying the amount of gold precursor. At solution surface, packets of nano shape energy
bind gold atoms into different kind tiny particles depending on the mechanism of formation of their
monolayer assembly. For precursor concentration between 0.07 mM to 0.90 mM, many tiny particles
are developed in two joint triangles shape for each case, maximum at 0.30 mM and 0.60 mM. On separation
and elongation under the force of opposite poles influencing uniformly at centre of each atom, tiny
particles pack at a point where they deal no force of surface resulting into develop various shaped
particles under one layer down gravity. At 0.05 mM and 1.20 mM, tiny particles rarely observed in
triangle shape developed where their packings under zigzag motions resulted into develop distorted
particles. Reflected photons patterns at the surface of various shaped particles validate their
structural regularity, whereas, it does not exist in the case of distorted ones. Changing the argon
gas flow rate influences the morphology-structure of particles at minute level. This study purely
determines that under what concentration of gold precursor a certain size and shape of tiny particle
or large particle is developed.
