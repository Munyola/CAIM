PrRu$_4$Sn$_6$ is a tetragonal, non-centrosymmetric structure compound. It is isostructural
to the extensively studied Kondo insulator CeRu$_4$Sn$_6$ which crystallizes in the YRu$_4$Sn$_6$-type
structure with space group $I$\={4}2$m$. In this structure, the Pr atom fills the void formed by
the octahedral Ru$_4$Sn$_6$ units which results in a tetragonal body-centred arrangement. Here
we present reports on the physical and magnetic properties of PrRu$_4$Sn$_6$. The temperature
dependences of specific heat, $C_p(T)$, electrical resistivity, $\rho(T)$, and magnetic susceptibility,
$\chi(T)$, reveal the absence of a long-range magnetic ordering down to 2 K. $\chi(T)$ follows a
Curie-Weiss behaviour above 100 K with an effective magnetic moment, $\mu_\mathrm{eff}$ = 3.34
$\mu_B$/Pr and paramagnetic Weiss temperature, $\theta_p$ = $-$19.47 K indicating a dominant
antiferromagnetic interaction. The magnetization at 2 K is quasi-linear in nature and attains
a value of 0.86 $\mu_B$/Pr at 7 T which is well reduced compared to the calculated value of 3.32 $\mu_B$/Pr
expected for a free Pr$^{3+}$ ion. This is attributed to possible magneto-crystalline anisotropy
in the system. $C_p(T)$ indicates the presence of a optical-phonon mode which is supported by a glass-like
thermal conductivity above $\sim$45 K. This observation is associated with caged structured compounds
where the low-frequency optical-phonon mode of the guest atom interacts with the host lattice,
resulting in the scattering of heat-carrying quasiparticles.
