Reliable models of the thermodynamic properties of materials are critical for industrially relevant
applications that require a good understanding of equilibrium phase diagrams, thermal and chemical
transport, and microstructure evolution. The goal of thermodynamic models is to capture data from
both experimental and computational studies and then make reliable predictions when extrapolating
to new regions of parameter space. These predictions will be impacted by artifacts present in real
data sets such as outliers, systematics errors and unreliable or missing uncertainty bounds. Such
issues increase the probability of the thermodynamic model producing erroneous predictions.
We present a Bayesian framework for the selection, calibration and quantification of uncertainty
of thermodynamic property models. The modular framework addresses numerous concerns regarding
thermodynamic models including thermodynamic consistency, robustness to outliers and systematic
errors by the use of hyperparameter weightings and robust Likelihood and Prior distribution choices.
Furthermore, the framework's inherent transparency (e.g. our choice of probability functions
and associated parameters) enables insights into the complex process of thermodynamic assessment.
We introduce these concepts through examples where the true property model is known. In addition,
we demonstrate the utility of the framework through the creation of a property model from a large
set of experimental specific heat and enthalpy measurements of Hafnium metal from 0 to 4900K.
