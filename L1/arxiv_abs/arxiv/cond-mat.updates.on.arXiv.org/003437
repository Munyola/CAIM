The characteristic frequencies of a system provide important information on the phenomena that
govern its physical properties. In this framework, there has recently been renewed interest in
cryogenic microwave characterization for condensed matter systems since it allows to probe energy
scales of the order of a few $\mu$eV. However, broadband measurements of the absolute value of a sample
response in this frequency range are extremely sensitive to its environment and require a careful
calibration. In this paper, we present an \textit{in situ} calibration method for cryogenic broadband
microwave reflectometry experiments that is both simple to implement and through which the effect
of the sample electromagnetic environment can be minimized. The calibration references are here
provided by the sample itself, at three reference temperatures where its impedance is assumed or
measured, and not by external standards as is usual. We compare the frequency-dependent complex
impedance (0.1--2 GHz) of an a-Nb$_{15}$Si$_{85}$ superconducting thin film obtained through
this Sample-Based Calibration (SBC) and through an Open-Short-Load Standard Calibration (SC)
when working at very low temperature (0.02--4 K) and show that the SBC allows us to obtain the absolute
response of the sample. This method brings the calibration planes as close as possible to the sample,
so that the environment electrodynamic response does not affect the measurement, provided it is
temperature independent. This results in a heightened sensitivity, for a given experimental set--up.
