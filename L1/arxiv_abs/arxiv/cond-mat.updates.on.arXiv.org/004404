The stability of nanoparticle suspensions is determined by a subtle interplay of particle-particle
and particle-solvent interactions. Experimental studies of suspensions of calcite nanoparticles
have reported formation of gels, hence providing evidence for adhesive interactions. Data obtained
using extended calcite surfaces support the existence of repulsion between surfaces, which has
been assigned to the presence of surface roughness. Here, we use the Derjaguin approximation to
calculate the effective interactions between calcite nanoparticles as a function of their inter-particle
separation and incorporating surface roughness effects. We combine an approach based on a Gaussian
distribution of surface heights with surface-surface interactions obtained recently in flat
surfaces using molecular simulations [G. Svaland and F. Bresme, $\textit{J. Phys. Chem. C}, \textbf{2018},
\textit{122} (13), pp. 7321-7330$]. We show that roughness effects associated to a discrete distribution
of heights, such as atomic steps or terraces in mineral surfaces, results in very different effective
inter-colloidal potentials. Using Langevin computer simulations and the effective inter-particle
potentials we demonstrate that roughness effects might influence significantly the phase behaviour
of nanoparticle suspensions. Small roughnesses lead to the formation of gel structures, while
stable dispersed suspensions are obtained when the root-mean-squared deviation (RMSD) of the
surface roughness increases above a $\sim 0.25$ \r{A} threshold.
