In this paper we continue to explore "hybrid" quantum circuit models in one-dimension with both
unitary and measurement gates, focussing on the entanglement properties of wavefunction trajectories
at long times, in the steady state. We simulate a large class of Clifford circuits, including models
with or without randomness in the unitary gates, and with or without randomness in the locations
of measurement gates, using stabilizer techniques to access the long time dynamics of systems up
to 512 qubits. In all models we find a volume law entangled phase for low measurement rates, which
exhibits a sub-dominant logarithmic behavior in the entanglement entropy, S_A = {\alpha} ln |A|
+ s|A|, with sub-system size |A|. With increasing measurement rate the volume law phase is unstable
to a disentangled area law phase, passing through a single entanglement transition at a critical
rate of measurement. At criticality we find a purely logarithmic entanglement entropy, S_A = {\alpha}(p_c)
ln|A|, a power law decay and conformal symmetry of the mutual information, with exponential decay
off criticality. Various spin-spin correlation functions also show slow decay at criticality,
providing possible experimental access. Critical exponents are consistent across all models,
indicative of a single universality class. These results suggest the existence of an effective
underlying statistical mechanical model for the entanglement transition. Beyond Clifford circuit
models, numerical simulations of up to 20 qubits give consistent results.
