Topological spin textures as an emerging class of topological matter offer a medium for information
storage and processing. The recently discovered topological Hall effect (THE) is considered as
a fingerprint for electrically probing non-trivial spin-textures. But the origin of THE in oxides
has remained elusive. Here we report an observation of the THE in ultrathin (unit cells. u.c.) 4d
ferromagnetic SrRuO3 films grown on SrTiO3(001) substrates, which can be attributed to the chiral
ordering of spin structure (i.e., skyrmion-like) in the single SrRuO3 layer without contacting
5d oxide SrIrO3 layer. It is revealed that the RuO6 octahedral tilting induced by local orthorhombic-to-tetragonal
structural phase transition exists across the SrRuO3/SrTiO3 interface, which naturally breaks
the inversion symmetry. Our theoretical calculations demonstrate that the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya
(DM) interaction arises owing to the broken inversion symmetry and strong spin-orbit interaction
of 4d SrRuO3. This DM interaction can stabilize the N\'eel-type magnetic skyrmions, which in turn
accounts for the observed THE in transport. The RuO6 octahedral tilting-induced DM interaction
provides a pathway toward the electrical control of the topological spin textures and resultant
THE, which is confirmed both experimentally and theoretically. Besides the fundamental significance,
the understanding of THE in oxides and its electrical manipulation presented in this work could
advance the low power cost topological electronic and spintronic applications.
