The field of double perovskites is now advancing to three magnetic elements on the A, B and B$'$ sites.
A series of iridium-based double perovskite compounds, $Ln_2$CoIrO$_6$ ($Ln$ = Eu, Tb, Ho) with
three magnetic elements were synthesized as polycrystalline samples. The compounds crystalize
in monoclinic structures with the space group $P2_1/n$. Magnetic properties of these hetero-tri-spin
$3d$-$5d$-$4f$ systems were studied by magnetic susceptibility and field dependent magnetization
in both DC and pulsed magnetic fields. All these compounds show ferrimagnetic transitions at temperatures
$T_C$ above 100 K, which are attributable to antiferromagnetic coupling between Co$^{2+}$ and
Ir$^{4+}$ spins. For Eu$_2$CoIrO$_6$, the magnetic properties are similar to those of La$_2$CoIrO$_6$.
The Eu$^{3+}$ spins show Van Vleck paramagnetism that don't significantly interact with transition-metal
cations. By contrast, Tb$_2$CoIrO$_6$ and Ho$_2$CoIrO$_6$ reveal a second transition to antiferromagnetic
order below a lower temperature $T_N$. The temperature-induced ferrimagnetic-to-antiferromagnetic
phase transition might be explained by a spin-reorientation transition. Moreover, a magnetic-field-induced
spin-flop transition with a small hysteresis was observed below $T_N$ in these two compounds. The
magnetic moment of all three compounds do not saturate up to 60 T at low temperatures. Moderate magnetocaloric
effect was also observed in all three compounds. Our results should motivate further investigation
of the spin configuration on single crystals of these iridium-based double perovskites.
