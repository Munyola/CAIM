Precise control of the chemical valence or oxidation state of vanadium in vanadium oxide thin films
is highly desirable for not only fundamental research, but also technological applications that
utilize the subtle change in the physical properties originating from the metal- insulator transition
(MIT) near room temperature. However, due to the multivalent nature of vanadium and the lack of a
good understanding on growth control of the oxidation state, stabilization of phase pure vanadium
oxides with a single oxidation state is extremely challenging. Here, we systematically varied
the growth conditions to clearly map out the growth window for preparing phase pure epitaxial vanadium
oxides by pulsed laser deposition for providing a guideline to grow high quality thin films with
well-defined oxidation states of V2(+3)O3, V(+4)O2, and V2(+5)O5. A well pronounced MIT was only
observed in VO2 films grown in a very narrow range of oxygen partial pressure P(O2). The films grown
either in lower (< 10 mTorr) or higher P(O2) (> 25 mTorr) result in V2O3 and V2O5 phases, respectively,
thereby suppressing the MIT for both cases. We have also found that the resistivity ratio before
and after the MIT of VO2 thin films can be further enhanced by one order of magnitude when the films
are further oxidized by post-annealing at a well-controlled oxidizing ambient. This result indicates
that stabilizing vanadium into a single valence state has to compromise with insufficient oxidation
of an as grown thin film and, thereby, a subsequent oxidation is required for an improved MIT behavior.
