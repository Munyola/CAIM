We report on hydrazine-sensing organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) with a design consisting
in concentric annular electrodes. The design engineering of these OECTs was motivated by the great
potential of using OECT sensing arrays in fields such as bioelectronics. In this work, PEDOT:PSS-based
OECTs have been studied as aqueous sensors, specifically sensitive to the lethal hydrazine molecule.
These amperometric sensors have many relevant features for the development of hydrazine sensors,
such as a sensitivity down to 10-5 M of hydrazine in water, an order of magnitude higher selectivity
for hydrazine than for 9 other water soluble common analytes, the capability to recover entirely
its base signal after water flushing and a very low voltage operation. The specificity for hydrazine
to be sensed by our OECTs is caused by its catalytic oxidation at the gate electrode and enables increasing
the output current modulation of the devices. This has permitted the device-geometry study of the
whole series of 80 micrometric OECT devices with sub-20-nm PEDOT:PSS layers, channel lengths down
to 1um and a specific device geometry of coplanar and concentric electrodes. The numerous geometries
unravel new aspects of the OECT mechanisms governing the electrochemical sensing behaviours of
the device, more particularly the effect of the contacts which are inherent at the micro-scale.
By lowering the device cross-talking, micrometric gate-integrated radial OECTs shall contribute
to the diminishing of the readout invasiveness and therefore promotes further the development
of OECT biosensors.
