We report on muon spin rotation experiments probing the temperature-dependent magnetic penetration
depth in 2H-NbSe_2 under high-pressure (p_max = 2.1 GPa) and in 4H-NbSe_2 at ambient pressure. The
current results for ambient pressure along with our earlier findings on 1T'-MoTe_2 (Z. Guguchia
et. al., Nature Communications 8, 1082 (2017)) demonstrates that the superfluid density n_s scale
linearly with T_c in the three transition metal dichalcogenide superconductors 2H-NbSe_2, 4H-NbSe_2,
and 1T'-MoTe_2. Upon increasing pressure, we observe a substantial increase of the superfluid
density n_s in 2H-NbSe_2, which we find to correlate with T_c. However, the n_s vs T_c dependence
shows a deviation from the Uemura linear relation. A similar deviation from the Uemura line was also
observed in previous pressure studies of optimally doped cuprates. The correlation between the
superfluid density and the critical temperature is considered a hallmark feature of unconventional
superconductivity, especially in high-temperature cuprate superconductors. Here, we show that
this correlation is also an intrinsic property of the superconductivity in transition metal dichalcogenides,
whereas the ratio T_c/T_F is approximately a factor of 20 lower than the ratio observed in hole-doped
cuprates. We, furthermore, find that the values of the superconducting gaps are insensitive to
the suppression of the quasi-two-dimensional CDW state, indicating that the CDW ordering and the
superconductivity in 2H-NbSe_2 are independent of each other.
