We provide a C/C++ software for the shape analysis of deflated elastic capsules in a pendant capsule
geometry, which is based on the proper elastic description of the capsule material as a quasi two-dimensional
elastic layer using shell theory. This pendant capsule elastometry provides a new tool for interfacial
rheology of elastic capsules that goes beyond determination of the Gibbs- or dilatational modulus
from area-dependent measurements of the surface tension using pendant drop tensiometry, which
can only give a rough estimate of the elastic capsule properties as they are based on a purely liquid
interface model. The software allows the user to determine the following quantities for each digitized
image of a deflated capsule shape given another image of its undeformed reference shape: the surface
tension characterizing the reference shape, Young's surface modulus (or alternatively area compression
modulus) and Poisson's ratio. If series of images are available, these moduli can be determined
as a function of the capsule volume to analyze hysteresis or aging effects depending on the deformation
history or to detect viscoelastic effects for different volume change rates. An additional wrinkling
wavelength measurement allows the user to determine the bending modulus, from which the layer thickness
can be derived. We verify the method by analyzing several materials, compare the results to available
rheological measurements, and review several applications. We make the software available under
the GPL license at github.com/jhegemann/opencapsule.
