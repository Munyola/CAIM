We report on the experimental observation of an anomalous electrical conduction effect in a metal-insulator
system, at room temperature. Namely, we fabricate current-carrying metallic micro-wires (diffusive
transport regime) on an electrically insulating diamond substrate and map the current-induced
vector magnetic field in the diamond using a layer of near-surface nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centres.
We show that the measured magnetic field satisfies Amp{\`e}re's circuital law if and only if one
assumes that the majority of the current flows in the diamond substrate. By reconstructing the spatial
distribution of the current density, we find that this leakage current is roughly vertically centred
about the NV layer (NV depths 10-30 nm), and spreads laterally by several micrometres away from the
wire. Further experimental tests reveal that the leakage through the diamond largely persists
when an additional insulating layer is inserted between the metallic wire and the diamond or when
the metallic wire is replaced by a graphene ribbon, and decreases when the intensity of the laser
used in the experiments is increased. Altogether, these observations lead to the surprising conclusion
that the current is carried by conduction electrons (or quasi-particles) with a current density
extending several micrometres into the diamond. Strategies to independently probe these unexpected
current phenomena are discussed. Beyond the scientific curiosity, these findings have immediate
ramifications for applications of diamond-based magnetometry to charge transport studies.
