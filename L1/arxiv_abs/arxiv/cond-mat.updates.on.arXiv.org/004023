Kinetic Monte-Carlo (KMC) simulations are a well-established numerical tool to investigate the
time-dependent surface morphology in molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) experiments. One drawback
of the KMC method, however, is the high computational cost at growth conditions, where particle
diffusion dominates over particle adsorption. As an alternative, we introduce in this study a limited
mobility (LM) model to realistically simulate the low-temperature regime (where detachment processes
can be neglected). The model is based on the stochastic transition rules of the so-called Das Sarma-Tamborena
(DT) model, but differs from the latter via a variable diffusion length. A first guess for this length
can be extracted from the mean-squared displacement calculated from short KMC simulations. Comparing
the resulting surface morphologies in the submonolayer growth regime to those obtained from KMC
simulations, we find deviations which can be cured by adding fluctuations to the diffusion length.
This mimics the stochastic nature of particle diffusion on a substrate, an aspect which is usually
neglected in LM models. We propose to add fluctuations to the diffusion length by choosing this quantity
for each adsorbed particle from a Gaussian distribution. The analysis of the surface morphologies
(on one-dimensional substrates) in the sub- and multilayer growth regime shows that the LM model
is capable of producing structures that are indistinguishable to the ones from KMC simulations
at arbitrary growth conditions. Our method can be generalized to two-dimensional calculations.
