Improving the critical transition temperature (TC) of Bi(Pb)SrCaCuO (B(P)SCCO) high-temperature
superconductors is important, however, considerable challenges exist. In this study, we designed
a smart meta-superconductor B(P)SCCO consisting of B(P)SCCO microparticles and Y2O3:Eu3++Ag
topological luminophor based on a metamaterial structure and the idea that the injecting energy
will promote the formation of Cooper pairs. In the applied electric field, the Y2O3:Eu3++Ag topological
luminophor generates an electroluminescence (EL), thereby promoting the TC via EL energy injection.
A series of Y2O3:Eu3++Ag topological luminophor-doped B(P)SCCO samples was prepared. Results
showed that Y2O3:Eu3++Ag was dispersed around B(P)SCCO particles, forming a metastructure. Accordingly,
the onset temperature (T_(C,on)) and zero resistance transition temperature (T_(C,0)) of B(P)SCCO
increased. The 0.1 wt% Y2O3:Eu3++Ag doping B(P)SCCO sample exhibited a large increase, and T_(C,0)
and T_(C,on) were increased by 13 K and 4 K, respectively. The B(P)SCCO sample doped with 0.2 wt% Y2O3
or Y2O3:Sm3+ nonluminous inhomogeneous phase was also prepared to further prove the influence
of EL on the T_(C,0) and T_(C,on) rather than the rare earth effect. Results indicated that the T_(C,on)
of the Y2O3 or Y2O3:Sm3+ doping sample decreased, and the T_(C,0) slightly increased. However,
the T_(C,0) and T_(C,on) of the 0.2 wt% Y2O3:Eu3++Ag topological luminophor-doped sample improved
by 8 K and 4 K, respectively. This outcome further demonstrated that the smart metastructure method
can improve the TC of B(P)SCCO.
