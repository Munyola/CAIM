The experimental observation of superconductivity in doped semimetals and semiconductors, where
the Fermi energy is comparable or smaller than the phonon frequencies, is not captured by conventional
theory. In this paper, we propose a mechanism for superconductivity in ultra low-density Dirac
materials based on the proximity to a ferroelectric quantum critical point. We consider both ionic
and covalent crystals. We derive a low-energy theory that takes into account the strong Coulomb
forces of the polarization modes and the direct coupling between the electrons and the soft phonon
modes. We show that in the case of ionic crystals, Coulomb repulsion is strongly screened by the lattice
polarization near the critical point. Using a renormalization group analysis in the low-density
limit, we demonstrate that the effective electron-electron interaction is dominantly mediated
by the transverse phonon mode. We find that the system generically flows towards strong electron-phonon
coupling. Hence, we propose a new mechanism to simultaneously produce an attractive interaction
and suppress strong Coulomb repulsion, which does not require retardation. We obtain qualitatively
similar results for covalent crystals, though the Coulomb screening in this case is much weaker.
We then apply our results to study superconductivity in the low-density limit. We find strong enhancement
of the transition temperature upon approaching the quantum critical point. Finally, we also discuss
scenarios to realize a topological $p$-wave superconducting state in covalent crystals close
to the critical point.
