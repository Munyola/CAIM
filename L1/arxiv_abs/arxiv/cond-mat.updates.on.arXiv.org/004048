We present a nonlocal statistical field theory of a diluted solution of dipolar particles which
are capable of forming chain-like clusters in accordance with the 'head-to-tail' mechanism. As
in our previous study [Yu.A. Budkov 2018 J. Phys.: Condens. Matter 30 344001], we model dipolar particles
as dimers comprised of oppositely charged point-like groups, separated by fluctuating distance.
For the special case of the Yukawa-type distribution function of distance between the charged groups
of dipolar particles we obtain an analytical expression for the electrostatic free energy of solution
within the random phase approximation. We show that an increase in the association constant leads
to a decrease in the absolute value of the electrostatic free energy of solution, preventing its
phase separation which is in agreement with the former computer simulations and theoretical results.
We obtain a non-linear integro-differential equation for the self-consistent field potential
created by the fixed external charges in a solution medium, taking into account the association
of dipolar particles. As a consequence of the derived self-consistent field equation, in regime
of weak electrostatic interactions, we obtain an analytical expression for the electrostatic
potential of the point-like test ion, surrounded by the chain-like clusters of the dipolar particles.
We show that in the mean-field approximation the association does not change the bulk dielectric
permittivity of the solution, but increases the solvation radius of the point-like charge, relative
to the theory of non-associating dipolar particles.
