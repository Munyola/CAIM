Steady structures originating from dynamic self-assembly have begun to show their advantages
in new generation materials, and pose challenges to equilibrium self-assembly. In view of the important
role of confinement in self-assembly, here, we propose a new type of confinement leading to dynamic
steady structures, which opens a new window for the conventional confinement. In our model, we consider
the self-assembly of ellipsoids in 2D circular confinement via the boundary performing periodically
stretching and contracting oscillation. Langevin dynamics simulations reveal the achievement
of non-equilibrium steady structures under appropriate boundary motions, which are novel smectic
structures with stable topological defects. Different from the confinement with a static boundary,
ellipsoids close to the boundary have variable orientations depending on the boundary motion.
Order-order structural transitions, accompanied by the symmetry change and varied defect number,
occur with the change of oscillating amplitude and/or frequency of the boundary. Slow and fast dynamics
are distinguished according to whether structural rearrangements and energetic adjustment happen
or not. The collective motion of confined ellipsoids, aroused by the work performed on the system,
is the key factor determining both the structure and dynamics of the self-assembly. Our results
not only achieve novel textures of circular confined liquid crystals, but also inspire us to reconsider
the self-assembly within the living organisms.
