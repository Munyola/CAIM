Topological semimetals feature a diversity of nodal manifolds including nodal points, various
nodal lines and surfaces, and recently novel quantum states in non-Hermitian systems have been
arousing widespread research interests. In contrast to Hermitian systems whose bulk nodal points
must form closed manifolds, it is fascinating to find that for non-Hermitian systems exotic nodal
manifolds can be bounded by exceptional points in the bulk band structure. Such exceptional points,
at which energy bands coalesce with band conservation violated, are iconic for non-Hermitian systems.
In this work, we show that a variety of nodal lines and drumheads with exceptional boundary can be
realized on 2D and 3D honeycomb lattices through natural and physically feasible non-Hermitian
processes. The bulk nodal Fermi-arc and drumhead states, although is analogous to, but should be
essentially distinguished from the surface counterpart of Weyl and nodal-line semimetals, respectively,
for which surface nodal-manifold bands eventually sink into bulk bands. Then we rigorously examine
the bulk-boundary correspondence of these exotic states with open boundary condition, and find
that these exotic bulk states are thereby undermined, showing the essential importance of periodic
boundary condition for the existence of these exotic states. As periodic boundary condition is
non-realistic for real materials, we furthermore propose a practically feasible electrical-circuit
simulation, with non-Hermitian devices implemented by ordinary operational amplifiers, to emulate
these extraordinary states.
