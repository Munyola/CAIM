The emerging diffusive dynamics in many complex systems shows a characteristic crossover behaviour
from anomalous to normal diffusion which is otherwise fitted by two independent power-laws. A prominent
example for a subdiffusive-diffusive crossover are viscoelastic systems such as lipid bilayer
membranes, while superdiffusive-diffusive crossovers occur in systems of actively moving biological
cells. We here consider the general dynamics of a stochastic particle driven by so-called tempered
fractional Gaussian noise, that is noise with Gaussian amplitude and power-law correlations,
which are cut off at some mesoscopic time scale. Concretely we consider such noise with built-in
exponential or power-law tempering, driving an overdamped Langevin equation (fractional Brownian
motion) and fractional Langevin equation motion. We derive explicit expressions for the mean squared
displacement and correlation functions, including different shapes of the crossover behaviour
depending on the concrete tempering, and discuss the physical meaning of the tempering. In the case
of power-law tempering we also find a crossover behaviour from faster to slower superdiffusion
and slower to faster subdiffusion. As a direct application of our model we demonstrate that the obtained
dynamics quantitatively described the subdiffusion-diffusion and subdiffusion-subdiffusion
crossover in lipid bilayer systems. We also show that a model of tempered fractional Brownian motion
recently proposed by Sabzikar and Meerschaert leads to physically very different behaviour with
a seemingly paradoxical ballistic long time scaling.
