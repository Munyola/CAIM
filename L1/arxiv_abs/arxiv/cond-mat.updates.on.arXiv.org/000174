Magnetic molecules possess a high potential as building blocks for the design of spintronic devices.
Moreover, the use of molecular materials opens the way for the controlled use of bottom-up, e.g.
supramolecular, processing techniques combining massively parallel self-fabrication with
conventional top-down nanostructuring techniques. The development of solid state spintronic
devices based on the giant magnetoresistance (GMR), tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR), and spin
valve effects has revolutionized the field of magnetic memory applications. Recently, organic
semiconductors were inserted into nanometer sized tunnel junctions allowing enhancement of spin
reversal, giant magneto-resistance behaviour was observed in single non-magnetic molecules
coupled to magnetic electrodes, and the use of the quantum tunnelling properties of single-molecule
magnets (SMMs) in hybrid devices was proposed. Herein, we present an original device in which a non-magnetic
molecular quantum dot, made of a single-wall carbon nanotube (SWCNT) contacted with non-magnetic
electrodes, is laterally coupled via supramolecular interactions to a TbPc2-SMM (Pc = phthalocyanine),
which provides a localized magnetic moment. The conductance through the SWCNT is modulated by sweeping
the magnetic field, exhibiting magnetoresistance ratios up to 300% between fully polarized and
non-polarized SMMs below 1 K. We thus demonstrate the functionality of a supramolecular spin valve
without magnetic leads. Our results open up prospects of circuit-integration and implementation
of new device capabilities.
