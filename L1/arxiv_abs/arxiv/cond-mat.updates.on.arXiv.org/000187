It has long been thought that superconductivity breaks down even at zero temperature in lower-dimensional
systems due to enhanced topological quantum phase fluctuations. In quasi-1D wires, these fluctuations
are described in terms of "quantum phase-slip" (QPS): tunneling of the superconducting order parameter
for the wire between states differing by $\pm2\pi$ in their relative phase between the wire's ends.
Many deviations from conventional bulk superconducting behavior have been observed in ultra-narrow
superconducting nanowires over the last several decades which have been identified with QPS, and
at least some of the observations are consistent with existing theories. However, other observations
in many cases point to contradictory conclusions or cannot be explained by these theories, such
that a unified understanding of the nature of quantum phase slip and its relationship to the various
observations has yet to be achieved. In this paper we present a new model for QPS which takes as its
starting point an idea originally postulated by Mooij and Nazarov [Nature Physics {\bf 2}, 169 (2006)]:
that \textit{flux-charge duality}, a classical symmetry of Maxwell's equations, can be used to
relate QPS to the well-known effect of Josephson tunneling of Cooper pairs. Our model provides an
alternative, and qualitatively different, conceptual basis for QPS and the phenomena which arise
from it in experiments, and it appears to permit for the first time a unified understanding of observations
across several different types of experiments and materials systems.
