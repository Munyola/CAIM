The main scientific activity in the field of topological insulators (TIs) consists of determining
their electronic structure by means of magneto-transport and electron spectroscopy with a view
to devices based on topological transport. There is however a caveat in this approach. There are
systematic experimental discrepancies on the electronic structure of the most pristine surfaces
of TI single crystals as determined by Shubnikov de Haas (SdH) oscillations and by Angle Resolved
PhotoElectron Spectroscopy (ARPES). We identify intense ultraviolet illumination -that is inherent
to an ARPES experiment- as the source for these experimental differences. We explicitly show that
illumination is the key parameter, or in other words the trigger, for energetic shifts of electronic
bands near the surface of a TI crystal. This finding revisits the common belief that surface decoration
is the principal cause of surface band bending and explains why band bending is not a prime issue in
the illumination-free magneto-transport studies. Our study further clarifies the role of illumination
on the electronic band structure of TIs by revealing its dual effect: downward band bending on very
small timescales followed by band flattening at large timescales. Our results therefore allow
us to present and predict the complete evolution of the band structure of TIs in a typical ARPES experiment.
By virtue of our findings, we pinpoint two alternatives of how to approach flat band conditions by
means of photon-based techniques and we suggest a microscopic mechanism that can explain the underlying
phenomena.
