It was discovered a few years ago that many networks in the real world exhibit self-similarity. A
lot of researches on the structures and processes on real and artificial fractal complex networks
have been done, drawing an analogy to critical phenomena. However, the non-Markovian dynamics
on fractal networks has not been understood well yet. We here study the self-avoiding walk on complex
fractal networks through the mapping of the self-avoiding walk to the n-vector model by a generating
function formalism. First, we analytically calculate the critical exponent {\nu} and the effective
coordination number (the connective constant) by a renormalization-group analysis in various
fractal dimensions. We find that the exponent {\nu} is equal to the exponent of displacement, which
describes the speed of diffusion in terms of the shortest distance. Second, by obtaining an exact
solution, we present an example which supports the well-known conjecture that the universality
class of the self-avoiding walk is not determined only by a fractal dimension. Our finding suggests
that the scaling theory of polymers can be applied to graphs which lack the Euclidian distance as
well. Furthermore, the self-avoiding walk has been exactly solved only on a few lattices embedded
in the Euclidian space, but we show that consideration on general graphs can simplify analytic calculations
and leads to a better understanding of critical phenomena. The scaling theory of the self-avoiding
path will shed light on the relationship between path numeration problems in graph theory and statistical
nature of paths.
