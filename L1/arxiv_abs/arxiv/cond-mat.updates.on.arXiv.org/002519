Recent atomic force microscopy (AFM) experiments~[ACS Nano {\bf 2014}, 8, 12410-12417] conducted
on graphene-coated SiO$_2$ demonstrated that monolayer graphene (G) can effectively screen dispersion
van der Waals (vdW) interactions deriving from the underlying substrate: despite the single-atom
thickness of G, the AFM tip was almost insensitive to SiO$_2$, and the tip-substrate attraction
was essentially determined only by G. This G vdW {\it opacity} has far reaching implications, encompassing
stabilization of multilayer heterostructures, micromechanical phenomena or even heterogeneous
catalysis. Yet, detailed experimental control and high-end applications of this phenomenon await
sound physical understanding of the underlying physical mechanism. By quantum many-body analysis
and ab-initio Density Functional Theory, here we address this challenge providing theoretical
rationalization of the observed G vdW {\it opacity} for weakly interacting substrates. The non-local
density response and ultra slow decay of the G vdW interaction ensure compensation between standard
attractive terms and many-body repulsive contributions, enabling vdW {\it opacity} over a broad
range of adsorption distances. vdW {\it opacity} appears most efficient in the low frequency limit
and extends beyond London dispersion including electrostatic Debye forces. By virtue of combined
theoretical/experimental validation, G hence emerges as a promising ultrathin {\it shield} for
modulation and switching of vdW interactions at interfaces and complex nanoscale devices.
