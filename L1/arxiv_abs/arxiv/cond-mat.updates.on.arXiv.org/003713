Studying surfaces with nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is challenging because of its low sensitivity,
but can reveal the atomic environments of both crystalline and amorphous materials. Dynamic nuclear
polarization (DNP) can be used to enhance the NMR signal, and overcome this limitation. However,
the standard practice for DNP involves wetting of the surface of the particles using exogenous radicals
dissolved in a solvent, which can alter the surface. An alternative to this method is using endogenous
unpaired electrons such as defects that are intrinsic to the microparticles, or metals as a source
of enhancement, thus leaving the surface intact and unaltered. Here, we study the surface of silicon
microparticles by detecting $^{1}$H nuclei on their surface. We take advantage of defect unpaired
electrons close to the surface of the particles to enhance the surface $^{1}$H nuclei as a first step
towards improving endogenous surface-DNP methods. This study involves both static liquid Helium
$^{1}$H-DNP at 3.3 T using a homebuilt DNP spectrometer and $^{1}$H-$^{29}$Si-DNP using a commercial
Bruker DNP-MAS spectrometer at 14.2 T and at 100 K. At 3.3 T and 4 K, we identify two resonance peaks
corresponding to two different proton environments, one of which is much more labile than the other.
A single resonance is detected in the high field case. At both fields, the $^{1}$H nuclei are enhanced
by a factor of 10-50 without the need for added radicals in solvent. We also explore the use of MW frequency
modulation during the static DNP experiments to selectively enhance only one $^{1}$H peak.
