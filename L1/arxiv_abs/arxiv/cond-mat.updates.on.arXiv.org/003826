Effect of the temperature and magnetic field induced martensitic transformation (MT) on the electronic
structure and some physical properties of bulk Fe$_{45.2}$Mn$_{25.9}$Ga$_{28.9}$ Heusler alloy
has been investigated. {According to the experimental results of DSC, magnetic and transport measurements
direct and reverse martensitic transformation without external magnetic field takes place within
194 $\leq T \leq$ 328 K temperature range with a hysteresis up to $\Delta T \approx$ 100 K defined as
$\Delta T$ = $A_{f,s}$ - $M_{s,f}$, where $A_{f,s}$ and $M_{s,f}$ are the critical temperatures
of direct and reverse martensitic transformation. External magnetic field of $\mu_{0}H$ = 5 T causes
a high-temperature shift of MT temperatures.} MT from parent austenite L2$_{1}$ phase to martensitic
tetragonally distorted L2$_{1}$ one (i. e. to L1$_{0}$) causes significant changes in the electronic
structure of alloy, a drastic increase in alloy magnetization, a decrease in the alloy resistivity,
and a reversal of the sign of the temperature coefficient of resistivity from negative to positive.
At the same time experimentally determined optical properties of Fe$_{45.6}$Mn$_{25.9}$Ga$_{28.9}$
Heusler alloy in austenitic and martensitic states look visually rather similar being noticeable
different in microscopic nature as can be concluded from first-principle calculations. Experimentally
observed changes in the physical properties of the alloy are discussed in terms of the electronic
structures of an austenite and martensite phases.
