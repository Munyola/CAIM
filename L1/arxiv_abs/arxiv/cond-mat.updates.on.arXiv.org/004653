Amorphous oxide semiconductors, especially indium oxide-based (InOx) thin-films, have been
major candidates for high mobility with easy-to-use device processability. As one of the dopants
in InOx semiconductors, we proposed Si to design a thin-film transistor (TFT) channel. Because
the suppression of unstable oxygen vacancies in InOx is crucial to maintaining the semiconducting
behavior, Si was selected as a strong oxygen binder that is reasonably available for large production.
In this review, we focus on the overall properties observed in Si-incorporated amorphous InOx TFTs
in terms of bond-dissociation energy, Gibbs free energy, Si-concentration dependence of TFT properties,
carrier transport mechanism, and bias stress instability. In comparing low and high doping densities,
we found that the activation energy and density of states decreased at a high Si concentration in
InOx TFTs, implying that the trap density was reduced. As a result, stable operation under bias stresses
could be realized. Furthermore, the inverse Meyer-Neldel rule was observed in the highly Si-doped
InOx TFT, indicating reasonable ohmic contact. Based on our fundamental knowledge of the Si-doped
InOx film, we developed a high-mobility bilayer TFT with a homogeneous stacked channel that was
different from a TFT with an etch stop layer structure. The TFT showed remarkably stable operation.
With simple element components based on InOx, it is possible to systematically discuss vacancy
engineering in terms of conduction properties.
