Superconducting field-effect transitor (SuFET) and Josephson field-effect transistor (JoFET)
technologies take advantage of electric field induced control of charge carrier concentration
in order to modulate the channel superconducting properties. Despite field-effect is believed
to be unaffective for superconducting metals, recent experiments showed electric field dependent
modulation of the critical current (IC) in a fully metallic transistor. Yet, the grounding mechanism
of this phenomenon is not completely understood. Here, we show the experimental realization of
Ti-based Dayem bridge field-effect transistors (DB-FETs) able to control IC of the superconducting
channel. Our easy fabrication process DB-FETs show symmetric full suppression of IC for an applied
critical gate voltage as low as VCG~+-8V at temperatures reaching about the 85% of the record critical
temperature TC~550mK for titanium. The gate-independent TC and normal state resistance (RN) coupled
with the increase of resistance in the supercoducting state (RS) for gate voltages close to the critical
value (VCG) suggest the creation of field-effect induced metallic puddles in the superconducting
sea. Our devices show extremely high values of transconductance (gMAXm~15uA/V at VG~+-6.5V) and
variations of Josephson kinetic inductance (LK) with VG of two orders of magnitude. Therefore,
the DB-FET appears as an ideal candidate for the realization of superconducting electronics, superconducting
qubits, tunable interferometers as well as photon detectors.
