The slow decay of charge carriers in polymer-fullerene blends measured in transient studies has
raised a number of questions about the mechanisms of nongeminate recombination in these systems.
In an attempt to understand this behavior, we have applied a combination of steady-state and transient
photoinduced absorption measurements to compare nongeminate recombination behavior in films
of neat poly(3-hexyl thiophene) (P3HT) and P3HT blended with [6,6]-phenyl-C61 butyric acid methyl
ester (PCBM). Transient measurements show that carrier recombination in the neat P3HT film exhibits
second-order decay with a recombination rate coefficient that is similar to that predicted by Langevin
theory. In addition, temperature dependent measurements indicate that neat films exhibit recombination
behavior consistent with the Gaussian disorder model. In contrast, the P3HT:PCBM blend films are
characterized by a strongly reduced recombination rate and an apparent recombination order greater
than two. We then assess a number of previously proposed explanations for this behavior, including
phase separation, carrier concentration dependent mobility, non-encounter limited recombination,
and interfacial states. In the end, we propose a model in which pure domains with a Gaussian density
of states are separated by a mixed phase with an exponential density of states. We find that such a
model can explain both the reduced magnitude of the recombination rate and the high order recombination
kinetics and, based on the current state of knowledge, is the most consistent with experimental
observations.
