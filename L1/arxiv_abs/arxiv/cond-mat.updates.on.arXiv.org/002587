Crystalline GeSb2Te4 (GST) is remarkable material, as it allows to continuously tune the electrical
resistance by orders of magnitude without involving a phase transition or stoichiometric changes,
just by altering the short-range order. While well-ordered specimen are metallic, increasing
amounts of disorder can eventually lead to an insulating state with vanishing conductivity in the
0K limit, but a similar number of charge carriers. These observations make disordered GST one of
the most promising candidates for the realization of a true Anderson insulator. While so far the
low-temperature properties have mostly been studied in films of small grain size, here a sputter-deposition
process is employed that enables preparation of a large variety of these GST states including metallic
and truly insulating ones. By growing films of GST on mica substrates, biaxially textured samples
with huge grain sizes are obtained. A series of these samples is employed for transport measurements,
as their electron mean free path can be altered by a factor of 20. Yet, the mean free path always remains
more than an order of magnitude smaller than the lateral grain size. This proves unequivocally that
grain boundaries play a negligible role for electron scattering, while intragrain scattering,
presumably by disordered vacancies, dominates. Most importantly, these findings underline that
the Anderson insulating state as well as the system's evolution towards metallic conductivity
are indeed intrinsic properties of the material.
