The properties of sputtered and scattered ions are studied for ion beam sputtering of Si by bombardment
with noble gas ions. The energy distributions in dependence on ion beam parameters (ion energy:
0.5 - 1 keV; ion species: Ne, Ar, Xe) and geometrical parameters (ion incidence angle, polar emission
angle, scattering angle) are measured by means of energy-selective mass spectrometry. The presence
of anisotropic effects due to direct sputtering and scattering is discussed and correlated with
process parameters. The experimental results are compared to calculations based on a simple elastic
binary collision model and to simulations using the Monte-Carlo code SDTrimSP. The influence of
the contribution of implanted primary ions on energy distributions of sputtered and scattered
particles is studied in simulations. It is found that a 10\% variation of the target composition
leads to detectable but small differences in the energy distributions of scattered ions. Comparison
with previously reported data for other ion/target configurations confirms the presence of similar
trends and anisotropic effects: the number of high-energy sputtered ions increases with increasing
energy of incident ions and decreasing scattering angle. The effect of the ion/target mass ratio
is additionally investigated. Small differences are observed with the change of the primary ion
species: the closer the mass ratio to unity, the higher the average energy of sputtered ions. The
presence of peaks, assigned to different mechanisms of direct scattering, strongly depends on
the ion/target mass ratio.
