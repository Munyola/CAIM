The observation of quantum oscillations in topological Kondo insulators SmB6 and YbB12 is a recent
puzzling experimental discovery. Quantum oscillations observed in the resistivity and the magnetization
are usually explained by the existence of the Fermi surface. However, Kondo insulators do not have
a Fermi surface and thus should not show quantum oscillations. By performing dynamical mean-field
calculations for topologically nontrivial Kondo insulators in a magnetic field, we analyze the
effect of correlations on the emergence of quantum oscillations in narrow-gap topological Kondo
insulators and demonstrate that the interplay between correlations and nonlocal hybridization,
ubiquitously occurring in topological Kondo insulators, can lead to observable quantum oscillations
without the necessity of a Fermi surface. Particularly, we show that correlations make it easier
to observe quantum oscillations in the magnetization and the resistivity of the bulk material.
The fundamental mechanism for these quantum oscillations is a combination of correlation effects
and Landau levels coming very close to the Fermi energy. We furthermore demonstrate that quantum
oscillations in a three-dimensional system can be understood by analyzing the physics on the two-dimensional
planes in the momentum space for which the hybridization in direction of the magnetic field vanishes.
We believe that this scenario is relevant to understanding the observation of quantum oscillations
in the magnetic torque for SmB6 as well as oscillations in the resistivity and the magnetic torque
of YbB12.
