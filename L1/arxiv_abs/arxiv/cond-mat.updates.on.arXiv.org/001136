In recent years it was shown both theoretically and experimentally that in certain systems exhibiting
anomalous diffusion the time and ensemble average mean squared displacement are remarkably different.
The ensemble average diffusivity is obtained from a scaling Green-Kubo relation, which connects
the scale invariant non-stationary velocity correlation function with the transport coefficient.
Here we obtain the relation between time averaged diffusivity, usually recorded in single particle
tracking experiments, and the underlying scale invariant velocity correlation function. The
time averaged mean squared displacement is given by $\overline{\delta^2} \sim 2 D_\nu t^{\beta}\Delta^{\nu-\beta}$
where $t$ is the total measurement time and $\Delta$ the lag time. Here $\nu>1$ is the anomalous diffusion
exponent obtained from ensemble averaged measurements $\langle x^2 \rangle \sim t^\nu$ while
$\beta\ge -1$ marks the growth or decline of the kinetic energy $\langle v^2 \rangle \sim t^\beta$.
Thus we establish a connection between exponents which can be read off the asymptotic properties
of the velocity correlation function and similarly for the transport constant $D_\nu$. We demonstrate
our results with non-stationary scale invariant stochastic and deterministic models, thereby
highlighting that systems with equivalent behavior in the ensemble average can differ strongly
in their time average. This is the case, for example, if averaged kinetic energy is finite, i.e. $\beta=0$,
where $\langle \overline{\delta^2}\rangle \neq \langle x^2\rangle$.
