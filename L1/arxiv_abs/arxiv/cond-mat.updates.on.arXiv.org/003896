The advent of atomically-thin materials has ushered new platforms for studying condensed-matter
physics in two-dimensions. Recently, there has been a strong thrust towards isolating graphene-like
material with interactions between the carriers making possible correlated states at low temperatures.
Here an investigation of the superconducting to normal state transition in NbSe$_2$ is detailed,
and it is found it is driven by a localized slip in the phase of the superconducting order parameter.
These phase slips produce dynamically-created Josephson junctions, which enable the elucidation
of two novel properties of the superconducting state in NbSe$_2$. The first is a coupling of the Josephson
current and the collective motion of the charge-density wave, resulting in a modification of the
Shapiro step diagram observed under the application of microwave radiation. The second is a Josephson
effect that possesses a modified shape and step height seen in its dependence on the applied RF radiation
power. This effect -- unlike any known Josephson behavior -- exhibits an insensitivity to magnetic
fields. We discuss possible origins of the latter effect, suggesting it lies in the multiband nature
of superconductivity in NbSe$_2$. Each result expands the knowledge of the superconducting state
of NbSe$_2$, sheds light on the nature of materials in which superconductivity both competes with
other collective phenomena and is multiband in nature. Further, this work opens new paradigms for
electronics and quantum computation applications in transition metal dichalcogenides.
