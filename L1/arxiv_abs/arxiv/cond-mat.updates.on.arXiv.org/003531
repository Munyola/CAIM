Moir\'e superlattices provide a powerful tool to engineer novel quantum phenomena in two-dimensional
(2D) heterostructures, where the interactions between the atomically thin layers qualitatively
change the electronic band structure of the superlattice. For example, mini-Dirac points, tunable
Mott insulator states, and the Hofstadter butterfly can emerge in different types of graphene/boron
nitride moir\'e superlattices, while correlated insulating states and superconductivity have
been reported in twisted bilayer graphene moir\'e superlattices. In addition to their dramatic
effects on the single particle states, moir\'e superlattices were recently predicted to host novel
excited states, such as moir\'e exciton bands. Here we report the first observation of moir\'e superlattice
exciton states in nearly aligned WSe2/WS2 heterostructures. These moir\'e exciton states manifest
as multiple emergent peaks around the original WSe2 A exciton resonance in the absorption spectra,
and they exhibit gate dependences that are distinctly different from that of the A exciton in WSe2
monolayers and in large-twist-angle WSe2/WS2 heterostructures. The observed phenomena can be
described by a theoretical model where the periodic moir\'e potential is much stronger than the
exciton kinetic energy and creates multiple flat exciton minibands. The moir\'e exciton bands
provide an attractive platform to explore and control novel excited state of matter, such as topological
excitons and a correlated exciton Hubbard model, in transition metal dichalcogenides.
