Low Energy Ion Scattering (LEIS) was employed to study the surface composition of thin films of Ru
on B, C and B4C films at different stages of growth. Effects of surface segregation of C were observed.
Previously unknown matrix effects were observed in these samples, expressed in the decrease of
LEIS signals of Ru, B and C at low Ru concentrations. The effect disappears for Ru-rich surfaces.
Measurements with different He+ ion energies prove that the characteristic velocities of the elements
involved change with surface composition. We suggest that these matrix effects appear due to the
changes in neutralization efficiency in quasiresonant neutralization from the valence band (VB-qRN).
This neutralization channel is present in elemental C and B due to a wide valence band with energy
states as low as -20 eV, which are in a (quasi-)resonance with the He 1s level. This mechanism was earlier
reported for graphitic carbon. We suggest that it can be applied to a much wider range of materials,
leading to potential matrix effects in LEIS from a variety of surfaces, containing B, C and potentially
O and N atoms, e.g. borides, carbides, oxides and nitrides, as well as alloys with B and C. This hypothesis
is supported by additional LEIS measurements on oxidized Ru which show matrix effect in Ru-O LEIS
signals as well. We argue that it is possible to avoid the matrix effects from compounded surfaces
within certain ranges of composition by a proper choice of reference samples, while for other compositions
knowledge of characteristic velocities is required for reliable quantification.
