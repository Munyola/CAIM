Necking instabilities, in which tensile (extensional) deformation localizes into a small spatial
region, are generic failure modes in elasto-viscoplastic materials. Materials in this very broad
class --- including amorphous, crystalline, polycrystalline and other materials --- feature
a predominantly elastic response at small stresses, plasticity onset at a rather well-defined
yield stress and rate-dependence. Necking instabilities involve a unique coupling between the
system's geometry and its constitutive behavior. We consider generic elasto-viscoplastic constitutive
relations involving an internal-state field, which represents the structural evolution of the
material during plastic deformation, and study necking in the long-wavelength approximation
(sometimes termed the lubrication or slender-bar approximation). We derive a general expression
for the largest time-dependent eigenvalue in an approximate WKB-like linear stability analysis,
highlighting various basic physical effects involved in necking. This expression is then used
to propose criteria for the onset of necking and more importantly for the emergence of strong localization.
Applications to strain-softening amorphous plasticity, in the framework of the Shear-Transformation-Zone
model, and to strain-hardening crystalline/polycrystalline plasticity, in the framework of
the Kocks-Mecking model, are presented. These quantitative analyses of widely different material
models support the theoretical predictions, most notably for the strong localization during necking.
