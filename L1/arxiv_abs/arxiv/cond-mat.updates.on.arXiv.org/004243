With a perspective of systematic investigating of compositional, structural, topological, electronic
and optical properties of solgel derived NixCd1-xO (x= 0, 0.02, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, 1) thin
films, thorough scrutiny has been accomplished.The exceptional compositional dependence of
transmittance spectra and optical gap value of such alloy may be corroborated to the band gap renormalization
effect incorporating the effect of local strain, electron-electron and electron-ionized impurity
interaction. Raman spectroscopy reveals a stronger phonon scattering stem via optical phonon
deformation potential, charged impurity scattering and also phonon stiffening of 477 cm-1 LO mode.
The appearance of eg and t2g sub-band peaks at higher Ni doping as confirmed by X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy
(XAS) is mainly associated to the anti-crossing interaction and crystal field splitting. X-ray
Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) evidences the increasing prominence of satellite features
with increasing density of shake-up states which justify the eg and t2g sub-band splitting also.
These manifest the gradual reduction of orbital hybridization with Ni doping which in turn lead
to decreases the band edge effective mass of electron and subsequently influence the band gap renormalization.
Molecular dynamics simulation reflects 13% reduction in lattice parameter for NiO thin film compared
to undoped one and projected density of states calculation further validates the experimental
observation of reduced orbital hybridization with increasing doping percentage.
