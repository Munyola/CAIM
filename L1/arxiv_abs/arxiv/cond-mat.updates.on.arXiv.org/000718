We report on a further investigation of a new method that can be used to address vibrational dynamics
and propagation of stress waves in liquids. The method is based on the decomposition of the macroscopic
Green-Kubo stress correlation function into the atomic level stress correlation functions. This
decomposition, as was demonstrated previously for a model liquid studied in molecular dynamics
simulations, reveals the presence of stress waves propagating over large distances and a structure
that resembles the pair density function. In this paper, by performing the Fourier transforms of
the atomic level stress correlation functions, we elucidate how the lifetimes of the stress waves
and the ranges of their propagation depend on their frequency, wavevector, and temperature. These
results relate frequency and wavevector dependence of the generalized viscosity to the character
of propagation of the shear stress waves. In particular, the results suggest that an increase in
the value of the frequency dependent viscosity at low frequencies with decrease of temperature
is related to the increase in the ranges of propagation of the stress waves of the corresponding low
frequencies. We found that the ranges of propagation of the shear stress waves of frequencies less
than half of the Einstein frequency, extend well beyond the nearest neighbor shell even above the
melting temperature. The results also show that the crossover from quasilocalized to propagating
behavior occurs at frequencies usually associated with the Boson peak.
