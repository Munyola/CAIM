Access resistance indicates how well current carriers from the bulk medium can converge to a pore
or opening, and is important in many fields, such as cell biology, electronics, electrochemical
engineering, thermal transport, among others. In simplified scenarios, it depends only on the
resistivity and pore radius when the bulk dimensions are infinite in all directions. These conditions
are often not valid in simulations of transport due to the computational cost of large simulation
cells, and can even break down in micro- and nano-scale systems due to strong confinement. Here,
we examine a scaling theory for the access resistance that predicts there should be a special simulation
cell aspect ratio -- the golden aspect ratio -- where finite size effects are eliminated. We demonstrate
that this golden aspect ratio exists and that it takes on a universal value in linear response and
moderate concentrations, i.e., regimes of interest to transport through biological ion channels
and nanopores. Outside of linear response, it gains an apparent dependence on characteristics
of the transport scenario (concentration, voltages, etc.) for small simulation cells, but this
dependence vanishes at larger length scales. These results will enable the use of all-atom molecular
dynamics to study contextual properties of access resistance -- i.e., its dependence on protein
and molecular-scale fluctuations, the presence of charges, etc. -- and yield the opportunity to
quantitatively compare computed and measured resistances.
