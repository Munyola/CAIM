Ferroelectric tunnel junctions, in which ferroelectric polarization and quantum tunneling are
closely coupled to induce the tunneling electroresistance (TER) effect, have attracted considerable
interest due to their potential in non-volatile and low-power consumption memory devices. The
ferroelectric size effect, however, has hindered ferroelectric tunnel junctions from exhibiting
robust TER effect. Here, our study proposes doping engineering in a two-dimensional in-plane ferroelectric
semiconductor as an effective strategy to design a two-dimensional ferroelectric tunnel junction
composed of homostructural $p$-type semiconductor/ferroelectric/$n$-type semiconductor.
Since the in-plane polarization persists in the monolayer ferroelectric barrier, the vertical
thickness of two-dimensional ferroelectric tunnel junction can be as thin as monolayer. We show
that the monolayer In:SnSe/SnSe/Sb:SnSe junction provides an embodiment of this strategy. Combining
density functional theory calculations with non-equilibrium Green's function formalism, we
investigate the electron transport properties of In:SnSe/SnSe/Sb:SnSe and reveal a giant TER
effect of 1460$\%$. The dynamical modulation of both barrier width and barrier height during the
ferroelectric switching are responsible for this giant TER effect. These findings provide an important
insight towards the understanding of the quantum behaviors of electrons in materials at the two-dimensional
limit, and enable new possibilities for next-generation non-volatile memory devices based on
flexible two-dimensional lateral ferroelectric tunnel junctions.
