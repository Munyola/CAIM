We present the results of $^{75}$As nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), nuclear quadrupole resonance
(NQR), and resistivity measurements in KFe$_2$As$_2$ under pressure ($p$). The temperature dependence
of the NMR shift, nuclear spin-lattice relaxation time ($T_1$) and resistivity show a crossover
between a high-temperature incoherent, local-moment behavior and a low-temperature coherent
behavior at a crossover temperature ($T^*$). $T^*$ is found to increase monotonically with pressure,
consistent with increasing hybridization between localized $3d$ orbital-derived bands with
the itinerant electron bands. No anomaly in $T^*$ is seen at the critical pressure $p_{\rm c}=1.8$
GPa where a change of slope of the superconducting (SC) transition temperature $T_{\rm c}(p)$ has
been observed. In contrast, $T_{\rm c}(p)$ seems to correlate with antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations
in the normal state as measured by the NQR $1/T_1$ data, although such a correlation cannot be seen
in the replacement effects of A in the AFe$_2$As$_2$ (A= K, Rb, Cs) family. In the superconducting
state, two $T_1$ components are observed at low temperatures, suggesting the existence of two distinct
local electronic environments. The temperature dependence of the short $T_{\rm 1s}$ indicates
nearly gapless state below $T_{\rm c}$. On the other hand, the temperature dependence of the long
component 1/$T_{\rm 1L}$ implies a large reduction in the density of states at the Fermi level due
to the SC gap formation. These results suggest a real-space modulation of the local SC gap structure
in KFe$_2$As$_2$ under pressure.
