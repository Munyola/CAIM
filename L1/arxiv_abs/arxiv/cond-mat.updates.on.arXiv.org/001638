Piezoelectric crystals are widely used for acoustic wave resonators of different functioning
modes and types including BAW and SAW. It is well-known that only some special orientations of crystals
will exhibit desirable properties such as mode couplings, thermal sensitivity, acceleration
sensitivity, and others that are important in design and applications of resonators. With extensive
studies on physical properties in last decades and increasing industrial needs of novel products,
it is necessary to comb the known knowledge of quartz crystal material for novel orientations and
better products as agendas in the industry. With known material properties like elastic, piezoelectric,
dielectric, and thermal constants, we can establish the relationships between vibrations and
bias fields such as temperature to ensure a resonator immunizing from excessive response to changes
causing significant degradation of resonator properties and performances. Since the theoretical
framework of wave propagation in piezoelectric solids is known, we need to use the existing data
and results for the validation of current orientations in actual products. The agreement will give
us needed confidence of the theory and analytical procedures. Through rotations, we calculated
physical properties as functions of angles and bias fields, enabling the calculation of resonator
properties for the identification of optimal cuts. Such a procedure can also be applied to similar
crystals for a careful examination of possible orientations to maximize the potential use of materials
in acoustic wave resonators.
