We study several aspects of the realization of global symmetries in highly entangled phases of quantum
matter. Examples include gapped topological ordered phases, gapless quantum spin liquids and
non-fermi liquid phases. An insightful window into such phases is provided by recent developments
in the theory of short ranged entangled Symmetry Protected Topological (SPT) phases . First they
generate useful no-go constraints on how global symmetry may be implemented in a highly entangled
phase. Possible symmetry implementation in gapped topological phases and some proposed gapless
spin/bose liquids are examined in this light. We show that some previously proposed spin liquid
states for 2d quantum magnets do not in fact have consistent symmetry implementation unless they
occur as the surface of a 3d SPT phase. A second SPT-based insight into highly entangled states is
the development of a view point of such states as SPT phases of one of the emergent excitations. We
describe this in the specific context of time reversal symmetric 3d U(1) quantum spin liquids with
an emergent photon. Different such spin liquids are shown to be equivalent to different SPT insulating
phases of the emergent monopole excitation of such phases. The highly entangled states also in turn
enrich our understanding of SPT phases. We use the insights obtained from our results to provide
an explicit construction of bosonic SPT phases in 3d in a system of coupled layers. This includes
construction of a time reversal symmetric SPT state that is not currently part of the cohomology
classification of such states.
