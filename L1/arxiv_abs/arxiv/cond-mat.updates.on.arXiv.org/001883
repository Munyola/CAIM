Small molecules are often found to exhibit extraordinarily diverse biological activities. Metformin
is one of them. It is widely used as anti-diabetic drug for type-two diabetes. In addition to that,
metformin hydrochloride shows anti-tumour activities and increases the survival rate of patients
suffering from certain types of cancer namely colorectal, breast, pancreas and prostate cancer.
However, theoretical studies of structure and dynamics of metformin have not yet been fully explored.
In this work, we investigate the characteristic structural and dynamical features of three mono-protonated
forms of metformin hydrochloride with the help of experiments, quantum chemical calculations
and atomistic molecular dynamics simulations. We validate our force field by comparing simulation
results to that of the experimental findings. Nevertheless, we discover that the non-planar tautomeric
form is the most stable. Metformin forms strong hydrogen bonds with surrounding water molecules
and its solvation dynamics show unique features. Because of an extended positive charge distribution,
metformin possesses features of being a permanent cationic partner toward several targets. We
study its interaction and binding ability with DNA using UV spectroscopy, circular dichroism,
fluorimetry and metadynamics simulation. We find a non-intercalating mode of interaction. Metformin
feasibly forms a minor/major groove-bound state within a few tens of nanoseconds, preferably with
AT rich domains. A significant decrease in the free-energy of binding is observed when it binds to
a minor groove of DNA.
