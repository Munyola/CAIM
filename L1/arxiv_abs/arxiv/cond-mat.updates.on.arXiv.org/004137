The anomalous Nernst effect in nanostructured magnetic materials is a key phenomenon to optimally
control and employ the internal energy dissipated in electronic devices, being dependent on for
instance the magnetic anisotropy of the active element. Thereby, here we report a theoretical and
experimental investigation of the magnetic properties and anomalous Nernst effect in a flexible
magnetostrictive film with induced uniaxial magnetic anisotropy and under external stress. Specifically,
we calculate the magnetization behavior and the thermoelectric voltage response from a theoretical
approach for a planar geometry and with a magnetic free energy density which takes into account the
induced uniaxial and magnetoelastic anisotropy contributions. Experimentally, we verify modifications
of the effective magnetic anisotropy and thermoelectric voltage with the stress and explore the
possibility of tailoring the anomalous Nernst effect in a flexible magnetostrictive film by modifying
both, the magnetic field and external stress. We find quantitative agreement between experiment
and numerical calculations, thus elucidating the magnetic and thermoelectric voltage behaviors,
as well as providing evidence to confirm the validity of the theoretical approach to describe the
magnetic properties and anomalous Nernst effect in ferromagnetic magnetostrictive films having
uniaxial magnetic anisotropy and submitted to external stress. Hence, the results place flexible
magnetostrictive systems as a promising candidate for active elements in functionalized touch
electronic devices.
