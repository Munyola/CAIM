Quantum chemical density functional theory calculations have been employed to investigate the
solvation of Lithium cations in the mixed electrolytes ethylene carbonate propylene carbonate
and propylene carbonate dimethyl carbonate. The counter anion effects on the solvation of Li in
the pure propylene carbonate and dimethyl carbonate electrolytes were also studied. An analysis
based on the free energy changes associated to the transitions between different types of structures
indicated that a variety of clusters could possibly exist in the mixed solvents at liquid conditions.
It was also found that the addition of dimethyl carbonate causes a significant increase of the dipole
moment of the clusters, underlying its importance as a co-solvent in mixed cyclic-acyclic carbonate
electrolytes for Lithium ion batteries technology. In addition, the presence of an anion in the
first coordination shell of Li modifies the local intermolecular structure comprising four carbonate
solvent molecules around Li in dilute solutions, allowing only two carbonate solvent molecules
to coordinate to Li directly. The bidentate complexation of Li with the anion electron donor atoms,
however, maintains the local tetrahedral structure around it on an interatomic scale. The neutralization
of the solvation shell of Li due to a contact ion-pair formation, and the consequent implications
on solvent and salt effects on the underlying molecular scale mechanisms, provide a rational explanation
for the ionic conductivity drop of electrolyte solutions at high salt concentrations.
