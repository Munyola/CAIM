Colloids have a striking relevance in a wide spectrum of industrial formulations, spanning from
personal care products to protective paints. Their behaviour can be easily influenced by extremely
weak forces, which disturb their thermodynamic equilibrium and dramatically determine their
performance. Motivated by the impact of colloidal dispersions in fundamental science and formulation
engineering, we have designed an efficient Dynamic Monte Carlo (DMC) approach to mimic their out-of-equilibrium
dynamics. Our recent theory, which provided a rigorous method to reproduce the Brownian motion
of colloids by MC simulations, is here generalised to reproduce the Brownian motion of colloidal
particles during transitory unsteady states, when their thermodynamic equilibrium is significantly
modified. To this end, we investigate monodisperse and bidisperse rod-like particles in the isotropic
phase and apply an external field that forces their reorientation along a common direction and induces
an isotropic-to-nematic phase transition. We also study the behaviour of the system once the external
field is removed. Our simulations are in excellent quantitative agreement with Brownian Dynamics
simulations when the DMC results are rescaled with a time-dependent acceptance ratio, which depends
on the strength of the applied field. Further generalising our DMC algorithm to processes displaying
significant density fluctuations, such as nucleation and growth, where the MC acceptance ratio
is expected to depend on both time and space, is currently under investigation.
