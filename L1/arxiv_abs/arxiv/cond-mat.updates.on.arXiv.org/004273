We show that the continuum limit of the tilted Dirac cone in materials such as $8Pmmn$-borophene
and layered organic conductor $\alpha$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$I$_3$ deformation of the Minkowski spacetime
of Dirac materials. From its Killing vectors we construct an emergent tilted-Lorentz (t-Lorentz)
symmetry group for such systems. With t-Lorentz transformations we are able to obtain the exact
solution of the Landau bands for a crossed configuration of electric and magnetic fields. For any
given tilt parameter $0\le\zeta<1$ if the ratio $\chi=v_FB_z/cE_y$ of the crossed magnetic and
electric fields that satisfies $\chi\ge 1+\zeta$ one can always find appropriate t-boosts in both
valleys labeled by $\pm$ in such a way the electric field can be t-boosted away, whereby the resulting
pure effective magnetic field $B^\pm_z$ governs the Landau level spectrum around each valley.
The effective magnetic field in one of the valleys is always larger than the applied perpendicular
magnetic field. This amplification comes at the expense of of diminishing the effective field in
the opposite valleyand can be detected in various quantum oscillation phenomena in tilted Dirac
cone systems. Tuning the ratio of electric and magnetic fields to $\chi_{\rm min}=1+\zeta$ leads
to valley selective collapse of Landau levels. Our geometric description of the tilt in Dirac systems
reveals an important connection between the tilt and an incipient "rotating source" when the tilt
parameter can be made to depend on spacetime in certain way.
