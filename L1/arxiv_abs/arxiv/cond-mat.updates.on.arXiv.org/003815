We analyse the dewetting of printing plates for gravure printing with well-defined gravure cells.
The printing plates were mounted on a rotating horizontal cylinder that is half immersed in an aqueous
solution of the anionic surfactant sodium 1-decanesulfonate. The gravure plates and the presence
of surfactants serve as one example of a real-world dewetting situation. When rotating the cylinder,
a liquid meniscus was partially drawn out of the liquid forming a dynamic contact angle at the contact
line. The dynamic contact angle is decreased on a structured surface as compared to a smooth one.
This is due to contact line pinning at the borders of the gravure cells. Additionally, surfactants
tend to decrease the dynamic receding contact angle. We consider the interplay between these two
effects. We compare the height differences of the meniscus on the structured and unstructured area
as function of dewetting speeds. The height difference increases with increasing dewetting speed.
With increasing size of the gravure cells this height difference and the induced changes in the dynamic
contact angle increased. By adding surfactant, the height difference and the changes in the contact
angle for the same surface decreased. We further note that although the liquid dewets the printing
plates some liquid is always left in the gravure cell. At high enough surfactant concentrations
or high enough dewetting speed, the dynamic contact angles in the structured surface approach those
in flat surfaces. We conclude that surfactant reduces the influence of surface structure on dynamic
dewetting.
