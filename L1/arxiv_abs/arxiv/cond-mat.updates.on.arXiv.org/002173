Electronic transport through a material depends on the response to local perturbations induced
by defects or impurities in the material. The scattering processes can be described in terms of phase
shifts and corresponding cross sections. The multiorbital nature of the spinor states in transition
metal dichalcogenides would naturally suggest the consideration of a massive Dirac equation to
describe the problem, while the parabolic dispersion of its conduction and valence bands would
invite a simpler Schr\"odinger equation description. Here, we contrast the scattering of massive
Dirac particles and Schr\"odinger electrons, in order to assess different asymptotic regimes
(low and high Fermi energy) for each one of the electronic models and describe their regime of validity
or transition. At low energies, where the dispersion is approximately parabolic, the scattering
processes are dominated by low angular momentum channels, which results in nearly isotropic scattering
amplitudes. On the other hand, the differential cross section at high Fermi energies exhibits clear
signatures of the linear band dispersion, as the partial phase shifts approach a non-zero value.
We analyze the electronic dynamics by presenting differential cross sections for both attractive
and repulsive scattering centers. The dissimilar behavior between Dirac and Schr\"odinger carriers
points to the limits and conditions over which different descriptions are required for the reliable
treatment of scattering processes in these materials.
