Van der Waals heterostructures give access to a wide variety of new phenomena that emerge thanks
to the combination of properties brought in by the constituent layered materials. We show here that
owing to an enhanced interaction cross section with electrons in a type I van der Waals heterostructure,
made of single layer molybdenum disulphide and thin boron nitride films, electrons and holes created
in boron nitride can be transferred to the dichalcogenide where they form electron-hole pairs yielding
luminescence. This cathodoluminescence can be mapped with a spatial resolution far exceeding
what can be achieved in a typical photoluminescence experiment, and is highly valuable to understand
the optoelectronic properties at the nanometer scale. We find that in heterostructures prepared
following the mainstream dry transfer technique, cathodoluminescence is locally extinguished,
and we show that this extinction is associated with the formation of defects, that are detected in
Raman spectroscopy and photoluminescence. We establish that to avoid defect formation induced
by low-energy electron beams and to ensure efficient transfer of electrons and holes at the interface
between the layers, flat and uniform interlayer interfaces are needed, that are free of trapped
species, airborne ones or contaminants associated with sample preparation. We show that heterostructure
fabrication using a pick-up technique leads to superior, intimate interlayer contacts associated
with significantly more homogeneous cathodoluminescence.
