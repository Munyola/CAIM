Recent years have seen the development of several experimental systems capable of tuning local
parameters of quantum Hamiltonians. Examples include ultracold atoms, trapped ions, superconducting
circuits, and photonic crystals. By design, these systems possess negligible disorder, granting
them a high level of tunability. Conversely, electrons in conventional condensed matter systems
exist inside an imperfect host material, subjecting them to uncontrollable, random disorder,
which often destroys delicate correlated phases and precludes local tunability. The realization
of a condensed matter system that is disorder-free and locally-tunable thus remains an outstanding
challenge. Here, we demonstrate a new technique for deterministic creation of locally-tunable,
ultra-low-disorder electron systems in carbon nanotubes suspended over circuits of unprecedented
complexity. Using transport experiments we show that electrons can be localized at any position
along the nanotube and that the confinement potential can be smoothly moved from location to location.
Nearly perfect mirror symmetry of transport characteristics about the centre of the nanotube establishes
the negligible effects of electronic disorder, thus allowing experiments in precision engineered
one-dimensional potentials. We further demonstrate the ability to position multiple nanotubes
at chosen separations, generalizing these devices to coupled one-dimensional systems. These
new capabilities open the door to a broad spectrum of new experiments on electronics, mechanics,
and spins in one dimension.
