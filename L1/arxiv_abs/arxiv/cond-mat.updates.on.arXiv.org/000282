In the heavy fermion material, $\mathrm{URu_{2}Si_{2}}$ the identity of the order parameter in
an enigmatic phase, known as the hidden order (HO) phase, is not known despite a quarter of a century
of its existence. Buried deep inside this phase lies a much less explored unconventional superconducting
state that is of our central interest here. First, we identify a mixed singlet-triplet density wave
(st-DDW) to be the hidden order state. It has no net charge or spin modulations and does not break time
reversal symmetry (TRS). It does have topological order with quantized spin Hall effect. Thus,
it is naturally impervious to common experimental probes and is an excellent candidate for HO. We
then construct, including st-DDW, a global phase diagram in which there is a deconfined quantum
critical point, which is ultimately responsible for the basic mechanism of superconductivity.
We argue that the skyrmionic spin texture in st-DDW ultimately fractionalizes into fermonic merons
and anti-merons, which results in two copies of unconventional chiral d-wave BCS superconductors,
consistent with experiments. The superconducting state breaks TRS, which can be directly detected
by polar Kerr effect (PKE) measurements. in contrast HO, identified as st-DDW, should not exhibit
PKE except perhaps for magnetic impurities. Direct determination of st-DDW is also possible through
two-magnon Raman scattering, nuclear quadrupolar resonance, or the skyrmions themselves. In
a more general context, our work reflects the rich possibilities of emergent behavior in condensed
matter systems.
