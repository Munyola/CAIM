The interactions among neutral polymer polyacrylamide (PAM) and the biosurfactant Surfactin
and four betaines, N-dodecyl-N,N-dimethyl-3-ammonio-1-propanesulfonate (SDDAB), N-tetradecyl-N,N-dimethyl-3-ammonio-1-propanesulfonate
(STDAB), N-hexadecyl-N,N-dimethyl-3-ammonio-1-propanesulfonate (SHDAB), and N-dodecyl-N,N-dimethyl-2-ammonio-acetate
(C12BE), in phosphate buffer solution (PBS) have been studied by surface tension measurements,
small-angle neutron scattering (SANS), small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), and rheological
experiments. It has been confirmed that the length of alkyl chain is a key parameter of interaction
between betaines and PAM. Differences in scattering contrast between X-ray and neutrons for surfactants
and PAM molecules provide the opportunity to separately follow the changes of structure of PAM and
surfactant aggregates. At concentrations of betaines higher than CMC (critical micelle concentration)
and C2 (CMC of surfactant with the presence of polymer), spherical micelles are formed in betaines
and betaines/PAM solutions. Transition from spherical to rod-like aggregates (micelles) has
been observed in solutions of Surfactin and Surfactin/SDDAB ({\alpha}Surfactin = 0.67 (molar
fraction)) with addition of 0.8 wt % of PAM. The conformation change of PAM molecules only can be observed
for Surfactin/SDDAB/PAM system. Viscosity values follow the structural changes suggested from
scattering measurements i.e., gradually increases for mixtures PAM -> Surfactin/PAM -> Surfactin/SDDAB/PAM
in PBS.
