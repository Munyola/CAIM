We consider films and filaments of nanoscale thickness on thermally conductive substrates exposed
to external heating. Particular focus is on metal films exposed to laser irradiation. Due to short
length scales involved, the absorption of heat in the metal is directly coupled to the film evolution,
since the absorption length and the film thickness are comparable. Such a setup requires self-consistent
consideration of fluid mechanical and thermal effects. We approach the problem via Volume-of-Fluid
based simulations that include destabilizing liquid metal-solid substrate interaction potentials.
These simulations couple fluid dynamics directly with the spatio-temporal evolution of the temperature
field both in the fluid and in the substrate. We focus on the influence of the temperature variation
of material parameters, in particular of surface tension and viscosity. Regarding variation of
surface tension with temperature, the main finding is that while Marangoni effect may not play a
significant role in the considered setting, the temporal variation of surface tension (modifying
normal stress balance) is significant and could lead to complex evolution including oscillatory
evolution of the liquid metal-air interface. Temperature variation of film viscosity is also found
to be relevant. Therefore, the variations of surface tensions and viscosity could both influence
the emerging wavelengths in experiments. In contrast, the filament geometry is found to be much
less sensitive to a variation of material parameters with temperature.
