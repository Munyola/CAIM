A detailed account of the local atomic structure and disorder at 5~K across the phase diagram of the
high temperature superconductor K$_x$Fe$_{2-y}$Se$_{2-z}$S$_z$ $(0 \leq z \leq 2)$ is obtained
from neutron total scattering and associated atomic pair distribution function (PDF) approaches.
Various model independent and model dependent aspects of the analysis reveal a high level of structural
complexity on the nanometer length-scale. Evidence is found for considerable disorder in the $c$-axis
stacking of the FeSe$_{1-x}$S$_{x}$ slabs without observable signs of turbostratic character
of the disorder. In contrast to the related FeCh (Ch = S, Se) type superconductors, substantial Fe-vacancies
are present in K$_x$Fe$_{2-y}$Se$_{2-z}$S$_z$, deemed detrimental for superconductivity when
ordered. Our study suggests that the distribution of vacancies significantly modifies the iron-chalcogen
bond-length distribution, in agreement with observed evolution of the PDF signal. A crossover
like transition is observed at a composition of $z\approx1$, from a predominantly vacancy-disordered
state at the selenium end to a more vacancy-ordered (VO) phase closer to the sulfur end of the phase
diagram. The S-content dependent measures of the local structure are found to exhibit distinct
behavior on either side of this crossover, correlating well with the evolution of the superconducting
state to that of a magnetic semiconductor towards the $z\approx2$ end. The behavior reinforces
the idea of the intimate relationship of correlated Fe-vacancies order in the local structure and
the emergent electronic properties.
