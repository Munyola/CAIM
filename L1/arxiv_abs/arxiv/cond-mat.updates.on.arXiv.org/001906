The best-understood crystal ordering transition is that of two-dimensional freezing, which proceeds
by the rapid eradication of lattice defects as the temperature is lowered below a critical threshold.
But crystals that assemble on closed surfaces are required by topology to have a minimum number of
lattice defects, called disclinations, that act as conserved topological charges; consider the
12 pentagons on a soccer ball or the 12 pentamers in a viral capsid. Moreover, crystals assembled
on curved surfaces can spontaneously develop additional defects to alleviate the stress imposed
by the curvature. How then can we have crystallization on a sphere, the simplest curved surface where
it is impossible to eliminate these defects? Here we show that freezing on a sphere proceeds by the
formation of a single, encompassing "continent," which forces defects into 12 isolated "seas"
with the same icosahedral symmetry as soccer balls and viruses. We use this broken symmetry - aligning
the vertices of an icosahedron with the defect seas and unfolding the faces onto a plane - to construct
a new order parameter that reveals the underlying long-range orientational order of the lattice.
These results further our understanding of the thermodynamic and mechanical properties of naturally
occurring structures, such as viral capsids, lipid vesicles, and bacterial s-layers, and show
that the spontaneous sequestration and organization of defects can produce mechanical and dynamical
inhomogeneities in otherwise homogeneous materials.
