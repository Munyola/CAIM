The solution for the radial distribution of pressure, density, temperature and flow velocity fields
in a blast wave propagating through a medium at rest, following an intense explosion, starting from
hydrodynamic equations, is one of the classic problems in gas dynamics. However, there is very little
direct verification of the theory and its assumptions from simulations of microscopic models.
In this paper, we compare the results and assumptions of the hydrodynamic theory with results from
large scale event driven molecular dynamics simulations of a hard sphere gas in three dimensions.
We find that the predictions for the radial distribution of the thermodynamic quantities do not
match well with the numerical data. We improve the theory by replacing the ideal gas law with a more
realistic virial equation of state for the hard sphere gas. While this improves the theoretical
predictions, we show that they still fail to describe the data well. To understand the reasons for
this discrepancy, the different assumptions of the hydrodynamic theory are tested within the simulations.
A key assumption of the theory is the existence of a local equation of state. We validate this assumption
by showing that the local pressure, temperature and density obey the equation of state for a hard
sphere gas. However, the probability distribution of the velocity fluctuations has non-gaussian
tails, especially away from the shock front, showing that the assumption of local equilibrium is
violated. This, along with neglect of heat conduction, could be the possible reasons for the mismatch
between theory and simulations.
