In diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) methods, the nodes (or zeroes) of the trial wave function dictate
the magnitude of the fixed-node (FN) error. Within standard DMC implementations, they emanate
from short multideterminant expansions, \textit{stochastically} optimized in the presence
of a Jastrow factor. Here, following a recent proposal, we follow an alternative route by considering
the nodes of selected configuration interaction (sCI) expansions built with the CIPSI (Configuration
Interaction using a Perturbative Selection made Iteratively) algorithm. In contrast to standard
implementations, these nodes can be \textit{systematically} and \textit{deterministically}
improved by increasing the size of the sCI expansion. The present methodology is used to investigate
the properties of the transition metal sulfide molecule FeS. This apparently simple molecule has
been shown to be particularly challenging for electronic structure theory methods due to the proximity
of two low-energy quintet electronic states of different spatial symmetry. In particular, we show
that, at the triple-zeta basis set level, all sCI results --- including those extrapolated at the
full CI (FCI) limit --- disagree with experiment, yielding an electronic ground state of $^{5}\Sigma^+$
symmetry. Performing FN-DMC simulation with sCI nodes, we show that the correct $^{5}\Delta$ ground
state is obtained if sufficiently large expansions are used. Moreover, we show that one can systematically
get accurate potential energy surfaces and reproduce the experimental dissociation energy as
well as other spectroscopic constants.
