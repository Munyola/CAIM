This paper derives a prediction for the variation of the amplitude of the dielectric loss from isomorph
theory, and presents an experimental test of the prediction performed by measuring the dielectric-relaxation
behavior of the van der Waals liquid 5-phenyl-4-ether (5PPE). The liquid is studied at isochronal
states in the temperature range $266-333$ K and pressure range $0.1-300$ MPa, for relaxation times
around $10^{-3}$ s and $10^{-4}$ s. From the isomorph statement that there is structural and dynamic
invariance of isomorph states in reduced units for Roskilde simple liquids we derive four equivalent
isomorph-invariant terms, one of which is used in analyzing our data. It is the frequency-dependent
term $\chi_{e}(f) \rho^{\gamma-1}$, with electric susceptibility $\chi_{e}$, density $\rho$,
and density-scaling factor $\gamma$. Due to the unique design of our experimental setup, we obtain
dielectric loss data where the amplitude is reproducible $\pm 0.1 \%$. We moreover find that the
empty capacitance of the capacitor cell is stable within $\pm 0.3 \%$ in our measuring range and can
be assumed to be constant. Using this we predict for two isomorph states there is $-C_{2}"(f)= -C_{1}"(f)
\left(\rho_1 / \rho_2 \right)^{\gamma-1}$ to scale the negative imaginary capacitance, where
$C_{1}$ is the capacitance measurement at ambient pressure and $C_{2}$ is the predicted capacitance
at elevated pressure. We visually compare the predicted and measured plots and there is good match
between the two plots among the 42 pairs of isochronal states from the measurement.
