The stability of the stored information in recording media depends on the anisotropy energy Ea =
KeffV of nanoparticles (NPs) of volume V or diameter D. Therefore, the knowledge of how the effective
magnetic anisotropy Keff varies with D for a given system is important for technological applications.
In a recent paper [Appl. Phys. Lett. 110 (22), 222409 (2017)], the variation of Keff versus D in NPs
of maghemite ({\gamma}-Fe2O3) was best described by the Eq.: Keff = Kb + (6KS/D) +Ksh{[1-(2d/D)]-3
-1}, where Kb, KS, and Ksh are the anisotropy constants of spins in the core, surface layer, and a shell
of thickness d, respectively. This core-shell-surface layer (CSSL) model is an extension of the
often used core-surface layer (CSL) model described by Keff = Kb + (6KS/D) [Phys. Rev. Lett. 72, 282
(1994)]. The additional term involving Ksh was found to be necessary to fit the data for smaller NPs
of {\gamma}-Fe2O3 with D < 5 nm. Here we check the validity of the CSSL model for metallic magnetic
NPs of Co, Ni, Fe and magnetite using Keff vs. D data from published literature. Care was taken in selecting
data only for those NPs for which the effects of interparticle interactions has been taken into account
in determining Keff. The importance of the new CSSL model is that it describes well the Keff vs. D variation
for all particles sizes whereas the core-surface layer model often fails for smaller particles
with the notable exception of Fe NPs. The verification of the CSSL model for metallic NPs of Co, Ni,
and magnetite along with NPs of NiO and {\gamma}-Fe2O3 validates its general applicability.
