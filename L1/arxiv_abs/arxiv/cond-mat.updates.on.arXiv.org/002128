We report on the first successful growth of single crystals of the noncentrosymmetric superconductor
Mo$_3$Al$_2$C obtained by means of a cubic-anvil, high-pressure and high-temperature technique.
Composition, structure, and normal-state transport properties of the crystals were studied by
means of X-ray diffraction, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, magnetic susceptibility
and resistivity measurements as a function of temperature. Variations in critical temperature
($T_c$) between 8.6 and 9.3 K were observed, probably due to the slightly different carbon stoichiometry
of the samples. Single-crystal X-ray refinement confirmed the high structural perfection of the
grown crystals. Remarkably, the refined Flack parameter values for all the measured crystals using
a $P4_132$ space-group model were consistently close to either 0 or 1, hence indicating that the
considered crystals belong to two enantiomorphic space groups, $P4_132$ and $P4_332$. An anomaly
in the resistivity is observed at about 130 K, most likely associated with the onset of a charge-density-wave
phase. The superconducting properties (and in particular the symmetry, the amplitude and the temperature
dependence of the superconducting gap) were studied by using - for the first time in this compound
- point contact Andreev-reflection spectroscopy. The results confirm that Mo$_3$Al$_2$C is a
moderately strongly-coupled superconductor with $2\Delta/k_BT_c \simeq 4$ and unambiguously
prove that the order parameter has an s-wave symmetry despite the asymmetric spin-orbit coupling
arising from the lack of inversion symmetry.
