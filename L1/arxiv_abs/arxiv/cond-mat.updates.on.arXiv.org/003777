InGaN-based visible LEDs find commercial applications for solid-state lighting and displays,
but lattice mismatch limits the thickness of InGaN quantum wells that can be grown on GaN with high
crystalline quality. Since narrower wells operate at a higher carrier density for a given current
density, they increase the fraction of carriers lost to Auger recombination and lower the efficiency.
The incorporation of boron, a smaller group-III element, into InGaN alloys is a promising method
to eliminate the lattice mismatch and realize high-power, high-efficiency visible LEDs with thick
active regions. In this work we apply predictive calculations based on hybrid density functional
theory to investigate the thermodynamic, structural, and electronic properties of BInGaN alloys.
Our results show that BInGaN alloys with a B:In ratio of 2:3 are better lattice matched to GaN compared
to InGaN and, for indium fractions less than 0.2, nearly lattice matched. Deviations from Vegard's
law appear as bowing of the in-plane lattice constant with respect to composition. Our thermodynamics
calculations demonstrate that the solubility of boron is higher in InGaN than in pure GaN. Varying
the Ga mole fraction while keeping the B:In ratio constant enables the adjustment of the (direct)
gap in the 1.75-3.39 eV range, which covers the entire visible spectrum. Holes are strongly localized
in non-bonded N 2p states caused by local bond planarization near boron atoms. Our results indicate
that BInGaN alloys are promising for fabricating nitride heterostructures with thick active regions
for high-power, high-efficiency LEDs.
