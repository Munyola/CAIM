Spin Hall oscillators (SHO) are promising candidates for the generation, detection and amplification
of high frequency signals, that are tunable through a wide range of operating frequencies. They
offer to be read out electrically, magnetically and optically in combination with a simple bilayer
design. Here, we experimentally study the spatial dependence and spectral properties of auto-oscillations
in SHO devices based on Pt(7 nm)/\ Ni$_{\mathrm{80}}$Fe$_{\mathrm{20}}$(5 nm) tapered nanowires.
Using Brillouin light scattering microscopy, we observe two individual self-localized spin-wave
bullets that oscillate at two distinct frequencies (5.2 GHz and 5.45 GHz) and are localized at different
positions separated by about 750 nm within the SHO. This state of a tapered SHO has been predicted
by a Ginzburg-Landau auto-oscillator model, but not yet been directly confirmed experimentally.
We demonstrate that the observed bullets can be individually synchronized to external microwave
signals, leading to a frequency entrainment, linewidth reduction and increase in oscillation
amplitude for the bullet that is selected by the microwave frequency. At the same time, the amplitude
of other parasitic modes decreases, which promotes the single-mode operation of the SHO. Finally,
the synchronization of the spin-wave bullets is studied as a function of the microwave power. We
believe that our findings promote the realization of extended spin Hall oscillators accomodating
several distinct spin-wave bullets, that jointly cover an extended range of tunability.
