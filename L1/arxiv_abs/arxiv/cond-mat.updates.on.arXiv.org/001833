Battery-like supercapacitors feature high power and energy densities as well as long-term capacitance
retention. The utilized capacitor electrodes are thus better to have large surface areas, high
conductivity, high stability, and importantly be of binder free. Herein, vertically aligned carbon
nanofibers (CNFs) coated boron-doped diamonds (BDD) are employed as the capacitor electrodes
to construct battery-like supercapacitors. Grown via a thermal chemical vapor deposition technique,
these CNFs/BDD hybrid films are binder free and own porous structures, resulting in large surface
areas. Meanwhile, the containment of graphene layers and copper metal catalysts inside CNFs/BDD
leads to their high conductivity. Electric double layer capacitors (EDLCs) and pseudocapacitors
(PCs) are then constructed in the inert electrolyte (1.0 M H2SO4 solution) and in the redox-active
electrolyte (1.0 M Na2SO4 + 0.05 M Fe(CN)63-/4-), respectively. For assembled two-electrode symmetrical
supercapacitor devices, the capacitances of EDLC and PC devices reach 30 and 48 mF cm-2 at 10 mV s-1,
respectively. They remain constant even after 10 000 cycles. The power densities are 27.3 kW kg-1
and 25.3 kW kg-1 for EDLC and PC devices, together with their energy densities of 22.9 Wh kg-1 and 44.1
Wh kg-1, respectively. The performance of formed EDLC and PC devices is comparable to market-available
batteries. Therefore, the vertically aligned CNFs/BDD hybrid film is a suitable capacitor electrode
material to construct high-performance battery-like and industry-orientated supercapacitors
for flexible power devices.
