Hereby, we present finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulation results on engineering of
technologically undemanding photonic structures offering a significant and spectrally-broad
improvement in extraction efficiency of emission at the third telecommunication window. The modelling
of the extraction efficiency has been performed for cylindrical and rectangular mesa structures
containing an exciton confined in a single quantum dot emitting at 1550 nm. We used FDTD method to
characterize the emission pattern from such mesas made of InP or interchangeable AlGaInAs for two
cases: monolithic InP substrate and InP/AlGaInAs distributed Bragg reflector (DBR) underneath
the mesa. The calculations have been performed in function of the system geometrical parameters,
i.e. mesa shape and dimensions, and the emitter position. Our results show that extraction efficiencies
of 25 % are achievable for numerical aperture of 0.4 of a common optical detection system. We also
observed that the extraction efficiency is rather weakly sensitive to the in-plane dipole alignment
and exhibits significantly higher susceptibility to even slight changes in its vertical position
or in mesa geometry. We also comment on the influence of the Purcell effect on the total emission power
leading to its enhancement for structures with high extraction efficiency. Finally, we have calculated
the extraction efficiency dependence versus the numerical aperture of the first detection lens
to verify the practical limits, which appeared to be about 47 % for NA of 0.9 and for the considered
structures with DBR.
