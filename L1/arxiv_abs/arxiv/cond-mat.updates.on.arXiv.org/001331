We develop a device model for pixelless converters of far/mid-infrared radiation (FIR/MIR) images
into near-infrared/visible (NIR/VIR) images. These converters use polycrystalline graphene
layers (PGLs) immersed in the van der Waals (vdW) materials integrated with light emitting diode
(LED). The PGL serves as an element of the PGL infrared photodetector (PGLIP) sensitive to the incoming
FIR/MIR due to the interband absorption. The spatially non-uniform photocurrent generated in
the PGLIP repeats (mimics) the non-uniform distribution (image) created by the incident FIR/MIR.
The injection of the nonuniform photocurrent into the LED active layer results in the nonuniform
NIR/VIR image reproducing the FIR/MIR image. The PGL and the entire layer structure are not deliberately
partitioned into pixels. We analyze the characteristics of such pixelless PGLIP-LED up-converters
and show that their image contrast transfer function and the up-conversion efficiency depend on
the PGL lateral resistivity. The up-converter exhibits high photoconductive gain and conversion
efficiency when the lateral resistivity is sufficiently high. Several teams have successfully
demonstrated the large area PGLs with the resistivities varying in a wide range. Such layers can
be used in the pixelless PGLIP-LED image up-converters. The PGLIP-LED image up-converters can
substantially surpass the image up-converters based on the quantum-well infrared photodetector
(QWIP) integrated with the LED. These advantages are due to the use of the interband FIR/NIR absorption
and a high photoconductive gain in the GLIPs.
