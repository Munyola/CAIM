The thermoelectric power factor of hierarchically nanostructured materials is investigated
using the nonequilibrium Greens function method for quantum transport, including interactions
of electrons with acoustic and optical phonons. We describe hierarchical nanostructuring by superlatticelike
potential barriers or wells, combined with quantum dot barriers or wells nanoinclusions as well
as voids in the intermediate region. We show that these structures can be designed in a way that the
power factor is not only largely immune to the presence of the nanostructure features, but under
certain conditions benefits can be achieved as well. Interestingly, we show that these design approaches
are linked to the energy relaxation of the current flow and whether charge carrier scattering is
limited by elastic or inelastic processes. In particular, when nanostructures form potential
barriers, the power factor can be substantially enhanced under elastic scattering conditions,
irrespective of nanostructuring density and potential barrier heights. When inelastic scattering
processes dominate, however, the power factor is inevitably degraded. In the case in which nanostructures
form potential wells, despite a slight decrease, the power factor is quite resilient under either
elastic or inelastic scattering processes. These nanostructuring design approaches could help
open the path to the optimization of new generation nanostructured thermoelectric materials by
not only targeting reductions in thermal conductivity, but simultaneous improvements in the power
factor as well.
