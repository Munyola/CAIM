The random phase approximation (RPA) is attracting renewed interest as a universal and accurate
method for first-principles total energy calculations. The RPA naturally accounts for long-range
dispersive forces without compromising accuracy for short range interactions making the RPA superior
to semi-local and hybrid functionals in systems dominated by weak van der Waals or mixed covalent-dispersive
interactions. In this work we present plane wave-based RPA calculations for a broad collection
of systems with bond types ranging from strong covalent to van der Waals. Our main result is the RPA
potential energy surfaces of graphene on the Cu(111), Ni(111), Co(0001), Pd(111), Pt(111), Ag(111),
Au(111), and Al(111) metal surfaces, which represent archetypical examples of metal-organic
interfaces. Comparison with semi-local density approximations and a non-local van der Waals functional
show that only the RPA captures both the weak covalent and dispersive forces which are equally important
for these systems. We benchmark our implementation in the GPAW electronic structure code by calculating
cohesive energies of graphite and a range of covalently bonded solids and molecules as well as the
dissociation curves of H2 and H2+. These results show that RPA with orbitals from the local density
approximation suffers from delocalization errors and systematically underestimates covalent
bond energies yielding similar or lower accuracy than the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) functional
for molecules and solids, respectively.
