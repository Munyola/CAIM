Recent experimental results: (i) the measurement of the singular specific heat in cuprates and
the earlier such results in some heavy fermion compounds, (ii) the measurement of the single-particle
scattering rates, (iii) the density fluctuation spectrum in cuprates and (iv) the long standing
results on the linear temperature dependence of the resistivity, are used to show that a theory of
the quantum-criticality in these compounds based on the solution of the dissipative 2D - XY model
{\it quantitatively} gives the temperature and frequency dependence of such properties with one
parameter - the dimensionless coupling constant of the fermions to the quantum-critical fluctuations.
The asymptotic low frequency or temperature dependences persist to an upper cut-off scale which
is given by another parameter in the theory - the upper cut-off of the derived fluctuations. This
can be read from the measured singularity in the specific heat or the saturation of the single-particle
relaxation rate. The two parameter had earlier been estimated from microscopic parameters to within
a factor of about 2. The cross-over exponent from quantum-criticality to Fermi-liquid is estimated
from specific heat and resistivity data to be about 1/2, also in agreement with the results on the
model. The simplicity of the results depends on the discovery that orthogonal topological excitations
in space and in time determine the fluctuations near criticality such that the space and time metrics
are free of each other. Only then do the interacting fermions form a marginal Fermi-liquid.
