The body-centered-tetragonal metallic compound EuCo{2-y}As2 orders into an antiferromagnetic
helical structure below a temperature TN = 40-45 K, where the effective moment of the Eu spins-7/2
in the paramagnetic state is enhanced by about 7% above the value expected for spectroscopic splitting
factor g = 2, and the saturation moment at high fields and low T is also sometimes enhanced compared
to the value for g = 2. Here we report X-band electron-spin resonance (ESR) measurements of the microscopic
magnetic behavior of the Eu spins that were carried out to identify the origin of these enhanced moments.
We infer that the enhancements arise from ferromagnetic polarization of the Co 3d band electrons
by the Eu spins, where the polarized band electrons form a spin cloud around the Eu spins that adiabatically
follows the motion of the Eu spins. In the past, the theoretically-required magnetic-field H prefactor
to the expression for the field-dependent microwave ESR power absorption was omitted from fits
of the ESR spectra for high concentrations of local magnetic moments in metals. Here we fitted the
ESR spectra for EuCo{2-y}As2 both with and without the H prefactor in the fitting expression and
found that the Dysonian alpha parameter is strongly affected when the H prefactor is omitted, whereas
the resonant field and linewidth are changed by only a few percent. The integrated power absorption
between H = 0 and H = infinity is finite if the H prefactor is ignored, whereas it diverges if the prefactor
is included as discussed in the Appendix.
