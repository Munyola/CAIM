Polymer brushes normally swell in a good solvent and collapse in a poor solvent. An abnormal response
of polymer brushes, so-called co-nonsolvency, is the phenomenon where the brush counter-intuitively
collapses in a good solvent mixture. In this work, we employed molecular dynamics simulations to
investigate the structural properties of the grafted polymers on the occurrence of co-nonsolvency.
Brushes with various grafting densities were considered to study the effect of topological excluded
volumes on the co-nonsolvency. We found that the brush height follows a novel scaling behavior of
the grafting density $h \sim \sigma_{\text g}^{0.71}$ in the co-nonsolvent mixture. Using the
scaling exponent and Alexander-de Gennes theory, an analytic function that predicts the monomer
density was obtained. The many-chain effects in the co-nonsolvent lead to the formation of both
intermolecular and intramolecular bridging structures. Increasing the grafting density entails
lower looping events occuring because of the intermolcular bridging, causing diverse structural
properties. We report how the average thickness, the polymer orientation, and the looping probability
varies as the grafting density increases. Based on these observations, we constructed a phase diagram
of the polymer brush system using the average thickness and orientation as order parameters. Our
simulations and analytical results reveal the nature of co-nonsolvency in polymer brushes in an
explicit way and will help to provide practical guidelines for applications such as drug delivery
and sensor devices.
