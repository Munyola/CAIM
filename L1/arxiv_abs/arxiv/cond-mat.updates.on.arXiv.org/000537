Colloidal model systems allow studying crystallization kinetics under fairly ideal conditions
with rather well characterized pair interactions and minimized external influences. In complementary
approaches therefore experiment, analytic theory and simulation have been employed to study colloidal
solidification in great detail. These studies were based on advanced optical methods, careful
system characterization and sophisticated numerical methods. Both the effects of the type, strength
and range of the pair-interaction between the colloidal particles and those of the colloid-specific
polydispersity were addressed in a quantitative way. Key parameters of crystallization were derived
and compared to those of metal systems. These systematic investigations significantly contributed
to an enhanced understanding of the crystallization processes in general. Further, new fundamental
questions have arisen and (partially) been solved over the last decade including e.g. a two step
nucleation mechanism in homogeneous nucleation, choice of the crystallization pathway or the
subtle interplay of boundary conditions in heterogeneous nucleation. On the other side, via the
application of both gradients and external fields the competition between different nucleation
and growth modes can be controlled and the resulting micro-structure be influenced. The present
review attempts an account of the interesting developments occurred since the turn of the millennium
and an identification of important novel trends with particular focus on experimental aspects.
