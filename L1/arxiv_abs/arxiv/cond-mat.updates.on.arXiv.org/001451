Despite much anticipation of valleytronics as a candidate to replace the ageing CMOS-based information
processing, its progress is severely hindered by the lack of practical ways to manipulate valley
polarization all-electrically in an electrostatic setting. Here we propose a class of all-electric-controlled
valley filter, valve and logic gate based on the valley-contrasting transport in a merging Dirac
cones system. The central mechanism of these devices lies on the pseudospin-assisted quantum tunneling
which effectively quenches the transport of one valley when its pseudospin configuration mismatches
that of a gate-controlled scattering region. The valley polarization can be abruptly switched
into different states and remains stable over semi-infinite gate-voltage windows. Colossal tunneling
valley-pseudo-magnetoresistance ratio of over 10,000\% can be achieved in a valley-valve setup.
We further propose a valleytronic-based logic gate capable of covering all 16 types of two-input
Boolean logics. Remarkably, the valley degree of freedom can be harnessed to resurrect logical-reversibility
in two-input universal Boolean gate. The (2+1) polarization states -- two distinct valleys plus
a null polarization -- re-establish one-to-one input-to-output mapping, a crucial requirement
for logical-reversibility, and significantly reduce the complexity of reversible circuits due
to the built-in nature of valley degree of freedom. Our results suggest that the synergy of valleytronics
and digital logics may provide new paradigms for valleytronic-based information processing and
reversible computing.
