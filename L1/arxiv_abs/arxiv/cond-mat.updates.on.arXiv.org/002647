Topological index of a system specifies gross features of the system. However, in situations such
as strong disorder where by level repulsion mechanism the spectral gap is closed, the topological
indices are not well-defined. In this paper, we show that the localization length of zero modes determined
from appropriate use of transfer matrix method reveals much more information than the topological
index. The localization length can provide not only information about the topological index of
the Hamiltonian itself, but it can also provide information about the topological indices of the
related Hamiltonians. As a case study, we study a generalized XY model (2XY model) plus a generalized
Dziyaloshinskii-Moriya-like (DM) interaction that after fermionization breaks the time-reversal
invariance and is parameterized by $\phi$. The {\em parent} Hamiltonian at $\phi=0$ which belongs
to BDI class is indexed by integer winding number while the $\phi\ne 0$ {\em daughter} Hamiltonian
which belongs to class D is specified by a $Z_2$ index $\nu=\pm 1$. We show that the localization length
in addition to determining the $Z_2$ can count the number of Majorana zero modes left over at the boundary
of the daughter Hamiltonian -- which are not protected by winding number anymore. Therefore the
localization length outperforms the standard topological indices in two respects: (i) it is much
faster and more accurate to calculate and (ii) it can count the winding number of the parent Hamiltonian
by looking into the edges of the daughter Hamiltonian.
