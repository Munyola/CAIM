We study quantum phase transitions (QPTs) associated with splitting nodal Fermi points, motivated
by topological phase transitions between Dirac and Weyl semi-metals. A Dirac point in Dirac semi-metals
may be split into two Weyl points by breaking a lattice symmetry or time reversal symmetry, and the
Lifshitz transition is commonly used to describe the phase transitions. Here, we show that the Lifshitz
description is fundamentally incorrect in QPTs with splitting nodal Fermi points. We argue that
correlations between fermions, order parameter, and the long range Coulomb interaction { must}
be incorporated from the beginning. One of the most striking correlation effects we find is {\it
infinite anisotropy} of physical quantities, which cannot appear in a Lifshitz transition. By
using the standard renormalization group (RG) method, two types of infinitely anisotropic quantum
criticalities are found in three spatial dimensions varying with the number of the Dirac points
($N_f$). For $N_f = 1$, the ratio of the fermion velocity to the velocity of order parameter excitations
becomes universal ($\sqrt{2}-1$) along the Dirac point splitting direction . For $N_f >1$, we find
that fermions are parametrically faster than order parameter excitations in all directions. Our
RG analysis is fully controlled by the fact that order parameter and fermion fluctuations are at
the upper critical dimension, and thus our stable fixed points demonstrate the presence of weakly
coupled quantum criticalities with infinite anisotropy.
