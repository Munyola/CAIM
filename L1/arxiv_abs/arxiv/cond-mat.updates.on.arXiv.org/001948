We compute annihilation rates of metastable magnetic skyrmions using a form of Langer's theory
in the intermediate-to-high damping (IHD) regime. We look at three possible paths to annihilation:
isotropic collapse of an isolated skyrmion, isotropic collapse induced by another skyrmion and
annihilation at a boundary. We find that the skyrmion's internal modes play a dominant role in the
thermally activated transitions compared to the spin-wave excitations and that the relative contribution
of internal modes depends on the nature of the transition process. Additionally, the eigenmodes
at saddle point configurations are characterized by broken symmetries. Our calculations for a
small skyrmion stabilized at zero-field show that the annihilation is largely dominated by the
mechanism at the boundary, even though in this case the activation energy is higher than that of isotropic
collapses. The potential source of stability of metastable skyrmions is therefore found not to
lie in high activation energies, nor in the dynamics at the transition state, but comes from entropic
narrowing in the saddle point region which leads to low attempt frequencies. This narrowing effect
is found to be primarily associated with the skyrmion's internal modes. Isotropic collapse induced
by another skyrmion exhibits the same internal energy barrier as a single skyrmion, but with a different
entropic barrier. The probability of induced isotropic collapse is expected to increase with the
number of skyrmions present on a racetrack.
