Discontinuous transitions have received considerable interest due to the uncovering that many
phenomena such as catastrophic changes, epidemic outbreaks and synchronization present a behavior
signed by abrupt (macroscopic) changes (instead of smooth ones) as a tuning parameter is changed.
However, in different cases there are still scarce microscopic models reproducing such above trademarks.
With these ideas in mind, we investigate the fundamental ingredients underpinning the discontinuous
transition in one of the simplest systems with up-down $Z_2$ symmetry recently ascertained in [Phys.
Rev. E {\bf 95}, 042304 (2017)]. Such system, in the presence of an extra ingredient-the inertia-
has its continuous transition being switched to a discontinuous one in complex networks. We scrutinize
the role of three fundamental ingredients: inertia, system degree, and the lattice topology. Our
analysis has been carried out for regular lattices and random regular networks with different node
degrees (interacting neighborhood) through mean-field treatment and numerical simulations.
Our findings reveal that not only the inertia but also the connectivity constitute essential elements
for shifting the phase transition. Astoundingly, they also manifest in low-dimensional regular
topologies, exposing a scaling behavior entirely different than those from the complex networks
case. Therefore, our findings put on firmer bases the essential issues for the manifestation of
discontinuous transitions in such relevant class of systems with $Z_2$ symmetry.
