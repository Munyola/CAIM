Two-dimensional metallic dichalcogenides display diverse charge ordering phenomena, but the
mechanisms for the formation of low-temperature commensurate order have proven surprisingly
controversial. Fermi surface instabilities, the electron-phonon interaction, exciton condensation
and strong correlations are commonly discussed, but each mechanism is typically applied individually,
and is usually applicable only in a certain range of temperature or doping. In this paper we propose
a new and universally applicable viewpoint on charge ordering in triangular lattices based on the
sparse ordering of polarons subject to (only) screened Coulomb interactions. Using a charged lattice
gas model, our parallel tempering Monte Carlo simulations find stable regularly ordered polaronic
crystals at certain magic filling fractions $f_{m}=1/3,1/4,1/9,1/13,1/16$ which are observed
as $commensurate$ charge density waves in different materials. Upon doping, a multitude of near-degenerate
domain wall configurations appear which accommodate the doped charges. In large regions of doping
between $f_{m}$, an apparently infinite number of configurationally near-degenerate states
result in an amorphous state, which is stable down to very low temperatures. The effective degeneracy
of configurational states subject to quantum fluctuations may lead to a quantum \emph{charge}
liquid at low temperatures, analogous to the canonical quantum spin liquid. Critical points, possibly
quantum, at $f_{m}$ delineate the different regions of the phase diagram in accordance with observed
doping and light-induced orders.
