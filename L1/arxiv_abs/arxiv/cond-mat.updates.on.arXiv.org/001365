Photoresponsive surfactants provide a unique microfluidic driving mechanism. Since their molecular
shapes change under illumination and thereby affect surface tension of fluid interfaces, Marangoni
flow along the interface occurs. To describe the dynamics of the surfactant mixture at a planar interface,
we formulate diffusion-advection-reaction equations for both surfactant densities. They also
include adsorption from and desorption into the neighboring fluids and photoisomerization by
light. We then study how the interface responds when illuminated by spots of light. Switching on
a single light spot, the density of the switched surfactant spreads in time and assumes an exponentially
decaying profile in steady state. Simultaneously, the induced radial Marangoni flow reverses
its flow direction from inward to outward. We use this feature to set up specific feedback rules,
which couple the advection velocities sensed at the light spots to their intensities. As a result
two neighboring spots switch on and off alternately. Extending the feedback rule to light spots
arranged on the vertices of regular polygons, we observe periodic switching patterns for even-sided
polygons, where two sets of next-nearest neighbors alternate with each other. A triangle and pentagon
also show regular oscillations, while heptagon and nonagon exhibit irregular oscillations due
to frustration. While our findings are specific to the chosen set of parameters, they show how complex
patterns at photoresponsive fluid interfaces emerge from simple feedback coupling.
