In the context of correlated insulators, where electron-electron interactions (U) drive the localization
of charge carriers, the metal-insulator transition (MIT) is described as either bandwidth (BC)
or filling (FC) controlled. Motivated by the challenge of the insulating phase in Sr$_2$IrO$_4$,
a new class of correlated insulators has been proposed, in which spin-orbit coupling (SOC) is believed
to renormalize the bandwidth of the half-filled $j_{\mathrm{eff}} = 1/2$ doublet, allowing a modest
U to induce a charge-localized phase. Naturally, the question arises whether in this new framework
the MIT can be driven by SOC. Previous attempts at revealing the role of SOC have been hindered by concurrently
occurring changes to the filling. We overcome this challenge by employing multiple substituents
that introduce well defined changes to the signatures of SOC and carrier concentration in the electronic
structure, as well as a new methodology that allows us to monitor SOC directly. Specifically, we
study Sr$_2$Ir$_{1-x}$T$_x$O$_4$ (T = Ru, Rh) by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy
(ARPES) combined with ab-initio and supercell tight-binding calculations. This allows us to distinguish
relativistic and filling effects, thereby establishing conclusively the central role of SOC in
stabilizing the insulating state of Sr$_2$IrO$_4$. Most importantly, we determine the critical
value for spin-orbit coupling in this system to be $\lambda_c = 0.41$ eV, and provide the first demonstration
of a spin-orbit-controlled MIT.
