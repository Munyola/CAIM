The superconductivity in the cuprates might be mediated by fluctuations of a distinct order parameter,
such as antiferromagnetism [1], q=0 order [2] or charge-spin stripes [3].The two most salient and
purportedly universal features of the antiferromagnetic (AF) excitation spectrum are the resonance
mode, a property of the superconducting (SC) state[4-6], and the X-shaped hourglass response,
whose downward dispersion has been associated with either stripe correlations[3,4] or the resonance[5,6].
Here we use neutron scattering on HgBa$_2$CuO$_{4+{\delta}}$ (Hg1201; moderately doped, transition
temperature T$_c = 71$ K), which exhibits a simple tetragonal structure and the highest optimal
T$_c$ of all single-CuO2-layer cuprates[7], to uncover a gapped Y-shaped spectrum in both the SC
and the normal state. The response lacks an incommensurate downward dispersion and a sharp resonance
mode, thus obviating the conventional wisdom concerning magnetism in the cuprates. Instead, the
spectrum is reminiscent of the normal-state response of double-layer YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O${_6+y}$
(YBCO)[8,9] and constitutes a distinct signature of the pseudogap state. We demonstrate for both
Hg1201 and YBCO (moderately-doped, T$_c = 61$ K) that substantial AF fluctuations first appear
along with q = 0 magnetism below the pseudogap temperature. This points to the distinct possibility
that the appearance of q=0 magnetism is aided by commensurate AF fluctuations, setting the stage
for charge-density-wave order[10-12] and superconductivity at lower temperature.
