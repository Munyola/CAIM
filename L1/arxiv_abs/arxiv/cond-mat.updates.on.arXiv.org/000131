The interaction of matter-wave solitons with a potential barrier is a fundamentally important
problem, and the splitting and subsequent recombination of the soliton by the barrier is the essence
of soliton matter-wave interferometry. We demonstrate the three-dimensional (3D) character
of the interactions in the case relevant to ongoing experiments, where the number of atoms in the
soliton is sufficiently large that the soliton is close to collapse. The mean-field description
is quite accurate, but the proximity to the collapse threshold makes the use of the 1D Gross-Pitaevskii
equation (GPE) irrelevant. We examine the soliton dynamics in the framework of the effectively
1D nonpolynomial Schr{\"{o}}dinger equation (NPSE), which admits the collapse in a modified form,
and in parallel we use the full 3D GPE. Both approaches produce results which are very different from
those produced in recent work which used the 1D cubic GPE. The features observed in both the NPSE and
the 3D GPE include (a) an increase in the first reflection coefficient for increasing barrier height
and decreasing atom number; (b) strong modulation in the secondary reflection/recombination
probability vs. barrier height; (c) a pronounced asymmetry in the oscillation amplitudes of the
transmitted and reflected fragments; (d) an enhancement of the transverse excitations as the number
of atoms is increased. We also explore effects produced by variations of the barrier width and outcomes
of the secondary collision upon phase imprinting on the fragment in one arm of the interferometer.
