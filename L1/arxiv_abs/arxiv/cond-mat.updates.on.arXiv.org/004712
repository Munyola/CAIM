The study of the electromagnetic response in cuprate superconductors plays a crucial role in the
understanding of the essential physics of these materials. Here the doping dependence of the electromagnetic
response in cuprate superconductors is studied within the kinetic-energy driven superconducting
mechanism. The kernel of the response function is evaluated based on the linear response approximation
for a purely transverse vector potential, and can be broken up into its diamagnetic and paramagnetic
parts. In particular, this paramagnetic part exactly cancels the corresponding diamagnetic part
in the normal-state, and then the Meissner effect is obtained within the entire superconducting
phase. Following this kernel of the response function, the electromagnetic response calculation
in terms of the specular reflection model qualitatively reproduces many of the striking features
observed in the experiments. In particular, the local magnetic-field profile follows an exponential
law, while the superfluid density exhibits the nonlinear temperature behavior at the lowest temperatures,
followed by the linear temperature dependence extending over the most of the superconducting temperature
range. Moreover, the maximal value of the superfluid density occurs at around the critical doping
$\delta_{\rm critical}\sim 0.16$, and then decreases in both lower doped and higher doped regimes.
The theory also shows that the nonlinear temperature dependence of the superfluid density at the
lowest temperatures can be attributed to the nonlocal effects induced by the d-wave gap nodes on
the electron Fermi surface.
