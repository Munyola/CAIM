Rapid development of micro- and nanofabrication methods have provoked interest and enabled experimental
studies of electronic properties of a vast class of (sub)micrometer-size solid state systems.
Mesoscopic-size hybrid structures, containing superconducting elements, have become interesting
objects for basic research studies and various applications, ranging from medical and astrophysical
sensors to quantum computing. One of the most important aspects of physics, governing the behavior
of such systems, is the finite concentration of nonequilibrium quasiparticles, present in a superconductor
even well below the temperature of superconducting transition. Those nonequilibrium excitations
might limit the performance of a variety of superconducting devices, like superconducting qubits,
single-electron turnstiles and microrefrigerators. On the contrary, in some applications, like
detectors of electromagnetic radiation, the nonequilibrium state is essential for their operation.
It is therefore of vital importance to study the mechanisms of nonequilibrium quasiparticle relaxation
in superconductors of mesoscopic dimensions, where the whole structure can be considered as an
`interface'. At early stages of research the problem was mostly studied in relatively massive systems
and at high temperatures close to the critical temperature of a superconductor. We review the recent
progress in studies of nonequilibrium quasiparticle relaxation in superconductors including
the low temperature limit. We also discuss the open physical questions and perspectives of development
in the field.
