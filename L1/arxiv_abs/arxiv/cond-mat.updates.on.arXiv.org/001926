Contrary to the electric charge that generates the electric field, magnetic charge (namely magnetic
monopoles) does not exist in the elementary electromagnetism. Consequently, magnetic flux lines
only form loops and cannot have a source or a sink in nature. It is thus extraordinary to find that magnetic
monopoles can be pictured conceptually in topological materials. Specifically in the 2D topological
insulators, the topological invariant corresponds to the total flux of an effective magnetic field
(the Berry curvature) over the reciprocal space.It is thus tempting to wrap the 2D reciprocal space
into a compact manifold--a torus, and imagine the total flux to originate from magnetic monopoles
inside the torus with a quantized total charge. However, such a physically appealing picture has
not been realized quantitatively: other than their existence in a toy (actually misleading) picture,
the properties of the magnetic monopoles remain unknown. Here, we will address this long-standing
problem by hunting down the magnetic monopoles in the reciprocal $k$-space. We will show that a simple
and physically useful picture will arrive upon analytically continuing the system to a third imaginary
momentum space. We then illustrate the evolution of the magnetic monopoles across the topological
phase transition and use it to provide natural explanations on: 1) discontinuous jump of integer
topological invariants, 2) the semi-metallic nature on the phase boundary, and 3) how a change of
global topology can be induced via a local change in reciprocal space.
