Epstein and Plesset's seminal work on the rate of gas bubble dissolution and growth in a simple liquid
is generalized to render it applicable to a gas bubble embedded in a soft elastic medium. Both the
underlying diffusion equation and the expression for the gas bubble pressure were modified to allow
for the non-zero shear modulus of the elastic medium. The extension of the diffusion equation results
in a trivial shift (by an additive constant) in the value of the diffusion coefficient, and does not
change the form of the rate equations. But the use of a Generalized Young-Laplace equation for the
bubble pressure resulted in significant differences on the dynamics of bubble dissolution and
growth, relative to a simple liquid medium. Depending on whether the salient parameters (solute
concentration, initial bubble radius, surface tension, and shear modulus) lead to bubble growth
or dissolution, the effect of allowing for a non-zero shear modulus in the Generalized Young-Laplace
equation is to speed up the rate of bubble growth, or to reduce the rate of bubble dissolution, respectively.
The relation to previous work on visco-elastic materials is discussed, as is the connection of this
work to the problem of Decompression Sickness (specifically, "the bends"). Examples of tissues
to which our expressions can be applied are provided. Also, a new phenomenon is predicted whereby,
for some parameter values, a bubble can be metastable and persist for long times, or it may grow, when
embedded in a homogeneous under-saturated soft elastic medium.
