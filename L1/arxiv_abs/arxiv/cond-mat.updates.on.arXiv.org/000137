We report a combined experimental and theoretical study of the spin S=1/2 nanomagnet Cu5(OH)2(NIPA)4*10H2O
(Cu5-NIPA). Using thermodynamic, electron spin resonance and 1H nuclear magnetic resonance measurements
on one hand, and ab initio density-functional band-structure calculations, exact diagonalizations
and a strong coupling theory on the other, we derive a microscopic magnetic model of Cu5-NIPA and
characterize the spin dynamics of this system. The elementary five-fold Cu2+ unit features an hourglass
structure of two corner-sharing scalene triangles related by inversion symmetry. Our microscopic
Heisenberg model comprises one ferromagnetic and two antiferromagnetic exchange couplings in
each triangle, stabilizing a single spin S=1/2 doublet ground state (GS), with an exactly vanishing
zero-field splitting (by Kramer's theorem), and a very large excitation gap of \Delta~68 K. Thus,
Cu5-NIPA is a good candidate for achieving long electronic spin relaxation (T1) and coherence (T2)
times at low temperatures, in analogy to other nanomagnets with low-spin GS's. Of particular interest
is the strongly inhomogeneous distribution of the GS magnetic moment over the five Cu2+ spins. This
is a purely quantum-mechanical effect since, despite the non-frustrated nature of the magnetic
couplings, the GS is far from the classical collinear ferrimagnetic configuration. Finally, Cu5-NIPA
is a rare example of a S=1/2 nanomagnet showing an enhancement in the nuclear spin-lattice relaxation
rate 1/T1 at intermediate temperatures.
