In search for the origins of the extraordinary low twinning stress of Ni-Mn-Ga magnetic shape memory
alloys we studied the thermally induced changes of structure in Ni$_{50}$Mn$_{25+x}$Ga$_{25-x}$
($x$=2.7--3.9) single crystal samples and compared them with twinning stress dependences. The
alloys exhibited transformation to five-layered (10M) martensite structure between 297 to 328
K. All samples exhibited magnetic shape memory effect. Just below the transformation temperature
the samples had very low twinning stress of about 0.1--0.3 MPa, which increased with decreasing
temperature. The structural changes were monitored using X-ray diffraction in the temperature
range 173--343 K. The 10M structure was approximated by monoclinic lattice with the unit cell derived
from the cubic unit cell of the parent L2$_{1}$ phase. With decreasing temperature, the lattice
parameters $a$ and $\gamma$ increased, $c$ decreased, while $b$ was nearly constant. For $x\leq3.5$,
sudden sharp changes in $a$ and $b$ parameters additionally occurred, resulting in $a=b$ in some
regions of the phase diagram, which might be related to the refinement of twin structure of 10M martensite
on nanoscale. The temperature dependences of lattice parameter $\gamma$ (and $c$ or $c/a$) correlate
well with the temperature dependences of twinning stress in agreement with the prediction by a microstructural
model of twin boundary motion. On the contrary, there is no correlation between $(a-b)$ and twinning
stress. This indicates no significant role of $a/b$ twins or laminate in twin boundary motion mechanism
and low twinning stress.
