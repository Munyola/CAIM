The transport behavior of strongly anisotropic systems is significantly richer compared to isotropic
ones. The most dramatic spatial anisotropy at a critical point occurs at a Lifshitz transition.
The present study uses scaling arguments and the gauge-gravity duality to investigate universal
bounds appearing in strongly-coupled quantum anisotropic systems near a Lifshitz point. Explicit
examples are merging Dirac or Weyl points or Lifshitz points near the superconductor-insulator
quantum phase transition. Using scaling arguments we propose a generalization of both the shear-viscosity
to entropy-density ratio and the charge-diffusivity bounds to the anisotropic case. We find that
the electric conductivity and viscosity of the same material vanish along certain directions yet
diverge along others. Thus, at such a quantum Lifshitz point the non-quasi-particle transport
in the strong coupling limit is both metallic and insulating, depending on the electric field direction.
We investigate the strongly-coupled phase of such systems in a gravitational Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton
model with a linear massless scalar. The holographic computation demonstrates that some elements
of the viscosity tensor can be related to the ratio of the electric conductivities. From the IR critical
geometry, we express the charge diffusion constants in terms of the square butterfly velocities.
The proportionality factor turns out to be direction-independent, linear in the inverse temperature,
and related to the critical exponents which parametrize the anisotropic scaling of the dual field
theory.
