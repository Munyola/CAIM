Topological phenomena in periodically driven, isolated quantum many body systems are difficult
to obtain due to the generic tendency of such systems to heat up towards a maximum entropy state in
the long time limit. Here we investigate a mechanism to transiently stabilize topological phenomena
over a long-time window, for systems driven at low frequencies. This mechanism provides a route
for obtaining long-lived prethermal states with anomalous topological properties, unattainable
in equilibrium. We consider the dynamics of interacting particles in a slowly driven lattice with
two (or more) bands separated by a bandgap. In the case where the bandgap of the Hamiltonian at any
specific time is large we obtain an analytical bound for the rate of change in the number of particles
populating these bands. The bound is exponentially small in the ratio between the instantaneous
bandgap and the maximum between the driving frequency, interaction strength, and the bandwidth.
Within the prethermal time window, this leads to the existence of a quasi-steady state which is characterized
by maximum entropy subject to the constraint of fixed number of particles in each band. By initializing
the system with a majority of particles in one of the bands, the topological properties of the bands
can be measured. For example, this mechanism can be used to obtain quasi-steady states in slowly
driven one dimensional systems which carry universal currents, or quasi-steady states of drive-induced
Weyl points in 3-dimensional systems.
