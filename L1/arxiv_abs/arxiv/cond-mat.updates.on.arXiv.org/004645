Aqueous proton transport at interfaces is ubiquitous and crucial for a number of fields, ranging
from cellular transport and signaling, to catalysis and membrane science. However, due to their
light mass, small size and high chemical reactivity, uncovering single proton surface transport
at room temperature and in aqueous environment has so far remained out-of-reach of conventional
atomic-scale surface science techniques, such as STM. Here, we use single-molecule localization
microscopy techniques to resolve optically the transport of individual excess protons at the interface
of hexagonal boron nitride crystals and aqueous solutions at room temperature. Our label-free
approach relies on the successive protonation and activation of optically active defects at the
surface of the crystal allowing us to resolve interfacial proton transport at the single molecule
scale with nanometric resolution and over micrometer range. Proton trajectories are revealed
as a succession of jumps between proton-binding defects, mediated by interfacial water. We demonstrate
unexpected interfacial proton mobility under illumination, limited by proton desorption from
individual defects. The proposed mechanism is supported by ab initio molecular dynamics simulations
of the defected hBN/water interface. Our observations provide the first direct experimental evidence
that interfacial water provides a preferential pathway for lateral proton transport. Our findings
have fundamental and general implications for water-mediated molecular charge transport at interfaces.
