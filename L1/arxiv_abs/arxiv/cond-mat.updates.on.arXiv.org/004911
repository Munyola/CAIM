The mysterious pseudo-gap (PG) phase of cuprate superconductors has been the subject of intense
investigation over the last thirty years, but without a clear agreement about its origin. Owing
to a recent observation in Raman spectroscopy, of a precursor in the charge channel, on top of the
well known fact of a precursor in the superconducting channel, we present here a novel idea: the PG
is formed through a Higgs mechanism, where two kinds of preformed pairs, in the particle-particle
and particle-hole channels, become entangled through a freezing of their global phase. Remarkably,
this entanglement is equivalent to fractionalizing a bond Cooper pair density wave (PDW) into its
elementary parts; the particle-hole pair, giving rise to both density modulations and current
modulations, and the particle-particle counterpart, leading to the formation of Cooper pairs.
From this perspective, the "fractionalized PDW" becomes the central object around the formation
of the pseudo-gap. The "locking" of phases between the charge and superconducting modes gives a
unique explanation for the unusual global phase coherence of short-range charge modulations,
observed below $T_{c}$ on phase sensitive scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). A simple microscopic
model enables us to estimate the mean-field values of the precursor gaps in each channel and the PG
energy scale, and to compare them to the values observed in Raman scattering spectroscopy. We also
discuss the possibility of a multiplicity of orders in the PG phase and give an overview of the phase
diagram.
