We propose to investigate the full counting statistics of nonequilibrium spin transport with an
ultracold atomic quantum gas. The setup makes use of the spin control available in atomic systems
to generate spin transport induced by an impurity atom immersed in a spin-imbalanced two-component
Fermi gas. In contrast to solid-state realizations, in ultracold atoms spin relaxation and the
decoherence from external sources is largely suppressed. As a consequence, once the spin current
is turned off by manipulating the internal spin degrees of freedom of the Fermi system, the nonequilibrium
spin population remains constant. Thus one can directly count the number of spins in each reservoir
to investigate the full counting statistics of spin flips, which is notoriously challenging in
solid state devices. Moreover, using Ramsey interferometry, the dynamical impurity response
can be measured. Since the impurity interacts with a many-body environment that is out of equilibrium,
our setup provides a way to realize the non-equilibrium orthogonality catastrophe. Here, even
for spin reservoirs initially prepared in a zero-temperature state, the Ramsey response exhibits
an exponential decay, which is in contrast to the conventional power-law decay of Anderson's orthogonality
catastrophe. By mapping our system to a multi-step Fermi sea, we are able to derive analytical expressions
for the impurity response at late times. This allows us to reveal an intimate connection of the decay
rate of the Ramsey contrast and the full counting statistics of spin flips.
