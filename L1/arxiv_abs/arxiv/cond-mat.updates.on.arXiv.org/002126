The electronic structure, magnetic properties and phase formation of hexagonal ferromagnetic
Fe$_{3}$Sn-based alloys have been studied from first principles and by experiment. The pristine
Fe$_{3}$Sn compound is known to fulfill all the requirements for a good permanent magnet, except
for the magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy (MAE). The latter is large, but planar, i.e. the easy
magnetization axis is not along the hexagonal c direction, whereas a good permanent magnet requires
the MAE to be uniaxial. Here we consider Fe$_{3}$Sn$_{0.75}$M$_{0.25}$, where M= Si, P, Ga, Ge,
As, Se, In, Sb, Te and Bi, and show how different dopants on the Sn sublattice affect the MAE and can
alter it from planar to uniaxial. The stability of the doped Fe$_{3}$Sn phases is elucidated theoretically
via the calculations of their formation enthalpies. A micromagnetic model is developed in order
to estimate the energy density product (BH)max and coercive field $\mu_{0}$H$_{c}$ of a potential
magnet made of Fe$_{3}$Sn$_{0.75}$Sb$_{0.25}$, the most promising candidate from theoretical
studies. The phase stability and magnetic properties of the Fe$_{3}$Sn compound doped with Sb and
Mn has been checked experimentally on the samples synthesised using the reactive crucible melting
technique as well as by solid state reaction. The Fe$_{3}$Sn-Sb compound is found to be stable when
alloyed with Mn. It is shown that even small structural changes, such as a change of the c/a ratio or
volume, that can be induced by, e.g., alloying with Mn, can influence anisotropy and reverse it from
planar to uniaxial and back.
