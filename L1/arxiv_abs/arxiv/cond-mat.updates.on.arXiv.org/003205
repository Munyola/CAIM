Multiphase flow through a porous medium involves complex interactions between gravity, wettability
and capillarity during drainage process. In contrast to these factors, the effect of pore distribution
on liquid retention is less understood. In particular, the quantitative correlation between the
fluid displacement and level of disorder has not yet been established. In this work, we employ direct
numerical simulation by solving the Navier-Stokes equations and using volume of fluid method to
track the liquid-liquid interface during drainage in disordered porous media. The disorder of
pore configuration is characterized by an improved index to capture small microstructural perturbation,
which is pivotal for fluid displacement in porous media. Then, we focus on the residual volume and
morphological characteristics of saturated zones after drainage and compare the effect of disorder
under different wettability (i.e., the contact angle) and gravity (characterized by a modified
Bond number) conditions. Pore-scale simulations reveal that the highly-disordered porous medium
is favourable to improve liquid retention and provide various morphologies of entrapped saturated
zones. Furthermore, the disorder index has a positive correlation to the characteristic curve
index (n) in van Genuchten equation, controlling the shape of the retention characteristic curves.
It is expected that the findings will benefit to a broad range of industrial applications involving
drainage processes in porous media, e.g., drying, carbon sequestration, and underground water
remediation.
