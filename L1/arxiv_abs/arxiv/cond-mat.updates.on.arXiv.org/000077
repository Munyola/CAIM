Organic superconductors are unique materials with a crystal structure made primarily of a complex
carbon based network, an element associated directly with life, which were postulated to have a
high critical temperature, $T_{C}$, even above room temperature, from a theoretical viewpoint.
Pressure plays an essential role in the study of superconductivity in such organic materials, including
creation of the first organic superconductor as well as the achievement of the highest $T_{C}$ of
14.2 K for charge transfer salts and 38 K for metal-doped fullerides. However, superconductivity
in these organic systems is only sustainable within a very narrow pressure range (a few GPa) and is
readily destroyed upon further compression. Here we report high-pressure magnetic susceptibility
and structure measurements on a newly discovered superconductor, LaPhenanthrene. It is found
that the application of pressure not only significantly increases $T_{C}$ from its ambient-pressure
value of 4.8 K to 12.3 K at 18.4 GPa but also stabilizes the high $T_{C}$ over the entire pressure range
(61 GPa) of the study. The evolution of $T_{C}$ with pressure is closely correlated with the angle
$\beta$ of the monoclinic unit cell. Both $T_{C}$ and $\beta$ change sharply with increasing pressure
initially but remain constant above 40 GPa, indicating that molecule orientation is essential
to superconductivity. These behaviors can be understood in terms of pressure tuning of electron
correlations, illustrating the unconventional nature of superconductivity in these hydrocarbon
superconductors.
