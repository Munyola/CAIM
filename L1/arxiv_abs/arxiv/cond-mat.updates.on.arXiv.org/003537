The generation of highly-confined plasmons through far-field optical illumination appears to
be impractical for technological applications due to their large energy-momentum mismatch with
external light. Electrical generation of plasmons offers a possible solution to this problem,
although its performance depends on a careful choice of material and geometrical parameters. Here
we theoretically investigate graphene-based structures and show in particular the very different
performance between double-layer graphene and metal$|$insulator$|$graphene sandwiches as
generators of propagating plasmons assisted by inelastic electron tunneling. For double-layer
graphene, we study the dependence on the relative tilt angle between the two sheets and show that
the plasmon generation efficiency for $4^\circ$ twist angle drops to $\sim20$\% of its maximum
for perfect stacking. For metal$|$insulator$|$graphene sandwiches, the inelastic tunneling
efficiency drops by several orders of magnitude relative to double-layer graphene, regardless
of doping level, metal$|$graphene separation, choice of metal, and direction of tunneling (metal
to or from graphene), a result that we attribute to the small fraction of the surface-projected metal
Brillouin zone covered by the graphene Dirac cone. Our results reveal a reasonable tolerance to
graphene lattice misalignment and a poor performance of structures involving metals, thus supporting
the use of double-layer graphene as an optimum choice for electrical plasmon generation in tunneling
devices.
