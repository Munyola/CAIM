The recently discovered superconductivity on the (001) surface of the topological crystalline
insulator Pb$_{1-x}$Sn$_{x}$Te has been predicted to be of the chiral $p-$wave type, but awaits
experimental confirmation. While the usual prescription of detecting Majorana zero modes at the
end-points of linear defects on the surface could be a possible test for chiral $p$-wave superconductivity,
these modes may not exist for other defect symmetries such as point like ones, or may be difficult
to confirm experimentally. In this context, we study the nature of subgap bound states induced at
point and linear nonmagnetic defects, under conditions of broken time-reversal symmetry, and
propose alternative signatures for chiral $p-$wave order in this system. In particular, we identify
two regimes: the $normal$ band gap regime where the bound states smoothly connect with impurity
states in semiconductors, and the $inverted$ band gap regime, where the impurity states nontrivially
depend on the existence of superconductivity. We obtain analytical expressions for the bound-state
spectra and importantly, also for the wavefunctions. We find that for point defects, the bound states
are quasi-localized, decreasing as an inverse-square law at large distances from the defect. We
also find that the wavefunction for a zero-energy bound state realized in a point defect has an internal
SU(2) rotational symmetry that enables its use as a possible quantum qubit, and provides an alternative
to the usual strategy of utilizing zero-energy Majorana bound states at the end points of linear
defects for realizing a qubit.
