Crystal structure, thermal and magnetic properties were systematically studied in the Y$_{1-x}$Pr$_x$CrO$_3$
with $0 \leq x \leq 0.3$ compositions. Magnetic susceptibility and specific heat measurements
show an increase of the antiferromagnetic transition temperature ($T_N$) as Pr is substituted
in the Y sites and notable magnetic features are observed below $T_N$. Strong coupling between magnetic
and crystalline parameters is observed in a small range of Pr compositions. A small perturbation
in the lattice parameters by Pr ion is sufficient to induce a spin reorientation transition followed
by magnetization reversal, to finally induce exchange bias effect. The spin reorientation temperature
($T_{SR}$) is increased from 35 K to 149 K for $0.025 \leq x \leq 0.1$ compositions. It is found that
the Cr spins sublattice rotates continuously from $T_{SR}$ to a new spin configuration a lower temperature.
In addition, magnetization reversal is observed at $T^* \sim 35$ K for x= 0.05 up to $T^* \sim 63$ K
for x = 0.20 composition. The $M-H$ curves show negative exchange bias effect induced by Pr ions,
which are observed below of 100 K and being more intense at 5 K. At 10 K, the magnetic contribution of
the specific heat, as well as the ZFC magnetization, show the rise of a peak with increasing Pr content.
The magnetic anomaly could be associated with the freezing of the Pr magnetic moment randomly distributed
at the 4c crystallographic site. A clear correspondence between spin reorientation, magnetization
reversal and exchange bias anisotropy with the tilting and octahedral distortion is also discussed.
