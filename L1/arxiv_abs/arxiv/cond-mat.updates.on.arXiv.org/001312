Iglesias et al. (2002) showed that the Rayleigh scattering from helium atoms decreases by collective
effects in the atmospheres of cool white dwarf stars. Their study is here extended to consider an
accurate evaluation of the atomic polarizability and the density effects involved in the Rayleigh
cross section over a wide density-temperature region. The dynamic dipole polarizability of helium
atoms in the ground state is determinated with the oscillator-strength distribution approach.
The spectral density of oscillator strength considered includes most significant single and doubly
excited transitions to discrete and continuum energies. Static and dynamic polarizability results
are confronted with experiments and other theoretical evaluations shown a very good agreement.
In addition, the refractive index of helium is evaluated with the Lorentz-Lorenz equation and shows
a satisfactory agreement with the most recent experiments. The effect of spatial correlation of
atoms on the Rayleigh scattering is calculated with Monte Carlo simulations and effective energy
potentials that represent the particle interactions, covering fluid densities between 0.005
and a few g/cm$^3$ and temperatures between $1000$ K and $15000$ K. We provide analytical fits from
which the Rayleigh cross section of fluid helium can be easily calculated at wavelength $\lambda>505.35$
\AA. Collision-induced light scattering was estimated to be the dominant scattering process at
densities greater than 1-2 g/cm$^3$ depending on the temperature.
