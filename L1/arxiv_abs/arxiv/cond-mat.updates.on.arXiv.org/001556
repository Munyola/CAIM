Achieving efficient nonlinear optical frequency conversion in small volumes is key for future
on-chip photonic devices that would provide a higher-speed alternative to modern electronics.
However, the already intrinsically low conversion efficiency severely limits miniaturization
to nanoscale dimensions. Here we demonstrate that gradient-field effects can provide for an efficient,
conventionally dipole-forbidden nonlinear response, offering a new approach for enhanced nonlinear
optics in nanostructures. We show that a {\em longitudinal} nonlinear source current can dominate
the third-order optical nonlinearity of the free electron response in gold in the technologically
important near-IR frequency range where the nonlinearities due to other mechanisms are particularly
small. Using adiabatic nanofocusing to spatially confine the excitation fields, from measurements
of the $2\omega_1 - \omega_2$ four-wave mixing response as a function of detuning $\omega_1 - \omega_2$,
we find up to $10^{-5}$ conversion efficiency with a gradient field contribution to $\chi^{(3)}_{\mathrm{Au}}$
of up to $10^{-19}~\mathrm{m}^2 / \mathrm{V}^2$. The results are in good agreement with theory
based on plasma hydrodynamics. Our results demonstrate an increase in nonlinear conversion efficiency
with decreasing sample size that can offset and even overcompensate the volume decrease of conventional
dipolar pathways. This will enable more efficient nonlinear optical devices and frequency converters
and facilitate the extension of coherent multidimensional spectroscopies to the nanoscale.
