Conventional crystalline magnets are characterized by symmetry breaking and normal modes of excitation
called magnons with quantized angular momentum $\hbar$. Neutron scattering correspondingly
features extra magnetic Bragg diffraction at low temperatures and dispersive inelastic scattering
associated with single magnon creation and annihilation. Exceptions are anticipated in so-called
quantum spin liquids as exemplified by the one-dimensional spin-1/2 chain which has no magnetic
order and where magnons accordingly fractionalize into spinons with angular momentum $\hbar/2$.
This is spectacularly revealed by a continuum of inelastic neutron scattering associated with
two-spinon processes and the absence of magnetic Bragg diffraction. Here, we report evidence for
these same key features of a quantum spin liquid in the three-dimensional Heisenberg antiferromagnet
NaCaNi$_2$F$_7$. Through specific heat and neutron scattering measurements, Monte Carlo simulations,
and analytic approximations to the equal time correlations, we show that NaCaNi$_2$F$_7$ is an
almost ideal realization of the spin-1 antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model on a pyrochlore lattice
with weak connectivity and frustrated interactions. Magnetic Bragg diffraction is absent and
90\% of the spectral weight forms a continuum of magnetic scattering not dissimilar to that of the
spin-1/2 chain but with low energy pinch points indicating NaCaNi$_2$F$_7$ is in a Coulomb phase.
The residual entropy and diffuse elastic scattering points to an exotic state of matter driven by
frustration, quantum fluctuations and weak exchange disorder.
