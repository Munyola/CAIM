We compute annihilation rates of metastable magnetic skyrmions using a form of Langer's theory
in the intermediate-to-high damping (IHD) regime. For a N\'eel skyrmion, a Bloch skyrmion, and
an antiskyrmion, we look at two possible paths to annihilation: collapse and escape through a boundary.
We also study the effects of a curved vs. a flat boundary, a second skyrmion and a non-magnetic defect.
We find that the skyrmion's internal modes play a dominant role in the thermally activated transitions
compared to the spin-wave excitations and that the relative contribution of internal modes depends
on the nature of the transition process. Our calculations for a small skyrmion stabilized at zero-field
show that collapse on a defect is the most probably path. In the absence of a defect, the annihilation
is largely dominated by escape mechanisms, even though in this case the activation energy is higher
than that of collapse processes. The potential source of stability of metastable skyrmions is therefore
found not to lie in high activation energies, nor in the dynamics at the transition state, but comes
from entropic narrowing in the saddle point region which leads to lowered attempt frequencies.
This narrowing effect is found to be primarily associated with the skyrmion's internal modes. Additionally,
collapse in the presence of another skyrmion exhibits the same internal energy barrier as a single
skyrmion, but with a different entropic barrier. Escape through a flat boundary is found more probable
than through a curved boundary.
