In this paper we investigate the effect of Cd doping at ultra-low concentrations in SnO$_2$ both
experimentally, by measuring the temperature dependence of the electric quadrupole hyperfine
interactions with time-differential perturbed angular correlation (TDPAC) spectroscopy using
$^{111}$Cd as probe nuclei, and theoretically, by performing first-principles calculations
based on the density functional theory. TDPAC spectra were successfully analyzed with a time-dependent
on-off model for the perturbation factor. These results show combined dynamic plus static interactions
whose electric-field gradients were associated in this model to different stable electronic configurations
close to the Cd atoms. The dynamic regime is then originated in fast fluctuations between these different
electronic configurations. First-principles calculations results show that the Cd impurity
introduces a double acceptor level in the top of the valence band of the doped semiconductor and produces
isotropic outward relaxations of the nearest oxygen neighbors. The variation of the calculated
electric-field gradient tensor as a function of the charge state of the Cd impurity level shows an
interesting behavior that explains the experimental results, giving strong support from first-principles
to the electron-capture after-effects proposed scenario. The electron-capture decay of the parent
$^{111}$In to $^{111}$Cd as well as the double acceptor character of the $^{111}$Cd impurity and
the electric nature of the host are shown to contribute to the existence of these type of time-dependent
hyperfine interactions.
