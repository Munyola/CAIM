The metallic compound EuCo{2-y}As2 orders into an antiferromagnetic helical structure below
TN = 40-45 K. The effective magnetic moment mu_eff of the Eu spins-7/2 is enhanced by about 7% compared
to the value expected for g = 2. Here magnetic field H-swept X-band electron-spin-resonance (CW
ESR) measurements of the microscopic magnetic properties of the Eu spins are reported that were
carried out to identify the origin of the enhanced mu_eff. In order to analyze the data, the complex
field-dependent magnetic susceptibility components chi'(H) and chi''(H) are derived which allow
the time-averaged microwave power absorption P(H) to be computed, where P(H) is found to contain
an H prefactor. As previously discussed in arXiv:1808.05436v2, these theoretical predictions
are especially relevant to broad Dysonian CW ESR spectra for local magnetic moments in metals, but
are also applicable more broadly to CW ESR and NMR spectra. By fitting the CW ESR spectra for EuCo{2-y}As2
by this theory, the enhancement of mu_eff is inferred to arise from ferromagnetic polarization
of the Co d-band electrons by the Eu spins, where the polarized band electrons form a spin cloud around
the Eu spins that adiabatically follows the motion of the Eu spins. To determine the influence of
the H prefactor in P(H) on the parameters obtained from the fits, the spectra were fitted both with
and without the prefactor and the results compared. The theoretical prediction of P(H) for broad
Dysonian CW ESR spectra is further discussed in the Appendix along with the field-integrated behavior.
