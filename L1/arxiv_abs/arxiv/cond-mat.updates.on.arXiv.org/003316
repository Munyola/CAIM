Vortex lattice patterns with transitions from regular to other variety vortex shapes are predicted
in rotating binary mixtures of dipolar Bose-Einstein condensates loaded in squared optical lattice.
We focus our investigation in the experimentally accessible dipolar isotopes of dysprosium ($^{162,164}$Dy),
erbium ($^{168}$Er), chromium ($^{52}$Cr), and rubidium ($^{87}$Rb), by considering the binary
mixtures ($^{164}$Dy-$^{162}$Dy, $^{168}$Er-$^{164}$Dy, $^{164}$Dy-$^{52}$Cr and $^{164}$Dy-$^{87}$Rb),
which are confined in strong pancake-shaped trap and loaded in squared two-dimensional optical
lattices, where we vary the polarization angle of dipoles, the inter-species contact interactions
and the rotation frequency. The ratio between inter- to intra-species contact interaction is used
for altering the miscibility properties; with the polarization of the dipolar species used for
tuning to repulsive or attractive the dipole-dipole interactions. For enough higher rotation,
of particular interest is the regime when the inter- to intra-species scattering length is larger
than one, in which a richer variety of vortex-lattice patterns are predicted, including vortex
sheets and two-dimensional rotating droplet formations. The patterns can be controlled by changing
the optical lattice parameters, as shown for the symmetric $^{164}$Dy-$^{162}$Dy dipolar mixture.
For mixtures with stronger differences in the dipole moments, as $^{164}$Dy-$^{52}$Cr and $^{164}$Dy-$^{87}$Rb,
only half quantum vortices and circular ones have been observed, which will depend on the dipole
orientations.
