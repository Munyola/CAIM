The spatiotemporal dynamics in systems of active self-propelled particles is controlled by the
propulsion mechanism in combination with various direct interactions, such as steric repulsion,
hydrodynamics, and chemical fields. Yet, these direct interactions are typically anisotropic,
and come in different 'flavors', such as spherical and elongated particle shapes for steric repulsion,
pusher and puller flow fields for hydrodynamics, etc. The combination of the various aspects is
expected to lead to new emergent behavior. However, it is a priori not evident whether shape and hydrodynamics
act synergistically or antagonistically to generate motility-induced clustering (MIC) and phase
separation (MIPS). We employ a model of prolate spheroidal microswimmers - called squirmers - in
quasi-two-dimensional confinement to address this issue by mesoscale hydrodynamic simulations.
For comparison, non-hydrodynamic active Brownian particles (ABPs) are considered to elucidate
the contribution of hydrodynamic interactions on MIC and MIPS. For spherical particles, the comparison
between ABP and hydrodynamic-squirmer ensembles reveals a suppression of MIPS due to hydrodynamic
interactions. The fundamental difference between ABPs and squirmers is attributed to an increased
reorientation of squirmers by hydrodynamic torques during their collisions. In contrast, for
elongated squirmers, hydrodynamics interactions enhance MIPS. Thus, hydrodynamic interactions
show opposing effects on MIPS for spherical and elongated microswimmers.
