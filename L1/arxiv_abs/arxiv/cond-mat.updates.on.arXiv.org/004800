The out-of-time-ordered correlator has been proposed as an indicator of chaos in quantum systems
due to its simple interpretation in the semiclassical limit. In particular, its rate of possible
exponential growth at $\hbar \to 0$ is closely related to the classical Lyapunov exponent. Here
we explore how this approach to quantum chaos relates to the random-matrix theoretical description.
To do so, we introduce and study the level statistics of the logarithm of the out-of-time-ordered
operator, $\hat{\Lambda}(t) = \ln \left( - \left[\hat{x}(t),\hat{p}_x(0) \right]^2 \right)/(2t)$,
that we dub the "Lyapunovian" or "Lyapunov operator" for brevity. The Lyapunovian's level statistics
is calculated explicitly for the quantum stadium billiard. It is shown that in the bulk of the filtered
spectrum, this statistics perfectly aligns with the Wigner-Dyson distribution. One of the advantages
of looking at the spectral statistics of this operator is that it has a well-defined semiclassical
limit where it reduces to the matrix of uncorrelated classical finite-time Lyapunov exponents
in a partitioned phase space. We provide a heuristic picture interpolating these two limits using
Moyal quantum mechanics. Our results show that the Lyapunov operator may serve as a useful tool to
characterize quantum chaos and in particular quantum-to-classical correspondence in chaotic
systems, by connecting the semiclassical Lyapunov growth at early times, when the quantum effects
are weak, to universal level repulsion that hinges on strong quantum interference effects.
