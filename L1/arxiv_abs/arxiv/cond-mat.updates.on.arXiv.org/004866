To extend the classical concept of Markovianity to an open quantum system, different notions of
the divisibility of its dynamics have been introduced. Here we analyze this issue by five complementary
approaches: equations of motion, real-time diagrammatics, Kraus-operator sums, as well as time-local
(TCL) and nonlocal (Nakajima-Zwanzig) quantum master equations. As a case study featuring several
types of divisible dynamics, we examine in detail an exactly solvable noninteracting fermionic
resonant level coupled arbitrarily strongly to a fermionic bath at arbitrary temperature in the
wideband limit. In particular, the impact of divisibility on the time-dependence of the observable
level occupation is investigated and compared with typical Markovian approximations. We find
that the loss of semigroup-divisibility is accompanied by a prominent reentrant behavior: Counter
to intuition, the level occupation may temporarily \emph{increase} significantly in order to
reach a stationary state with \emph{smaller} occupation, implying a reversal of the measurable
transport current. In contrast, the loss of the so-called completely-positive divisibility is
more subtly signaled by the \emph{prohibition} of such current reversals in specific time-intervals.
Experimentally, it can be detected in the family of transient currents obtained by varying the initial
occupation. To quantify the nonzero footprint left by the system in its effective environment,
we determine the exact time-dependent state of the latter as well as related information measures
such as entropy, exchange entropy and coherent information.
