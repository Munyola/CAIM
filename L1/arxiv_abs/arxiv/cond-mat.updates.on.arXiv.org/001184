Focused electron beam induced deposition (FEBID) is a direct-write method for the fabrication
of nanostructures whose lateral resolution rivals that of advanced electron lithography but is
in addition capable of creating complex three-dimensional nano-architectures. Over the last
decade several new developments in FEBID and focused electron beam induced processing (FEBIP)
have led to a growing number of scientific contributions in solid state physics and materials science
based on FEBID-specific materials and particular shapes and arrangements of the employed nanostructures.
In this review an attempt is made to give a broad overview of these developments and the resulting
contributions in various research fields encompassing mesoscopic physics with nanostructured
metals at low temperatures, direct-write of superconductors and nano-granular alloys or intermetallic
compounds and their applications, the contributions of FEBID to the field of metamaterials, and
the application of FEBID structures for sensing of force or strain, dielectric changes or magnetic
stray fields. The very recent development of FEBID towards simulation-assisted growth of complex
three-dimensional nano-architectures is also covered. In the review particular emphasis is laid
on conceptual clarity in the description of the different developments, which is reflected in the
mostly schematic nature of the presented figures, as well as in the recurring final sub-sections
for each of the main topics discussing the respective "challenges and perspectives".
