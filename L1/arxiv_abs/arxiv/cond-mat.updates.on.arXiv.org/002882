The consideration of oxygen vacancies influence on the relaxors with perovskite structure was
considered in the framework of Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire phenomenological theory. The theory
applicability for relaxors is based on the existence of some hidden soft phonon polar mode in them,
and its frequency could be zero at some negative temperature TC*. Main attention was paid to PZN-PLZT
relaxor described by formula 0.3Pb(Zn1/3Nb2/3)O3-0.7(Pb0.96La0.04(ZrxTi1-x)0.99O3) with
x = 0.52, where earlier experimental investigation of oxygen vacancies influence on the polar properties
was performed and the evidence of oxygen vacancies induced ferroelectricity was obtained. Since
the oxygen vacancies are known to be elastic dipoles, they influence upon elastic and electric fields
due to Vegard and flexoelectric coupling. We include the vacancies elastic and electrostrictive
contribution into free energy functional. The calculations of the vacancies impact on polar properties
were performed using their concentration distribution function. It was shown that the negative
Curie temperature of a relaxor TC* is renormalized by the elastic dipoles due to the electrostrictive
coupling and can become positive at some large enough concentration of the vacancies. We calculated
the local polarization and electric field induced by the flexo-chemical coupling in dependence
on the concentration of oxygen vacancies. The coexistence of FE phase and relaxor state can take
place because of inhomogeneity of vacancies concentration distribution.
