Additive manufacture and rapid prototyping are versatile methods for the generation of lattice
materials for applications in the creep regime. However, these techniques introduce defects that
can degrade the macro-scopic creep strength. In the present study, the uniaxial tensile response
of two-dimensional PMMA lattices is measured in the visco-plastic regime: tests are performed
at 100C which is slightly below the glass transition temperature T g of PMMA. Both as-manufactured
defects (Plateau borders and strut thickness variation) and as-designed defects (missing cell
walls, solid inclusions, and randomly perturbed joints) are introduced. The dispersion in macroscopic
strength is measured for relative densities in the range of 0.07 to 0.19. It is observed that initial
failure of the lattice is diffuse in nature: struts fail at a number of uncorrelated locations, followed
by the development of a single macroscopic crack transverse to the loading direction. In contrast,
the same PMMA lattice fails in a correlated, brittle manner at room temperature. An FE study is performed
to gain insight into the diffuse failure mode and the role played by as-manufactured defects, including
the dispersion in tensile strength of individual struts of the lattice. A high damage tolerance
to as-designed defects is observed experimentally: there is negligible knock-down in strength
due to the removal of cell walls or to the presence of solid inclusions. These findings aid the design
and manufacture of damage tolerant lattices in the creep regime.
