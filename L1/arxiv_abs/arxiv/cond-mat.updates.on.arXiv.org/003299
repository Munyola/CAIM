Establishing strong electron-correlations not only shed lights on overcoming the trade-off limitations
for optimizing thermoelectric materials, but can also introduce new functionalities that extend
the vision of conventional thermoelectric applications. Here, we demonstrate that the high thermoelectric
and thermistor functionalities coexist in lattice distorted SrNbxTi1-xO3 films with electron
correlations between carriers and ordering aligned lattice dipoles. As-grown SrNbxTi1-xO3/SrTiO3
with effectively preserved interfacial strains exhibits cross-plane charge ordering and orbital
anisotropy, as indicated by the polarization dependent near edge X-ray absorption fine structures.
The resultant coulomb-correlations regulate the carrier transport and enhance the Seebeck coefficient
more independently via enlarging the system vibration entropy. As-achieved maximum thermoelectric
power factor exceeds 100 uWcm-1K-2 measured in the bulk performance of SrNb0.2Ti0.8O3 (2.2 um)/SrTiO3
(100 um), which is comparable to the best thermoelectric materials for low temperature applications.
In addition, the strong temperature dependence of the carrier scattering aroused by the lattice
dipoles introduces a positive temperature dependent thermistor transportation behavior with
large temperature coefficient of resistance ranging from 30 to 300 K, which is rarely seen in conventional
thermistors. Combining both functionalities largely extend the horizon in exploring new Joule
sensors for detection of temperature and thermal perturbations across a broad temperature range.
