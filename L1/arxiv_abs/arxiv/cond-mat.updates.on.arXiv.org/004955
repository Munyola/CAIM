Inverted solubility--a crystal melting upon cooling--is observed in a handful of proteins, such
as carbomonoxy hemoglobin and $\gamma$D-crystallin. In human $\gamma$D-crystallin, the phenomenon
is associated with the mutation of the 23$^\mathrm{rd}$ residue, a proline, to a threonine, serine
or valine. One proposed microscopic mechanism for this effect entails an increase in hydrophobicity
upon mutagenesis. Recent crystal structures of a double mutant that includes the P23T mutation
allows for a more careful investigation of this proposal. Here, we first measure the surface hydrophobicity
of various mutant structures of this protein and determine that it does not discernibly increase
upon the mutating the 23$^\mathrm{rd}$ residue. We then investigate the solubility inversion
regime with a schematic patchy particle model that includes one of three models for temperature-dependent
patch energies: two of the hydrophobic effect, and a more generic description. We conclude that
while solubility inversion due to the hydrophobic effect may be possible, microscopic evidence
to support it in $\gamma$D-crystallin is weak. More generally, we find that solubility inversion
requires a fine balance between patch strengths and the temperature-dependent contribution,
which may explain why inverted solubility is not commonly observed in proteins. In any event, we
also find that the temperature-dependent interaction has only a negligible impact on the critical
properties of the $\gamma$D-crystallin, in line with previous experimental observations.
