In most lattice models, the closing of a band gap typically occurs at high-symmetry points in the
Brillouin zone. Differently, in the Creutz model $-$ describing a system of spinless fermions hopping
on a two-leg ladder pierced by a magnetic field $-$ the gap closing at the quantum phase transition
between the two topologically nontrivial phases of the model can be moved by tuning the hopping amplitudes.
We take advantage of this property to examine the nonequilibrium dynamics of the model after a sudden
quench of the magnetic flux through the plaquettes of the ladder. For a quench to one of the equilibrium
quantum critical points we find that the revival period of the Loschmidt echo $-$ measuring the overlap
between initial and time-evolved states $-$ is controlled by the gap closing zero-energy modes.
In particular, and contrary to expectations, the revival period of the Loschmidt echo for a finite
ladder does not scale linearly with size but exhibits jumps determined by the presence or absence
of zero-energy modes. We further investigate the conditions for the appearance of dynamical quantum
phase transitions in the model and find that, for a quench {\em to} an equilibrium critical point,
such transitions occur only for ladders of sizes which host zero-energy modes. Exploiting concepts
from quantum thermodynamics, we show that the average work and the irreversible work per lattice
site exhibit a weak dependence on the size of the system after a quench {\em across} an equilibrium
critical point, suggesting that quenching into a different phase induces effective correlations
among the particles.
