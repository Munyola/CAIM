An intact CuO$_2$ plane is widely believed to be a prerequisite for the high-$T_c$ superconductivity
in cuprate superconductors. However, an exception may exist in the superconducting Ba$_2$CuO$_{3+\delta}$
materials where CuO chains play a more important role. From first-principles density functional
theory calculations, we have studied the electronic and magnetic structures of Ba$_2$CuO$_{3+\delta}$.
The stoichiometric Ba$_2$CuO$_3$ and Ba$_2$CuO$_4$ contain quasi-one-dimensional CuO chains
and intact two-dimensional CuO$_2$ planes, respectively. In comparison with the nonmagnetic
metal Ba$_2$CuO$_4$, Ba$_2$CuO$_3$ is found to be an antiferromagnetic (AFM) Mott insulator.
It possesses a nearest-neighbor intra-chain antiferromagnetic (AFM) coupling and a weak inter-chain
interaction, and its lowest unoccupied band and highest occupied band are contributed by Cu 3$d_{b^2-c^2}$-orbital
(or $d_{x^2-y^2}$-orbital if we denote the $bc$-plane as the $xy$-plane) and O 2$p$-orbitals,
respectively. Total energy calculations indicate that the oxygen vacancies in Ba$_2$CuO$_{3+\delta}$
prefer to reside in the planar sites rather than the apical oxygens in the CuO chains, in agreement
with the experimental observation. Furthermore, we find that the magnetic frustrations or spin
fluctuations can be effectively induced by moderate charge doping. This suggests that the superconducting
pairing in oxygen-enriched Ba$_2$CuO$_{3+\delta}$ or oxygen-deficient Ba$_2$CuO$_{4-\delta}$
is likely to be mainly driven by the AFM fluctuations within CuO chains.
