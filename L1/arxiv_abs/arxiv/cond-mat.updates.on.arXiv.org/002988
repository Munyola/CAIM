The dynamic polarization of nuclear spins interacting with resident electrons under resonant
excitation of trions is studied in a nominally undoped GaAs/(Al,Ga)As quantum well. Unlike in common
time-resolved pump-probe techniques, we used a single beam approach where the excitation light
is modulated between the circular and linear polarization states. The time-integrated intensity
of the excitation laser reflected from the sample surface, proportional to the optical generation
rate and changes due to the pumping of the resident electrons, is detected. Polarized electrons
on the other hand transfer their spin to the lattice nuclei via the hyperfine interaction. Exciting
the sample with a train of pulses in an external magnetic field leads to resonant spin amplification
observed when the Larmor precession frequency is synchronized with the laser pulse repetition
rate. Build-up of the nuclear spin polarization causes a shifting of the RSA peaks since the resulting
nuclear field alters the strength of the external magnetic field experienced by the electrons.
It was established that the nuclear spin polarization time $T_1$ is temperature dependent and owing
to the electron localization at lower temperatures becomes shorter. "Locking" of the nuclear field
manifested as the limited by the strength of the external field growth of the nuclear field, that
is related to the anisotropy of the electron $g$-factor, was observed. The $g$-factor ratio between
the in plane $g_{\parallel}$ and out-of-plane $g_{\bot}$ components was estimated to be $g_{\bot}/g_{\parallel}=1.3$.
