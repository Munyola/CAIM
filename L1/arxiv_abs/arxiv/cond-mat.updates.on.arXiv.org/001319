As an exotic quantum condensed matter, the topological insulator (TI) is a bulk-insulating material
with a Dirac-type conducting surface state. Such dissipationless transport of topological surface
states (TSSs) is protected by the time-reversal symmetry, which leads to the potential applications
in spintronics and quantum computations. Understanding the topological symplectic transport
of the Dirac fermions is a key issue to study and design the TI-based devices. In this review, we introduce
the progress on the universal conductance fluctuation (UCF) of TSSs. Firstly, we report the two
dimensional UCF phenomenon in TIs, and its topological nature is demonstrated based on the investigations
of UCF by angle-varying, in-plane field tuning and scaling analysis. Secondly, we discuss the statistical
symmetry of UCF in TIs. For a single TSS, the applied magnetic field will drive the system from a Gaussian
symplectic ensemble into a Gaussian unitary ensemble. It results a 2^0.5 fold increase of the UCF
amplitude. However, the experiment reveals a decreasing of the UCF amplitude of 2^0.5 times. This
is contradictory to the theoretical prediction. Actually, there are two TSSs and they are coherently
coupled to each other in TIs since the sample's thickness is shorter than its bulk dephasing length.
This leads to a Gaussian orthogonal ensemble of the interface coupling system without an external
field. In such situation, the UCF amplitude will decrease by 2^0.5 times with the field increasing.
It is consistent with the experimental results. Finally, the other progress on UCFs is also discussed.
