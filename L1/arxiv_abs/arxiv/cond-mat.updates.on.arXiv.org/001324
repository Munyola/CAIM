Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations have been widely used to identify active catalysts
by constructing free energy diagrams incorporating the electrochemically stable surface structure.
Surface Pourbaix diagrams are required to determine the state of the surface under reaction conditions.
The adsorption energetics of reaction intermediates are determined self-consistently based
on the state of the surface at the reaction conditions. The close energetics of oxygen intermediates
determine the rich surface phase diagram on transition metal surfaces at oxidizing conditions.
In this work, we utilize error-estimation capabilities within the BEEF-vdW exchange correlation
functional to propagate the uncertainty associated with the energetics for the construction of
Pourbaix diagrams. As a result, within this approach, the surface-transition phase boundaries
are no longer sharp and have a finite width. We determine the surface phase diagram for several transition
metals under reaction conditions and electrode potentials relevant for oxygen reduction reaction.
We compare against linear sweep voltammetry experiments and observe the most predominant species
are in good agreement with our predictions for Pt(111), Pt(100), Pd(111), and Ir(111) when compared
to previous cyclic voltammetry experiments and DFT-based predictions. We argue that the probabilistic
approach enables a more accurate determination of the surface structure, and can readily be incorporated
in computational studies for better understanding the catalyst surface under operating conditions.
