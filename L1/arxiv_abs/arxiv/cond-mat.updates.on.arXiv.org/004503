While the scaling of entanglement in a quantum system can be used to distinguish many-body quantum
phases, it is usually hard to quantify the amount of entanglement in mixed states of open quantum
systems, while measuring entanglement experimentally, even for the closed systems, requires
in general quantum state tomography. In this work we show how to remedy this situation in system with
a fixed or conserved charge, e.g., density or magnetization, due to an emerging relation between
quantum correlations and coherence. First, we show how, in these cases, the presence of multipartite
entanglement or quantumness can be faithfully witnessed simply by detecting coherence in the quantum
system, while bipartite entanglement or bipartite quantum discord are implied by asymmetry (block
coherence) in the system. Second, we prove that the relation between quantum correlations and coherence
is also quantitative. Namely, we establish upper and lower bounds on the amount of multipartite
and bipartite entanglement in a many-body system with a fixed local charge, in terms of the amount
of coherence and asymmetry present in the system. Importantly, both for pure and mixed quantum states,
these bounds are expressed as closed formulas, and furthermore, for bipartite entanglement, are
experimentally accessible by means of the multiple quantum coherence spectra. In particular,
in one-dimensional systems, our bounds may detect breaking of the area law of entanglement entropy.
We illustrate our results on the example of a many-body localized system, also in the presence of
dephasing.
