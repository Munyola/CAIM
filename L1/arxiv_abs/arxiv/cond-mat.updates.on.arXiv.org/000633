We examine a two-dimensional system of sterically repulsive interacting disks where each particle
runs in a random direction. This system is equivalent to a run-and-tumble dynamics system in the
limit where the run time is infinite. At low densities, we find a strongly fluctuating state composed
of transient clusters. Above a critical density that is well below the density at which non-active
particles would crystallize, the system can organize into a drifting quiescent or frozen state
where the fluctuations are lost and large crystallites form surrounded by a small density of individual
particles. Although all the particles are still moving, their paths form closed orbits. The average
transient time to organize into the quiescent state diverges as a power law upon approaching the
critical density from above. We compare our results to the random organization observed for periodically
sheared systems that can undergo an absorbing transition from a fluctuating state to a dynamical
non-fluctuating state. In the random organization studies, the system organizes to a state in which
the particles no longer interact; in contrast, we find that the randomly running active matter organizes
to a strongly interacting dynamically jammed state. We show that the transition to the frozen state
is robust against a certain range of stochastic fluctuations. We also examine the effects of adding
a small number of pinned particles to the system and find that the transition to the frozen state shifts
to significantly lower densities and arises via the nucleation of faceted crystals centered at
the obstacles.
