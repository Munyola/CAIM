Knitting is not only a mere art and craft hobby but also a thousand year old technology. Unlike weaving,
it can produce loose yet extremely stretchable fabrics with almost vanishing rigidity, a desirable
property exhibited by hardly any bulk material. It also enables the engineering of arbitrarily
shaped two and three-dimensional objects with tunable mechanical response. In contrast with the
extensive body of related empirical knowledge and despite a growing industrial interest, the physical
ingredients underlying these intriguing mechanical properties remain poorly understood. As
a matter of fact, the interplay between the constitutive yarn properties and local topological
features of the stitches cannot be easily described by standard continuum mechanics. To make some
progress in this direction, we study a model tricot made of a single elastic thread knitted into the
common pattern called \textit{stockinette}. On the one hand, we experimentally investigate its
tensile response and measure local displacements of the stitches during deformation. On the other
hand, we derive a first-principle mechanical model for the displacement field based on the yarn
bending energy, the conservation of its total length and the topological constraints on the constitutive
stitches. Our model solves both the shape and mechanical response of the knit and agrees quantitatively
with our measurements. This study thus provides a fundamental framework for the understanding
of knitted fabrics, paving the way to thread-based smart materials.
