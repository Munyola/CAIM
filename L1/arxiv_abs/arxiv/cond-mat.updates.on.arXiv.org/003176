Recent photoemission spectroscopy measurements (T. J. Reber et al., arXiv:1509.01611) of cuprate
superconductors have inferred that the self-energy exhibits critical scaling over an extended
doping regime, thereby calling into question the conventional wisdom that critical scaling exists
only at isolated points. In particular, this new state of matter, dubbed a power-law liquid, has
a self-energy whose imaginary part scales as $\Sigma^{\prime\prime}\sim(\omega^{2}+\pi^{2}T^{2})^{\alpha}$,
with $\alpha=1$ in the overdoped Fermi-liquid state and $\alpha\leq0.5$ in the optimal to underdoped
regime. Previously, we showed that this self-energy can arise from interactions between electrons
and unparticles, a scale-invariant sector that naturally emerges from strong correlations. Here,
taking the self-energy as a given, we first reconstruct the real part of the self-energy. We find
that the resultant quasiparticle weight vanishes for any doping level less than optimal, implying
an absence of particle-like excitations in the underdoped regime. Consequently, the Fermi velocity
vanishes and the effective mass diverges for $\alpha\leq\frac{1}{2}$, in agreement with earlier
experimental observations. We then use the self-energy to reconstruct the spectral function and
compute the superconducting $T_c$ within the BCS formalism. We find that the $T_c$ has a dome-like
structure, implying that broad scale invariance manifested in the form of a power-law liquid is
the likely cause of the superconducting dome in the cuprates.
