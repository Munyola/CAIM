Under high pressure, Zr undergoes a transformation from its ambient equilibrium hexagonal close
packed $\alpha$ phase to a simple hexagonal $\omega$ phase. Subsequent unloading to ambient conditions
does not see a full reversal to the $\alpha$ phase, but rather a retainment of significant $\omega$.
Previously, the thermal stability of the $\omega$ phase was investigated via in-situ synchrotron
X-ray diffraction analysis of the isothermal annealing of Zr samples shocked to 8 and 10.5 GPa at
temperatures 443, 463, 483, and 503 K. The phase volume fractions were tracked quantitatively and
the dislocation densities were tracked semi-quantitatively. Trends included a rapid initial
(transient) transformation rate from $\omega\to\alpha$ followed by a plateau to a new metastable
state with lesser retained $\omega$ (asymptotic). A significant reduction in dislocation densities
in the $\omega$ phase was observed prior to initiation of an earnest reverse transformation, leading
to the hypothesis that the $\omega\to\alpha$ transformation from is being hindered by defects
in the $\omega$ phase. As a continuation of this work, we present a temperature dependent model that
couples the removal of dislocations in the $\omega$ phase and the reverse transformation via a barrier
energy that is associated with the free energy of remaining dislocations. The reduction of dislocations
in the $\omega$ phase occur as a sum of glide and climb controlled processes, both of which dictate
the transient and asymptotic behavior of the annealing process respectively.
