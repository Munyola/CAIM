Isolation and characterization of mechanically exfoliated black phosphorus flakes with a thickness
down to two single-layers is presented. A modification of the mechanical exfoliation method, which
provides higher yield of atomically thin flakes than conventional mechanical exfoliation, has
been developed. We present general guidelines to determine the number of layers using optical microscopy,
Raman spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy in a fast and reliable way. Moreover,
we demonstrate that the exfoliated flakes are highly crystalline and that they are stable even in
free-standing form through Raman spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy measurements.
A strong thickness dependence of the band structure is found by density functional theory calculations.
The exciton binding energy, within an effective mass approximation, is also calculated for different
number of layers. Our computational results for the optical gap are consistent with preliminary
photoluminescence results on thin flakes. Finally, we study the environmental stability of black
phosphorus flakes finding that the flakes are very hydrophilic and that long term exposure to air
moisture etches black phosphorus away. Nonetheless, we demonstrate that the aging of the flakes
is slow enough to allow fabrication of field-effect transistors with strong ambipolar behavior.
Density functional theory calculations also give us insight into the water-induced changes of
the structural and electronic properties of black phosphorus.
