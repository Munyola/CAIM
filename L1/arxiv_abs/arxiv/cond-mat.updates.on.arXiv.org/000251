Three dimensional topological superconductors (TScs) protected by time reversal (T) symmetry
are characterized by gapless Majorana cones on their surface. Free fermion phases with this symmetry
(class DIII) are indexed by an integer n, of which n=1 is realized by the B-phase of superfluid Helium-3.
Previously it was believed that the surface must be gapless unless time reversal symmetry is broken.
Here we argue that a fully symmetric and gapped surface is possible in the presence of strong interactions,
if a special type of topological order appears on the surface. The topological order realizes T symmetry
in an anomalous way, one that is impossible to achieve in purely two dimensions. For odd n TScs, the
surface topological order must be non-Abelian. We propose the simplest non-Abelian topological
order that contains electron like excitations, SO(3)_6, with four quasiparticles, as a candidate
surface state. Remarkably, this theory has a hidden T invariance which however is broken in any 2D
realization. By explicitly constructing an exactly soluble Walker-Wang model we show that it can
be realized at the surface of a 3D system with T symmetry. We also propose an Abelian theory, the semion-fermion
topological order, to realize an even n TSc surface, for which an explicit model is derived using
a coupled layer construction. Both phases require electrons to transform as Kramers pairs, i.e.
T^2=-1 under time reversal. New topological phases of interacting fermions, based on bosonic topological
states, are shown to introduce a Z2 extension to the set of phases in this symmetry class.
