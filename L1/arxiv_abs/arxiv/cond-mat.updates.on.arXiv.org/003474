Shape Memory Alloys (SMAs) are materials with the ability to recover apparently permanent deformation
under specific thermomechanical loading. The majority of constitutive models for SMAs are developed
based on the infinitesimal strain theory. However, such assumption may not be proper in the presence
of geometric discontinuities, such as cracks, and repeated cycling loading that has been reported
to induce irrecoverable strains up to 20% due to transformation induced plasticity. In addition
to finite strains, SMA-based devices may also undergo large rotations. Thus, it is indispensable
to develop a constitutive model based on the finite strain to provide accurate predictions of these
actuators response. A three-dimensional phenomenological constitutive model for SMAs considering
finite strains and finite rotations is proposed in this work. This model utilizes the logarithmic
strain as the strain measure that is the strain measure whose logarithmic rate in a corotating material
frame is equal to the rate of deformation tensor. In the proposed model, the martensitic volume fraction
and the second-order logarithmic transformation strain tensor are chosen as the internal state
variables associated with the inelastic transformation process. Numerical simulations considering
basic SMAs component geometries such as a bar, a beam, and a torque tube are performed to test the capabilities
of the proposed model under both mechanically and thermally induced phase transformation. The
presented model formulation will be extended in future work for the incorporation of transformation-induced
plasticity.
