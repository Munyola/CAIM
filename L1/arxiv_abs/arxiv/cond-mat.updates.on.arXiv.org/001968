Unusual behavior of quantum materials commonly arises from their effective low-dimensional physics,
which reflects the underlying anisotropy in the spin and charge degrees of freedom. Torque magnetometry
is a highly sensitive technique to directly quantify the anisotropy in quantum materials, such
as the layered high-T$_c$ superconductors, anisotropic quantum spin-liquids, and the surface
states of topological insulators. Here we introduce the magnetotropic coefficient $k=\partial^2
F/\partial \theta^2$, the second derivative of the free energy F with respect to the angle $\theta$
between the sample and the applied magnetic field, and report a simple and effective method to experimentally
detect it. A sub-$\mu$g crystallite is placed at the tip of a commercially available atomic force
microscopy cantilever, and we show that $k$ can be quantitatively inferred from a shift in the resonant
frequency under magnetic field. While related to the magnetic torque $\tau=\partial F/\partial
\theta$, $k$ takes the role of torque susceptibility, and thus provides distinct insights into
anisotropic materials akin to the difference between magnetization and magnetic susceptibility.
The thermodynamic coefficient $k$ is discontinuous at second-order phase transitions and subject
to Ehrenfest relations with the specific heat and magnetic susceptibility. We apply this simple
yet quantitative method on the exemplary cases of the Weyl-semimetal NbP and the spin-liquid candidate
RuCl$_3$, yet it is broadly applicable in quantum materials research.
