Crystal structure imperfections in solids often act as efficient carrier trapping centers which,
when suitably isolated, act as sources of single photon emission. The best known examples of such
attractive imperfections are wellwidth or composition fluctuations in semiconductor heterostructures
(resulting in a formation of quantum dots) and coloured centers in wide bandgap (e. g., diamond)
materials. In the case of recently investigated thin films of layered compounds, the crystal imperfections
may logically be expected to appear at the edges of commonly investigated few-layer flakes of these
materials, exfoliated on alien substrates. Here, we report on comprehensive optical microspectroscopy
studies of thin layers of tungsten diselenide, WSe2, a representative semiconducting dichalcogenide
with a bandgap in the visible spectral range. At the edges of WSe2 flakes, transferred onto Si/SiO2
substrates, we discover centers which, at low temperatures, give rise to sharp emission lines (0.1
meV linewidth). These narrow emission lines reveal the effect of photon antibunching, the unambiguous
attribute of single photon emitters. The optical response of these emitters is inherently linked
to two-dimensional properties of the WSe2 monolayer, as they both give rise to luminescence in the
same energy range, have nearly identical excitation spectra and very similar, characteristically
large Zeeman effects. With advances in the structural control of edge imperfections, thin films
of WSe2 may provide added functionalities, relevant for the domain of quantum optoelectronics.
