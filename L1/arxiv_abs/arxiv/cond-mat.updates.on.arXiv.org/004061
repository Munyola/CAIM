Characterizing the role of grain boundaries and grain orientation has remained an ongoing challenge
in the field of halide perovskite semiconductors. We use electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD)
images to map the local crystal orientations in CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPI) thin films, allowing identification
of grains and grain boundaries. Although this grain structure is broadly consistent with the structures
visible in conventional scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and optical microscopy data, the inverse
pole figure (IPF) maps taken with EBSD reveal subtle internal crystal orientation variations of
the grain structure. This local crystal misorientation leads to orientation spread within grains
indicating the presence of local strain which varies from one grain to the next. Furthermore, we
use crystallographic identification to demonstrate the presence of sub-grain boundaries and
their location within grains. To quantify the impact of local grain structure on the local optoelectronic
properties, we also acquire co-aligned confocal optical photoluminescence (PL) microscopy images
on the same MAPI samples used for EBSD. By correlating the optical and EBSD data, we find that the PL
is anticorrelated with the local grain orientation spread taken near the film surface, suggesting
that grains with higher degrees of crystalline orientational heterogeneity exhibit more non-radiative
recombination. These results provide critical insight into the interplay between local crystal
orientation heterogeneity and local non-radiative recombination in halide perovskite thin films.
