Previous theoretical calculations show azetidinium has the right radial size to form a 3D perovskite
with lead halides [1], and has been shown to impart, as the A-site cation of ABX3 unit, beneficial
properties to ferroelectric perovskites [2]. However, there has been very limited research into
its use as the cation in lead halide perovskites to date. In this communication we report the synthesis
and characterization of azetidinium-based lead mixed halide perovskite colloidal nanocrystals.
The mixed halide system is iodine and chlorine unlike other reported nanocrystals in the literature
where the halide systems are either iodine/bromine or bromine/chlorine. UV-visible absorbance
data, complemented with photoluminescence spectroscopy, reveals an indirect-bandgap of about
1.96 eV for our nanocrystals. Structural characterization using TEM shows two distinct interatomic
distances (2.98 +/- 0.15 Angstroms and 3.43 +/- 0.16 Angstroms) and non-orthogonal lattice angles
(approximately 112 degrees) intrinsic to the nanocrystals with a probable triclinic structure
revealed by XRD. The presence of chlorine and iodine within the nanocrystals is confirmed by EDS
spectroscopy. Finally, light-induced electron paramagnetic resonance (LEPR) spectroscopy
with PCBM confirms the photoinduced charge transfer capabilities of the nanocrystals. The formation
of such semiconducting lead mixed halide perovskite using azetidinium as the cation suggests a
promising subclass of hybrid perovskites holding potential for optoelectronic applications
such as in solar cells and photodetectors.
