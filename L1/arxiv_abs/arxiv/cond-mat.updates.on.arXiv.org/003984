Simple intersections between one-dimensional channels can act as coherent beam splitters for
non-interacting electrons. Here we examine how coherent splitting at such intersections is affected
by inter-particle interactions, in the special case of an intersection of topological edge states.
We derive an effective impurity model which represents the edge-state intersection within Luttinger
liquid theory at low energy. For Luttinger K = 1 / 2 , we compute the exact time-dependent expectation
values of the charge density as well as the density-density correlation functions. In general a
single incoming charge density wave packet will split into four outgoing wave packets with transmission
and reflection coefficients depending on the strengths of the tunnelling processes between the
wires at the junction. We find that when multiple charge density wave packets from different directions
pass through the intersection at the same time, reflection and splitting of the packets depend on
the relative phases of the waves. Active use of this phase-dependent splitting of wave packets may
make Luttinger interferometry possible. We also find that coherent incident packets generally
suffer partial decoherence from the intersection, with some of their initially coherent signal
being transferred into correlated quantum noise. In an extreme case four incident coherent wave
packets can be transformed entirely into density-density correlations, with the charge density
itself having zero expectation value everywhere in the final state.
