We focus on a broad class of tetragonal itinerant systems sharing a tendency towards the spontaneous
formation of incommensurate magnetism with ordering wavevectors $\mathbf{Q}_{1,2}=(\pi-\delta,0)/(0,\pi-\delta)$
or $\mathbf{Q}_{1,2}=(\pi,\delta)/(-\delta,\pi)$. Employing a Landau approach, we obtain
the generic magnetic phase diagram and identify the leading instabilities near the paramagnetic-magnetic
transition. Nine distinct magnetic phases exist that either preserve or violate the assumed C$_4$-symmetry
of the paramagnetic phase. These are single- and double-$\mathbf{Q}$ phases consisting of magnetic
stripes, helices and whirls, either in an individual or coexisting manner. These nine phases can
be experimentally distinguished by polarized neutron scattering, or, for example, by combining
measurements of the induced charge order and magnetoelectric coupling. Within a representative
five-orbital model we find that the incommensurate magnetic phases discussed here are accessible
in iron-based superconductors. Thus, our investigation unveils a set of potential candidates
for the unidentified C$_2$-symmetric magnetic phase that was recently observed in Ba$_{1-x}$Na$_x$Fe$_{2}$As$_{2}$.
We further show that orbital selectivity can stabilize a C$_4$-symmetric spin-whirl crystal phase
in the hole-doped regime. The possible experimental observation of textured magnetic phases in
FeSCs, which have been verified to support microscopic coexistence of various magnetic phases
and spin-singlet superconductivity, opens new directions for realizing intrinsic topological
SCs.
