We present a new measurement method which can be used to image gap nodal structure of superconductors
whose pairing symmetry is under debate. This technique utilizes a high quality factor microwave
resonance involving the sample of interest. While supporting a circularly symmetric standing
wave current pattern, the sample is perturbed by a scanned laser beam, creating a photoresponse
that was previously shown to reveal the superconducting gap anisotropy. Simulation and the measurement
of the photoresponse of an unpatterned Nb film show less than 8\% anisotropy, as expected for a superconductor
with nearly isotropic energy gap along with expected systematic uncertainty. On the other hand,
measurement of a YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$ thin film shows a clear 4-fold symmetric image with
$\mathtt{\sim}12.5$\% anisotropy, indicating the well-known 4-fold symmetric $d_{x^2-y^2}$
gap nodal structure in the $ab$-plane. The deduced gap nodal structure can be further cross-checked
by low temperature surface impedance data, which is simultaneously measured. The important advantage
of the presented method over the previous spiral resonator method is that it does not require a complicated
lithographic patterning process which limits one from testing various kinds of materials due to
photoresponse arising from patterning defects. This advantage of the presented technique, and
the ability to measure unpatterned samples such as planar thin films and single crystals, enables
one to survey the pairing symmetry of a wide variety of unconventional superconductors.
