The interplay of competing orders is relevant to high-temperature superconductivity known to
emerge upon suppression of a parent antiferromagnetic order typically via charge doping. How such
interplay evolves at low temperature---in particular at what doping level the zero-temperature
quantum critical point (QCP) is located---is still elusive because it is masked by the superconducting
state. The QCP had long been believed to follow a smooth extrapolation of the characteristic temperature
$T^*$ for the strange normal state well above the superconducting transition temperature. However,
recently the $T^*$ within the superconducting dome was reported to unexpectedly exhibit back-bending
likely in the cuprate Bi$_{2}$Sr$_{2}$CaCu$_{2}$O$_{8+\delta}$. Here we show that the original
and revised phase diagrams can be understood in terms of weak and moderate competitions, respectively,
between superconductivity and a pseudogap state such as $d$-density-wave or spin-density-wave,
based on both Ginzburg-Landau theory and the realistic $t$-$t^{\prime}$-$t^{\prime\prime}$-$J$-$V$
model for the cuprates. We further found that the calculated temperature and doping-level dependence
of the quasiparticle spectral gap and Raman response qualitatively agrees with the experiments.
In particular, the $T^*$ back-bending can provide a simple explanation of the observed anomalous
two-step thermal evolution dominated by the superconducting gap and the pseudogap, respectively.
Our results imply that the revised phase diagram is likely to take place in high-temperature superconductors.
