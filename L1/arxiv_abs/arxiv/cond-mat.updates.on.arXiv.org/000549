We propose an analog superconducting quantum simulator for a one-dimensional model featuring
momentum-dependent (nonlocal) electron-phonon couplings of Su-Schrieffer-Heeger and "breathing-mode"
types. Because its corresponding vertex function depends on both the electron- and phonon quasimomenta,
this model does not belong to the realm of validity of the Gerlach-L\"{o}wen theorem that rules out
any nonanalyticities in single-particle properties. The superconducting circuit behind the
proposed simulator entails an array of transmon qubits and microwave resonators. By applying microwave
driving fields to the qubits, a small-polaron Bloch state with an arbitrary quasimomentum can be
prepared in this system within times several orders of magnitude shorter than the typical qubit
decoherence times. We demonstrate that in this system -- by varying the circuit parameters -- one
can readily reach the critical coupling strength required for observing the sharp transition from
a nondegenerate (single-particle) ground state corresponding to zero quasimomentum ($K_{\textrm{gs}}=0$)
to a twofold-degenerate small-polaron ground state at nonzero quasimomenta $K_{\textrm{gs}}$
and $-K_{\textrm{gs}}$. Through exact numerical diagonalization of our effective Hamiltonian,
we show how this nonanalyticity is reflected in the relevant single-particle properties (ground-state
energy, quasiparticle residue, average number of phonons). The proposed setup provides an ideal
testbed for studying quantum dynamics of polaron formation in systems with strongly momentum-dependent
electron-phonon interactions.
