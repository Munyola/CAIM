Semiconductor nanowires such as InAs and InSb are promising materials for studying Majorana zero-modes
and demonstrating non-Abelian particle exchange relevant for topological quantum computing.
While evidence for Majorana bound states in nanowires has been shown, the majority of these experiments
are marked by significant disorder. In particular, the interfacial inhomogeneity between the
superconductor and nanowire is strongly believed to be the main culprit for disorder and the resulting
soft superconducting gap ubiquitous in tunneling studies of hybrid semiconductor-superconductor
systems. Additionally, a lack of ballistic transport in nanowire systems can create bound states
that mimic Majorana signatures. We resolve these problems through the development of selective-area
epitaxy of Al to InSb nanowires, a technique applicable to other nanowires and superconductors.
Epitaxial InSb-Al devices generically possess a hard superconducting gap and demonstrate ballistic
1D superconductivity and near perfect transmission of supercurrents in the single mode regime,
requisites for engineering and controlling 1D topological superconductivity. Additionally,
we demonstrate that epitaxial InSb-Al superconducting island devices, the building blocks for
Majorana based quantum computing applications, prepared using selective area epitaxy can achieve
micron scale ballistic 1D transport. Our results pave the way for the development of networks of
ballistic superconducting electronics for quantum device applications.
