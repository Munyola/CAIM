We study fermion-parity-changing quantum phase transitions (QPTs) in platform Josephson junctions.
These QPTs, associated with zero-energy bound states, are rather widely observed experimentally.
They emerge from numerical calculations frequently without detailed microscopic insight. Importantly,
they may incorrectly lend support to claims for the observations of Majorana zero modes. In this
paper we present a fully self consistent solution of the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations and show
how this consistency provides insights into the origin of the QPTs. This is enabled by an analysis
of the spatially-dependent induced magnetization throughout the junction. The junctions we consider
can have an arbitrary phase difference and are chosen to mirror conventional, proximitized Josephson
experiments; they contain two superconducting leads (separated by a thin insulator). The leads
induce superconductivity in a fourth substrate medium which incorporates both Zeeman and spin-orbit
coupling as required for a topological phase. We find, quite generally, the wavefunctions of the
zero-energy bound states are confined to regions with magnetization inhomogeneities and exist
almost exclusively inside the substrate medium where the magnetization is large. We interpret
this to suggest that these parity-changing QPTs derive from physics involving spatially extended
magnetic "impurities". Our results suggest more generally that QPTs in Josephson junctions generally
do not require the existence of spin-orbit coupling and should not be confused with, nor are they
indicators of, Majorana physics.
