Oscillations are a hallmark of neural population activity in various brain regions with a spectrum
covering a wide range of frequencies. Within this spectrum gamma oscillations have received particular
attention due to their ubiquitous nature and to their correlation with higher brain functions.
Recently, it has been reported that gamma oscillations in the hippocampus of behaving rodents are
segregated in two distinct frequency bands: slow and fast. These two gamma rhythms correspond to
dfferent states of the network, but their origin has been not yet clarified. Here, we show theoretically
and numerically that a single inhibitory population can give rise to coexisting slow and fast gamma
rhythms corresponding to collective oscillations of a balanced spiking network. The slow and fast
gamma rhythms are generated via two different mechanisms: the fast one being driven by the coordinated
tonic neural firing and the slow one by endogenous fluctuations due to irregular neural activity.
We show that almost instantaneous stimulations can switch the collective gamma oscillations from
slow to fast and vice versa. Furthermore, to make a closer contact with the experimental observations,
we consider the modulation of the gamma rhythms induced by a slower (theta) rhythm driving the network
dynamics. In this context, depending on the strength of the forcing, we observe phase-amplitude
and phase-phase coupling between the fast and slow gamma oscillations and the theta forcing. Phase-phase
coupling reveals different theta-phases preferences for the two coexisting gamma rhythms.
