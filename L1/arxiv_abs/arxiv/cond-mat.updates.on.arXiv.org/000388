We study the non-equilibrium dynamics of quenching through a quantum critical point in topological
systems, focusing on one of their defining features: ground state degeneracies and associated
topological sectors. We present the notion of 'topological blocking', experienced by the dynamics
due to a mismatch in degeneracies between two phases and we argue that the dynamic evolution of the
quench depends strongly on the topological sector being probed. We demonstrate this interplay
between quench and topology in models stemming from two extensively studied systems, the transverse
Ising chain and the Kitaev honeycomb model. Through non-local maps of each of these systems, we effectively
study spinless fermionic $p$-wave paired superconductors. Confining the systems to ring and toroidal
geometries, respectively, enables us to cleanly address degeneracies, subtle issues of fermion
occupation and parity, and mismatches between topological sectors. We show that various features
of the quench, which are related to Kibble-Zurek physics, are sensitive to the topological sector
being probed, in particular, the overlap between the time-evolved initial ground state and an appropriate
low-energy state of the final Hamiltonian. While most of our study is confined to translationally
invariant systems, where momentum is a convenient quantum number, we briefly consider the effect
of disorder and illustrate how this can influence the quench in a qualitatively different way depending
on the topological sector considered.
