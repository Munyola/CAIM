Out of equilibrium relaxation processes show aging if they become slower as time passes. Aging processes
are ubiquitous and play a fundamental role in the physics of glasses and spin glasses and in other
applications (e.g. in algorithms minimizing complex cost/loss functions). The theory of aging
in the out of equilibrium dynamics of mean-field spin glass models has achieved a fundamental role,
thanks to the asymptotic analytic solution found by Cugliandolo and Kurchan. However this solution
is based on assumptions (e.g. the weak ergodicity breaking hypothesis) which have never been put
under a strong test until now. In the present work we present the results of an extraordinary large
set of numerical simulations of the prototypical mean-field spin glass models, namely the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick
and the Viana-Bray models. Thanks to a very intensive use of GPUs, we have been able to run the latter
model for more than $2^{64}$ spin updates and thus safely extrapolate the numerical data both in
the thermodynamical limit and in the large times limit. The measurements of the two-times correlation
functions in isothermal aging after a quench from a random initial configuration to a temperature
$T<T_c$ provides clear evidence that, at large times, such correlations do not decay to zero as expected
by assuming weak ergodicity breaking. We conclude that strong ergodicity breaking takes place
in mean-field spin glasses aging dynamics which, asymptotically, takes place in a confined configurational
space. Theoretical models for the aging dynamics need to be revised accordingly.
