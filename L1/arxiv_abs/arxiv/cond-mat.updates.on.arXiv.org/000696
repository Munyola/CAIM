A theory for hot-electron cooling by acoustic (APs) and optical (OPs) phonons is developed in monolayers
of MoS2. The cooling power P is investigated as a function of electron temperature $T_e$ and carrier
density $n$ taking into account all the relevant electron-phonon (el-ph) couplings. $P$ due to
APs is dominant at low $T_e$ and the cross over to OP dominated cooling happens at $T_e\sim 50$-$75$
K. The unscreened deformation potential (DP) coupling to the TA phonon is shown to dominate $P$ due
to acoustic phonon scattering over the entire temperature and density range considered. The cooling
power due to screened DP coupling to the LA phonon and screened piezoelectric (PE) coupling to the
TA and LA phonons is orders of magnitude lower. In the Bloch-Gruneisen (BG) regime, $P\sim T_e^4$
($P\sim T_e^6$) and $P\sim n^{-1/2}$ are predicted for unscreened (screened) el-ph interaction.
With increasing $T_e$, the exponent decreases to smaller values of nearly 1. The cooling power due
to OPs is dominated by zero-order deformation potential and Frohlich interactions and is found
to be significantly reduced by the hot-phonon effect at large values for the phonon-relaxation
time due to phonon-phonon scattering $\tau_\text{ph}$ and $n$. The dependence of the optical phonon
lifetime due to el-ph scattering, the effective hot-phonon temperature and hence the hot-phonon
distribution function on carrier density $n$ and $T_e$ is also studied. These results for monolayer
MoS2 are compared with those in conventional two-dimensional electron gases (2DEGs) and graphene.
