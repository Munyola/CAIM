We have investigated the structural, magnetic, thermodynamic, and charge transport properties
of Mn1/3NbS2 single crystals through x-ray and neutron diffraction, magnetization, specific
heat, magnetoresistance, and Hall effect measurements. Mn1/3NbS2 displays a magnetic transition
at TC ~ 45 K with highly anisotropic behavior expected for a hexagonal structured material. Below
TC, neutron diffraction reveals increased scattering near the structural Bragg peaks having a
wider Q-dependence along the c-axis than the nuclear Bragg peaks. This indicates helimagnetism
with a long pitch length of ~250 nm (or a wavevector q~0.0025 {\AA}-1) along the c-axis. This q is substantially
smaller than that found for the helimagnetic state in isostructural Cr1/3NbS2 (0.015 {\AA}-1).
Specific heat capacity measurements confirm a second-order magnetic phase transition with a substantial
magnetic contribution that persists to low temperature. The large low-temperature specific heat
capacity is consistent with a large density of low-lying magnetic excitations that are likely associated
with topologically interesting magnetic modes. Changes to the magnetoresistance, the magnetization,
and the magnetic neutron diffraction, which become more apparent below 20 K, imply a modification
in the character of the magnetic ordering corresponding to the magnetic contribution to the specific
heat capacity. These observations signify a more complex magnetic structure both at zero and finite
fields for Mn1/3NbS2 than for the well-investigated Cr1/3NbS2.
