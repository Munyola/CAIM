We consider a recent proposal for a physical realization of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model in
the zeroth-Landau-level sector of an irregularly-shaped graphene flake. We study in detail charge
transport signatures of the unique non-Fermi liquid state of such a quantum dot coupled to non-interacting
leads. The properties of this setup depend essentially on the ratio $p$ between the number of transverse
modes in the lead $M$ and the number of the fermion degrees of freedom $N$ on the SYK dot. This ratio
can be tuned via the magnetic field applied to the dot. Our proposed setup gives access to the non-trivial
conformal-invariant regime associated with the SYK model as well as a more conventional Fermi-liquid
regime via tuning the field. The dimensionless linear response conductance acquires distinct
$\sqrt{p}$ and $1/\sqrt{p}$ dependencies for the two phases respectively in the low-temperature
limit, with a universal jump at the transition. We find that corrections scale linearly and quadratically
in either temperature or frequency on the two sides of the transition. In the weak tunneling regime
we find differential conductance proportional to the inverse square root of the applied voltage
bias $U$. This dependence is replaced by a conventional Ohmic behavior with constant conductance
proportional to $1/\sqrt{T}$ for bias energy $eU$ smaller than temperature scale $k_BT$. We also
describe the out-of-equilibrium current-bias characteristics and discuss various crossovers
between the limiting behaviors mentioned above.
