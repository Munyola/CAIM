The observation of room temperature sub-60 mV/dec subthreshold slope (SS) in MOSFETs with ferroelectric
(FE) layers in the gate stacks or in series with the gate has attracted much attention. Recently,
we modeled this effect in the framework of a FE polarization switching model. However, there is a
large amount of literature attributing this effect to a stabilization of quasi-static (QS) negative
capacitance (NC) in the FE. The technological implications of a stabilized non-switching (NS)
QSNC model vs a FE switching model are vastly different; the latter precluding applications to sub-60
mV/dec SS scaled CMOS due to speed limitations and power dissipated in switching. In this letter,
we provide a thorough analysis assessing the foundations of models of QSNC, identifying which specific
assumptions (ansatz) may be unlikely or unphysical, and analyzing their applicability. We show
that it is not reasonable to expect QSNC for two separate capacitors connected in series (with a metal
plate between dielectric (DE) and FE layers). We propose a model clarifying under which conditions
a QS "apparent NC" for a FE layer in a FE-DE bi-layer stack may be observed, quantifying the requirements
of strong interface polarization coupling in addition to capacitance matching. In this regime,
our model suggests the FE layer does not behave as a NC layer, simply, the coupling leads to both the
DE and FE behaving as high-k DE with similar permittivities. This may be useful for scaled EOT devices
but does not lead to sub-60 mV/dec SS.
