We present non-equilibrium physics in spin ice as a novel setting which combines kinematic constraints,
emergent topological defects, and magnetic long range Coulomb interactions. In spin ice, magnetic
frustration leads to highly degenerate yet locally constrained ground states. Together, they
form a highly unusual magnetic state -- a "Coulomb phase" -- whose excitations are pointlike defects
-- magnetic monopoles -- in the absence of which effectively no dynamics is possible. Hence, when
they are sparse at low temperature, dynamics becomes very sluggish. When quenching the system from
a monopole-rich to a monopole-poor state, a wealth of dynamical phenomena occur the exposition
of which is the subject of this article. Most notably, we find reaction diffusion behaviour, slow
dynamics due to kinematic constraints, as well as a regime corresponding to the deposition of interacting
dimers on a honeycomb lattice. We also identify new potential avenues for detecting the magnetic
monopoles in a regime of slow-moving monopoles. The interest in this model system is further enhanced
by its large degree of tunability, and the ease of probing it in experiment: with varying magnetic
fields at different temperatures, geometric properties -- including even the effective dimensionality
of the system -- can be varied. By monitoring magnetisation, spin correlations or zero-field Nuclear
Magnetic Resonance, the dynamical properties of the system can be extracted in considerable detail.
This establishes spin ice as a laboratory of choice for the study of tunable, slow dynamics.
