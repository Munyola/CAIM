We study a large $N$ tensor model with $O(N)^3$ symmetry containing two flavors of Majorana fermions,
$\psi_1^{abc}$ and $\psi_2^{abc}$. We also study its random counterpart consisting of two coupled
Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev models, each one containing $N_{\rm SYK}$ Majorana fermions. In these models
we assume tetrahedral quartic Hamiltonians which depend on a real coupling parameter $\alpha$.
We find a duality relation between two Hamiltonians with different values of $\alpha$, which allows
us to restrict the model to the range of $-1\leq \alpha\leq 1/3$. The scaling dimension of the fermion
number operator $Q=i\psi_1^{abc} \psi_2^{abc}$ is complex and of the form $1/2 +i f(\alpha)$ in
the range $-1\leq \alpha<0$, indicating an instability of the conformal phase. Using Schwinger-Dyson
equations to solve for the Green functions, we show that in the true low-temperature phase this operator
acquires an expectation value. This demonstrates the breaking of an anti-unitary particle-hole
symmetry and other discrete symmetries. We also calculate spectra of the coupled SYK models for
values of $N_{\rm SYK}$ where exact diagonalizations are possible. For negative $\alpha$ we find
a gap separating the two lowest energy states from the rest of the spectrum; this leads to exponential
decay of the zero-temperature correlation functions. For $N_{\rm SYK}$ divisible by $4$, the two
lowest states have a small splitting. They become degenerate in the large $N_{\rm SYK}$ limit, as
expected from the spontaneous breaking of a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry.
