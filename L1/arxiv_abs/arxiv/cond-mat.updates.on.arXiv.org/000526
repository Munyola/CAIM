Understanding the roles of the temporary and spatial structures of quantum functional noise in
open multilevel quantum molecular systems attracts a lot of theoretical interests. I want to establish
a rigorous and general framework for functional quantum noises from the constructive and computational
perspectives, $\it{i.e.}$ how to generate the random trajectories to reproduce the kernel and
path ordering of the influence functional with effective Monte Carlo methods for arbitrary spectral
densities. This construction approach aims to unify the existing stochastic models to rigorously
describe the temporary and spatial structure of Gaussian quantum noises. In this paper, I review
the Euclidean imaginary time influence functional and propose the stochastic matrix multiplication
scheme to calculate reduced equilibrium density matrices (REDM). In addition, I review and discuss
the Feynman-Vernom influence functional according to the Gaussian quadratic integral, particularly
its imaginary part which is critical to the rigorous description of the quantum detailed balance.
As a result, I establish the conditions under which the influence functional can be interpreted
as the average of exponential functional operator over real-valued Gaussian processes for open
multilevel quantum systems. I also show the difference between the local and nonlocal phonons within
this framework. With the stochastic matrix multiplication scheme, I compare the normalized REDM
with the Boltzmann equilibrium distribution for open multilevel quantum systems.
