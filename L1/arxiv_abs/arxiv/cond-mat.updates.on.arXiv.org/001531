Bosonization provides a powerful analytical framework to deal with one-dimensional strongly
interacting fermion systems, which makes it a cornerstone in quantum many-body theory. Yet, this
success comes at the expense of using effective infrared parameters, and restricting the description
to low energy states near the Fermi level. We propose a radical extension of the bosonization technique
that overcomes both limitations, allowing computations with microscopic lattice Hamiltonians,
from the Fermi level down to the bottom of the band. The formalism rests on the simple idea of representing
the fermion kinetic term in the energy domain, after which it can be expressed in terms of free bosonic
degrees of freedom. As a result, one- and two-body fermionic scattering processes generate anharmonic
boson-boson interactions, even in the forward channel. We show that up to moderate interaction
strengths, these nonlinearities can be treated analytically at all energy scales, using the x-ray
emission problem as a showcase. In the strong interaction regime, we employ a systematic variational
solution of the bosonic theory, and obtain results that agree quantitatively with an exact diagonalization
of the original one-particle fermionic model. This provides a proof of the fully microscopic character
of bosonization on all energy scales for an arbitrary band structure. Besides recovering the known
x-ray edge singularity at the emission threshold, we find strong signatures of correlations even
at emission frequencies beyond the band bottom.
