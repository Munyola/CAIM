The problem of quantum turbulence in a channel with an inhomogeneous counterflow of superfluid
turbulent helium is studied. \ The counterflow velocity $V_{ns}^{x}(y)$ along the channel is supposed
to have a parabolic profile in the transverse direction $y$. Such statement corresponds to the recent
numerical simulation by Khomenko et al. [Phys. Rev. B \textbf{91}, 180504 (2015)]. The authors
reported about a sophisticated behavior of the vortex line density (VLD) $\mathcal{L}(\mathbf{r},t)$,
different from $% \mathcal{L}\propto V_{ns}^{x}(y)^{2}$, which follows from the naive, straightforward
application of the conventional Vinen theory. It is clear, that Vinen theory should be refined by
taking into account transverse effects and the way it ought to be done is the subject of active discussion
in the literature. In the work we discuss several possible mechanisms of the transverse flux of VLD
$\mathcal{L}(\mathbf{r},t)$ which should be incorporated in the standard Vinen equation to describe
adequately the inhomogeneous quantum turbulence (QT). It is shown that the most effective among
these mechanisms is the one that is related to the phase slippage phenomenon. The use of this flux
in the modernized Vinen equation corrects the situation with an unusual distribution of the vortex
line density, and satisfactory describes the behavior $\mathcal{L}(\mathbf{r},t)$ both in stationary
and nonstationary situations. The general problem of the phenomenological Vinen theory in the
case of nonuniform and nonstationary quantum turbulence is thoroughly discussed.
