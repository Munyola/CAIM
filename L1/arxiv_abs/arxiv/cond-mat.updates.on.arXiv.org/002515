The incompressible Stokes equations can classically be recast in a boundary integral (BI) representation,
which provides a general method to solve low-Reynolds number problems analytically and computationally.
Alternatively, one can solve the Stokes equations by using an appropriate distribution of flow
singularities of the right strength within the boundary, a method particularly useful to describe
the dynamics of long slender objects for which the numerical implementation of the BI representation
becomes cumbersome. While the BI approach is a mathematical consequence of the Stokes equations,
the singularity method involves making judicious guesses that can only be justified a posteriori.
In this paper we use matched asymptotic expansions to derive an algebraically accurate slender-body
theory directly from the BI representation able to handle arbitrary surface velocities and surface
tractions. This expansion procedure leads to sets of uncoupled linear equations and to a single
one-dimensional integral equation identical to that derived by Keller and Rubinow (1976) and Johnson
(1979) using the singularity method. Hence we show that it is a mathematical consequence of the BI
approach that the leading-order flow around a slender body can be represented using a distribution
of singularities along its centreline. Furthermore when derived from either the single-layer
or double-layer modified BI representation, general slender solutions are only possible in certain
types of flow, in accordance with the limitations of these representations.
