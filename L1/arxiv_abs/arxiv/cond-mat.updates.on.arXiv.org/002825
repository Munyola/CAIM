We study the effect of impurities on the two types of spin-dimers in the hybrid chain/ladder spin
1/2 quantum magnet Sr$_{14}$Cu$_{24}$O$_{41}$. Four different impurities were used, namely,
the non-magnetic Zn (0.0025 and 0.01 per Cu) and Al (0.0025 and 0.01 per Cu), and magnetic Ni (0.0025
and 0.01 per Cu) and Co (0.01, 0.03, 0.05 and 0.1 per Cu). These impurities were doped in high-quality
single-crystals synthesized by the floating zone method. The magnetic susceptibility of pristine
Sr$_{14}$Cu$_{24}$O$_{41}$ is analyzed rigorously to confirm that at low temperatures (T $<$
5 K), the "free" spins in the chains undergo a long-distance dimerization as proposed in a recent
study [Sahling et al. Nature Phys., \textbf{11}, 255 (2015)]. The effect of impurity on these dimers
is analyzed by measuring the specific heat down to T = 0.06 K. We found that even at the lower impurity
concentration, the long-distance dimers are significantly severed, but the quantum entangled
spin dimerized state of the chains persists. On the other hand, the other type of spin dimers that
forms at relatively higher temperatures via an intervening Zhang-Rice singlet are found to be practically
unaffected at the lower impurity concentration; but at 1\% doping, even these are found to be considerably
severed. The effect of Co impurity turned out to be most unusual displaying a strongly anisotropic
response, and with a dimerization gap that suppresses faster along the chain/ladder direction
than perpendicular to it as a function of increasing Co concentration.
