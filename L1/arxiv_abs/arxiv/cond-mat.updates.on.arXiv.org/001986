Building upon the recently developed formalism of Kinetic Field Theory (KFT) for cosmic structure
formation by Bartelmann et al., we investigate a kinematic relationship between diffusion and
gravitational interactions in cosmic structure formation. In the first part of this work we explain
how the process of structure formation in KFT can be separated into three processes, particle diffusion,
the accumulation of structure due to initial momentum correlations and interactions relative
to the inertial motion of particles. We study these processes by examining the time derivative of
the non-linear density power spectrum in the Born approximation. We observe that diffusion and
accumulation are delicately balanced because of the Gaussian form of the initial conditions, and
that the net diffusion, resulting from adding these two counteracting contributions, approaches
the contributions from the interactions in amplitude over time. This hints at a kinematic relation
between diffusion and interactions in KFT. Indeed, in the second part, we show that the response
of the system to arbitrary gradient forces is directly related to the evolution of particle diffusion
in the form of kinematic fluctuation-dissipation relations (FDRs). This result is independent
of the interaction potential. We show that this relationship roots in a time-reversal symmetry
of the underlying generating functional. Furthermore, our studies demonstrate how FDRs originating
from purely kinematic arguments can be used in theories far from equilibrium.
