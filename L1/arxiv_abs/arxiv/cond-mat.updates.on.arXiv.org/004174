To date, density functional theory (DFT) is one of the most accurate and yet practical theory to gain
insight about materials properties. Although successful, the computational cost is the main hurdle
even today. A way out is combining DFT with machine learning (ML) to reduce the computational cost
without compromising accuracy. However, the success of this approach hinges on the correctness
of the descriptors. In the present work, we demonstrate that, based on only interatomic distances
as descriptors, our ML model predicts interaction energy between an adsorbate and Al cluster with
absolute mean error (AME) $\approx$ 0.05 eV (or less) and reproduces the PES experienced by an incoming
atom. Our extensive DFT calculations reveal that atoms experiencing identical environment within
a cluster have identical interaction energy patterns. This further provides the rationale behind
the choice of descriptors and a proof of concept that our ML model picks up the essence of Hohenberg-Kohn's
first theorem. Further, we demonstrate that our model is not specific to Al clusters, and could be
applied to clusters of different elements as well. Its application to compute PES experienced by
various test atoms and molecules in the vicinity of different clusters proves the transferability
of the model not just to clusters of different elements but also to various molecules. The descriptors
chosen are invariant to rotation, translation, and permutation yet very simple to compute is one
of the most crucial points of the present work.
