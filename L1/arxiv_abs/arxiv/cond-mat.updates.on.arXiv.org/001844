A constant supply of oxygen has been assumed to be necessary for the growth of titanium nanoparticles
by sputtering. This oxygen supply can arise from a high background pressure in the vacuum system
or from a purposely supplied gas. The supply of oxygen makes it difficult to grow metallic nanoparticles
of titanium and can cause process problems by reacting with the target. We here report that growth
of titanium nanoparticles in the metallic hexagonal titanium ({\alpha}Ti) phase is possible using
a pulsed hollow cathode sputter plasma and adding a high partial pressure of helium to the process
instead of trace amounts of oxygen. The helium cools the process gas in which the nanoparticles nucleate.
This is important both for the first dimer formation and the continued growth to a thermodynamically
stable size. The parameter region where the synthesis of nanoparticles is possible is mapped out
experimentally and the theory of the physical process behind this process window is presented.
A limit where no nanoparticles were produced was found below a pressures of 200 Pa, which is attributed
to the low dimer formation rate. A second limit of the process window were found at argon gas flows
above 25 sccm, and is due to a temperature increase within the nucleation zone. These two mechanisms
are in depth explored in a companion paper [1]. A lower process stability limit was also found at low
argon gas partial pressures, which can be attributed to a transition from a hollow cathode discharge
to a glow discharge.
