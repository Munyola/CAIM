The topological properties of the tight-binding model on the breathing kagome lattice are studied.
The lack of inversion centers on the bonds of the kagome lattice allows antisymmetric spin-orbit
(SOC) coupling between nearest-neighbors. Interestingly, the system with such intrinsic SOC
between nearest-neighbors hosts non-trivial topological phases, even without second-nearest-neighbor
hopping. The energy spectrum of the tight-binding model on the kagome lattice has a dispersion-less
band which can also become topological thanks to SOC. We show that the inclusion of Rashba SOC, which
breaks the mirror symmetry, does not hinder the non-trivial phase (in contrast to graphene) but,
on the contrary, makes it possible by itself. We also consider an inversion symmetry-breaking lattice
trimerization term (i.e., the breathing kagome lattice), calculate the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological
index, and draw the full phase diagram considering nearest-neighbor SOC (intrinsic and Rashba)
and lattice trimerization. We find that the pair of flat bands hosts a non-trivial $\mathbb{Z}_2$
topological index, and that the resulting topological phase is remarkably robust to trimerization
for both intrinsic and Rashba SOC thanks to the flat bands. We also consider the same system in the
ferromagnetically spin-polarized limit. We similarly draw the phase diagram corresponding to
the Chern numbers of the bands. We find that in this case too, the flat band is topological in a remarkable
region of the phase diagram, even for large trimerization.
