We study the heat transport along an edge state of a two-dimensional electron gas in the quantum Hall
regime, in contact to two reservoirs at different temperatures. We consider two exactly solvable
models for the edge state coupled to the reservoirs. The first one corresponds to filling $\nu=1$
and tunneling coupling to the reservoirs. The second one corresponds to integer or fractional filling
of the sequence $\nu=1/m$ (with $m$ odd), and capacitive coupling to the reservoirs. In both cases
we solve the problem by means of non-equilibrium Green function formalism. We show that heat propagates
chirally along the edge in the two setups. We identify two temperature regimes, defined by $\Delta$,
the mean level spacing of the edge. At low temperatures, $T< \Delta$, finite size effects play
an important role in heat transport, for both types of contacts. The nature of the contacts manifest
themselves in different power laws for the thermal conductance as a function of the temperature.
For capacitive couplings a highly non-universal behavior takes place, through a prefactor that
depends on the length of the edge as well as on the coupling strengths and the filling fraction. For
larger temperatures, $T>\Delta$, finite-size effects become irrelevant, but the heat transport
strongly depends on the strength of the edge-reservoir interactions, in both cases. The thermal
conductance for tunneling coupling grows linearly with $T$, whereas for the capacitive case it
saturates to a value that depends on the coupling strengths and the filling factors of the edge and
the contacts.
