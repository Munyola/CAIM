We revisit the supercurrent generation mechanism for the type of superconductors whose superconducting
transition temperature is explained by the BCS theory (we call them BCS superconductors). This
revisit is motivated by the reexamination of the ac Josephson effect [H. Koizumi, M. Tachikii, J.
Supercond. Nov. Magn. (2015) 28:61] that indicates the charge on the charge carrier for the ac Josephson
effect is $q=-e$, which strongly suggests that the supercurrent generation mechanism is lacking
in the BCS theory since the charge carrier in the BCS theory is the Cooper pair with $q=-2e$. We present
a new mechanism for the supercurrent generation in BCS superconductors. We first argue that the
origin of the supercurrent generation is the formation of Dirac strings with $pi$ flux inside. Then,
the ground state is not the functional of the electron density at sites alone (assumed by the density
functional theory), but also the Berry connection between sites that ensures the conservation
of charge and the single-valuedness of the wave function. The $pi$-flux Dirac strings are realized
when the Rashba spin-orbit interaction is added to the BCS model. The Rashba spin-orbit interaction
modifies the electron pairing from the original BCS one to the pairing of spin-twisting circular
itinerant motion states. Then, the energy minimizing wave function becomes multi-valued with
respect to electron coordinates due to the sign-change of the wave function around the centers of
spin-twisting, and the lines composed of the centers of spin-twisting become the $pi$-flux Dirac
strings.
