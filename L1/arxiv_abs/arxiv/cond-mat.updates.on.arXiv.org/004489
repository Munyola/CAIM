Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) exist in various crystal structures with semiconducting,
semi-metallic, and metallic properties. The dynamic control of these phases is of immediate interest
for next generation electronics such as phase change memories. Of the binary Mo and W-based TMDs,
MoTe2 is attractive for electronic applications because it has the lowest energy difference (40
meV) between the semiconducting (2H) and semi-metallic (1T') phases, allowing for MoTe2 phase
change by electrostatic doping. Here we report phase change between the 2H and 1T' polymorphs of
MoTe2 in thicknesses ranging from the monolayer case to effective bulk (73nm) using an ionic liquid
electrolyte at room temperature and in air. We find consistent evidence of a partially reversible
2H-1T' transition using in-situ Raman spectroscopy where the phase change occurs in the top-most
layers of the MoTe2 flake. We find a thickness-dependent transition voltage where higher voltages
are necessary to drive the phase change for thicker flakes. We also show evidence of electrochemical
activity during the gating process by observation of Te metal deposition. This finding suggests
the formation of Te vacancies which have been reported to lower the energy difference between the
2H and 1T' phase, potentially aiding the phase change process. Our discovery that the phase change
can be achieved on the surface layer of bulk materials reveals that this electrochemical mechanism
does not require isolation of a single layer and the effect may be more broadly applicable than previously
thought.
