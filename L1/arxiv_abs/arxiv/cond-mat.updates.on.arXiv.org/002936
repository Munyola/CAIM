Highly concentrated or 'dense" particle suspensions can undergo a sharp increase in viscosity,
or shear thickening, under applies stress. Understanding the fundamental features leading to
such rheological changes in dense suspensions is crucial to optimize flow conditions or to design
flow modifiers for slurry processing. While local changes to the particle environment under an
applied shear can be related to changes in viscosity, there is a broader need to connect the shear
thickening transition to the fundamental organization of particle-interaction forces which
lead to long-range organization. In particular, at a high volume fraction of particles, recent
evidence indicates frictional forces between contacting particles is of importance. Herein,
the network of frictional contact forces is analyzed within simulated two-dimensional shear thickening
suspensions. Two topological metrics are studied to characterize the response of the contact force
network (CFN) under varying applied shear stress. The metrics, geodesic index and the void parameter,
reflect complementary aspects of the CFN: one is the connectedness of the contact network and the
second is the distribution of spatial areas devoid of particle-particle contacts. Considered
in relation to the variation of the viscosity, the topological metrics show that the network grows
homogeneously at large scales but with many local regions devoid of contacts, indicating clearly
the role of stress chain growth in causing the large change in the rheological response at the shear
thickening transition.
