The binary Re$_{1-x}$Mo$_x$ alloys, known to cover the full range of solid solutions, were successfully
synthesized and their crystal structures and physical properties investigated via powder x-ray
diffraction, electrical resistivity, magnetic susceptibility, and heat capacity. By varying
the Re/Mo ratio we explore the full Re$_{1-x}$Mo$_x$ binary phase diagram, in all its four different
solid phases: hcp-Mg ($P6_3/mmc$), $\alpha$-Mn ($I\overline{4}3m$), $\beta$-CrFe ($P4_2/mnm$),
and bcc-W ($Im\overline{3}m$), of which the second is non-centrosymmetric with the rest being
centrosymmetric. All Re$_{1-x}$Mo$_x$ alloys are superconductors, whose critical temperatures
exhibit a peculiar phase diagram, characterized by three different superconducting regions.
In most alloys the $T_c$ is almost an order of magnitude higher than in pure Re and Mo. Low-temperature
electronic specific-heat data evidence a fully-gapped superconducting state, whose enhanced
gap magnitude and specific-heat discontinuity suggest a moderately strong electron-phonon coupling
across the series. Considering that several $\alpha$-Mn-type Re$T$ alloys ($T$ = transition metal)
show time-reversal symmetry breaking (TRSB) in the superconducting state, while TRS is preserved
in the isostructural Mg$_{10}$Ir$_{19}$B$_{16}$ or Nb$_{0.5}$Os$_{0.5}$, the Re$_{1-x}$Mo$_x$
alloys represent another suitable system for studying the interplay of space-inversion, gauge,
and time-reversal symmetries in future experiments expected to probe TRSB in the Re$T$ family.
