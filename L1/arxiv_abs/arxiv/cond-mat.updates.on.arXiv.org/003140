A non-perturbative method is introduced to measure the particle-particle interaction strengths
and in-situ confinement for a vertically aligned dust particle pair in a complex plasma. The intrinsic
thermal motion of each particle is tracked, allowing the interaction strengths and confinement
in both the vertical and horizontal directions to be determined simultaneously. The method is validated
through quantitative agreement with previous measurements of the non-reciprocal interaction
strength in the vertical direction, the horizontal ion wake attraction, and the charge reduction
and heating of the lower particle when located in the wake of the upper particle. The experiment also
verifies both theoretical and numerical predictions for the ion wake potential by investigating
the ratios among the interaction strengths in the vertical and horizontal directions, as well as
in the up- and down-stream directions at varying powers. The upstream potential is shown to be asymmetric
with unequal screening lengths in the vertical and horizontal directions, implying a subsonic
ion flow at low rf powers. Additionally, it is shown that the ratio between the down and up-stream
strengths in the vertical direction remains constant at high power, then increases at low power,
in agreement with the theoretically predicted increase in the magnitude of the wake potential as
the Mach number decreases. Finally, the measured ratio of approximately 5 between the downstream
and upstream strengths in the horizontal direction is shown to agree with simulations conducted
employing similar plasma parameters.
