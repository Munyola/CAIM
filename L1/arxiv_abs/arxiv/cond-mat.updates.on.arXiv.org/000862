Recent advances in growth techniques have allowed the fabrication of semiconductor nanostructures
with mixed wurtzite/zinc-blende crystal phases. Although the optical characterization of these
polytypic structures is well eported in the literature, a deeper theoretical understanding of
how crystal phase mixing and quantum confinement change the output linear light polarization is
still needed. In this paper, we theoretically investigate the mixing effects of wurtzite and zinc-blende
phases on the interband absorption and in the degree of light polarization of an InP polytypic superlattice.
We use a single 8$\times$8 k$\cdot$p Hamiltonian that describes both crystal phases. Quantum confinement
is investigated by changing the size of the polytypic unit cell. We also include the optical confinement
effect due to the dielectric mismatch between the superlattice and the vaccum and we show it to be
necessary to match experimental results. Our calculations for large wurtzite concentrations
and small quantum confinement explain the optical trends of recent photoluminescence excitation
measurements. Furthermore, we find a high sensitivity to zinc-blende concentrations in the degree
of linear polarization. This sensitivity can be reduced by increasing quantum confinement. In
conclusion, our theoretical analysis provides an explanation for optical trends in InP polytypic
superlattices, and shows that the interplay of crystal phase mixing and quantum confinement is
an area worth exploring for light polarization engineering.
