We introduce a two-species exclusion model to describe the key features of the conflict between
the RNA polymerase (RNAP) motor traffic, engaged in the transcription of a segment of DNA, concomitant
with the progress of two DNA replication forks on the same DNA segment. One of the species of particles
($P$) represents RNAP motors while the other ($R$) represents replication forks. Motivated by
the biological phenomena that this model is intended to capture, a maximum of only two $R$ particles
are allowed to enter the lattice from two opposite ends whereas the unrestricted number of $P$ particles
constitute a totally asymmetric simple exclusion process (TASEP) in a segment in the middle of the
lattice. Consequently, the lattice consists of three segments; the encounters of the $P$ particles
with the $R$ particles are confined within the middle segment (segment $2$) whereas only the $R$
particles can occupy the sites in the segments $1$ and $3$. The model captures three distinct pathways
for resolving the co-directional as well as head-collision between the $P$ and $R$ particles. Using
Monte Carlo simulations and heuristic analytical arguments that combine exact results for the
TASEP with mean-field approximations, we predict the possible outcomes of the conflict between
the traffic of RNAP motors ($P$ particles engaged in transcription) and the replication forks ($R$
particles). The outcomes, of course, depend on the dynamical phase of the TASEP of $P$ particles.
In principle, the model can be adapted to the experimental conditions to account for the data quantitatively.
