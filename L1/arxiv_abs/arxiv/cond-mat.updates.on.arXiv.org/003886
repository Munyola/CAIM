Nucleation plays a critical role in many physical and biological phenomena ranging from crystallization,
melting and evaporation to the formation of clouds and the initiation of neurodegenerative diseases.
However, nucleation is a challenging process to study in experiments especially in the early stage
when several atoms/molecules start to form a new phase from its parent phase. Here, we advance atomic
electron tomography to study early stage nucleation at 4D atomic resolution. Using FePt nanoparticles
as a model system, we reveal that early stage nuclei are irregularly shaped, each has a core of one
to few atoms with the maximum order parameter, and the order parameter gradient points from the core
to the boundary of the nucleus. We capture the structure and dynamics of the same nuclei undergoing
growth, fluctuation, dissolution, merging and/or division, which are regulated by the order parameter
distribution and its gradient. These experimental observations differ from classical nucleation
theory (CNT) and to explain them we propose the order parameter gradient (OPG) model. We show the
OPG model generalizes CNT and energetically favours diffuse interfaces for small nuclei and sharp
interfaces for large nuclei. We further corroborate this model using molecular dynamics simulations
of heterogeneous and homogeneous nucleation in liquid-solid phase transitions of Pt. We anticipate
that the OPG model is applicable to different nucleation processes and our experimental method
opens the door to study the structure and dynamics of materials with 4D atomic resolution.
