The exchange-driven growth model describes the mean field kinetics of a population of composite
particles (clusters) subject to pairwise exchange interactions. Exchange in this context means
that upon interaction of two clusters, one loses a constituent unit (monomer) and the other gains
this unit. Two variants of the exchange-driven growth model appear in applications. They differ
in whether clusters of zero size are considered active or passive. In the active case, clusters of
size zero can acquire a monomer from clusters of positive size. In the passive case they cannot, meaning
that clusters reaching size zero are effectively removed from the system. While this distinction
may seem minor, the large time behaviour is radically different for the two variants of the model.
We first consider an isolated system. In the passive case, the cluster size distribution tends towards
a self-similar evolution and the typical cluster size grows as a power of time. In the active case,
the cluster size distribution tends towards a time-independent equilibrium in which the typical
cluster size is finite. We next consider a non-isolated system in which monomers are input at a constant
rate. In the passive case, the cluster size distribution again attains a self-similar profile in
which the typical cluster size grows as a power of time. In the active case, a surprising new behavior
is found: the cluster size distribution asymptotes to the same equilibrium profile found in the
isolated case but with an amplitude that grows linearly in time.
