We report the discovery of superconductivity in binary alloy Sn$_{1-x}$Sb$_{x}$ with $x$ in the
range of 0.43 to 0.6, which possesses a modulated rhombohedral structure due to the incommensurate
ordering of Sn and Sb layers along the $c$-axis. The specific heat measurements indicate a weakly
coupled, fully gapped superconducting state in this homogeneity range with a maximum bulk $T_{\rm
c}$ of 1.58 K at $x$ = 0.46, though the electronic specific heat and Hall coefficients remain nearly
$x$-independent. The nonmonotonic dependence of the bulk $T_{\rm c}$ is discussed in relation
to the effects of Sb-layer intercalation between the [Sn$_{4}$Sb$_{3}$] seven-layer lamellae
that are the essential building block for superconductivity. On the other hand, a zero-resistivity
transition is found to take place well above the bulk superconducting transition, and the corresponding
$T_{\rm c}$ increases monotonically with $x$ from 2.06 K to 3.29 K. This contrast, together with
the uniform elements distribution revealed by energy dispersive x-ray mapping, implies that the
resistive transition is due to the strain effect at the grain boundary rather than the compositional
inhomogeneity. The first-principles calculations on the representative composition Sn$_{4}$Sb$_{3}$
($x$ = 0.43) indicate that it is topologically nontrivial similar to Sb, but with different Z$_{2}$
invariants (0;111). Our results not only identify a new superconducting region in the Sn-Sb phase
diagram, but also provide a viable platform to study the interplay between structural modulation,
nontrivial band topology and superconductivity.
