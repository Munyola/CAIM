In this work, we investigate theoretically and demonstrate experimentally the existence of valley-Hall
edge states in the in-plane dynamics of honeycomb lattices with bi-valued strut thickness. We exploit
these states to achieve non-trivial waveguiding of optical modes that is immune to backscattering
from sharp corners. We also present how different types of interfaces can be combined into multi-branch
junctions to form complex waveguide paths and realize a variety of structural logic designs with
unconventional wave transport capabilities. We illustrate this potential with two applications.
The first is a direction-selective de-multiplexing waveguide tree featuring a pronounced asymmetric
wave transport behavior. The second is an internal waveguide loop along which the energy can be temporarily
trapped and periodically released, effectively working as a signal delayer. We provide a rationale
for the observed phenomena that blends topological considerations and mechanistic arguments,
and we offer a criterion for the proper selection of the junction characteristics that are conducive
to non-trivial interface modes. The modal complexity of in-plane elasticity has important consequences
on the regime of manifestation of the edge states, as the availability of viable total bandgaps is
shifted to higher frequencies compared to the out-of-plane counterpart problem. It also poses
additional experimental challenges, associated with proper acquisition and deciphering of the
in-plane modes, the solution of which requires a systematic use of in-plane laser vibrometry.
