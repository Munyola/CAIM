Active materials are capable of converting free energy into directional motion, giving rise to
striking dynamical phenomena. Developing a general understanding of their structure in relation
to the underlying non-equilibrium physics would provide a route towards control of their dynamic
behavior and pave the way for potential applications. The active system considered here consists
of a quasi-two-dimensional sheet of short ($\approx$ 1 $\mu$m) actin filaments driven by myosin-II
motors. By adopting a concerted theoretical and experimental strategy, new insights are gained
into the non-equilibrium properties of active nematics over a wide range of internal activity levels.
In particular, it is shown that topological defect interactions can be led to transition from attractive
to repulsive as a function of initial defect separation and relative orientation. Furthermore,
by examining the +1/2 defect morphology as a function of activity, it is found that the apparent elastic
properties of the system (the ratio of bend-to-splay elastic moduli) are altered considerably
by increased activity, leading to an effectively lower bend elasticity. At high levels of activity,
the topological defects that decorate the material exhibit a liquid-like structure, and adopt
preferred orientations depending on their topological charge. Taken together, these results
suggest that it should be possible to tune internal stresses in active nematic systems with the goal
of designing out-of-equilibrium structures with engineered dynamic responses.
