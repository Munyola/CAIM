We detail an efficient, generic numerical procedure to expedite non-bonded pair energy calculations
for arbitrary complex particles interacting through hard and soft finite-range potentials. This
approach, based on the construction of neighbour lists via recursive hierarchies of bounding volumes,
may effectively handle a wide range of molecular systems through the use of robust statistical atom-decomposition
techniques. Its association with fast overlap detection algorithms and binary search schemes
is shown to lead to an increase in computational efficiency by several orders of magnitudes over
traditional grid-based methods for systems of high-aspect-ratio particles. The combination
of this accelerated second-order virial evaluation process with an efficient theoretical framework
based on classical density functional theory enables us to investigate the uniaxial nematic and
cholesteric self-assembly of a wide variety of molecular models. We provide an extensive comparison
of the results and performance of our approach with those obtained using state-of-the-art collision
detection libraries specialised for hard interactions, both of which we find to scale sub-logarithmically
with particle resolution. We illustrate the method through the determination of the cholesteric
behaviour of hard, structurally-resolved twisted cuboids, and report quantitative evidence
of the long-predicted phase handedness inversion with increasing particle thread angles near
the phenomenological threshold value of $45^\circ$.
