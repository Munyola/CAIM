We employ a multi-scale mechanistic approach to investigate radiation induced cell toxicities
and deactivation mechanisms as a function of linear energy transfer in hadron therapy. Our theoretical
model consists of a system of Markov chains in microscopic and macroscopic spatio-temporal landscapes,
i.e., stochastic birth-death processes of cells in millimeter-scale colonies that incorporates
a coarse-grained driving force to account for microscopic radiation induced damage. The coupling,
hence the driving force in this process, stems from a nano-meter scale radiation induced DNA damage
that incorporates the enzymatic end-joining repair and mis-repair mechanisms. We use this model
for global fitting of the high-throughput and high accuracy clonogenic cell-survival data acquired
under exposure of the therapeutic scanned proton beams, the experimental design that considers
$\gamma$-H2AX as the biological endpoint and exhibits maximum observed achievable dose and LET,
beyond which the majority of the cells undergo collective biological deactivation processes.
An estimate to optimal dose and LET calculated from tumor control probability by extension to $~
10^6$ cells per $mm$-size voxels is presented. We attribute the increase in degree of complexity
in chromosome aberration to variabilities in the observed biological responses as the beam linear
energy transfer (LET) increases, and verify consistency of the predicted cell death probability
with the in-vitro cell survival assay of approximately 100 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells.
