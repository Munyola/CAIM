Doping the hydrogen-disordered phases of ice V, VI and XII with hydrochloric acid (HCl) has led to
the discovery of their hydrogen-ordered counterparts ices XIII, XV and XIV. Yet, the mechanistic
details of the hydrogen-ordering phase transitions are still not fully understood. This includes
in particular the role of the acid dopant and the defect dynamics that it creates within the ices.
Here we investigate the effects of several acid and base dopants on the hydrogen ordering of ices
V and VI with calorimetry and X-ray diffraction. HCl is found to be most effective for both phases
which is attributed to a favourable combination of high solubility and strong acid properties which
create mobile H3O+ defects that enable the hydrogen-ordering processes. Hydrofluoric acid (HF)
is the second most effective dopant highlighting that the acid strengths of HCl and HF are much more
similar in ice than they are in liquid water. Surprisingly, hydrobromic acid doping facilitates
hydrogen ordering in ice VI whereas only a very small effect is observed for ice V. Conversely, lithium
hydroxide (LiOH) doping achieves a performance comparable to HF-doping in ice V but it is ineffective
in the case of ice VI. Sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide (as previously shown) and perchloric
acid doping are ineffective for both phases. These findings highlight the need for future computational
studies but also raise the question why LiOH-doping achieves hydrogen-ordering of ice V whereas
potassium hydroxide doping is most effective for the 'ordinary' ice Ih.
