By investigating the bulk superconducting state via dc magnetization measurements, we have discovered
a common resurgence of the superconductive transition temperatures (Tcs) of the monolayer Bi2Sr2CuO6+{\delta}
(Bi2201) and bilayer Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+{\delta} (Bi2212) to beyond the maximum Tcs (Tc-maxs) predicted
by the universal relation between Tc and doping (p) or pressure (P) at higher pressures. The Tc of
under-doped Bi2201 initially increases from 9.6 K at ambient to a peak at ~ 23 K at ~ 26 GPa and then drops
as expected from the universal Tc-P relation. However, at pressures above ~ 40 GPa, Tc rises rapidly
without any sign of saturation up to ~ 30 K at ~ 51 GPa. Similarly, the Tc for the slightly overdoped
Bi2212 increases after passing a broad valley between 20-36 GPa and reaches ~ 90 K without any sign
of saturation at ~ 56 GPa. We have therefore attributed this Tc-resurgence to a possible pressure-induced
electronic transition in the cuprate compounds due to a charge transfer between the Cu 3d_(x^2-y^2
) and the O 2p bands projected from a hybrid bonding state, leading to an increase of the density of
states at the Fermi level, in agreement with our density functional theory calculations. Similar
Tc-P behavior has also been reported in the trilayer Br2Sr2Ca2Cu3O10+{\delta} (Bi2223). These
observations suggest that higher Tcs than those previously reported for the layered cuprate high
temperature superconductors can be achieved by breaking away from the universal Tc-P relation
through the application of higher pressures.
