The Rashba effect, a spin splitting in electronic band structure, attracts much attention for the
potential applications in spintronics with no requirement of external magnetic field. Realizing
one-dimensional (1D) Rashba system is a big challenge due to the difficulties of growing high-quality
heavy-metal nanowires or introducing strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and broken inversion symmetry
in flexible materials. Here, based on first-principles calculations, we propose a pathway to realize
the Rashba spin-split by adsorbing Gd atom on zigzag graphene nanoribbons (Gd-ZGNR) and further
investigate the magnetic anisotropy energy (MAE). Perpendicular MAE and unconventional MAE contributions
in k-space are found in the self-assembled Gd-ZGNR system, which present a remarkable Rashba effect
(the estimated strength is 1.89 eV {\AA}) attributed to strong SOC (~65.6 meV) and the asymmetric
adsorption site at the nanoribbons edge. Moreover, first-order MAE is connected to the intrinsic
Rashba effect beyond the traditional second-order MAE, which is confirmed based on the analysis
of electronic structures perturbed with SOC in comparison with metastable Gd-ZGNR at central symmetric
adsorption site. The dependence of first-order MAE as well as Rashba effect of Gd-ZGNRs on the ribbon
width are also examined. This work offers new perspective to achieve 1D Rashba system and provides
fundamental understanding on the magnetic anisotropy, which would be of great significance for
searching Majorana fermions and promoting the potential applications in spintronics.
