In many unconventional superconductors, the pairing of electrons is driven by the repulsive interaction,
which leads to the sign reversal of superconducting gaps along the Fermi surfaces (FS) or between
them. However, to measure this sign change is not easy and straightforward. It is known that, in superconductors
with sign reversal gaps, non-magnetic impurities can break Cooper pairs leading to the quasiparticle
density of states in the superconducting state. The standing waves of these quasiparticles will
interfere each other leading to the quasiparticle interference (QPI) pattern which carries the
phase message reflecting also the superconducting gap structure. Based on the recently proposed
defect-bound-state QPI technique, we explore the applicability of this technique to a typical
iron based superconductor FeTe$_{0.55}$Se$_{0.45}$ with roughly equivalent gap values on the
electron and hole pockets connected by the wave vector q_2=(0,\pi). It is found that, on the negative
energy side, with the energy slightly below the gap value, the phase reference quantity $|g(q,-E)|\cos(\theta_{q,+E}-\theta_{q,-E})
becomes negative and the amplitude is strongly enhanced with the scattering vector q_2, but that
corresponding to the scattering between the electron-electron pockets, namely q_3=(\pi,\pi),
keeps all positive. This is well consistent with the theoretical expectation of the s^+- pairing
gap and thus serves as a direct visualization of the sign reversal gaps. This experimental observation
is also supported by the theoretical calculations with the Fermi surface structure and s^+- pairing
gap.
