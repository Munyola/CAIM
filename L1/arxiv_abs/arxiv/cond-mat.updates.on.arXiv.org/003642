Maximally localized Wannier functions are localized orthogonal functions that can accurately
represent given Bloch eigenstates of a periodic system at a low computational cost, thanks to the
small size of each orbital. Tight-binding models based on the maximally localized Wannier functions
obtained from different systems are often combined to construct tight-binding models for large
systems such as a semi-infinite surface. However, the corresponding maximally localized Wannier
functions in the overlapping region of different systems are not identical, and this discrepancy
can introduce serious artifacts to the combined tight-binding model. Here, we propose two methods
to seamlessly stitch two different tight-binding models that share some basis functions in common.
First, we introduce a simple and efficient method: (i) finding the best matching maximally localized
Wannier function pairs in the overlapping region belonging to the two tight-binding models, (ii)
rotating the spin orientations of the two corresponding Wannier functions to make them parallel
to each other, and (iii) making their overall phases equal. Second, we propose a more accurate and
generally applicable method based on the iterative minimization of the difference between the
Hamiltonian matrix elements in the overlapping region. We demonstrate our methods by applying
them to the surfaces of diamond, GeTe, Bi$_2$Se$_3$, and TaAs. Our methods can be readily used to
construct reliable tight-binding models for surfaces, interfaces, and defects.
