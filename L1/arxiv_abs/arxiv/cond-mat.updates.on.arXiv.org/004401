We investigate Josephson flux-flow in annular Josephson tunnel junctions (AJTJs) under the application
of magnetic fields generating finite-voltage steps in their current-voltage characteristics.
Experimental data are presented for confocal AJTJs which are the natural generalization of the
well studied circular AJTJs for which flux flow effects have never been reported. Displaced linear
slopes, Fiske step staircases and Eck steps were sequentially recorded at $4.2\,K$ with high-quality
Nb/Al-AlOx/Nb confocal AJTJs when increasing the strength of a uniform magnetic field applied
in the plane of the junction. Their amplitude was found to strongly depend not only on the strength,
but also on the orientation, of the external field. Extensive numerical simulations based on a phenomenological
sine-Gordon model developed for confocal AJTJs were carried out to disclose the basic flux-flow
mechanism responsible for the appearance of magnetically induced steps and to elucidate the role
of several critical parameters, namely, the field orientation, the system loss and the annulus
eccentricity. It was found that in a topologically closed system, such as the AJTJ, where the number
of trapped fluxons is conserved and new fluxons can be created only in the form of fluxon-antifluxon
pairs, the existence of a steady viscous flow of Josephson vortices only relies on the capability
of the fluxons and antifluxons to be generated and to annihilate each other inside the junction.
This also implies that flux-flow effects are not observable in circular AJTJs.
