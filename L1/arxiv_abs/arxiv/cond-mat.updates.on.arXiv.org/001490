Using fluorescence microscopy we study the adsorption of single latex microparticles at a water/water
interface between demixing aqueous solutions of polymers, generally known as a water-in-water
emulsion. Similar microparticles at the interface between molecular liquids have exhibited an
extremely slow relaxation preventing the observation of expected equilibrium states. This phenomenon
has been attributed to "long-lived" metastable states caused by significant energy barriers $\Delta{\cal
F}\sim \gamma A_d\gg k_B T$ induced by high interfacial tension ($\gamma \sim 10^{-2}$ N/m) and
nanoscale surface defects with characteristic areas $A_d \simeq$ 10--30 nm$^2$. For the studied
water/water interface with ultra-low surface tension ($\gamma \sim 10^{-4}$ N/m) we are able to
characterize the entire adsorption process and observe equilibrium states prescribed by a single
equilibrium contact angle independent of the particle size. Notably, we observe crossovers from
fast initial dynamics to slower kinetic regimes analytically predicted for large surface defects
($A_d \simeq$ 500 nm$^2$). Moreover, particle trajectories reveal a position-independent damping
coefficient that is unexpected given the large viscosity contrast between phases. These observations
are attributed to the remarkably diffuse nature of the water/water interface and the adsorption
and entanglement of polymer chains in the semidilute solutions. This work offers some first insights
on the adsorption dynamics/kinetics of microparticles at water/water interfaces in bio-colloidal
systems.
