Hot deformation process is one of the primary methods to produce anisotropic rare earth permanent
magnets. Firstly, rapidly quenched powder flakes with nanocrystal structure are condensed into
the full dense isotropic precursors by hot pressing process. And then, the prepared isotropic precursors
are hot deformed to produce high-anisotropy uniaxial bulk rare earth permanent magnets, in which
the highly textured structure is obtained in the hot plastic deformation process. The obtained
hot-deformed magnets possess many advantages, such as near net-shape, outstanding corrosion
resistance and ultrafine-grain structure. The noteworthy effects of preparation parameters
employed in hot-pressing and deformation processes on the magnetic properties and microstructures
characterizations are systemically summarized in this academic monograph. As a near net-shape
technique, hot deformation process has noteworthy advantages in producing irregular shape magnets,
especially for radially oriented ring-shape magnets with high length-diameter ratio or thin wall.
The difficulties in producing crack-free, homogeneous and non-decentered ring-shaped magnets
are basically resolved through mold design, adjustment of deformation parameters and application
of theoretical simulation. Considering the characteristics of hot-deformed magnets, such as
the grain shapes and sizes, anisotropic distribution of intergranular phases, etc., there is practical
significance to study and improve the mechanical, electric properties and thermal stability to
enlarge the applicable area of hot-deformed magnets or ring-shaped magnets.
