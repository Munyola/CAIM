In this article, we use a many-body approach to study the absorption spectra of electron-doped two-dimensional
semiconductors. Optical absorption is modeled by a many-body scattering Hamiltonian which describes
an exciton immersed in a Fermi sea. The interaction between electron and exciton is approximated
by an effective scattering potential, and optical spectra are calculated by solving for the exciton
Green's function. From this approach, a trion state can be assigned as a bound state of an electron-exciton
scattering process, and the doping-dependent phenomena observed in the spectra can be attributed
to several many-body effects induced by the interaction with the Fermi sea. While the many-body
scattering Hamiltonian can not solved exactly, we reduce the problem to two limiting solvable situations.
The first approach approximates the full many-body problem by a simple scattering process between
the electron and the exciton, with a self-energy obtained by solving a Bethe-Salpeter equation
(BSE). An alternate approach assumes an infinite mass for the exciton, such that the many-body scattering
Hamiltonian reduces to a Mahan-Nozieres-De Dominicis (MND) model. The exciton Green's function
can then be solved numerically exactly by a determinantal formulation, and the optical spectra
show signatures of the Fermi-edge singularity at high doping densities. The full doping dependence
and temperature dependence of the exciton and trion lineshapes are simulated via these two approximate
approaches, with the results compared to each other and to experimental expectations.
