We introduce the magnonic Floquet Hofstadter butterfly in the two-dimensional insulating honeycomb
ferromagnet. We show that when the insulating honeycomb ferromagnet is irradiated by an oscillating
space- and time-dependent electric field, the hopping magnetic dipole moment (i.e. magnon quasiparticles)
accumulate the Aharonov-Casher phase. In the case of only space-dependent electric field, we realize
the magnonic Hofstadter spectrum with similar fractal structure as graphene subject to a perpendicular
magnetic field, but with no spin degeneracy due to broken time-reversal symmetry by the ferromagnetic
order. In addition, the magnonic Dirac points and Landau levels occur at finite energy as expected
in a bosonic system. Remarkably, this discrepancy does not affect the topological invariant of
the system. Consequently, the magnonic Chern number assumes odd values and the magnon Hall conductance
gets quantized by odd integers. In the case of both space- and time-dependent electric field, the
theoretical framework is studied by the Floquet formalism. We show that the magnonic Floquet Hofstadter
spectrum emerges entirely from the oscillating space- and time-dependent electric field, which
is in stark contrast to electronic Floquet Hofstadter spectrum, where irradiation by circularly
polarized light and a perpendicular magnetic field are applied independently. We study the deformation
of the fractal structure at different laser frequencies and amplitudes, and analyze the topological
phase transitions associated with gap openings in the magnonic Floquet Hofstadter butterfly.
