We generalize, and then use, a recently introduced formalism to study thermal fluctuations of atomic
displacements in several two and three dimensional crystals. We study both close packed as well
as open crystals with multi atom bases. Atomic displacement fluctuations in a solid, once coarse-grained
over some neighborhood may be decomposed into two mutually orthogonal components. In any dimension
$d$ there are always $d^2$ {\em affine} displacements representing local strains and rotations
of the ideal reference configuration. In addition, there exists a number of {\em non-affine} localized
displacement modes that cannot be represented as strains or rotations. The number of these modes
depends on $d$ and the size of the coarse graining region. All thermodynamic averages and correlation
functions concerning the affine and non-affine displacements may be computed within a harmonic
theory. We show that for compact crystals, such as the square and triangular in $d=2$ and the simple,
body-centered and face-centered cubic crystals in $d=3$, a single set of $d-$fold degenerate modes
always dominate the non-affine sub-space and are separated from the rest by a large gap. These modes
may be identified with specific precursor configurations that lead to lattice defects. Deformation
mechanisms such as lattice slips and stacking faults in close packed crystals can also be understood
within this framework. The qualitative features of these conclusions are expected to be independent
of the details of the atomic interactions.
