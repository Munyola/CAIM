A central question in ecology is to understand the ecological processes that shape community structure.
Niche-based theories have emphasized the important role played by competition for maintaining
species diversity. Many of these insights have been derived using MacArthur's consumer resource
model (MCRM) or its generalizations. Most theoretical work on the MCRM has focused on small ecosystems
with a few species and resources. However theoretical insights derived from small ecosystems many
not scale up large ecosystems with many resources and species because large systems with many interacting
components often display new emergent behaviors that cannot be understood or deduced from analyzing
smaller systems. To address this shortcoming, we develop a sophisticated statistical physics
inspired cavity method to analyze MCRM when both the number of species and the number of resources
is large. We find that in this limit, species generically and consistently perturb their environments
and significantly modify available ecological niches. We show how our cavity approach naturally
generalizes niche theory to large ecosystems by accounting for the effect of this emergent environmental
engineering on species invasion and ecological stability. Our work suggests that environmental
engineering is a generic feature of large, natural ecosystems and must be taken into account when
analyzing and interpreting community structure. It also highlights the important role that statistical-physics
inspired approaches can play in furthering our understanding of ecology.
