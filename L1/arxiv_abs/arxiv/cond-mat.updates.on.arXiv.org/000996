Nanowires have much potential application as it shows outstanding mechanical properties due to
the size effect. Compared to the pure metallic counterparts Al and Cu, Al-Cu alloy nanowire posits
enhanced mechanical properties like strength hardening. The mechanism of hardening coupled with
the deformation process of Al-Cu alloy is of particular importance from its application point of
view. In this paper, the effect of grain size on the hardening mechanism of Al-Cu polycrystalline
alloy is elucidated by molecular dynamics simulation. Al-Cu (50-54% Cu by weight) alloy having
an average grain size of 4.97 to 7.26 nm are investigated for tensile simulation at different strain
rate using embedded atom method (EAM) potential at a temperature of 50~500K. It is found that the
failure mechanism of the alloy is governed by the temperature, grain size as well as strain rate effect.
At the high temperature of 300-500K, the failure strength of Al-Cu alloy increases with the decrease
of average grain size following Hall-Petch relation. Dislocation motions are hindered significantly
when the grain size is decreased which play a vital role on the hardening of the alloy. The failure
is always found to initiate at a particular Al grain due to its weak link and propagates through grain
boundary (GB) sliding, diffusion, dislocation nucleation and propagation. We also visualize
the dislocation density at different grain size to show how the dislocation affects the material
properties at the nanoscale. These results will aid further investigation on the deformation mechanism
of polycrystalline alloy nanowires.
