We extend our discussion of effective actions for stochastic partial differential equations to
systems that give rise to a Martin-Siggia-Rose (MSR) type of action. This type of action naturally
arises when one uses the many-body formalism of Doi and Peliti to describe reaction-diffusion models
which undergo transitions into the absorbing state and which are described by a Master equation.
These models include predator prey models, and directed percolation models as well as chemical
kinetic models. For classical dynamical systems with external noise it is always possible to construct
an MSR action. Using a path integral representation for the generator of the correlation functions,
we show how, by introducing a composite auxiliary field, one can generate an auxiliary field loop
expansion for the effective action for both types of systems. As a specific example of the Doi-Peliti
formalism we determine the effective action for the chemical reaction annihilation and diffusion
process $A+A \rightarrow 0$. For the external noise problem we evaluate the effective action for
the Cole-Hopf form of the Kardar-Parisi Zhang (KPZ) equation as well as for the Ginzburg Landau model
of spin relaxation. We determine for arbitrary spatial dimension $d$, the renormalized effective
potential in leading order in the auxiliary field loop expansion (LOAF) and also determine the renormalization
group equation for the running of the reaction rate (coupling constant) for arbitrary $d$. We compare
our results with known perturbative and non-perturbative results for the renormalization group
equations.
