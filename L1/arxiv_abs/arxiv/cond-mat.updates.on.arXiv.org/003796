The Monte Carlo-Mean Field (MC-MF) approach rests up on deriving an effective spin fermion model
containing classical and quantum degrees of freedom from an interacting many body problem. The
effective model allows us to build in non-trivial thermal fluctuations and was shown to compare
well against finite $T$ Determinantal Quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC) on half filled square lattice
Hubbard model. In this case it was shown that MC-MF could capture formation of local moments in the
high $T$ paramagnetic phase and could also reproduce the non monotonic dependence of antiferromagnetic
ordering temperature ($T_N$) on local correlation strength $U$. Here, we study the effect of frustration
at half filling by introducing next nearest hopping ($t^{\prime}$), with $t^{\prime}/t<0$. We
benchmark low temperature $U-t^{\prime}$ phases against literature, present evolution of magnetic
phases with temperature and establish that, for intermediate to large $t^\prime$, a pseudogapped
(PG) metal separates small $U$ Fermi Liquid and large $U$ Mott insulator. We study the evolution
of this metal with temperature and map out the $U$ and $t^\prime$ variation of the PG to normal metal
crossover scale ($T^*$). From temperature dependence of resistivity, optical conductivity and
low $T$ single particle spectral function calculations, we demonstrate that properties of this
pseudogapped metal deviates strongly from a Fermi liquid, track these deviations with $U$ and $t^\prime$
and show how thermally induced spin fluctuations assisted spectral weight transfer, can lead to
formation of the PG metal.
