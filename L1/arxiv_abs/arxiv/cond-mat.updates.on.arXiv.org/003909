We study a model for thin film electrodeposition in which instability development by preferential
adsorption and reduction of cations at surface peaks competes with surface relaxation by diffusion
of the adsorbates. The model considers cations moving in a supported electrolyte, adsorption and
reduction when they reach the film surface, and consequent production of mobile particles that
execute activated surface diffusion, which is represented by a sequence of random hops to neighboring
lattice sites with a maximum of G hop attempts (G>>1), a detachment probability epsilon<1 per neighboring
particle, and a no-desorption condition. Computer simulations show the formation of a compact
wetting layer followed by the growth of branched deposits. The maximal thickness z_c of that layer
increases with G, but is weakly affected by epsilon. A scaling approach describes the crossover
from smooth film growth to unstable growth and predicts z_c ~ G^gamma, with gamma = 1/[2(1-nu)] =
0.43, where nu=0.30 is the inverse of the dynamical exponent of the Villain-Lai-Das Sarma equation
that describes the initial roughening. Using previous results for related deposition models,
the thickness z_c can be predicted as a function of an activation energy for terrace surface diffusion
and the temperature, and the small effects of the parameter epsilon are justified. These predictions
are confirmed by the numerical results with good accuracy. We discuss possible applications, with
a particular focus on the growth of multifuncional structures with stacking layers of different
porosity.
