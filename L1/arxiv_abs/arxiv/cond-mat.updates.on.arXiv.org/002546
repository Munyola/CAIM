Recently has been observed for some one-dimensional models that exhibit unexpected pseudo-transitions
and quasi-phases. This pseudo-transition resembles a first- and second-order phase transition
simultaneously. One of those models is the spin-1/2 Ising-XYZ diamond chain, composed of Ising
spin particles at the nodal sites and the Heisenberg spin particles at the interstitial sites. Where
we assume Ising-type interaction between the nodal and interstitial sites, the Heisenberg-type
interaction between interstitial sites, and with an external magnetic field applied along the
z-axis. This model presents an exact analytical solution applying the transfer matrix technique,
which shows 3 phases at zero temperature in the vicinity of pseudo-transition. The pseudo-transition
separates quasi-phases, these quasi-phases still hold at a finite temperature most of the pattern
configurations of a true phase at zero temperature. Here we study the quantum entanglement of pair
spin particles in the quasi-phase regions, which can be measured through the concurrence. Then
we observe an unexpected behavior in the concurrence, that is below pseudo-critical temperature
the concurrence remains almost constant up to pseudo-critical temperature, but above the pseudo-critical
temperature, the concurrence behaves as for the standard one-dimensional spin models. Further,
we consider the entropy behavior of the system, below pseudo-critical temperature the entropy
becomes almost null, while above pseudo-critical temperature the system exhibits standard behavior
as for ordinary one-dimensional spin models.
