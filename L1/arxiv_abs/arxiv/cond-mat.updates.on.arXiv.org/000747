In addition to charge plasmons, a 2D electron system with Rashba-type spin-orbit coupling (SOC)
also supports three collective modes in the spin sector: the chiral-spin modes. We study the dispersions
of the charge and spin modes and their coupling to each other within a generalized Random Phase Approximation
for arbitrarily strong SOC, and both in 2D and 3D systems. In both 2D and 3D, we find that the charge
plasmons are coupled to only one of the three chiral-spin modes. This coupling is shown to affect
the dispersions of the modes at finite but not at zero wavenumbers. In 3D, the chiral-spin modes are
strongly damped by particle-hole excitations and disappear for weak electron-electron interaction.
Landau damping of the chiral-spin modes in 3D is directly related to the fact that, in contrast to
2D, there is no gap for particle-hole excitations between spin-split subbands. The gapless continuum
is also responsible for Landau damping of the charge plasmon in 3D - a qualitatively new feature of
the SOC system. We also discuss the optical conductivity of clean 2D and 3D systems and show that SOC
introduces spectral weight at finite frequency in a such way that the sum rule is satisfied. The in-plane
tranverse chiral-spin mode shows up as dispersing peak in the optical conductivity at finite number
which can can be measured in the presence of diffraction grating. We also discuss possible experimental
manifestations of chiral-spin modes in semiconductor quantum wells such InGaAs/AlGaAs and 3D
giant Rashba materials of the BiTeI family.
