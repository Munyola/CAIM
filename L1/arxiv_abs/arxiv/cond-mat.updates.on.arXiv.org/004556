This manuscript provides a general approach to the investigation of field quantization in high-curvature
geometries. The models and calculations can help with understanding the elastic and inelastic
scattering of photons and electrons in nanostructures and probe-like metallic domains. The results
find important applications in high-resolution photonic and electronic modalities of scanning
probe microscopy, nano-optics, plasmonics, and quantum sensing. Quasistatic formulation, leading
to nonretarded quantities, is employed and justified on the basis of the nanoscale, here subwavelength,
dimensions of the considered domains of interest. Within the quasistatic framework, the nanostructure
material domains with frequency-dependent dielectric functions are presented. Quantities associated
with the normal modes of the electronic systems, the nonretarded plasmon dispersion relations,
eigenmodes, and fields are then calculated for several geometric entities of use in nanoscience
and nanotechnology. From the classical energy of the charge density oscillations in the modeled
nanoparticle, the Hamiltonian of the system, which is used for quantization, is derived. The quantized
plasmon field is obtained and, employing an interaction Hamiltonian derived from the first-order
perturbation theory within the hydrodynamic model of the electron gas, an analytical expression
for the radiative decay rate of the plasmons could be obtained. The established treatment could
be applied to multiple geometries to investigate the quantized charge density oscillations on
their bounding surfaces.
