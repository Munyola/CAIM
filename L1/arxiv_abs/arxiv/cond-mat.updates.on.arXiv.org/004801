Fractons are particles that cannot move in one or more directions without paying energy proportional
to their displacement. Here, we introduce the concept of symmetry enforced fractonicity, in which
particles are fractons in the presence of a global symmetry, but are free to move in its absence. A
simple example is dislocation defects in a two-dimensional crystal, which are restricted to move
only along their Burgers vector due to particle number conservation. Utilizing a recently developed
dual rank-2 tensor gauge description of elasticity, we show that accounting for their symmetry
enforced one-dimensional nature of dislocation motion dramatically alters the structure of quantum
crystal melting phase transitions. We show that, at zero temperature, sufficiently strong quantum
fluctuations of the crystal lattice favor the formation of a super-solid phase that spontaneously
breaks the symmetry enforcing fractonicity of defects. The defects can then condense to drive the
crystal into a super-nematic phase via a phase transition in the $2+1d$ XY universality class to
drive a melting phase transition of the crystal to a nematic phase. This scenario contrasts the standard
Halperin-Nelson scenario for thermal melting of $2d$ solids in which dislocations can proliferate
via a single continuous thermal phase transition. We comment on the application of these results
to other scenarios such as vortex lattice melting at a magnetic field induced superconductor-insulator
transition, and quantum melting of charge density waves of stripes in a metal.
