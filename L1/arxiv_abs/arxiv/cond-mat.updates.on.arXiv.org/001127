The advantage of MoS2, compared with graphene, is the direct growth on various oxide substrates
by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) without utilizing catalytic metal substrates, which facilitates
practical applications for electronics. The carrier mobility is, however, degraded from the intrinsic
limit mainly due to short-range scattering caused by S vacancies formed during CVD growth. If the
upper limit for the crystallinity of CVD-MoS2 on oxide substrates is determined by the MoS2/substrate
interaction during growth, it will hinder the advantage. In this study, we investigated the interaction
between monolayer MoS2 and a SiO2/Si substrate and the difference in crystallinity between the
top and bottom S surfaces due to the MoS2/substrate interaction. Raman and photoluminescence spectroscopy
indicated that doping and strain were induced in MoS2 from the substrate, but they could be removed
by transferring MoS2 to a new substrate using polymers. The newly developed polymer-transfer technique
enabled selective transfer of the bottom or top surface of CVD-MoS2 onto a new SiO2/Si substrate.
The metal-insulator transition was clearly observed for both the normal and inverse transfers,
suggesting that the crystallinity of CVD-MoS2 is high and that the crystallinity of the bottom surface
interacting with the substrate was similar to that of the top free surface. These results provide
positive prospects for the further improvement of the crystallinity of MoS2 on oxide substrates
by reconsidering the growth conditions.
