In the Dirac/Weyl semimetal, the chiral anomaly appears as an "axial" current arising from charge-pumping
between the lowest (chiral) Landau levels of the Weyl nodes, when an electric field is applied parallel
to a magnetic field $\bf B$. Evidence for the chiral anomaly was obtained from the longitudinal magnetoresistance
(LMR) in Na$_3$Bi and GdPtBi. However, current jetting effects (focussing of the current density
$\bf J$) have raised general concerns about LMR experiments. Here we implement a litmus test that
allows the intrinsic LMR in Na$_3$Bi and GdPtBi to be sharply distinguished from pure current jetting
effects (in pure Bi). Current jetting enhances $J$ along the mid-ridge (spine) of the sample while
decreasing it at the edge. We measure the distortion by comparing the local voltage drop at the spine
(expressed as the resistance $R_{spine}$) with that at the edge ($R_{edge}$). In Bi, $R_{spine}$
sharply increases with $B$ but $R_{edge}$ decreases (jetting effects are dominant). However,
in Na$_3$Bi and GdPtBi, both $R_{spine}$ and $R_{edge}$ decrease (jetting effects are subdominant).
A numerical simulation allows the jetting distortions to be removed entirely. We find that the intrinsic
longitudinal resistivity $\rho_{xx}(B)$ in Na$_3$Bi decreases by a factor of 10.9 between $B$
= 0 and 10 T. A second litmus test is obtained from the parametric plot of the planar angular magnetoresistance.
These results strenghthen considerably the evidence for the intrinsic nature of the chiral-anomaly
induced LMR. We briefly discuss how the squeeze test may be extended to test ZrTe$_5$.
