The stable configurations formed by two viscoelastic, ellipsoid-shaped droplets during their
arrested coalescence has been investigated using micromanipulation experiments. Ellipsoidal
droplets are produced by millifluidic emulsification of petrolatum into a yield stress fluid that
preserves their elongated shape. The liquid meniscus between droplets can transmit stress and
instigate movement of the droplets, from their initial relative position, in order to minimize
doublet surface energy. The action of the liquid meniscus causes the ellipsoidal droplets to undergo
rolling and restructuring events because of their unique ellipsoid shape and associated variation
in surface curvature. The final configuration of the droplets is shown to be controlled by the balance
between interfacial Laplace pressure and internal elasticity, as well as a constraint force that
resists complete minimization of surface energy. Geometric and surface energy calculations are
used to map the possible and most likely configurations of the droplet pairs. Experimental deviations
from the calculations indicate the magnitude and potential origin of the constraint force resisting
full equilibration. Droplet aspect ratio and elasticity are both shown to influence the degree
of restructuring and stability of the droplets at energy extrema. Higher aspect ratios drive greater
restructuring and better agreement with final doublet configurations predicted by energy minimization.
Lower elasticity droplets undergo secondary deformations at high aspect ratios, further broadening
the space of possible morphologies.
