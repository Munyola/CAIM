Josephson junctions provide highly non-linear impedances at the root of many applications such
as quantum limited parametric amplifiers or superconducting qubits. These junctions are often
described by a sinusoidal relation $I = I_c \sin \varphi$ which relates the current $I$ to the integral
over time of the voltage across the junction $\varphi$. This relation properly captures the contribution
of the superconducting condensate but not the quasi-particles that appear when the system is driven
out-of-equilibrium. Here, we construct a unifying framework that includes a microscopic description
of the junction (full fledged treatment of the time-dependent Bogoliubov-De-Gennes equation)
in presence of a classical electronic circuit. Our approach generalizes the standard Resistor-Capacitor-Josephson
model (RCJ) to arbitrary junctions (including e.g. multi-terminal geometries and/or junctions
that embed topological or magnetic elements) and classical circuits. We apply our technique to
two situations. First, a RC circuit connected to single channel Josephson junction that exhibits
Multiple Andreev Reflection (MAR) phenomena. We show that the theory properly describes both MAR
and the hysteresis loops due to the electromagnetic environment. We show that out-of-equilibrium,
the current-phase relation of the junction becomes strongly distorted from the simple sinusoidal
form. Second, we embed the junction into a RLC circuit and show that the out-of-equilibrium non-sinusoidal
current phase relation leads to a strong change of the shape of the resonance.
