We observe capillary-driven binding between thin, equilateral triangular prisms at a flat air-water
interface. The edge length of the equilateral triangle face is 120 $\mu m$, and the thickness of the
prism is varied between 2 and 20 $\mu m$. For thickness to length (T/L) ratios of 1/10 or less, pairs
of triangles preferentially bind in either a tip-to-tip or tip-to-midpoint edge configurations;
for pairs of particles of thickness T/L = 1/5, the tip of one triangle binds to any position along the
other triangle's edge. The distinct binding configurations for small T/L ratios result from physical
bowing of the prisms, a property that arises during their fabrication. When bowed prisms are placed
at the air-water interface, two distinct polarity states arise: prisms either sit with their center
of mass above or below the interface. The interface pins to the edge of the prism's concave face, resulting
in an interface profile that is similar to that of a capillary hexapole, but with important deviations
close to the particle that enable directed binding. We present corresponding theoretical and numerical
analysis of the capillary interactions between these prisms and show how particle bowing and contact-line
pinning yield a capillary hexapole-like interaction that results in the two sets of distinct, highly-directional
binding events. Prisms of all T/L ratios self-assemble into space-spanning open networks; the
results suggest design parameters for the fabrication of building blocks of ordered open structures
such as the Kagome lattice.
