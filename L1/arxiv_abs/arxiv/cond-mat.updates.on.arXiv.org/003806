The discovery of unusual negative thermal expansion (NTE) provides the opportunity to control
the common but much desired property of thermal expansion, which is valuable not only in scientific
interests but also in practical applications. However, most of the available NTE materials are
limited to a narrow temperature range, and the NTE effect is generally weakened by means of various
modifications. Here, we report an enhanced NTE effect that occurs over a wide temperature range
(\alpha V = -5.24 * 10-5 {\deg}C^-1, 25-575 {\deg} C), and this NTE effect is accompanied by an abnormal
enhanced tetragonality, a large spontaneous polarization, and a G-type antiferromagnetic ordering
in the present perovskite-type ferroelectric of (1-x)PbTiO3-xBiCoO3. Specifically, for the
composition of 0.5PbTiO3-0.5BiCoO3, an extensive volumetric contraction of ~4.8 % has been observed
near the Curie temperature of 700 {\deg}C, which represents the highest level in PbTiO3-based ferroelectrics.
According to our experimental and theoretical results, the giant NTE originates from a synergistic
effect of the ferroelectrostriction and spin-crossover of cobalt on the crystal lattice. The actual
NTE mechanism is contrasted with previous functional NTE materials, in which the NTE is simply coupled
with one ordering such as electronic, magnetic, or ferroelectric ordering. The present study sheds
light on the understanding of NTE mechanisms and it attests that NTE could be simultaneouslycoupled
with different orderings, which will pave a new way toward the design of large NTE materials.
