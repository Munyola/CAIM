The mixed spin-1 and spin-1/2 Heisenberg octahedral chain with regularly alternating monomeric
spin-1 sites and square-plaquette spin-1/2 sites is investigated using variational technique,
localized-magnon approach, exact diagonalization (ED) and density-matrix renormalization
group (DMRG) method. The investigated model has in a magnetic field an extraordinarily rich ground-state
phase diagram, which includes the uniform and cluster-based Haldane phases, two ferrimagnetic
phases of Lieb-Mattis type, two quantum spin liquids and two bound magnon crystals in addition to
the fully polarized ferromagnetic phase. The lowest-energy eigenstates in a highly-frustrated
parameter region belong to flat bands and hence, low-temperature thermodynamics above the bound
magnon-crystal ground states can be satisfactorily described within the localized-magnon approach.
The variational method provides an exact evidence for the magnon-crystal phase with a character
of the monomer-tetramer ground state at zero field, while another magnon-crystal phase with a single
bound magnon at each square plaquette is found in a high-field region. A diversity of quantum ground
states gives rise to manifold zero-temperature magnetization curves, which may involve up to four
wide intermediate plateaus at zero, one-sixth, one-third and two-thirds of the saturation magnetization,
two quantum spin-liquid regions and two tiny plateaus at one-ninth and one-twelfth of the saturation
magnetization corresponding to the fragmentized cluster-based Haldane phases.
