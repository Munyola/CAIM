Superposition states of circular currents of exciton-polaritons mimic the superconducting flux
qubits. The current states are formed by a macroscopic number of bosonic quasiparticles that compose
a single quantum state of a many-body condensate. The essential difference between a polariton
fluid and a superconducting current comes from the fact that in contrast to Cooper pairs polaritons
are electrically neutral, and the magnetic field would not have a significant effect on a polariton
flow. Nevertheless, the phase of a polariton condensate must change by an integer number of 2$\pi$,
when going around the ring. If one introduces a $\pi$-phase delay line in the ring, the system is obliged
to propagate a clockwise or anticlockwise circular current to reduce the total phase gained over
one round-trip to zero or to build it up to $2\pi$. We show that such a $\pi$-delay line can be provided
by a dark soliton embedded into a ring condensate and pinned to a potential well created by a C-shape
non-resonant pump-spot. The physics of resulting split-ring polariton condensates is essentially
similar to the physics of flux qubits. In particular, they exhibit pronounced coherent oscillations
passing periodically through clockwise and anticlockwise current states. We predict that these
oscillations may persist far beyond the coherence time of polariton condensates. As a consequence,
the qubits based on split-ring polariton condensates are expected to possess very high figures
of merit that makes them a valuable alternative to superconducting qubits.
