Intrinsic defects give rise to scattering processes governing the transport properties of mesoscopic
systems. We investigate analytically and numerically the local density of states in Bernal stacking
bilayer graphene with a point defect. With Bernal stacking structure, there are two types of lattice
sites. One corresponds to connected sites, where carbon atoms from each layer stack on top of each
other, and the other corresponds to disconnected sites. From our theoretical study, a picture emerges
in which the pronounced zero-energy peak in the local density of states does not attribute to zero-energy
impurity states associated to two different types of defects but to a collective phenomenon of the
low-energy resonant states induced by the defect. To corroborate this description, we numerically
show that at small system size $N$, where $N$ is the number of unit cells, the zero-energy peak near
the defect scales as $1/\ln N$ for the quasi-localized zero-energy state and as $1/N$ for the delocalized
zero-energy state. As the system size approaches to the thermodynamic limit, the former zero-energy
peak becomes a power-law singularity $1/|E|$ in low energies, while the latter is broadened into
a Lorentzian shape. A striking point is that both types of zero-energy peaks decay as $1/r^2$ away
from the defect, manifesting the quasi-localized character. Based on our results, we propose a
general formula for the local density of states in low-energy and in real space. Our study sheds light
on this fundamental problem of defects.
