In semiconductor physics, many of the essential material parameters relevant for optoelectronics
can be experimentally revealed via optical spectroscopy in sufficiently large magnetic fields.
For the new class of monolayer transition-metal dichalcogenide semiconductors, this field scale
can be substantial --many tens of teslas or more-- due to the relatively heavy carrier masses and
the very large electron-hole (exciton) binding energies. Here we report circularly-polarized
absorption spectroscopy of the monolayer semiconductors MoS$_2$, MoSe$_2$, and WS$_2$ in extremely
high magnetic fields up to 91~T. By encapsulating exfoliated monolayers in hexagonal boron nitride,
we achieve very high optical quality structures that allow to follow the diamagnetic shifts and
valley Zeeman splittings of not only the $1s$ ground state of the neutral exciton but also its excited
$2s$, $3s$, ..., $ns$ Rydberg states. The energies and diamagnetic shifts provide a direct determination
of the effective (reduced) exciton masses and the dielectric properties of these monolayer semiconductors
-- fundamental material parameters that until now were available only from theoretical calculations.
Unexpectedly, the measured exciton masses are significantly heavier than predicted for Mo-based
monolayers. Moreover, we also measure other important material properties, including exciton
binding energies, exciton radii, and free-particle bandgaps. These results provide essential
and quantitative parameters for the rational design of opto-electronic van der Waals heterostructures
incorporating 2D semiconductor monolayers.
