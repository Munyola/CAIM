The primary mechanism of operation of almost all transistors today relies on electric-field effect
in a semiconducting channel to tune its conductivity from the conducting 'on'-state to a non-conducting
'off'-state. As transistors continue to scale down to increase computational performance, physical
limitations from nanoscale field-effect operation begin to cause undesirable current leakage
that is detrimental to the continued advancement of computing. Using a fundamentally different
mechanism of operation, we show that through nanoscale strain engineering with thin films and ferroelectrics
(FEs) the transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) MoTe$_2$ can be reversibly switched with electric-field
induced strain between the 1T'-MoTe$_2$ (semimetallic) phase to a semiconducting MoTe$_2$ phase
in a field effect transistor geometry. This alternative mechanism for transistor switching sidesteps
all the static and dynamic power consumption problems in conventional field-effect transistors
(FETs). Using strain, we achieve large non-volatile changes in channel conductivity (G$_{on}$/G$_{off}$~10$^7$
vs. G$_{on}$/G$_{off}$~0.04 in the control device) at room temperature. Ferroelectric devices
offer the potential to reach sub-ns nonvolatile strain switching at the attojoule/bit level, having
immediate applications in ultra-fast low-power non-volatile logic and memory while also transforming
the landscape of computational architectures since conventional power, speed, and volatility
considerations for microelectronics may no longer exist.
