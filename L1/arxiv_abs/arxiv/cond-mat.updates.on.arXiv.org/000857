When exposed to strong shearing, the particles in a crystal will rearrange and ultimately, the crystal
will break by forming large nonaffine defects. Even for the initial stage of this process, only little
effort has been devoted to the understanding of the breaking process on the scale of the individual
particle size for thermalized mixed crystals. Here, we explore the shear-induced breaking for
an equimolar two-dimensional binary model crystal with a high interaction asymmetry between the
two different species such that the initial crystal has an intersecting square sublattice of the
two constituents. Using Brownian dynamics computer simulations, we show that the combination
of shear and thermal fluctuations leads to a characteristic hierarchical breaking scenario where
initially, the more strongly coupled particles are thermally distorted, paving the way for the
weakly coupled particles to escape from their cage. This in turn leads to mobile defects which may
finally merge, proliferating a cascade of defects, which triggers the final breakage of the crystal.
This scenario is in marked contrast to the breakage of one-component crystals close to melting.
Moreover, we explore the orientational dependence of the initial shear direction relative to the
crystal orientation and compare this to the usual melting scenario without shear. Our results are
verifiable in real-space experiments of superparamagnetic colloidal mixtures at a pending air-water
interface in an external magnetic field where the shear can be induced by an external laser field.
