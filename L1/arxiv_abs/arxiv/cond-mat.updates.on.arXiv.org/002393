The ground state of half-doped manganites involves intricate spin, charge and orbital orderings,
which are difficult to discern experimentally. In this work, we resort to the theoretical analysis
of the spin fluctuation spectrum of the half-doped bilayer Pr(Ca$_{0.9}$Sr$_{0.1}$)$_2$ Mn$_2$O$_7$
in order to get an insight of its electronic ground state. By means of the linear spin wave approximation,
we compute the magnon dispersion for a family of localized spin models, which can describe several
phases proposed for the ground state of half-doped manganites, like the intermediate one proposed
by Efremov et al. [Nat.Mats. 3, 853, (2004)] along with its particular cases corresponding to Goodenough's
CE phase [Phys. Rev. 100, 564, (1955)] and Zener polaron or dimer phases. We obtain an excellent agreement
between theory and experiment when the ground state is assumed to be a generalized Goodenough's
CE phase, with a Mn-charge disproportionation inside the experimentally expected range. As essential
ingredients for our improved fit of the upper and lower magnon branches measured around the gap,
we identified two next-nearest neighbour exchange interactions between the planar Mn zig-zag
chains, one for each type of Mn ion present. In connection with this finding, we revisited the magnetic
excitations of the laminar related compounds, focusing on the upper magnon branches. Here we prove
that their measurement would provide the key to identify unambiguously the ground state present
in the layered half-doped manganites.
