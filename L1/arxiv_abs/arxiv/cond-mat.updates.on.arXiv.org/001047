Determining the atomic configuration of an interface is one of the most important issues in the materials
research. Although theoretical simulations are effective tools for that purpose, the exhaustive
search is computationally prohibitive due to high degrees of freedom of the interface structure.
For the fast exploration of the interface structures, we introduce two machine-learning concepts,
called transfer learning and cost-sensitive search. To solve multiple different (but related)
tasks, transferring knowledge of each task improves efficiency of machine-learning methods.
In the interface-structure search, multiple energy surfaces created by a variety of different
orientation angles need to be explored to understand interface properties. A knowledge-transfer
based machine-learning algorithm can provide an efficient search for the interface structures
by exploiting similarity among multiple energy surfaces. Further, we consider diversity of supercell
sizes of interface models, which results in a different computational cost of each search space.
The idea of the cost-sensitive search is to compare candidate structures based on both of a possible
energy decrease and the computational cost, meaning that each candidate is evaluated by its cost-effectiveness
for the energy decrease. By combining the above two machine-learning concepts, our method realizes
a cost-effective simultaneous search for multiple energy surfaces. As a case study, we show efficiency
of our method using the fcc-Al [110] tilt grain boundary.
