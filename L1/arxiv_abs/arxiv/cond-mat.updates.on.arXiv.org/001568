Many puzzling properties of high-$T_c$ superconducting (HTSC) copper oxides have deep roots in
the nature of the antinodal quasiparticles, the elementary excitations with wavevector parallel
to the Cu-O bonds. These electronic states are most affected by the onset of antiferromagnetic correlations
and charge instabilities and they host the maximum of the anisotropic superconducting gap and pseudogap.
In this work, we use time-resolved extreme-ultra-violet (EUV) photoemission with proper photon
energy (18 eV) and time-resolution (50 fs) to disclose the ultrafast dynamics of the antinodal states
in a prototypical HTSC cuprate. After photoinducing a non-thermal charge redistribution within
the Cu and O orbitals, we reveal a dramatic momentum-space differentiation of the transient electron
dynamics. While the nodal quasi-particle distribution is heated up as in a conventional metal,
new quasiparticle states transiently emerge at the antinodes, similarly to what is expected for
a photoexcited Mott insulator, where the frozen charges can be released by an impulsive excitation.
This transient antinodal metallicity is mapped into the dynamics of the O-2$p$ bands thus directly
demonstrating the intertwining between the low- and high-energy scales that is typical of correlated
materials. Our results suggest that the correlation-driven freezing of the electrons moving along
the Cu-O bonds, analogous to the Mott localization mechanism, constitutes the starting point for
any model of high-$T_c$ superconductivity and other exotic phases of HTSC cuprates.
