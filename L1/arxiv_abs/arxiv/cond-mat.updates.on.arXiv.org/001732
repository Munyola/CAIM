Lattice structures have tailorable mechanical properties which allows them to exhibit superior
mechanical properties (per unit weight) beyond what is achievable through natural materials.
In this paper, quasi-static and dynamic behavior of additively manufactured stainless steel lattice
cylinders is studied. Cylindrical samples with internal lattice structure are fabricated by a
laser powder bed fusion system. Equivalent hollow cylindrical samples with the same length, outer
diameter, and mass (larger wall thickness) are also fabricated. Split Hopkinson bar is used to study
the behavior of the specimens under high strain rate loading. It is observed that lattice cylinders
reduce the transmitted wave amplitude up to about 21% compared to their equivalent hollow cylinders.
However, the lower transmitted wave energy in lattice cylinders comes at the expense of a greater
reduction in their stiffness, when compared to their equivalent hollow cylinder. In addition,
it is observed that increasing the loading rate by five orders of magnitude leads to up to about 36%
increase in the peak force that the lattice cylinder can carry, which is attributed to strain rate
hardening effect in the bulk stainless steel material. Finite element simulations of the specimens
under dynamic loads are performed to study the effect of strain rate hardening, thermal softening,
and the failure mode on dynamic behavior of the specimens. Numerical results are compared with experimental
data and good qualitative agreement is observed.
