Chiral magnets support topological skyrmion textures due to the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya spin-orbit
interaction. In the presence of a sufficiently large applied magnetic field, such skyrmions are
large amplitude excitations of the field-polarized magnetic state. We investigate analytically
the interaction between such a skyrmion excitation and its small amplitude fluctuations, i.e.,
the magnons in a clean two-dimensional chiral magnet. The magnon spectrum is found to include two
magnon-skyrmion bound states corresponding to a breathing mode and, for intermediate fields,
a quadrupolar mode, which will give rise to subgap magnetic and electric resonances. Due to the skyrmion
topology, the magnons scatter from a Aharonov-Bohm flux density that leads to skew and rainbow scattering,
characterized by an asymmetric differential cross section with, in general, multiple peaks. As
a consequence of the skew scattering, a finite density of skyrmions will generate a topological
magnon Hall effect. Using the conservation law for the energy-momentum tensor, we demonstrate
that the magnons also transfer momentum to the skyrmion. As a consequence, a magnon current leads
to magnon pressure reflected in a momentum-transfer force in the Thiele equation of motion for the
skyrmion. This force is reactive and governed by the scattering cross sections of the skyrmion;
it causes not only a finite skyrmion velocity but also a large skyrmion Hall effect. Our results provide,
in particular, the basis for a theory of skyrmion caloritronics for a dilute skyrmion gas in clean
insulating chiral magnets.
