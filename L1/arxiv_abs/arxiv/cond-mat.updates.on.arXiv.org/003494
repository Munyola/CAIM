Cortical neurons exhibit rich dynamics, shaped by the presence of history-dependent biophysical
mechanisms such as adaptation over different time scales. On the other hand, cortical circuits
are highly recurrent which can result in chaotic network dynamics even if network nodes have simple
dynamics. We analyze how the dynamics of nodes (such as single neurons) and recurrent connections
interact to shape the effective dynamics in large randomly connected networks. A novel dynamical
mean-field theory for networks of multi-dimensional rate units shows that, despite the nonlinear
interactions between units, the recurrent network dynamics inherit, in the chaotic phase, the
qualitative features of the linear response properties of the single units. For the case of two-dimensional
rate units with strong adaptation, we find that the network exhibits a state of "resonant chaos",
whose resonance frequency can be predicted from the properties of isolated units. The correlation
time of the chaotic network scales with the adaptation timescale of a single unit. Our theory for
network analysis can be applied to numerous other mechanisms at the level of single nodes, such as
synaptic filtering, refractoriness or spike synchronization. These results advance our understanding
of the interaction between single-neuron mechanisms and recurrent connectivity, a fundamental
step toward the description of biologically realistic network models in the brain, or, more generally,
networks of other physical or man-made complex dynamical units.
