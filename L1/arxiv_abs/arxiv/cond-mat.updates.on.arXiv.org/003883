The nematic electronic state and its associated nematic critical fluctuations have emerged as
potential candidates for superconducting pairing in various unconventional superconductors.
However, in most materials their coexistence with other magnetically-ordered phases poses significant
challenges in establishing their importance. Here, by combining chemical and hydrostatic physical
pressure in FeSe$_{0.89}$S$_{0.11}$, we provide a unique access to a clean nematic quantum phase
transition in the absence of a long-range magnetic order. We find that in the proximity of the nematic
phase transition, there is an unusual non-Fermi liquid behavior in resistivity at high temperatures
that evolves into a Fermi liquid behaviour at the lowest temperatures. From quantum oscillations
in high magnetic fields, we trace the evolution of the Fermi surface and electronic correlations
as a function of applied pressure. We detect experimentally a Lifshitz transition that separates
two distinct superconducting regions: one emerging from the nematic electronic phase with a small
Fermi surface and strong electronic correlations and the other one with a large Fermi surface and
weak correlations that promotes nesting and stabilization of a magnetically-ordered phase at
high pressures. The lack of mass divergence suggests that the nematic critical fluctuations are
quenched by the strong coupling to the lattice. This establishes that superconductivity is not
enhanced at the nematic quantum phase transition in the absence of magnetic order.
