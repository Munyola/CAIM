Few-layer Tellurium, an elementary semiconductor, succeeds most of striking physical properties
that black phosphorus (BP) offers and could be feasibly synthesized by simple solution-based methods.
It is comprised of non-covalently bound parallel Te chains, among which covalent-like feature
appears. This feature is, we believe, another demonstration of the previously found covalent-like
quasi-bonding (CLQB) where wavefunction hybridization does occur. The strength of this inter-chain
CLQB is comparable with that of intra-chain covalent bonding, leading to closed stability of several
Te allotropes. It also introduces a tunable bandgap varying from nearly direct 0.31 eV (bulk) to
indirect 1.17 eV (2L) and four (two) complex, highly anisotropic and layer-dependent hole (electron)
pockets in the first Brillouin zone. It also exhibits an extraordinarily high hole mobility (~10$^5$
cm$^2$/Vs) and strong optical absorption along the non-covalently bound direction, nearly isotropic
and layer-dependent optical properties, large ideal strength over 20%, better environmental
stability than BP and unusual crossover of force constants for interlayer shear and breathing modes.
All these results manifest that the few-layer Te is an extraordinary-high-mobility, high optical
absorption, intrinsic-anisotropy, low-cost-fabrication, tunable bandgap, better environmental
stability and nearly direct bandgap semiconductor. This "one-dimension-like" few-layer Te,
together with other geometrically similar layered materials, may promote the emergence of a new
family of layered materials.
