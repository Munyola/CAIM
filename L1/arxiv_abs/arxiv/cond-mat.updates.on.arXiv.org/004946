The steady flow of spherical particles in a rectangular bin is studied using the Discrete Element
Method (DEM) for different flow rates of the particles from the bin, in the slow flow regime. The flow
has two non-zero velocity components and is more complex than the widely studied unidirectional
shear flows. The objective of the study is to characterize, in detail, the local rheology of the flowing
material. The flow is shown to be nearly constant density, with a symmetric stress tensor and the
principal directions of the stress and rate of strain tensors nearly colinear. The local rheology
is analyzed using a coordinate transformation which enables direct computation of the viscosity
and components of the pressure assuming the granular material to be a generalized Newtonian fluid.
The scaled viscosity, fluctuation velocity and volume fraction are shown to follow power law relations
with the inertial number, a scaled shear rate, and data for different flow rates collapse to a single
curve in each case. Results for flow of the particles on an inclined surface, presented for comparison,
are similar to those for the bin flow, but with a lower viscosity and a higher solid fraction due to
layering of the particles. The in plane normal stresses are nearly equal and slightly larger than
the third component. All three normal stresses correlate well with the corresponding fluctuation
velocity components. Based on the empirical correlations obtained, a continuum model is presented
for computation of granular flows.
