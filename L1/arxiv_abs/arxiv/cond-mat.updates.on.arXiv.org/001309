We consider Anderson transitions in two-dimensional spinful electron gases subject to random
scalar potentials with time-reversal-symmetric spin-mixing tunneling (SMT) and spin-preserving
tunneling (SPT) at potential saddle points (PSPs). A symplectic quantum network model, named as
SMT-QNM, is constructed in which SMT and SPT have the same status and contribute independent tunneling
channels rather than sharing a total-probability-fixed one. Two-dimensional continuous Dirac
Hamiltonian is then extracted out from this discrete network model as the generator of certain unitary
transformation. With the help of high-accuracy numerics based on transfer matrix technique, finite-size
analysis on two-terminal conductance and normalized localization length provides a phase diagram
drawn in the SMT-SPT plane. As a manifestation of symplectic ensembles, a normal-metal (NM) phase
emerges between the quantum spin Hall (QSH) and normal-insulator (NI) phases when SMT appears.
We systematically analyze the quantum phases on the boundary and in the interior of the phase space.
Particularly, the phase diagram is closely related to that of disordered three-dimensional weak
topological insulators by appropriate parameter mapping. At last, if time-reversal symmetry
in electron trajectories between PSPs is destroyed, the system falls into unitary class with no
more NM phase. A direct SMT-driven transition from QSH to NI phases exists and can be explained by
spin-flip backscattering between the degenerate doublets at the same sample edge.
