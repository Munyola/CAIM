The quantum mechanical screening of a spin via conduction electrons depends sensitively on the
environment seen by the magnetic impurity. A high degree of responsiveness can be obtained with
metal complexes, as the embedding of a metal ion into an organic molecule prevents intercalation
or alloying and allows for a good control by an appropriate choice of the ligands. There are therefore
hopes to reach an "on demand" control of the spin state of single molecules adsorbed on substrates.
Hitherto one route was to rely on "switchable" molecules with intrinsic bistabilities triggered
by external stimuli, such as temperature or light, or on the controlled dosing of chemicals to form
reversible bonds. However, these methods constrain the functionality to switchable molecules
or depend on access to atoms or molecules. Here, we present a way to induce bistability also in a planar
molecule by making use of the environment. We found that the particular "habitat" offered by an antiphase
boundary of the Rashba system BiAg$_2$ stabilizes a second structure for manganese phthalocyanine
molecules, in which the central Mn ion moves out of the molecular plane. This corresponds to the formation
of a large magnetic moment and a concomitant change of the ground state with respect to the conventional
adsorption site. The reversible spin switch found here shows how we can not only rearrange electronic
levels or lift orbital degeneracies via the substrate, but even sway the effects of many-body interactions
in single molecules by acting on their surrounding.
