Ultrafine-grained aluminum alloys offer interesting multifunctional properties with a combination
of high strength, low electrical resistivity, and low density. However, due to thermally induced
grain coarsening, they typically suffer from an intrinsic poor thermal stability. To overcome
this drawback, an Al-2%Fe alloy has been selected because of the low solubility of Fe in Al and their
highly positive enthalpy of mixing leading to the formation of stable intermetallic particles.
The two-phase alloy has been processed by severe plastic deformation to achieve simultaneously
submicrometer Al grains and a uniform distribution of nanoscaled intermetallic particles. The
influence of the level of deformation on the microstructure has been investigated thanks to transmission
electron microscopy and atom probe tomography and it is shown that for the highest strain a partial
dissolution of the metastable Al6Fe particle occurred leading to the formation of a Fe super saturated
solid solution. The thermal stability, and especially the precipitation of particles from the
ultrafine-grained solid solution and the way they pin grain boundaries has been investigated both
from static annealing and in-situ transmission electron microscopy experiments. The correlation
between microstructural features and microhardness has been established to identify the various
strengthening contributions. Finally, it is 2 shown that ultrafine grained high purity Al with
less than 0.01 at. % Fe in solid solution could preserve a grain size only 300nm after 1h at 250$^\circ$C.
