Nanomechanical resonators based on strained silicon nitride (Si3N4) have received a large amount
of attention in fields such as sensing and quantum optomechanics due to their exceptionally high
quality factors (Qs). Room-temperature Qs approaching 1 billion are now in reach by means of phononic
crystals (soft-clamping) and strain engineering. Despite great progress in enhancing Qs, difficulties
in fabrication of soft-clamped samples limits their implementation into actual devices. An alternative
means of achieving ultra-high Qs was shown using trampoline resonators with engineered clamps,
which serves to localize the stress to the center of the resonator, while minimizing stress at the
clamping. The effectiveness of this approach has since come into question from recent studies employing
string resonators with clamp-tapering. Here, we investigate this idea using nanomechanical string
resonators with engineered clampings similar to those presented for trampolines. Importantly,
the effect of orienting the strings diagonally or perpendicularly with respect to the silicon frame
is investigated. It is found that increasing the clamp width for diagonal strings slightly increases
the Qs of the fundamental out-of-plane mode at small radii, while perpendicular strings only deteriorate
with increasing clamp width. Measured Qs agree well with finite-element method simulations even
for higher-order resonances. The small increase cannot account for previously reported Qs of trampoline
resonators. Instead, we propose the effect to be intrinsic and related to surface and radiation
losses.
