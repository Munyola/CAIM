The classical Langevin dynamics of a particle in a periodic potential energy landscape are studied
via the intermediate scattering function (ISF). By construction, the particle performs coupled
vibrational and activated jump motion with a wide separation of the vibrational period and the mean
residence time between jumps. The long time limit of the ISF is a decaying tail proportional to the
function that describes ideal jump motion in the absence of vibrations. The amplitude of the tail
is unity in idealized jump dynamics models, but is reduced from unity by the intra-well motion. Analytical
estimates of the amplitude of the jump motion signature are provided by assuming a \textcolor{blue}{factorization
of the conditional probability density of the particle position at long times, motivated by the
separation of time scales associated with inter-cell and intra-cell motion}. The assumption leads
to a factorization of the ISF at long correlation times, where one factor is an ideal jump motion signature,
and the other component is the amplitude of the signature. The amplitude takes the form of a single-particle
anharmonic Debye-Waller factor. The factorization approximation is exact at the diffraction
conditions associated with the periodic potential. Numerical simulations of the Langevin equation
in one and two spatial dimensions confirm that for a strongly corrugated potential the analytical
approximation provides a good qualitative description of the trend in the jump signature amplitude,
between the points where the factorization is exact.
