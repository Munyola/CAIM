Due to its non-equilibrium character, active matter in a steady state can drive engines that autonomously
deliver work against a constant mechanical force or torque. As a generic model for such an engine,
we consider systems that contain one or several active components and a single passive one that is
asymmetric in its geometrical shape or its interactions. Generally, one expects that such an asymmetry
leads to a persistent, directed current in the passive component, which can be used for the extraction
of work. We validate this expectation for a minimal model consisting of an active and a passive particle
on a one-dimensional lattice. It leads us to identify thermodynamically consistent measures for
the efficiency of the conversion of isotropic activity to directed work. For systems with continuous
degrees of freedom, work cannot be extracted using a one-dimensional geometry under quite general
conditions. In contrast, we put forward two-dimensional shapes of a movable passive obstacle that
are best suited for the extraction of work, which we compare with analytical results for an idealised
work-extraction mechanism. For a setting with many non-interacting active particles, we use a
mean-field approach to calculate the power and the efficiency, which we validate by simulations.
Surprisingly, this approach reveals that the interaction with the passive obstacle can mediate
cooperativity between otherwise non-interacting active particles, which enhances the extracted
power per active particle significantly.
