Analogs of the high-T$_c$ cuprates have been long sought after in transition metal oxides. Due to
the strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC), the $5d$ perovskite iridates Sr$_2$IrO$_4$ exhibit a low-energy
electronic structure remarkably similar to the cuprates. Whether a superconducting state exists
as in the cuprates requires understanding the correlated spin-orbit entangled electronic states.
Recent experiments discovered hidden order in the parent and electron doped iridates, some with
striking analogies to the cuprates, including Fermi surface pockets, Fermi arcs, and pseudogap.
Here, we study the correlation and disorder effects in a five-orbital model derived from the band
theory. We find that the experimental observations are consistent with a $d$-wave spin-orbit density
wave order that breaks the symmetry of a joint two-fold spin-orbital rotation followed by a lattice
translation. There is a Berry phase and a plaquette spin flux due to spin procession as electrons
hop between Ir atoms, akin to the intersite SOC in quantum spin Hall insulators. The associated staggered
circulating $J_\text{eff}=1/2$ spin current can be probed by advanced techniques of spin-current
detection in spintronics. This electronic order can emerge spontaneously from the intersite Coulomb
interactions between the spatially extended iridium $5d$ orbitals, turning the metallic state
into an electron doped quasi-2D Dirac semimetal with important implications on the possible superconducting
state suggested by recent experiments.
