We present a comprehensive overview of vortex pinning in single crystals of the isovalently substituted
iron-based superconductor BaFe$_{2}$(As$_{1-x}$P$_{x}$)$_{2}$, a material that qualifies
as an archetypical clean superconductor, containing only sparse strong point-like pins [in the
sense of C.J. van der Beek {\em et al.}, Phys. Rev. B {\bf 66}, 024523 (2002)]. Widely varying critical
current values for nominally similar compositions show that flux pinning is of extrinsic origin.
Vortex configurations, imaged using the Bitter decoration method, show less density fluctuations
than those previously observed in charge-doped Ba(Fe$_{1-x}$Co$_{x}$)$_{2}$As$_{2}$ single
crystals. Analysis reveals that the pinning force and -energy distributions depend on the P-content
$x$. However, they are always much narrower than in Ba(Fe$_{1-x}$Co$_{x}$)$_{2}$As$_{2}$, a
result that is attributed to the weaker temperature dependence of the superfluid density on approaching
$T_{c}$ in BaFe$_{2}$(As$_{1-x}$P$_{x}$)$_{2}$. Critical current density measurements and
pinning force distributions independently yield a mean distance between effective pinning centers
$\bar{\mathcal L} \sim 90$ nm, increasing with increasing P-content $x$. This evolution can be
understood as being the consequence of the P-dependence of the London penetration depth. Further
salient features are a wide vortex free "Meissner belt", observed at the edge of overdoped crystals,
and characteristic chain-like vortex arrangements, observed at all levels of P-substitution.
