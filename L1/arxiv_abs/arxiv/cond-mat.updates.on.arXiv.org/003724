Enhancement of thermal performance of concrete wall is nowadays of great importance in reducing
the operational energy demand of buildings. We developed a new kind of inorganic coating material
based on \ce{SiO2}-\ce{Al2O3}-rich minerals and Portland cement (PC) powder. The finely pulverized
mineral powder with the particle size distribution (PSD) of 0.4-40 $\mu$m was mixed with the vehicle
solvent containing some agents, cement powder with PSD of 2-100 $\mu$m, and water in the certain
weight ratio, producing the colloid solution. After application within 2 hours to the plaster layer
of concrete wall and sufficient long hardening period of over three months, the coating layer of
0.6-1.0 mm thickness was observed to become a densified ceramic. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD)
experiments were performed to identify the crystalline components of minerals, cement and ceramic
coating powders. Three- and two-dimensional surface morphologies and chemical compositions
of coating material were obtained with the optical interferometer and scanning electron microscope
(SEM) equipped with an energy dispersive X-ray analyzer (EDX). These XRD and SEM/EDX analyses demonstrated
obviously that the coating layer is mainly composed of the calcium-silicate-hydrate (C-S-H) and
the calcium-aluminate-hydrate (C-A-H) ceramics with the relatively small number of closed pores
(10\% porosity) compared with the cement mortar and concrete layers. Two-step hydrations of cement
and subsequently \ce{SiO2}-\ce{Al2O3} promoted by the alkali product \ce{Ca(OH)2} were proposed
as the main mechanism of ceramic formation.
