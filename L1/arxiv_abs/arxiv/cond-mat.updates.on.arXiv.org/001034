The longitudinal spin Seebeck effect refers to the generation of a spin current when heat flows across
a normal metal/magnetic insulator interface. Until recently, most explanations of the spin Seebeck
effect use the interfacial temperature difference as the conversion mechanism between heat and
spin fluxes. However, theoretically it is expected that a magnon spin current is generated in the
bulk of a magnetic insulator even in the absence of an interface. This is the so-called intrinsic
spin Seebeck effect. Here, by utilizing a non-local spin Seebeck geometry, we provide evidence
that the total magnon spin current in the ferrimagnetic insulator yttrium iron garnet (YIG) actually
contains two distinct terms: one proportional to the gradient in the magnon chemical potential
(pure spin diffusion), and a second proportional to the gradient in magnon temperature ($\nabla
T_m$). We observe two characteristic decay lengths for magnon spin currents in YIG with distinct
temperature dependences: a temperature independent decay length of ~ 10 {\mu}m consistent with
earlier measurements of pure ($\nabla T_m = 0$) magnon spin diffusion, and a longer decay length
ranging from about 20 {\mu}m around 250 K and exceeding 80 {\mu}m at 10 K. The coupled spin-heat transport
processes are modeled using a finite element method revealing that the longer range spin current
is attributable to the intrinsic spin Seebeck ($\nabla T_m \neq 0$), whose length scale increases
at lower temperatures in agreement with our experimental data.
