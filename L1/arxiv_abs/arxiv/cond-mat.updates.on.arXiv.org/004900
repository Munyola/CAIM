Superfluid stiffness $\rho_s$ is a defining characteristic of the superconducting state, allowing
phase coherence and supercurrent. It is accessible experimentally through the penetration depth.
Coexistence of $d$-wave superconductivity with other phases in underdoped cuprates, such as antiferromagnetism
(AF) or charge-density waves (CDW), may drastically alter $\rho_s$. To shed light on this physics,
the zero-temperature value of $\rho_s=\rho_{zz}$ along the $c$-axis was computed for different
values of Hubbard interaction $U$ and different sets of tight-binding parameters describing the
high-temperature superconductors YBCO and NCCO. We used Cellular Dynamical Mean-Field Theory
for the one-band Hubbard model with exact diagonalization as impurity solver and state-of-the-art
bath parametrization. We conclude that Mott physics plays a dominant role in determining the superfluid
stiffness on the hole-doped side of the phase diagram. On the electron-doped side, antiferromagnetism
wins over superconductivity near half-filling. But upon approaching optimal electron-doping,
homogeneous coexistence between superconductivity and antiferromagnetism causes the superfluid
stiffness to drop sharply. Hence, on the electron-doped side, it is competition between antiferromagnetism
and $d$-wave superconductivity that plays a dominant role in determining the value of $\rho_{zz}$
near half-filling. At large overdoping, $\rho_{zz}$ behaves in a more BCS-like manner in both the
electron- and hole-doped cases. We comment on some qualitative implications of these results for
the superconducting transition temperature.
