In two-dimensional (2D) superconductors an insulating state can be induced either by applying
a magnetic field, $H$, or by increasing disorder. Many scenarios have been put forth to explain the
superconductor to insulator transition (SIT): dominating fermionic physics after the breaking
of Cooper pairs, loss of phase coherence between superconducting islands embedded in a metallic
or insulating matrix and localization of Cooper pairs with concomitant condensation of vortex-type
excitations. The difficulty in characterizing the insulating state and its origin stems from the
lack of a continuous mapping of the superconducting to insulating phase diagram in a single sample.
Here we use the two-dimensional (2D) electron liquid formed at the interface between the two insulators
(111) SrTiO$_3$ and LaAlO$_3$ to study the superconductor to insulator transition. This crystalline
interface surprisingly exhibits very strong features previously observed only in amorphous systems.
By use of electrostatic gating and magnetic fields, the sample is tuned from the metallic region,
where supeconductivity is fully manifested, deep into the insulating state. Through examination
of the field dependence of the sheet resistance and comparison of the response to fields in different
orientations we identify a new magnetic field scale, H$_{pairing}$, where superconducting fluctuations
are muted. Our findings show that vortex fluctuations excitations and Cooper pair localization
are responsible for the observed SIT and that these excitations surprisingly persist deep into
the insulating state.
