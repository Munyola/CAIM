Effects of spin-orbit interactions in condensed matter are an important and rapidly evolving topic.
Strong competition between spin-orbit, on-site Coulomb and crystalline electric field interactions
in iridates drives exotic quantum states that are unique to this group of materials. In particular,
the Jeff = 1/2 Mott state served as an early signal that the combined effect of strong spin-orbit and
Coulomb interactions in iridates has unique, intriguing consequences. In this Key Issues Review,
we survey some current experimental studies of iridates. In essence, these materials tend to defy
conventional wisdom: absence of conventional correlations between magnetic and insulating states,
avoidance of metallization at high pressures, S-shaped I-V characteristic, emergence of an odd-parity
hidden order, etc. It is particularly intriguing that there exist conspicuous discrepancies between
current experimental results and theoretical proposals that address superconducting, topological
and quantum spin liquid phases. This class of materials, in which the lattice degrees of freedom
play a critical role seldom seen in other materials, evidently presents some profound intellectual
challenges that call for more investigations both experimentally and theoretically. Physical
properties unique to these materials may help unlock a world of possibilities for functional materials
and devices. We emphasize that, given the rapidly developing nature of this field, this Key Issues
Review is by no means an exhaustive report of the current state of experimental studies of iridates.
