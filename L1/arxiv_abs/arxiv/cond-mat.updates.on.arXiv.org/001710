Global coevolutionary models of homologous protein families, as constructed by direct coupling
analysis (DCA), have recently gained popularity in particular due to their capacity to accurately
predict residue-residue contacts from sequence information alone, and thereby to facilitate
tertiary and quaternary protein structure prediction. More recently, they have also been used
to predict fitness effects of amino-acid substitutions in proteins, and to predict evolutionary
conserved protein-protein interactions. These models are based on two currently unjustified
hypotheses: (a) correlations in the amino-acid usage of different positions are resulting collectively
from networks of direct couplings; and (b) pairwise couplings are sufficient to capture the amino-acid
variability. Here we propose a highly precise inference scheme based on Boltzmann-machine learning,
which allows us to systematically address these hypotheses. We show how correlations are built
up in a highly collective way by a large number of coupling paths, which are based on the protein's
three-dimensional structure. We further find that pairwise coevolutionary models capture the
collective residue variability across homologous proteins even for quantities which are not imposed
by the inference procedure, like three-residue correlations, the clustered structure of protein
families in sequence space or the sequence distances between homologs. These findings strongly
suggest that pairwise coevolutionary models are actually sufficient to accurately capture the
residue variability in homologous protein families.
