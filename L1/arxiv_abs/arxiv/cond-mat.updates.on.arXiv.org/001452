Defects such as dislocations impact materials properties and their response during external stimuli.
Defect engineering has emerged as a possible route to improving the performance of materials over
a wide range of applications, including batteries, solar cells, and semiconductors. Imaging these
defects in their native operating conditions to establish the structure-function relationship
and, ultimately, to improve performance has remained a considerable challenge for both electron-based
and x-ray-based imaging techniques. However, the advent of Bragg coherent x-ray diffractive imaging
(BCDI) has made possible the 3D imaging of multiple dislocations in nanoparticles ranging in size
from 100 nm to1000 nm. While the imaging process succeeds in many cases, nuances in identifying the
dislocations has left manual identification as the preferred method. Derivative-based methods
are also used, but they can be inaccurate and are computationally inefficient. Here we demonstrate
a derivative-free method that is both more accurate and more computationally efficient than either
derivative- or human-based methods for identifying 3D dislocation lines in nanocrystal images
produced by BCDI. We formulate the problem as a min-max optimization problem and show exceptional
accuracy for experimental images. We demonstrate a 260x speedup for a typical experimental dataset
with higher accuracy over current methods. We discuss the possibility of using this algorithm as
part of a sparsity-based phase retrieval process. We also provide the MATLAB code for use by other
researchers.
