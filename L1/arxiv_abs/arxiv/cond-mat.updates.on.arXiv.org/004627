We develop an analytical model to describe the phonon dispersion relations of thermoelectrics
with heavy guest atoms (rattlers). Crucially, the model also accounts for phonon damping arising
from anharmonicity. The spectrum of low energy states contains acoustic-like and (soft) optical-like
modes, which display the typical avoided crossing, and which can be derived analytically by considering
the dynamical coupling between host lattice and guest rattlers. Inclusion of anharmonic damping
in the model allows us, for the first time, to compute the vibrational density of states (VDOS) and
the specific heat, unveiling the presence of a boson peak (BP) anomaly indicating the glassy behaviour
of phonons in the otherwise crystalline material. We discuss the dynamics of the BP as a function
of the strength of the interaction between the soft modes and the anharmonic lattice, and of the energy
gap between the two avoided-crossing branches. Upon increasing the coupling strength between
the host and the guest dynamics, and by decreasing the energy of the soft optical modes, the BP anomaly
becomes stronger and it moves towards lower frequencies. Moreover, we find a robust linear correlation
between the BP frequency and the energy of the soft optical-like modes. Our results provide decisive
evidence for the link between soft gapped modes and glassy phonon anomalies. Finally, it provides
a useful model for tuning the phonon glass behaviour of thermoelectrics, which is crucial for optimizing
the energy conversion efficiency in these materials.
