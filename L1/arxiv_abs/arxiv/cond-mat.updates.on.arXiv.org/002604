We perform a systematic theoretical analysis of the nature and importance of alloy disorder effects
on the electronic and optical properties of GaN$_{y}$As$_{1-x-y}$Bi$_{x}$ alloys and quantum
wells (QWs), using large-scale atomistic supercell electronic structure calculations based
on the tight-binding method. Using ordered alloy supercell calculations we also derive and parametrise
an extended basis 14-band \textbf{k}$\cdot$\textbf{p} Hamiltonian for GaN$_{y}$As$_{1-x-y}$Bi$_{x}$.
Comparison of the results of these models highlights the role played by short-range alloy disorder
-- associated with substitutional nitrogen (N) and bismuth (Bi) incorporation -- in determining
the details of the electronic and optical properties. Systematic analysis of large alloy supercells
reveals that the respective impact of N and Bi on the band structure remain largely independent,
a robust conclusion we find to be valid even in the presence of significant alloy disorder where N
and Bi atoms share common Ga nearest neighbours. Our calculations reveal that N- (Bi-) related alloy
disorder strongly influences the conduction (valence) band edge states, leading in QWs to strong
carrier localisation, as well as inhomogeneous broadening and modification of the conventional
selection rules for optical transitions. Our analysis provides detailed insight into key properties
and trends in this unusual material system, and enables quantitative evaluation of the potential
of GaN$_{y}$As$_{1-x-y}$Bi$_{x}$ alloys for applications in photonic and photovoltaic devices.
