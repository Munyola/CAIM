We investigate the use of variational wave-functions that mimic stochastic recurrent neural networks,
specifically, unrestricted Boltzmann machines, as guiding functions in projective quantum Monte
Carlo (PQMC) simulations of quantum spin models. As a preliminary step, we investigate the accuracy
of such unrestricted neural network states as variational Ans\"atze for the ground state of the
ferromagnetic quantum Ising chain. We find that by optimizing just three variational parameters,
independently on the system size, accurate ground-state energies are obtained, comparable to
those previously obtained using restricted Boltzmann machines with few variational parameters
per spin. Chiefly, we show that if one uses optimized unrestricted neural network states as guiding
functions for importance sampling the efficiency of the PQMC algorithms is greatly enhanced, drastically
reducing the most relevant systematic bias, namely that due to the finite random-walker population.
The scaling of the computational cost with the system size changes from the exponential scaling
characteristic of PQMC simulations performed without importance sampling, to a polynomial scaling,
even at the ferromagnetic quantum critical point. The important role of the protocol chosen to sample
hidden-spins configurations, in particular at the critical point, is analyzed. We discuss the
implications of these findings for what concerns the problem of simulating adiabatic quantum optimization
using stochastic algorithms on classical computers.
