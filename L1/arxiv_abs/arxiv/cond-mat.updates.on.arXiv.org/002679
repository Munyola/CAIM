The unexpected appearance of a fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE) plateau at $\nu=2+6/13$~
[Kumar \emph{et al.}, Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 105}, 246808 (2010)] offers a clue into the physical
mechanism of the FQHE in the second Landau level (SLL). Here we propose a "$\bar{3}\bar{2}111$"
parton wave function as a candidate ground state for this phase and demonstrate that it satisfies
the criteria we expect from successful wave functions. Specifically, we show: 1) in the SLL this
wave function has lower energy than the standard composite fermion 6/13 wave function relevant
for the lowest Landau level (LLL), 2) the $\bar{3}\bar{2}111$ wave function has a reasonably high
overlap with the numerically obtained exact SLL Coulomb ground state, and 3) the excitation gap
and overlap of the $\bar{3}\bar{2}111$ state with the exact ground state are robust to small changes
to the form of the interaction potential. We make several predictions for experimentally measurable
properties that can reveal the nature of this state and also distinguish it from the topologically
distinct 6/13 state realized in the LLL. Taking these results together with the recent demonstration
that the related "$\bar{2}\bar{2}111$" wave function is a good candidate for the ground state at
$\nu = 2 + 1/2$ [Balram, Barkeshli, Rudner, arXiv:1803.10427], we propose that the "$\bar{n}\bar{2}111$"
family of parton wave functions naturally describes the experimentally observed sequence of SLL
FQHE plateaus at $2+2/3$, $2+1/2$ and $2+6/13$, and their hole partners.
