We explore with exact diagonalization the propagation of a single hole in four magnetic phases of
the t-J-like Kitaev-Heisenberg model on a honeycomb lattice: the Neel antiferromagnetic, stripe,
zigzag and Kitaev spin-liquid phase. We find coherent propagation of spin-polaron quasiparticles
in the antiferromagnetic phase by a similar mechanism as in the $t$-$J$ model for high-$T_c$ cuprates.
In the stripe and zigzag phases clear quasiparticles features appear in spectral functions of those
propagators where holes are created and annihilated on one sublattice, while they remain largely
{\it hidden} in those spectral functions that correspond to photoemission experiments. As the
most surprising result, we find a totally incoherent spectral weight distribution for the spectral
function of a hole moving in the Kitaev spin-liquid phase in the strong coupling regime relevant
for iridates. At intermediate coupling the finite systems calculation reveals a well defined quasiparticle
at the $\Gamma$ point, however, we find that the gapless spin excitations wipe out quasiparticles
at finite momenta. Also for this more subtle case we conclude that in the thermodynamic limit the
lightly doped Kitaev liquid phase does not support quasiparticle states in the neighborhood of
$\Gamma$, and therefore yields a {\it non-Fermi liquid}, contrary to earlier suggestions based
on slave-boson studies. These observations are supported by the presented study of the dynamic
spin-structure factor for the Kitaev spin liquid regime.
