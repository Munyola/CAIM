Using first principles calculations, we study the conduction band alignment, effective mass,
and Fermi surface complexity factor of n-type Mg3Sb2-xBix (x = 0, 1, and 2) from the full ab initio
band structure. We find that with increasing the Bi content the K and M band minima moves away from
the conduction band minimum CB1 while the singly-degenerate $\Gamma$ band minimum shifts rapidly
downward and approaches the conduction band minimum. But the favorable six-fold degenerate CB1
band minimum keeps dominating the conduction band minimum and there is no band crossing between
the $\Gamma$ and CB1 band minima. In addition, we show that the connection of the CB1 carrier pockets
with the energy level close to the band minimum M can strongly enhance the carrier pocket anisotropy
and Fermi surface complexity factor, which is likely the electronic origin for the local maximum
in the theoretical power factor. Our calculations also show that the band gap, density of states
effective mass, Seebeck coefficient, and Fermi surface complexity factor decrease with increasing
the Bi content, which is unfavorable to the electrical transport. However, reducing the conductivity
effective mass with increasing the Bi content is beneficial to the electrical transport by improving
carrier mobility and weighted mobility as long as the detrimental bipolar effect is insignificant.
As a result, in comparison with n-type Mg3Sb2, n-type Mg3SbBi shows higher power factors and a much
lower optimal carrier concentration for the theoretical power factor at 300 K, which can be easily
achieved by the experiment.
