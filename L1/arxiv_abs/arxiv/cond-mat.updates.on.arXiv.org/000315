Changes in temperature or stress state may induce reversible B2$\leftrightarrow$(R)$\leftrightarrow$
B19' martensitic transformations and associated shape memory effects in close-to-stoichiometric
nickel-titanium (NiTi) alloys. Recent experimental studies confirmed a considerable impact
of the hydrogen-rich aging atmosphere on the subsequent B2 austenite $\leftrightarrow$ B19' martensite
transformation path. In this paper, we employ Density Functional Theory to study properties of
Ar, He, and H interstitials in B2 austenite and B19' martensite phases. We show that H interstitials
exhibit negative formation energies, while Ar and He interstitials yield positive values. Our
theoretical analysis of slightly Ni-rich Ni--Ti alloys with the austenite B2 structure shows that
a slight over-stoichiometry towards Ni-rich compositions in a range 51--$52\,\text{at.%}$ is
energetically favorable. The same conclusion holds for H-doped NiTi with the H content up to $\approx6\,\text{at.%}$.
In agreement with experimental data we predict H atoms to have a strong impact on the martensitic
phase transformation in NiTi by altering the mutual thermodynamic stability of the high-temperature
cubic B2 and the low-temperature monoclinic B19' phase of NiTi. Hydrogen atoms are predicted to
form stable interstitial defects. As this is not the case for He and Ar, mixtures of hydrogen and the
two inert gases can be used in annealing experiments to control H partial pressure when studying
the martensitic transformations in NiTi in various atmospheres.
