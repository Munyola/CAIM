The concept of hyperuniformity has been a useful tool in the study of large-scale density fluctuations
in systems ranging across the natural and mathematical sciences. One can rank a large class of hyperuniform
systems by their ability to suppress long-range density fluctuations through the use of a hyperuniformity
order metric $\bar{\Lambda}$. We apply this order metric to the Barlow packings, which are the infinitely
degenerate densest packings of identical rigid spheres that are distinguished by their stacking
geometries and include the commonly known fcc lattice and hcp crystal. The "stealthy stacking"
theorem implies that these packings are all stealthy hyperuniform, a strong type of hyperuniformity
which involves the suppression of scattering up to a wavevector $K$. We describe the geometry of
three classes of Barlow packings, two disordered classes and small-period packings. In addition,
we compute a lower bound on $K$ for all Barlow packings. We compute $\bar{\Lambda}$ for the aforementioned
three classes of Barlow packings and find that to a very good approximation, it is linear in the fraction
of fcc-like clusters, taking values between those of least-ordered hcp and most-ordered fcc. This
implies that the $\bar{\Lambda}$ of all Barlow packings is primarily controlled by the local cluster
geometry. These results indicate the special nature of anisotropic stacking disorder, which provides
impetus for future research on the development of anisotropic order metrics and hyperuniformity
properties.
