We present a combined single-crystal x-ray diffuse scattering and ab-initio molecular dynamics
study of lead telluride, PbTe. Well-known for its thermoelectric and narrow-gap semiconducting
properties, PbTe recently achieved further notoriety following the report of an unusual off-centering
of the lead atoms, accompanied by a local symmetry breaking, on heating. This observation, which
was named emphanisis, ignited considerable controversy regarding the details of the underlying
local structure and the appropriate interpretation of the total scattering experiments. In this
study, we demonstrate close agreement between our diffuse scattering measurements and our calculations,
which allows us to analyze features such as higher-order correlations that are accessible in the
simulations but not experimentally. This allowed us to discover an unusual correlated local dipole
formation extending over several unit cells with an associated local reduction of the cubic symmetry
in both our x-ray diffuse scattering measurements and our molecular dynamics simulations. Importantly,
when averaged spatially or temporally, the most probable positions for the ions are at the centers
of their coordination polyhedra. Our results therefore clarify the nature of the local symmetry
breaking, and reveal the source of the earlier controversy regarding the existence or absence of
off-centering. Finally, we provide an interpretation of the behavior in terms of coupled soft optical
and acoustic modes, which is linked also to the high thermoelectric performance of PbTe.
