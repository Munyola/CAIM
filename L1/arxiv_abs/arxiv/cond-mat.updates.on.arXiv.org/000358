The t-J model is studied using a novel and rigorous mapping of the Gutzwiller projected electrons,
in terms of canonical electrons. The mapping has considerable similarity to the Dyson-Maleev transformation
relating spin operators to canonical Bosons. This representation gives rise to a non Hermitean
quantum theory, characterized by minimal redundancies. A path integral representation of the
canonical theory is given. Using it, the salient results of the extremely correlated Fermi liquid
(ECFL) theory, including the previously found Schwinger equations of motion, are easily rederived.
Further a transparent physical interpretation is obtained of the previously identified ingredients
needed to compute the physical Greens function, namely the auxiliary Greens functions and the caparison
factor. The low energy electron spectral function in this theory with a strong intrinsic asymmetry,
is summarized in terms of a few expansion coefficients. The resulting energy dispersion is a hybrid
of a massive and a massless Dirac spectrum $ E^*_Q\sim \gamma\, Q- \sqrt{\Gamma_0^2 + Q^2} $, where
$Q\sim 0$ locates the kink momentum. Therefore the quasiparticle velocity interpolates between
$(\gamma \mp 1)$ over a width $\Gamma_0$ on the two sides of $Q=0$. The resulting kink strongly resembles
a prominent low energy feature seen in angle resolved photoemission spectra (ARPES) of cuprate
materials. We also propose novel ways of analyzing the ARPES data to isolate the predicted asymmetry
between particle and hole excitations.
