Fe$_{2}$VAl and Fe$_{2}$TiSn are full Heusler compounds with non-magnetic ground state. The two
compouds are good thermoelectric materials. PBE and LDA(PW92) are the two most commonly used density
functionals to study the Heusler compounds. Along with these two well studied exchange-correlation
functionals, recently developed PBEsol, mBJ and SCAN functionals are employed to study the two
compounds. Using the five functionals equilibrium lattice parameter and bulk modulus are calculated.
Obtained values are compared with experimental reports wherever available. Electronic structure
properties are studied by calculating dispersion curves, total and partial density of states.
For Fe$_{2}$VAl, band gap of 0.22 eV is obtained from the mBJ potential which is in reasonable agreement
with experimental value while, for Fe$_{2}$TiSn band gap of 0.68 eV is obtained. Fe$_{2}$VAl is
predicted to be semimetallic with different values of negative gaps from LDA,PBEsol,PBE and SCAN
functionals. Whereas, Fe$_{2}$TiSn is found to be semimetallic(semiconducting) from LDA,PBEsol(PBE,SCAN)
functionals employed calculations. From the dispersion curve effective mass values are also computed
to see the contribution to the Seebeck coefficient. In Fe$_{2}$TiSn, a flat band is present along
the $\Gamma$-X direction with calculated value of effective mass $\sim$36 more than the mass of
electron. The improvements or inadequacies among the functionals in explaining the properties
of full Heusler alloys for thermoelectric application are thus observed through this study.
