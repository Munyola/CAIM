Infrared spectroscopic ellipsometry is applied to investigate the free-charge carrier properties
of Mg-doped InN films. Two representative sets of In-polar InN grown by molecular beam epitaxy with
Mg concentrations ranging from $1.2\times10^{17}$ cm$^{-3}$ to $8\times10^{20}$ cm$^{-3}$
are compared. P-type conductivity is indicated for the Mg concentration range of $1\times10^{18}$
cm$^{-3}$ to $9\times10^{19}$ cm$^{-3}$ from a systematic investigation of the longitudinal
optical phonon plasmon broadening and the mobility parameter in dependence of the Mg concentration.
A parameterized model that accounts for the phonon-plasmon coupling is applied to determine the
free-charge carrier concentration and mobility parameters in the doped bulk InN layer as well as
the GaN template and undoped InN buffer layer for each sample. The free-charge carrier properties
in the second sample set are consistent with the results determined in a comprehensive analysis
of the first sample set reported earlier [Sch\"oche et al., J. Appl. Phys. 113, 013502 (2013)]. In
the second set, two samples with Mg concentration of $2.3\times10^{20}$ cm$^{-3}$ are identified
as compensated n-type InN with very low electron concentrations which are suitable for further
investigation of intrinsic material properties that are typically governed by high electron concentrations
even in undoped InN. The compensated n-type InN samples can be clearly distinguished from the p-type
conductive material of similar plasma frequencies by strongly reduced phonon plasmon broadening.
