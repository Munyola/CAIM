Crystallization from a supercooled liquid initially proceeds via the formation of a small solid
embryo (nucleus), which requires surmounting an activation barrier. This phenomenon is most easily
studied by numerical simulation, using specialized biased-sampling techniques to overcome the
limitations imposed by the rarity of nucleation events. Here, I focus on the barrier to homogeneous
ice nucleation in supercooled water, as represented by the monatomic-water model, which in the
bulk exhibits a complex interplay between different ice structures. I consider various protocols
to identify solidlike particles on a computer, which perform well enough for the Lennard-Jones
model, and compare their respective impact on the shape and height of the nucleation barrier. It
turns out that the effect is stronger on the nucleus size than on the barrier height. As a by-product
of the analysis, I determine the structure of the nucleation cluster, finding that the relative
amount of ice phases in the cluster heavily depends on the method used for classifying solidlike
particles. Moreover, the phase which is most favored during the earlier stages of crystallization
may happen, depending on the nucleation coordinate adopted, to be different from the stable polymorph.
Therefore, the quality of a reaction coordinate cannot be assessed simply on the basis of the barrier
height obtained. I explain how this outcome is possible and why it just points out the shortcoming
of collective variables appropriate to simple fluids in providing a robust method of particle classification
for monatomic water.
