The Bose-Einstein condensation of excitons continues to garner immense attention as a prototypical
example for observing emergent properties from many-body quantum effects. In particular, Titanium
Diselenide (TiSe$_2$) is a promising candidate for realizing exciton condensation and was experimentally
observed only very recently [\href{https://doi.org/10.1126\%2Fscience.aam6432}{Science
\textbf{358} 1314 (2017)}]. Surprisingly, the condensate was experimentally characterized
by a soft plasmon mode that only exists near the transition temperature, $T_c$, of the charge density
wave (CDW). Here, we characterize and analyze the experimental spectra using linear-response
time-dependent density functional theory and find that the soft mode can be attributed to interband
electronic transitions. At the CDW state below $T_c$, the periodic lattice distortions hamper
the spontaneous formation of the exciton by introducing a CDW gap. The band gap raises the soft mode
and merges it into the regular plasmon. Our surprising results contradict previous simplistic
analytical models commonly used in scientific literature. In addition, we find that a finite electronic
temperature, $T_e$, introduces a dissipation channel and prevents the condensation above $T_c$.
The combined effect of the CDW and $T_e$ explains the fragile temperature-dependence of the exciton
condensation. Taken together, our work provides the first \textit{ab initio} atomic-level framework
for rationalizing recent experiments and further manipulating exciton condensates in TiSe$_2$.
