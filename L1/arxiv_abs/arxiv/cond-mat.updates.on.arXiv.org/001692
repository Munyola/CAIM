A new mathematical approach to condensed matter physics, based on the finite temperature field
theory, was recently proposed. The field theory is a scale-free formalism, thus, it denies absolute
values of thermodynamic temperature and uses dimensionless thermal variables, which are expressed
via the group velocities of sound and the interatomic distance. This formalism was previously applied
to the specific heat of condensed matter and predicted the fourth power of temperature at sufficiently
low temperatures, which was tested by experimental data for diamond lattice materials. The range
of temperatures with the quartic law varies for different materials, therefore, it is called the
quasi-low temperature regime. The quasi-low temperature behavior of specific heat is verified
here with experimental data for the fcc lattice materials, silver chloride and lithium iodide.
The conjecture that the fourth order behavior is universal for all condensed matter systems is also
confirmed by the glass of vitreous silica. This law is long known to hold for the bcc solid helium-4.
The characteristic temperatures of the threshold of the quasi-low temperature regime are obtained
for the studied materials. The scaling in the specific heat of condensed matter is expressed by the
dimensionless parameter explored with data for several glasses. The correlation of the 'boson
peak' temperature with the shear velocities is explained. The critique of the Debye theory of specific
heat and the Born-von Karman model of the lattice dynamics is given.
