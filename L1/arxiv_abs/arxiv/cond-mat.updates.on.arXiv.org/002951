We consider a new class of model systems to study systematically the role of molecular shape in the
transport properties of dense liquids. Our model is a liquid binary mixture where both the molecules
are non-spherical and characterized by a collection of parameters. Although in the real world most
of the molecules are non-spherical, only a limited number of theoretical studies exist on the effects
of molecular shapes and hardly any have addressed the validity of the hydrodynamic predictions
of rotational and translational diffusion of these shapes in liquids. In this work, we study a model
liquid consisting of a mixture of prolate and oblate (80:20 mixture) ellipsoidals with interactions
governed by a modified Gay-Berne potential for a particular aspect ratio (ratio of the length and
diameter of the ellipsoids), at various temperature and pressure conditions. We report calculations
of transport properties of this binary mixture by varying temperature over a wide range, at a fixed
pressure. We find that for the pressure-density conditions studied, there is no signature of any
phase separation, except transitions to the crystalline phase at low temperatures and relatively
low pressure (the reason we largely confined our studies to high pressure). We find that for our model
binary mixture, both the stick and slip hydrodynamic predictions break down in a major fashion,
for both prolates and oblates and particularly so for rotation. Moreover, prolates and oblates
themselves display different dynamical features in the mean square displacement and in orientational
time correlation functions.
