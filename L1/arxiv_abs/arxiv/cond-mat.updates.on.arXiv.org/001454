Finite element analysis of stress about a blunt crack tip, emphasizing finite strain and phenomenological
and mechanism-based strain gradient plasticity (SGP) formulations, is integrated with electrochemical
assessment of occluded-crack tip hydrogen (H) solubility and two H-decohesion models to predict
hydrogen environment assisted crack growth properties. SGP elevates crack tip geometrically
necessary dislocation density and flow stress, with enhancement declining with increasing alloy
strength. Elevated hydrostatic stress promotes high-trapped H concentration for crack tip damage;
it is imperative to account for SGP in H cracking models. Predictions of the threshold stress intensity
factor and H-diffusion limited Stage II crack growth rate agree with experimental data for a high
strength austenitic Ni-Cu superalloy (Monel K-500) and two modern ultra-high strength martensitic
steels (AerMet 100 and Ferrium M54) stressed in 0.6 M NaCl solution over a range of applied potential.
For Monel K-500, KTH is accurately predicted versus cathodic potential using either classical
or gradient-modified formulations; however, Stage II growth rate is best predicted by a SGP description
of crack tip stress that justifies a critical distance of 1 {\mu}m. For steel, threshold and growth
rate are best predicted using high-hydrostatic stress that exceeds 6 to 8 times alloy yield strength
and extends 1 {\mu}m ahead of the crack tip. This stress is nearly achieved with a three-length phenomenological
SGP formulation, but additional stress enhancement is needed, perhaps due to tip geometry or slip-microstructure.
