The low energy structures of irradiation-induced defects have been studied in detail, as these
determine the available modes by which a defect can diffuse or relax. As a result, there are many studies
concerning the relative energies of possible defect structures, and empirical potentials are
commonly fitted to or evaluated with respect to these energies. But recently [Dudarev et al Nuclear
Fusion 2018], we have shown how to determine the stresses, strains and swelling of reactor components
under irradiation from the elastic properties of ensembles of irradiation-induced defects. These
elastic properties have received comparatively little attention. Here we evaluate relaxation
volumes of irradiation-induced defects in tungsten computed with empirical potentials, and compare
to density functional theory results where available. Different empirical potentials give different
results, but some potential-independent trends in relaxation volumes can be identified. We show
that the relaxation volume of small defects can be predicted to within 10% from their point-defect
count. For larger defects we provide empirical fits for the relaxation volume of as a function of
size. We demonstrate that the relaxation volume associated with a single primary-damage cascade
can be estimated from the primary knock-on atom (PKA) energy. We conclude that while annihilation
of vacancy- and interstitial- character defects will invariably reduce the total relaxation volume
of the cascade debris, empirical potentials disagree whether coalescence of defects will reduce
or increase the total relaxation volume.
