Topological superconductors are in the focus of research because of their high potential for future
applications of quantum computation. With the recent discovery of the quantum anomalous Hall insulator
(QAHI), which exhibits the conductive quantum Hall edge states without external magnetic field,
it becomes possible to create a novel topological superconductor by introducing superconductivity
into these edge states. In this case, two distinct topological superconducting phases with one
or two chiral Majorana edge modes formed, characterized by Chern numbers (N ) of 1 and 2, respectively.
Recent experiments on a QAHI / superconductor (SC) heterostructure revealed the presence of integer
and half-integer quantized plateaus in the conductance over a deposited SC strip and presented
the quantization evidence of these states. However, these results also provoked a few controversies
and thus additional direct evidence of a superconducting origin is urgently needed. We provided
spectroscopic evidence for a superconducting QAHI state using nano-point contacts at the edge
of a QAHI / SC heterostructure and obtained unique signatures of these two different topological
superconducting phases. The phase with N = 1 with a 2e^2/h conduction signature occurs in a narrow
field regime during the QAHI magnetization reversal just before the QAHI enters the trivial insulating
state. These results are consistent with theoretical analysis and further reaffirm the previous
result of 1/2 quantization due to Majorana fermion.
