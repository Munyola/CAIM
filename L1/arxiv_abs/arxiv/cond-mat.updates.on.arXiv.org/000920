Variability on the external conditions, such as temperature, humidity, pH, available nutrients,
etc., has important consequences for the dynamics and organization of communities of living systems.
In many cases, the characteristic timescale of environmental changes and their correlations play
a fundamental role in the way living systems adapt and respond to it. Thus, a proper mathematical
modeling requires of approaches more refined than e.g. simple white-noise approximations to population
dynamics. In this paper, we propose a unifying framework based on different analytical and numerical
tools available to deal with "colored" noise. For the sake of specificity, we present the method
we have devised using --as a guideline-- a variation of the contact process, where the propagation
rate varies stochastically in time. This approach allows us to tackle in a systematic manner some
of the relevant questions concerning population dynamics under environmental variability such
as, for instance, determining the stationary population density, establishing the conditions
under which a population may become extinct, and estimating extinction times. These questions
are fundamental, for example, in the context of population ecology and epidemiology, as they provide
valuable information for the maintenance of biodiversity or the eradication spreading diseases.
We shed light onto these questions, putting the focus on the emerging phase diagram and the possible
phase transitions, underlying how these change with respect to the noiseless case.
