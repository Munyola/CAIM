We theoretically study the high-harmonic generation (HHG) in one-dimensional spin systems. While
in electronic systems the driving by AC electric fields produces radiation from the dynamics of
excited charges, we consider here the situation where spin systems excited by a magnetic field pulse
generate radiation via a time-dependent magnetization. Specifically, we study the magnetic dipole
radiation in two types of ferromagnetic spin chain models, the Ising model with static longitudinal
field and the XXZ model, and reveal the structure of the spin HHG and its relation to spin excitations.
For weak laser amplitude, a peak structure appears which can be explained by time-dependent perturbation
theory. With increasing amplitude, plateaus with well-defined cutoff energies emerge. In the
Ising model with longitudinal field, the thresholds of the multiple plateaus in the radiation spectra
can be explained by the annihilation of multiple magnons. In the XXZ model, which retains the $\mathbf{Z}_{2}$
symmetry, the laser magnetic field can induce a phase transition of the ground state when it exceeds
a critical value, which results in a drastic change of the spin excitation character. As a consequence,
the first cutoff energy in the HHG spectrum changes from a single-magnon to a two-magnon energy at
this transition. Our results demonstrate the possibility of generating high-harmonic radiation
from magnetically ordered materials and the usefulness of high-harmonic signals for extracting
information on the spin excitation spectrum.
