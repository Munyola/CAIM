To explore the defect physics and chemistry in the water intercalated MAPbI$_3 \cdot$ H$_2$O and
monohydrated MAPbI$_3 \cdot$ H$_2$O phases , we investigate the water effect on the defect formation
energy diagrams and electronic structure by first-principles calculations. The formation energies
of Schottky defects such as PbI$_2$ and MAI vacancies are higher in hydrated phases than in pristine
phase because additional energy is needed for breaking the hydrogen bond between the water molecule
and the organic methylammonium molecule (MA) as well as the inorganic framework of PbI$_6$. Analysis
of the defect formation energy diagrams in the hydrated phases reveals that dominant defects under
iodine poor condition are the charged elemental defects such as lead and iodine vacancies (Pb$^{2+}$
and I$^-$), while under iodine rich condition the lead vacancy (Pb$^{2+}$) is the most dominant
defect. Most importantly, it is found through calculations of density of states (DOS) that the Schottky
defects of PbI$_2$ and MAI vacancies, and the charged elemental defect of iodine vacancy (I$^-$)
generate deep trap states within the band gap in hydrated phases, on the other hand any deep trap state
is not generated in pristine phase. Electron charge density calculations for deep trap states indicate
that iodine vacancy plays important role in deep trap states of monohydrated MAPbI$_3 \cdot$ H$_2$O
phase. Our study provides the degradation mechanism of perovskite solar cells under humid environment
in the view point of defect physics and chemistry.
