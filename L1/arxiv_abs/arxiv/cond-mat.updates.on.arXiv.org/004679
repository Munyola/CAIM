The interaction of light with matter in the presence of a static magnetic field gives rise to a wide
variety of phenomena, including the Faraday effect whereby the polarization of light is rotated
by magnetically induced circular birefringence. We report quantitative microwave Faraday rotation
measurements conducted with a high-mobility two-dimensional electron gas in a GaAs/AlGaAs semiconductor
heterostructure. Cyclotron motion of charge carriers in a two-dimensional electron gas leads
to a large Faraday effect in the microwave frequency range. The magnitude of Faraday rotation is
suppressed at higher frequencies by the kinetic inductance that arises from electron inertia.
As with the Hall effect, a continuous classical Faraday effect is observed as well as a quantized
Faraday effect. The high electron mobility enables a large single-pass Faraday rotation of $\theta_F^{max}
\simeq 45^\circ$ $(\simeq0.8$~rad) to be achieved at a modest magnetic field of $B \simeq 100$~mT.
In the quantum regime, the Faraday rotation $\theta_F$ is naturally quantized in units of the fine
structure constant $\alpha\simeq \frac{1}{137}$, giving a geometric prescription for determining
$\alpha$. Electromagnetic confinement leads to Faraday rotation that is quantized in units of
an effective $\alpha^*$ whose value is on the order of its free space value. Engineering of the electromagnetic
field distribution and impedance, including resonant cavity effects, could hence be used to purposefully
enhance or suppress Faraday rotation.
