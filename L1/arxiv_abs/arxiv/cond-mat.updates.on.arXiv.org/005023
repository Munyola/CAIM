The electronic structure inhomogeneities in Co, Ni, and Cr doped BaFe2As2 122 single crystals are
compared using scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/S) at nanoscales within three
different global property regions: pure superconducting (SC) dome (Co-122), coexisting of SC
and antiferromagnetic (AFM) region (Ni-122), and non-SC region (Cr-122). Machine learning method
is utilized to categorize the various nanometer-size inhomogeneous electronic states described
here as in-gap, L-shape and S-shape states immersed into the SC matrix for Ni-and Co-doped 122, and
L-shape and S-shape states into metallic matrix for Cr-doped 122. Although the relative percentages
of in-gap, L-shape and S-shape states vary in the three samples, the total volume fraction of the
three electronic states are quite similar, coincident with the electron (Ni0.04 and Co0.08) and
hole (Cr0.04) numbers doped into the 122 compound. By combining the volume fractions of the three
states, local density of the states (LDOS), field dependent behavior and global properties in these
three sets of samples, the in-gap state is confirmed as a magnetic impurity state from the Co or Ni
dopants, the L-shape state is identified as a spin density wave (SDW) which competes with the SC phase,
and the S-shape state is found to be another form of magnetic order which constructively cooperates
with the SC phase rather than competing with it. The comparison of the vortex structures indicates
that those inhomogeneous electronic states serve as pinning centers for stabilizing the hexagonal
vortex lattice.
