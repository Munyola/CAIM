Charge order is now accepted as an integral constituent of cuprate high-temperature superconductors,
one that is intimately related to other instabilities in the phase diagram including antiferromagnetism
and superconductivity. Unlike nesting-induced Peierls-like density waves, the charge correlations
in the CuO2 planes have been predicted to display a rich momentum space topology depending on the
detailed fermiology of the system. However, to date charge order has only been observed along the
high-symmetry Cu-O bond directions. Here, using resonant soft X-ray scattering, we investigate
the evolution of the full momentum space topology of charge correlations in Ln2CuO4 (Ln=Nd, Pr)
as a function of intrinsic electron doping. We report that, upon electron doping the parent Mott
insulator, charge correlations first emerge in a hitherto-unobserved form, with full (Cinf) rotational
symmetry in momentum-space. At higher doping levels, the orientation of charge correlations is
sharply locked to the Cu-O bond high-symmetry directions, restoring a more conventional bidirectional
charge order with enhanced correlation lengths. Through charge susceptibility calculations,
we closely reproduce the drastic evolution in the topology of charge correlations across an antiferromagnetic
quantum phase transition, highlighting the interplay between spin and charge degrees of freedom
in electron-doped cuprates. Finally, using the established link between charge correlations
and the underlying fermiology, we propose a revised phase diagram of Ln2CuO4 with a superconducting
region extending toward the Mott limit.
