Information technology depends on how one can control and manipulate signals accurately and quickly.
Transistors are at the core of modern technology and are based on electron charges. But as the device
dimension shrinks, heating becomes a major problem. The spintronics explores the spin degree of
electrons and thus bypasses the heat, at least in principle. For this reason, spin-based technology
offers a possible solution. In this review, we survey some of latest developments in all-optical
switching (AOS), where ultrafast laser pulses are able to reverse spins from one direction to the
other deterministically. But AOS only occurs in a special group of magnetic samples and within a
narrow window of laser parameters. Some samples need multiple pulses to switch spins, while others
need a single-shot pulse. To this end, there are several models available, but the underlying mechanism
is still under debate. This review is different from other prior reviews in two aspects. First, we
sacrifice the completeness of reviewing existing studies, while focusing on a limited set of experimental
results that are highly reproducible in different labs and provide actual switched magnetic domain
images. Second, we extract the common features from existing experiments that are critical to AOS,
without favoring a particular switching mechanism. We emphasize that given the limited experimental
data, it is really premature to identify a unified mechanism. We compare these features with our
own model prediction, without resorting to a phenomenological scheme. We hope that this review
serves the broad readership well.
