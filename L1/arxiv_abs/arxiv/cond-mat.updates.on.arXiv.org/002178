We investigate chemical and physical properties of crystalline Ta$_2$O$_5$ films grown on Si substrates
by radio frequency magnetron sputtering. We first grew three Ta films and, to induce the crystalline
phase of Ta$_2$O$_5$, two of them were exposed to a post-deposition annealing at 1273 K in air for
1 h. Coating characterization was performed by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy,
Raman scattering spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The microstructure of
the crystalline films is granular and the atomic structure corresponds to orthorhombic Ta$_2$O$_5$.
XPS depth profiles for Ta $4f$ and O $1s$ core-levels were carried out in order to assess the chemical
states of all samples. Upon analysis at the surface of the films, we observe the Ta $4f$ spectrum characteristic
of Ta$_2$O$_5$. However, as one goes deeper into the films, oxygen vacancies are generated by ion
bombardment and reconstruction processes are induced; resulting in the formation of metastable
Ta oxide phases with oxidation states Ta$^{1+}$, Ta$^{2+}$, Ta$^{3+}$, Ta$^{4+}$, and Ta$^{5+}$.
Exposing the films, after sputtering, to ambience for some days stimulates the amorphous phase
of Ta$_2$O$_5$ at the very surface suggesting that the suboxides of Ta are unstable. We discuss that
these suboxides are only generated during sputtering and at the very surface. The Raman results
indicate the presence of the orthorhombic Ta$_2$O$_5$ phase and also a straightforward transition
from Ta amorphous to crystalline Ta$_2$O$_5$.
