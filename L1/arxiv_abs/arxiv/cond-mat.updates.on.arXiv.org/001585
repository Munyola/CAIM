Interparticle interactions and bulk properties of colloidal suspensions can be substantially
modified by addition of nanoparticles. Extreme asymmetries in size and charge between colloidal
particles and nanoparticles present severe computational challenges to molecular-scale modeling
of such complex systems. We present a statistical mechanical theory of effective electrostatic
interactions that can greatly ease large-scale modeling of charged colloid-nanoparticle mixtures.
By applying a sequential coarse-graining procedure, we show that a multicomponent mixture of charged
colloids, nanoparticles, counterions, and coions can be mapped first onto a binary mixture of colloids
and nanoparticles and then onto a one-component model of colloids alone. In a linear-response approximation,
the one-component model is governed by a single effective pair potential and a one-body volume energy,
whose parameters depend nontrivially on nano particle size, charge, and concentration. To test
the theory, we perform molecular dynamics simulations of the two-component and one-component
models and compute structural properties. For moderate electrostatic couplings, colloid-colloid
radial distribution functions and static structure factors agree closely between the two models,
validating the sequential coarse-graining approach. Nanoparticles of sufficient charge and
concentration enhance screening of electrostatic interactions, weakening correlations between
charged colloids and destabilizing suspensions, consistent with experiments.
