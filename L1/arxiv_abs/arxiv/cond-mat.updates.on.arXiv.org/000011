Recently proposed density matrix renormalization group complete active space self consistent
field (DMRG-CASSCF) method provided a promising multi-reference tool for treating large complicated
electron correlation problems because it can handle up to 40 active orbitals for general systems.
However, the convergence difficulties and the expensive computational costs for large active
spaces in orbital optimization iterations as well as the complexity in selecting active orbitals
still greatly limit the applications of these promising methods. In this paper, we assess the efficiency
of using natural orbitals as the basis of large active space DMRG calculations, which include the
traditional NOs obtained by MP2, CISD and CASPT2 calculations, and NOs acquired from preliminary
moderate DMRG calculations (e.g. preserved states less than 500), as well as Kohn-Sham orbitals,
Hartree Fock canonical orbitals and CASSCF optimized orbitals. The tested systems include N$_2$,
transition metal Cr$_2$ and one-dimensional hydrogen polyradical chain systems under both equilibrium
and dissociation situations. The results of DMRG-complete active space configuration interaction
(DMRG-CASCI) calculations with these orbitals are carefully compared with those by DMRG-CASSCF
calculations. It is shown that DMRG-CASCI calculation in a basis of carefully chosen NOs can provide
a less expensive alternative to standard DMRG-CASSCF calculation and this can also avoid the convergence
difficulties of orbital optimization for large active space.
