Characterizing criticality in quantum many-body systems of dimension $\ge 2$ is one of the most
important challenges of the contemporary physics. In principle, there is no generally valid theoretical
method that could solve this problem. In this work, we propose an efficient approach to identify
the criticality of quantum systems in higher dimensions. Departing from the analysis of the numerical
renormalization group flows, we build a general equivalence between the higher-dimensional ground
state and a one-dimensional (1D) quantum state defined in the imaginary time direction in terms
of the so-called time matrix product state (tMPS). We show that the criticality of the targeted model
can be faithfully identified by the tMPS, using the mature scaling schemes of correlation length
and entanglement entropy in 1D quantum theories. We benchmark our proposal with the results obtained
for the Heisenberg anti-ferromagnet on honeycomb lattice. We demonstrate critical scaling relation
of the tMPS for the gapless case, and a trivial scaling for the gapped case with spatial anisotropy.
The critical scaling behaviors are insensitive to the system size, suggesting the criticality
can be identified in small systems. Our tMPS scheme for critical scaling shows clearly that the spin-1/2
kagom\'e Heisenberg antiferromagnet has a gapless ground state. More generally, the present study
indicates that the 1D conformal field theories in imaginary time provide a very useful tool to characterize
the criticality of higher dimensional quantum systems.
