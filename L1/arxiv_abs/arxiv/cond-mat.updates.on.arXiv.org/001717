We report on a study of the structural, magnetic and superconducting properties of Nb(25nm)/Gd($d_f$)/Nb(25nm)
hybrid structures of a superconductor/ ferromagnet (S/F) type. The structural characterization
of the samples, including careful determination of the layer thickness, was performed using neutron
and X-ray scattering with the aid of depth sensitive mass-spectrometry. The magnetization of the
samples was determined by SQUID magnetometry and polarized neutron reflectometry and the presence
of magnetic ordering for all samples down to the thinnest Gd(0.8nm) layer was shown. The analysis
of the neutron spin asymmetry allowed us to prove the absence of magnetically dead layers in junctions
with Gd interlayer thickness larger than one monolayer. The measured dependence of the superconducting
transition temperature $T_c(d_f)$ has a damped oscillatory behavior with well defined positions
of the minimum at $d_f$=3nm and the following maximum at $d_f$=4nm. Similar behavior, albeit with
a 1.5nm off-set in $d_f$, was already observed by Jiang et al. (PRB 54, 6119) in analogous Nb/Gd/Nb
trilayers. The analysis of the $T_c(d_f)$ dependence based on Usadel equations allowed us to describe
our experimental data. Our structures are characterized by highly transparent S/F interfaces
and the superconducting correlation length $\xi_f \approx 4$nm in Gd. This penetration length
is several times higher than for strong ferromagnets like Fe, Co or Ni. This simplifies preparation
of S/F structures with $d_f \sim \xi_f$ which are of topical interest in superconducting spintronics.
