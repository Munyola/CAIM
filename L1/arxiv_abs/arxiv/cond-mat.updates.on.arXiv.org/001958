We theoretically study an ultra-cold gas of spin-1 polar bosons in one spatial dimension which are
subject to a quadratic Zeeman field and a Raman induced spin-orbit coupling. Concentrating on the
regime in which the background fields can be treated perturbatively we analytically solve the model
in its low-energy sector, i.e. we characterize the relevant phases and the quantum phase transitions
between them. Depending on the sign of the effective quadratic Zeeman field {\epsilon}, two superfluid
phases with distinct nematic order appear. In addition, we uncover a spin-disordered superfluid
phase at strong coupling. We employ a combination of renormalization group calculations and duality
transformations to access the nature of the phase transitions. At ${\epsilon} =0$, a line of spin-charge
separated pairs of Luttinger liquids divides the two nematic phases and the transition to the spin
disordered state at strong coupling is of the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless type. In contrast,
at ${\epsilon} \neq 0$, the quantum critical theory separating nematic and strong coupling spin
disordered phases contains a Luttinger liquid in the charge sector that is coupled to a Majorana
fermion in the spin sector (i.e. the critical theory at finite {\epsilon} maps to a quantum critical
Ising model that is coupled to the charge Luttinger liquid). Due to an emergent Lorentz symmetry,
both have the same, logarithmically diverging velocity. We discuss the experimental signatures
of our findings that are relevant to ongoing experiments in ultra-cold atomic gases of $^{23}$Na.
