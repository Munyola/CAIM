We develop stability analysis for matter-wave solitons in a two-dimensional (2D) Bose-Einstein
condensate loaded in an optical lattice (OL), to which periodic time modulation is applied, in different
forms. The stability is studied by dint of the variational approximation and systematic simulations.
For solitons in the semi-infinite gap, well-defined stability patterns are produced under the
action of the attractive nonlinearity, clearly exhibiting the presence of resonance frequencies.
The analysis is reported for several time-modulation formats, including the case of in-phase modulations
of both quasi-1D sublattices, which build the 2D square-shaped OL, and setups with asynchronous
modulation of the sublattices. In particular, when the modulations of two sublattices are phase-shifted
by {\delta}={\pi}/2, the stability map is not improved, as the originally well-structured stability
pattern becomes fuzzy and the stability at high modulation frequencies is considerably reduced.
Mixed results are obtained for anti-phase modulations of the sublattices ({\delta}={\pi}), where
extended stability regions are found for low modulation frequencies, but for high frequencies
the stability is weakened. The analysis is also performed in the case of the repulsive nonlinearity,
for solitons in the first finite bandgap. It is concluded that, even though stability regions may
be found, distinct stability boundaries for the gap solitons cannot be identified clearly. Finally,
the stability is also explored for vortex solitons of both the "square-shaped" and "rhombic" types
(i.e., off- and on-site-centered ones).
