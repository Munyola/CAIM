We demonstrate a fabrication scheme for clean suspended structures using chemical-vapor-deposition-grown
graphene and a dry transfer method on lift-off-resist-coated substrates to facilitate suspended
graphene nanoelectronic devices for technology applications. It encompasses the demands for
scalable fabrication as well as for ultra-fast response due to weak coupling to environment. The
fabricated devices exhibited initially a weak field-effect response with substantial positive
($p$) doping which transformed into weak negative ($n$) doping upon current annealing at the temperature
of 4 Kelvin. With increased annealing current, $n$-doping gradually decreased while the Dirac
peak position approached zero in gate voltage. An ultra-low residual charge density of $9\times10^8
\mathrm{ \ cm^{-2}}$ and a mobility of $1.9 \times 10^5 \mathrm{\ cm^2/Vs}$ were observed. Our samples
display clear Fabry-P\'{e}rot (FP) conductance oscillation which indicates ballistic electron
transport. The spacing of the FP oscillations are found to depend on the charge density in a manner
that agrees with theoretical modeling based on Klein tunneling of Dirac particles. The ultra-low
residual charge, the FP oscillations with density dependent period, and the high mobility prove
excellent quality of our suspended graphene devices. Owing to its simplicity, scalability and
robustness, this fabrication scheme enhances possibilities for production of suspended, high-quality,
two-dimensional-material structures for novel electronic applications.
