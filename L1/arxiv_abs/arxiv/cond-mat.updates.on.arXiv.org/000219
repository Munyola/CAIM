The review considers the peculiarities of symmetry breaking and symmetry transformations and
the related physical effects in finite quantum systems. Some types of symmetry in finite systems
can be broken only asymptotically. However, with a sufficiently large number of particles, crossover
transitions become sharp, so that symmetry breaking happens similarly to that in macroscopic systems.
This concerns, in particular, global gauge symmetry breaking, related to Bose-Einstein condensation
and superconductivity, or isotropy breaking, related to the generation of quantum vortices, and
the stratification in multicomponent mixtures. A special type of symmetry transformation, characteristic
only for finite systems, is the change of shape symmetry. These phenomena are illustrated by the
examples of several typical mesoscopic systems, such as trapped atoms, quantum dots, atomic nuclei,
and metallic grains. The specific features of the review are: (i) the emphasis on the peculiarities
of the symmetry breaking in finite mesoscopic systems; (ii) the analysis of common properties of
physically different finite quantum systems; (iii) the manifestations of symmetry breaking in
the spectra of collective excitations in finite quantum systems. The analysis of these features
allows for the better understanding of the intimate relation between the type of symmetry and other
physical properties of quantum systems. This also makes it possible to predict new effects by employing
the analogies between finite quantum systems of different physical nature.
