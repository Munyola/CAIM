In a recent study, the finite-time ($t$) and -population size ($N_c$) scalings in the evaluation
of a large deviation function (LDF) estimator were analyzed by means of the cloning algorithm. These
scalings provide valuable information about the convergence of the LDF estimator in the infinite-$t$
and infinite-$N_c$ limits. For the cases analyzed in that study, the scalings of the systematic
errors of the estimator were found to behave as $t^{-1}$ and $N_c^{-1}$ in the large-$t$ and large-$N_c$
asymptotics. Moreover, it was shown how this convergence speed can be used in order to extract an
asymptotic limit which resulted to render a better LDF estimation in comparison to the standard
estimator. However, the validity of these scaling laws and thus, the convergence of the estimator
was proved only in systems for which the number of sites $L$ (where the dynamics occurs) was small.
In this paper, the analysis is extended to a wider range of system sizes $L$. We show how the introduction
of the exponents $\gamma_{t}$ and $\gamma_{N_c}$ allows to characterize the behavior of the LDF
estimator for any system size. From these generalized $t^{-\gamma_{t}}$- and $N_{c}^{-\gamma_{N_c}}$-
scalings, we verify that in the large-$L$ limit the $t^{-1}$- and $N_c^{-1}$-scalings are no longer
valid. Moreover, as the convergence of the estimator relies on the positivity of these exponents,
we show how for some cases $\gamma_{N_c}$ can be negative implying that the estimation provided
by the cloning algorithm is no longer reliable.
