We present an investigation of the electron spin dynamics in an ensemble of singly-charged quantum
dots subject to an external magnetic field and laser pumping with circularly polarized light. The
spectral laser width is tailored such that different groups of quantum dots are coherently pumped.
Surprisingly, the dephasing time $T^*$ of the electron spin polarization depends only weakly on
the laser spectral width. These findings can be consistently explained by a cluster theory of coupled
quantum dots with a long range electronic spin-spin interaction. We present a numerical simulation
of the spin dynamics based on the central spin model that includes a quantum mechanical description
of the laser pulses as well as a time-independent Heisenberg interaction between each pair of electron
spins. We discuss the individual dephasing contributions stemming from the Overhauser field,
the distribution of the electron $g$-factors and the electronic spin-spin interaction as well
as the spectral width of the laser pulse. This analysis reveals the counterbalancing effect of the
total dephasing time when increasing the spectral laser width. On one hand, the deviations of the
electron $g$-factors increase. On the other hand, an increasing number of coherently pumped electron
spins synchronize due to the spin-spin interaction. We find an excellent agreement between the
experimental data and the dephasing time in the simulation using an exponential distribution of
Heisenberg couplings with a mean value $\overline{J}\approx 0.26\,\mathrm{\mu eV}$.
