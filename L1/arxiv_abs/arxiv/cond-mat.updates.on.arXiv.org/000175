Using the collective variables method we revisit the estimates of the Ginzburg temperature for
the Coulomb-dominated models of ionic fluids. We consider the charge-asymmetric primitive model
supplemented by short-range attractive interactions in the vicinity of the gas-liquid critical
point. For this model, we derive the effective Ising-like $\phi^{4}$-model Hamiltonian expressed
in terms of the collective variables describing the fluctuation modes of the total number density.
We obtain the explicit expressions for all the Hamiltonian coefficients within the framework of
the same approximation, namely, the one-loop approximation which produces the mean-field critical
parameters. Based on this Hamiltonian, we consistently calculate the reduced Ginzburg temperature
$t_{G}$ for both the pure Coulombic model (a restricted primitive model) and the pure solvophobic
model (a hard-sphere square-well model) as well as for the model parameters ranging between these
two limiting cases. Contrary to the previous theoretical estimates, we obtain the reduced Ginzburg
temperature for the pure Coulombic model to be about 20 times smaller than for the pure solvophobic
model. For the full model including the short-range attractive and long-range Coulomb interactions,
we show that $t_{G}$ approaches the value found for the pure Coulombic model when the strength of
the Coulomb interactions becomes large enough. Our results suggest a key role of the Coulomb interactions
in the crossover behaviour observed experimentally in ionic fluids as well as confirm the Ising-like
criticality in the Coulomb-dominated ionic systems.
