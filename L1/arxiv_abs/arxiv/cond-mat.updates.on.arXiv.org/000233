Numerical studies of the reduced density matrix of a gapped spin-1/2 Heisenberg antiferromagnet
on a two-leg ladder find that it has the same form as the Gibbs density matrix of a gapless spin-1/2
Heisenberg antiferromagnetic chain at a finite temperature determined by the spin gap of the ladder.\cite{Poilblanc2010}
We investigate this interesting result by considering a model of free fermions on a two-leg ladder
(gapped by the inter-chain tunneling operator) and in spin systems on a ladder with a gapped ground
state using exact solutions and several controlled approximations. We calculate the reduced density
matrix and the entanglement entropy for a leg of the ladder (i.e. cut made between the chains). In
the fermionic system we find the exact form of the reduced density matrix for one of the chains and
determine the entanglement spectrum explicitly. In the case of the spin system, we consider the
strong coupling limit by using perturbation theory and get the reduced density matrix by the Schmidt
decomposition. The entanglement entropies of a general gapped system of two coupled conformal
field theories (in 1+1 dimensions) is discussed using the replica trick and scaling arguments.
We show that 1) for a system with a bulk gap the reduced density matrix has the form of a thermal density
matrix, 2) the long-wavelength modes of one subsystem (a chain) are always thermal, 3) the von Neumann
entropy equals to the thermodynamic entropy of one chain, and 4) the bulk gap plays the role of effective
temperature.
