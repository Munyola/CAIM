We study the rise and decay times in BP-MoS2 heterojunctions through gate- and wavelength-dependent
scanning photocurrent measurements. Our results have shown that the Schottky barrier at the MoS2-metal
interface plays an important role in the photoresponse dynamics of the heterojunction. When the
MoS2 channel is in the on-state, photo-excited carriers can tunnel through the narrow depletion
region at the MoS2-metal interface, leading to a short carrier transit time. A response time constant
of 13 {\mu}s has been achieved in both the rising and decaying regions regardless of the incident
laser wavelength, which is comparable or higher than those of other BP-MoS2 heterojunctions as
well as BP and MoS2 based phototransistors. On the other hand, when the MoS2 channel is in the off-state
the resulting sizeable Schottky barrier and depletion width make it difficult for photo-excited
carriers to overcome the barrier. This significantly delays the carrier transit time and thus the
photoresponse speed, leading to a wavelength-dependent response time since the photo-excited
carriers induced by short wavelength photons have a higher probability to overcome the Schottky
barrier at the MoS2-metal interface than long wavelength photons. These studies not only shed light
on the fundamental understanding of photoresponse dynamics in BP-MoS2 heterojunctions, but also
open new avenues for engineering the interfaces between two-dimensional (2D) materials and metal
contacts to reduce the response time of 2D materials based optoelectronic devices.
