We study a liquid film that is deposited onto a flat plate that is inclined at a constant angle to the
horizontal and is extracted from a liquid bath at a constant speed. We additionally assume that there
is a constant temperature gradient along the plate that induces a Marangoni shear stress. We analyse
steady-state solutions of a long-wave evolution equation for the film thickness. Using centre
manifold theory, we first obtain an asymptotic expansion of solutions in the bath region. The presence
of the temperature gradient significantly changes these expansions and leads to the presence of
logarithmic terms that are absent otherwise. Next, we obtain numerical solutions of the steady-state
equation and analyse the behaviour of the solutions as the plate velocity is changed. We observe
that the bifurcation curve exhibits snaking behaviour when the plate inclination angle is beyond
a certain critical value. Otherwise, the bifurcation curve is monotonic. The solutions along these
curves are characterised by a foot-like structure that is formed close to the meniscus and is preceded
by a thin precursor film further up the plate. The length of the foot increases along the bifurcation
curve. Finally, we explain that the snaking behaviour of the bifurcation curves is caused by the
existence of an infinite number of heteroclinic orbits close to a heteroclinic chain that connects
in an appropriate three-dimensional phase space the fixed point corresponding to the precursor
film with the fixed point corresponding to the foot and then with the fixed point corresponding to
the bath.
