Relations of simulated annealing and quantum annealing are studied by a mapping from the transition
matrix of classical Markovian dynamics of the Ising model to a quantum Hamiltonian and vice versa.
It is shown that these two operators, the transition matrix and the Hamiltonian, share the eigenvalue
spectrum. Thus, if simulated annealing with slow temperature change does not encounter a difficulty
caused by an exponentially long relaxation time at a first-order phase transition, the same is true
for the corresponding process of quantum annealing in the adiabatic limit. One of the important
differences between the classical-to-quantum mapping and the converse quantum-to-classical
mapping is that the Markovian dynamics of a short-range Ising model is mapped to a short-range quantum
system, but the converse mapping from a short-range quantum system to a classical one results in
long-range interactions. This leads to a difference in efficiencies that simulated annealing
can be efficiently simulated by quantum annealing but the converse is not necessarily true. We conclude
that quantum annealing is easier to implement and is more flexible than simulated annealing. We
also point out that the present mapping can be extended to accommodate explicit time dependence
of temperature, which is used to justify the quantum-mechanical analysis of simulated annealing
by Somma, Batista, and Ortiz. Additionally, an alternative method to solve the non-equilibrium
dynamics of the one-dimensional Ising model is provided through the classical-to-quantum mapping.
