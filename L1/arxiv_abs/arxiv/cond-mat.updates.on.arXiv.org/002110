We present an analysis of the transient electronic and transport properties of a nanojunction in
the presence of electron-electron and electron-phonon interactions. We introduce a novel numerical
approach which allows for an efficient evaluation of the non-equilibrium Green functions in the
time domain. Within this approach we implement different self-consistent diagrammatic approximations
in order to analyze the system evolution after a sudden connection to the leads and its convergence
to the steady state. In the electron-electron interaction case we show how the inclusion of correlation
effects beyond a mean-field approximation relaxes the appearance of magnetic steady state solutions.
In the zero-bias case we analyze the Kondo resonance formation time, finding good agreement with
NRG results for the steady state spectral density. In the voltage biased case the obtained transient
and steady state currents exhibit good agreement with available Quantum Monte Carlo results. In
the electron-phonon case we find that a proper description of the phonon dynamics is essential to
get accurate results. We implement self-consistent diagrammatic approaches for this case, showing
that correlation effects tend to remove the possible appearance of bistability. As in the electron-electron
interaction case the long time spectral density and the transient currents exhibit good agreement
with numerically exact calculations for moderate electron-phonon coupling strenghts. Finally
we analyze the situation where both interactions are present comparing the results with available
NRG calculations.
