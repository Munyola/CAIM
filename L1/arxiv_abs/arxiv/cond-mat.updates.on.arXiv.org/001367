Motivated by recent experimental suggestions of charge-order-driven ferroelectricity in organic
charge-transfer salts, such as $\kappa$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$Cu[N(CN)$_2$]Cl, we investigate magnetic
and charge-ordered phases that emerge in an extended two-orbital Hubbard model on the anisotropic
triangular lattice at $3/4$ filling. This model takes into account the presence of two organic BEDT-TTF
molecules, which form a dimer on each site of the lattice, and includes short-range intramolecular
and intermolecular interactions and hoppings. By using variational wave functions and quantum
Monte Carlo techniques, we find two polar states with charge disproportionation inside the dimer,
hinting to ferroelectricity. These charge-ordered insulating phases are stabilized in the strongly
correlated limit and their actual charge pattern is determined by the relative strength of intradimer
to interdimer couplings. Our results suggest that ferroelectricity is not driven by magnetism,
since these polar phases can be stabilized also without antiferromagnetic order and provide a possible
microscopic explanation of the experimental observations. In addition, a conventional dimer-Mott
state (with uniform density and antiferromagnetic order) and a nonpolar charge-ordered state
(with charge-rich and charge-poor dimers forming a checkerboard pattern) can be stabilized in
the strong-coupling regime. Finally, when electron-electron interactions are weak, metallic
states appear, with either uniform charge distribution or a peculiar $12$-site periodicity that
generates honeycomb-like charge order.
