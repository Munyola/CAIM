From intracellular protein trafficking to large scale motion of animal groups, the physical concepts
driving the organization of living systems are still largely unraveled. Self-organization of
active entities, leading to novel phases and emergent macroscopic properties, have shed new lights
on these complex dynamical processes and also inspired the design of new materials and devices.
Like the many artificial active systems recently proposed to tackle this question, assemblies
of motile bacteria turned out to be a rich and insightful experimental playground. Magnetotactic
bacteria (MTB) are micro-organisms living in aquatic environments which synthesize magnetite
nano-particles and internally assemble a micro-magnet. MTB orient their swimming direction along
the magnetic field lines. Here we show that under the application of a constant magnetic field, MTB
confined in water-in-oil emulsions self-assemble into a rotary motor, inducing a net flow circulation
outside the droplets. This self-assembly shows the emergence of a vortex flow at the center of the
droplets, whose axis of rotation is perpendicular to the magnetic field direction and can be reversed
by reversing the magnetic field. Studying this collective organization at different concentrations,
magnetic fields and droplet radii, we show the formation of two torque-generating areas close to
the droplet poles, both activating the solid rotation of the central core. We propose and test a scaling
relation characterizing the energy of this new biological self-assembled motor.
