It has been shown that oxide ceramics containing multiple transition and/or rare-earth elements
in equimolar ratios have a strong tendency to crystallize in simple single phase structures, stabilized
by the high configurational entropy. In analogy to the metallic alloy systems, these oxides are
denoted high entropy oxides (HEOs). The HEO concept allows to access hitherto uncharted areas in
the multi-element phase diagram. Among the already realized structures there is the highly complex
class of rare earth - transition element perovskites. This fascinating class of materials generated
by applying the innovative concept of high entropy stabilization provides a new and manyfold research
space with promise of discoveries of unprecedented properties and phenomena. The present study
provides a first investigation of the magnetic properties of selected compounds of this novel class
of materials. Comprehensive studies by DC and AC magnetometry are combined with element specific
spectroscopy in order to understand the interplay between magnetic exchange and the high degree
of chemical disorder in the systems. We observe a predominant antiferromagnetic behavior in the
single phase materials, combined with a small ferromagnetic contribution possibly stemming from
small ferromagnetic clusters or configurations in the antiferromagnetic matrix. In the long term
perspective it is proposed to screen the properties of this family of compounds with high throughput
methods, including combined experimental and theoretical approaches.
