While there is still no consensus on the superconducting mechanism in iron-based superconductors,
we present an ab initio approach that allows us to calculate explicitly the superconducting transition
temperatures (Tc) of LaFeAsO1-xFx and related compounds that perfectly match the experiments.
Our theory states that when the electrons interact with phonons, the antiferromagnetism between
the Fe atoms and the out-of-plane abnormal vibration in the FeAs layers amplify the electron-phonon
coupling, so that certain percentage of high-energy core-electrons become involved in the pairing.
This is considered to be a dynamic process in which core electrons scatter into the superconducting
gap region and condense, while quasiparticles leaving the condensate fall down to fill in the voids.
Furthermore, it is essential to consider ferrimagnetism between Fe and As atoms, which causes an
unbalanced distribution of the spin density of states. Therefore, the spin-polarized electrons
on the Fermi surface interact with the Fe atoms via dipole-dipole attraction. Another effect, the
exchange Hamiltonian, mediates a stronger interaction between the electrons as an additional
glue. With this approach, we can not only calculate a theoretical Tc of LaFeAsO0.9F0.1 as a function
of pressure corresponding to the experimental values, but also determine its correct doping dependence
in LaFeAsO1-xFx. For optimally doped SmFeAsO1-xFx, Cooper pairs are formed at 50.9 K, with a tetrahedral
angle of 108.8 degrees. The optimized Tc = 50.6 K of NdFeAsO0.85F0.15 is observed when the Fe-As-Fe
angle is set to ~110 degrees.
