Materials exhibiting a substitutional disorder such as multicomponent alloys and mixed metal
oxides/oxyfluorides are of great importance in many scientific and technological sectors. Disordered
materials constitute an overwhelmingly large configurational space, which makes it practically
impossible to be explored manually using first-principles calculations such as density functional
theory (DFT) due to the high computational costs. Consequently, the use of methods such as cluster
expansion (CE) is vital in enhancing our understanding of the disordered materials. CE dramatically
reduces the computational cost by mapping the first-principles calculation results on to a much
faster Hamiltonian. In this work, we present our implementation of the CE method, which is integrated
as a part of the Atomic Simulation Environment (ASE) open-source package. The versatile and user-friendly
code automates the complex set up and construction procedure of CE while giving the users the flexibility
to tweak the settings and to import their own structures and previous calculation results. Recent
advancements such as regularization techniques from machine learning are implemented in the developed
code. The code allows the users to construct CE on any bulk lattice structure, which makes it useful
for a wide range of applications involving complex materials. We demonstrate the capabilities
of our implementation by analyzing the two example materials with varying complexities: a binary
metal alloy and a disordered lithium chromium oxyfluoride.
