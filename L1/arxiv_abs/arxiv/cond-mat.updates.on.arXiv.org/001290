Dirac points in two-dimensional (2D) materials have been a fascinating subject of research, with
graphene as the most prominent example. However, the Dirac points in existing 2D materials, including
graphene, are vulnerable against spin-orbit coupling (SOC). Here, based on first-principles
calculations and theoretical analysis, we propose a new family of stable 2D materials, the HfGeTe-family
monolayers, which represent the first example to host so-called spin-orbit Dirac points (SDPs)
close to the Fermi level. These Dirac points are special in that they are formed only under significant
SOC, hence they are intrinsically robust against SOC. We show that the existence of a pair of SDPs
are dictated by the nonsymmorphic space group symmetry of the system, which are very robust under
various types of lattice strains. The energy, the dispersion, and the valley occupation around
the Dirac points can be effectively tuned by strain. We construct a low-energy effective model to
characterize the Dirac fermions around the SDPs. Furthermore, we find that the material is simultaneously
a 2D $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological metal, which possesses nontrivial $\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant
in the bulk and spin-helical edge states on the boundary. From the calculated exfoliation energies
and mechanical properties, we show that these materials can be readily obtained in experiment from
the existing bulk materials. Our result reveals HfGeTe-family monolayers as a promising platform
for exploring spin-orbit Dirac fermions and novel topological phases in two-dimensions.
