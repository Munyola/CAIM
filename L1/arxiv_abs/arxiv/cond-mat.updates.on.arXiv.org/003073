Hierarchical material nanostructuring is considered to be a very promising direction for high
performance thermoelectric materials. In this work we investigate thermal transport in hierarchically
nanostructured silicon. We consider the combined presence of nanocrystallinity and nanopores,
arranged under both ordered and randomized positions and sizes, by solving the Boltzmann transport
equation using the Monte Carlo method. We show that nanocrystalline boundaries degrade the thermal
conductivity more drastically when the average grain size becomes smaller than the average phonon
mean free path. The introduction of pores degrades the thermal conductivity even further. Its effect,
however, is significantly more severe when the pore sizes and positions are randomized, as randomization
results in regions of higher porosity along the phonon transport direction, which introduce significant
thermal resistance. We show that randomization acts as a large increase in the overall effective
porosity. Using our simulations, we show that existing compact nanocrystalline and nanoporous
theoretical models describe thermal conductivity accurately under uniform nanostructured conditions,
but overestimate it in randomized geometries. We propose extensions to these models that accurately
predict the thermal conductivity of randomized nanoporous materials based solely on a few geometrical
features. Finally, we show that the new compact models introduced can be used within Matthiessens
rule to combine scattering from different geometrical features within approximately 10 per cent
accuracy.
