Though the martensitic transformation in zirconia has been the object of a very large number of studies
for the last decades, qualitative and quantitative observations of the formation and growth of
relief induced by low temperature treatments has hardly ever been reported. In the first part of
the study, we have demonstrated the excellent agreement between the atomic force microscopy quantitative
observations and the outputs of the calculations derived from the phenomenological theory of martensitic
transformation. The intermediate stages of transformation were nonetheless not considered.
In this second part, the growth mechanisms of monoclinic phase resulting from the martensitic transformation
in ceria-stabilized zirconia (10 mol% CeO2) are investigated. Surface transformation is induced
by ageing treatments in water vapor at 413 K. The observations are rationalized by the recent analysis
proposed for the crystallographic ABC1 correspondence choice, where the ct axis transforms to
the cm axis. Three growth modes are observed and interpreted in terms of transformation strains
accommodation. Microcracks formation is observed, explaining grain pop-out where the crystallographic
disorientation between two adjacent grains is the largest. The influence of grain boundary paths
on the surface relief features is demonstrated. Overall, our results strongly support the non-existence
of a critical grain size for low temperature transformation, confirmed by the classical thermodynamics
theory applied to this particular case.
