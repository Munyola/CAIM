Photovoltaics is a fundamental phenomenon in solids from the viewpoints of both basic science and
applications such as solar cells. The most important characteristics of the photovoltaics is the
current-voltage relation, i.e., $I-V$ characteristic, which determines the energy conversion
rate. Usually, generation of photocurrent requires dc electric field to separate the photo-generated
electrons and holes in addition to the excitations by light. In sharp contrast, it has been shown
that the photocurrent is generated {\it without} the external dc electric field in noncentrosymmetric
crystals, which is called shift current. This shift current originates from the shift of the intra-cell
coordinates of the electrons associated with the interband transitions, and is a purely quantum
mechanical phenomenon. Therefore, its nature is expected to be quite different from the conventional
photocurrent supported by the diffusive motion of electrons and holes. Here we theoretically show
that the $I-V$ characteristic and shot noise are controlled by the difference of group velocities
between conduction and valence bands, i.e., $v_{11}-v_{22}$, and the relaxation time $\tau$.
Since the shift current itself is independent of these quantities, there are wide possibilities
to design it to maximize the energy conversion rate and also to suppress the noise. We propose the
Landau levels in noncentrosymmetric two-dimensional systems are the promising candidate for
energy conversion. Such photovoltaic functioning with low noise level would also allow an application
to photon detectors.
