Understanding thermal transport from nanoscale heat sources is important for a fundamental description
of energy flow in materials, as well as for many technological applications including thermal management
in nanoelectronics, thermoelectric devices, nano-enhanced photovoltaics and nanoparticle-mediated
thermal therapies. Thermal transport at the nanoscale is fundamentally different from that at
the macroscale and is determined by the distribution of carrier mean free paths in a material, the
length scales of the heat sources, and the distance over which heat is transported. Past work has
shown that Fourier's law for heat conduction dramatically over-predicts the rate of heat dissipation
from heat sources with dimensions smaller than the mean free path of the dominant heat-carrying
phonons. In this work, we uncover a new regime of nanoscale thermal transport that dominates when
the separation between nanoscale heat sources is small compared with the dominant phonon mean free
paths. Surprisingly, the interplay between neighboring heat sources can facilitate efficient,
diffusive-like heat dissipation, even from the smallest nanoscale heat sources. This finding
suggests that thermal management in nanoscale systems including integrated circuits might not
be as challenging as projected. Finally, we demonstrate a unique and new capability to extract mean
free path distributions of phonons in materials, allowing the first experimental validation of
differential conductivity predictions from first-principles calculations.
