The relation between collective properties and performance of antiagglomerants (AAs) used in
hydrate management is handled using molecular dynamics simulations and enhanced sampling techniques.
A thin film of AAs adsorbed at the interface between one flat sII methane hydrate substrate and a fluid
hydrocarbon mixture containing methane and n-dodecane is studied. The AA considered is a surface-active
compound with a complex hydrophilic head that contains both amide and tertiary ammonium cation
groups and hydrophobic tails. At sufficiently high AA density, the interplay between the surfactant
layer and the liquid hydrocarbon excludes methane from the interfacial region. In this scenario,
we combine metadynamics and umbrella sampling frameworks to study accurately the free-energy
landscape and the equilibrium rates associated with the transport of one methane molecule across
the AA film. We observe that local configurational changes of the liquid hydrocarbon packed within
the AA film are associated with high free-energy barriers for methane transport. The time scales
estimated for the transport of methane across the AA film can be, in some cases, comparable to those
reported in the literature for the growth of the hydrates, suggesting that one possible mechanism
by which AAs delay the formation of hydrate plugs could be providing a barrier to methane transport.
Considering the interplay between structural design and collective properties of AAs might be
of relevance to improve their performance in flow assurance.
