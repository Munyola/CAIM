We consider the gapless modes along the vortex line of the fully gapped, momentum independent paired
states of three dimensional Dirac fermions. For this we require the solution of fermion zero modes
of the corresponding two dimensional problem in the presence of a point vortex, in the plane perpendicular
to the vortex line. Based on the spectral symmetry requirement for the existence of the zero mode,
we identify the generalized Jackiw-Rossi Hamiltonians for different paired states. A four dimensional
generalized Jackiw-Rossi Hamiltonian possesses spectral symmetry with respect to an anti-unitary
operator, and gives rise to a single zero mode only for the odd vorticity, which is described by a $Z_2$
index. In the presence of generic perturbations such as chemical potential, Dirac mass and Zeeman
coupling, the two dimensional problem for the odd parity topological superconducting state maps
onto two copies of generalized Jackiw-Rossi Hamiltonian, and consequently an odd vortex binds
two Majorana fermions. In contrast there are no zero energy states for the topologically trivial
s-wave superconductor, in the presence of any chiral symmetry breaking perturbation in the particle-hole
channel, such as Dirac mass. We show that the number of one dimensional dispersive modes along the
vortex line is also determined by the index of the associated two dimensional problem. For an axial
superfluid state in the presence of various perturbations, we discuss the consequences of the $Z_2$
index on the anomaly equations.
