The spin-1/2 triangular lattice antiferromagnet YbMgGaO$_{4}$ has attracted recent attention
as a quantum spin-liquid candidate with the possible presence of off-diagonal anisotropic exchange
interactions induced by spin-orbit coupling. Whether a quantum spin-liquid is stabilized or not
depends on the interplay of various exchange interactions with chemical disorder that is inherent
to the layered structure of the compound. We combine time-domain terahertz spectroscopy and inelastic
neutron scattering measurements in the field polarized state of YbMgGaO$_{4}$ to obtain better
microscopic insights on its exchange interactions. Terahertz spectroscopy in this fashion functions
as high-field electron spin resonance and probes the spin-wave excitations at the Brillouin zone
center, ideally complementing neutron scattering. A global spin-wave fit to all our spectroscopic
data at fields over 4T, informed by the analysis of the terahertz spectroscopy linewidths, yields
stringent constraints on $g$-factors and exchange interactions. Our results paint YbMgGaO$_{4}$
as an easy-plane XXZ antiferromagnet with the combined and necessary presence of sub-leading next-nearest
neighbor and weak anisotropic off-diagonal nearest-neighbor interactions. Moreover, the obtained
$g$-factors are substantially different from previous reports. This works establishes the hierarchy
of exchange interactions in YbMgGaO$_{4}$ from high-field data alone and thus strongly constrains
possible mechanisms responsible for the observed spin-liquid phenomenology.
