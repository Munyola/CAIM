The era of near-room-temperature superconductivity started after experimental discovery by
Drozdov et al (2015 Nature 525 73) who found that compressed H3S exhibits superconducting transition
at Tc = 203 K. To date, the record near-room-temperature superconductivity stands with another
hydrogen-rich highly compressed compound, LaH10 (Somayazulu et al 2019 Phys. Rev. Lett. 122 027001),
which has critical temperature of Tc>240 K. In this paper, we analyse available upper critical field,
Bc2(T), data for LaH10 (Drozdov et al 2019 Nature 569 528) and report that this compound in all considered
scenarios has the ratio of Tc to the Fermi temperature, Tf, 0.009 < Tc/Tf < 0.038, which is typical
range for unconventional superconductors. In attempt to extend our finding, we examined experimental
Bc2(T) data for superconductors in the palladium-hydrogen (PdHx) and thorium-hydrogen-deiterium
(ThH-ThD) systems and surprisingly find that superconductors in both these systems also fall into
unconventional superconductors band. Taking in account that H3S has the ratio of 0.012 < Tc/Tf <
0.039 (Talantsev 2019 Mod. Phys. Lett. B 33 1950195) we come to conclusion that in the Uemura plot
all discovered to date hydrogen-rich superconductors, i.e., Th4H15-Th4D15, PdHx, H3S and LaH10
(in this list we do not include NbTiHx, PtHx, SiH4, and PH3 for which experimental data beyond Tc are
unknown), lie in same band as all unconventional superconductors, particularly heavy fermions,
fullerenes, pnictides, and cuprates, and former should be classified as a new class of unconventional
superconductors.
