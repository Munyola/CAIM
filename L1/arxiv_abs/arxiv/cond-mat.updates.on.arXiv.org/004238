We report on a study on a representative set of Fe$_{2}$P-based MnFePSi samples by means of $^{55}$Mn
NMR in both zero and applied magnetic field. The first-order nature of the magnetic transition is
demonstrated by truncated order parameter curves with a large value of the local ordered moment
at the Curie point, even at compositions where the transition appears second order from magnetic
measurements. No weak ferromagnetic order could be detected at Si-poor compositions showing the
kinetic arrest phenomenon, but rather the phase separation of fully ferromagnetic domains from
volume fractions where Mn spins are fluctuating. The more pronounced decrease of the ordered moment
at the $3f$ sites on approaching $T_C$, characteristic of the mixed magnetism of these materials,
is demonstrated to be driven by a vanishing spin density rather than enhanced spin fluctuations
at the $3f$ site. An upper limit of 0.03~$\mu_B$ is set for the fluctuating Mn moment at the $3f$ site
by the direct detection of a $^{55}$Mn NMR resonance peak in the Mn-rich samples above $T_C$, showing
nearly temperature-independent frequency shifts. A sharper secondary peak observed at the same
compositions reveals however the disproportionation of a significant $3f$-Mn fraction with negligible
hyperfine couplings, which retains its diamagnetic character across the transition, down to the
lowest available temperatures. Such a diamagnetic fraction qualitatively accounts for the reduced
average $3f$ moment previously reported at large Mn concentrations.
