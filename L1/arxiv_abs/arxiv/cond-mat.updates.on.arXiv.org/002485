Analytical description of domain structure morphology and phase diagrams of ferroelectric nanoparticles
is developed in the framework of Landau Ginzburg Devonshire approach. To model realistic conditions
of incomplete screening of spontaneous polarization at the particle surface, it was considered
covered by an ultra-thin layer of screening charge with finite screening length. The phase diagrams,
calculated for spherical Sn2P2S6 nanoparticles in coordinates "temperature vs surface screening
length" by finite element modeling, demonstrate the emergence of polydomain region at the tricritical
point and its broadening with increasing the screening length for the particle radius over a critical
value. Metastable and stable labyrinthine domain structures exist in Sn2P2S6 nanoparticles with
radius 8 and 10 nm and more, similarly to the case of CuInP2S6 nanoparticles considered previously.
We derived simple analytical expressions for the boundaries between paraelectric, single-domain
and poly-domain ferroelectric phases, tricritical point and the necessary condition for the appearance
of labyrinthine domains, and demonstrated their high accuracy in comparison with finite element
modeling results. Analytical description shows that phase diagrams and domain morphologies,
which are qualitatively similar to the ones calculated in this work, can be expected in other ferroelectric
nanoparticles covered by the screening charges, being rather different for the ferroelectrics
with the first and second order ferroelectric-paraelectric transitions respectively.
