The locomotion and design of microswimmers are topical issues of current fundamental and applied
research. In addition to numerous living and artificial active microswimmers, a passive microswimmer
was identified only recently: a soft, ${\Lambda}$-shaped, non-buoyant particle propagates in
a shaken liquid of zero-mean velocity [Jo et al. Phys. Rev. E 94, 063116 (2016)]. We show that this
novel passive locomotion mechanism works for realistic non-buoyant, asymmetric Janus microcapsules
as well. According to our analytical approximation, this locomotion requires a symmetry breaking
caused by different Stokes drags of soft particles during the two half periods of the oscillatory
liquid motion. It is the intrinsic anisotropy of Janus capsules and ${\Lambda}$-shaped particles
that break this symmetry for sinusoidal liquid motion. Further, we show that this passive locomotion
mechanism also works for the wider class of symmetric soft particles, e.g., capsules, by breaking
the symmetry via an appropriate liquid shaking. The swimming direction can be uniquely selected
by a suitable choice of the liquid motion. Numerical studies, including lattice Boltzmann simulations,
also show that this locomotion can outweigh gravity, i.e., non-buoyant particles may be either
elevated in shaken liquids or concentrated at the bottom of a container. This novel propulsion mechanism
is relevant to many applications, including the sorting of soft particles like healthy and malignant
(cancer) cells, which serves medical purposes, or the use of non-buoyant soft particles as directed
microswimmers .
