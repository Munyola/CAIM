Electronic systems harboring one dimensional helical modes, where the spin and momentum of the
electron are locked, have lately become an important field of its own. When coupled to a conventional
superconductor, such systems are expected to manifest topological superconductivity, a unique
phase that gives rise to exotic Majorana zero modes. Even more interesting are fractional helical
states which have not been observed before and which open the route for the realization of the generalized
para fermions quasiparticles. Possessing non abelian exchange statistics, these quasiparticles
may serve as building blocks in topological quantum computing. Here, we present a new approach to
form protected one dimensional helical and fractional helical edge modes in the quantum Hall regime.
The novel platform is based on a carefully designed double quantum well structure in a high mobility
GaAs based system. In turn, the quantum well hosts two sub bands of 2D electrons, each tuned to the
quantum Hall effect regime. By electrostatic gating of different areas of the structure, counter
propagating integer, as well as fractional, edge modes, belonging to Landau levels with opposite
spins are formed, rendering the modes helical. We demonstrate that due to spin protection, these
helical modes remain ballistic, without observed mixing for large distances. In addition to the
formation of helical modes, this new platform can be exploited as a rich playground for an artificial
induction of compounded fractional edge modes, as well as construction of interferometers based
on chiral edge modes.
