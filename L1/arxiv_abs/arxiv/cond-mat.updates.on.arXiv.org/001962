Yb$_2$Si$_2$Al may be a prototype for exploring different aspects of the Shastry-Sutherland lattice,
formed by planes of orthogonally coupled Yb ions. Measurements of the magnetic susceptibility
find incoherently fluctuating Yb$^{3+}$ moments coexisting with a weakly correlated metallic
state that is confirmed by measurements of the electrical resistivity. Increasing signs of Kondo
coherence are found with decreasing temperature, including an enhanced Sommerfeld coefficient
and Kadowaki-Woods ratio that signal that the metallic state found at the lowest temperatures is
a Fermi liquid where correlations have become significantly stronger. A pronounced peak in the
electronic and magnetic specific heat indicates that the coupling of the Yb moments to the conduction
electrons leads to an effective Kondo temperature that is approximately 30 K. The valence and ground
state symmetry of Yb$_2$Si$_2$Al have been investigated with electron spectroscopy methods.
Yb$_2$Si$_2$Al is found to be strongly intermediate valent ($v_F$=2.68(2) at 80 K). The crystal-field
split Hund's rule ground state exhibits strong dichroism and possible crystal-field ground state
symmetries are discussed. The temperature dependence of the dichroism puts a lower limit to the
energy of the first excited crystal-field level ($\Delta_{CEF}$$\geq$ 10 meV). Taken together,
these experimental data are consistent with a scenario where a coherent Kondo lattice forms in $\mathrm{Yb_2Si_2Al}$
from an incoherently fluctuating ensemble of Yb moments with incomplete Kondo compensation, and
strong intermediate valence character.
