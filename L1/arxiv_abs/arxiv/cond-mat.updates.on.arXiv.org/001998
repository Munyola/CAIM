Transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) alloys have attracted great interests in recent years due
to their tunable electronic properties, especially the semiconductor-metal phase transition,
along with their potential applications in solid-state memories and thermoelectrics. However,
the thermal conductivity of layered two-dimensional (2D) TMD alloys remains largely unexplored
despite that it plays a critical role in the reliability and functionality of TMD-enabled devices.
In this work, we study the temperature-dependent anisotropic thermal conductivity of the phase-transition
2D TMD alloys WSe2(1-x)Te2x in both the in-plane direction (parallel to the basal planes) and the
cross-plane direction (along the c-axis) using time-domain thermoreflectance measurements.
In the WSe2(1-x)Te2x alloys, the cross-plane thermal conductivity is observed to be dependent
on the heating frequency (modulation frequency of the pump laser) due to the non-equilibrium transport
between different phonon modes. Using a two-channel heat conduction model, we extracted the anisotropic
thermal conductivity at the equilibrium limit. A clear discontinuity in both the cross-plane and
the in-plane thermal conductivity is observed as x increases from 0.4 to 0.6 due to the phase transition
from the 2H to Td phase in the layered 2D alloys. The temperature dependence of thermal conductivity
for the TMD alloys was found to become weaker compared with the pristine 2H WSe2 and Td WTe2 due to the
atomic disorder. This work serves as an important starting point for exploring phonon transport
in layered 2D alloys.
