Pole-skipping is a recently discovered signature of many-body quantum chaos in collective energy
dynamics. It establishes a precise connection between resummed, all-order hydrodynamics and
the underlying microscopic chaos. In this paper, we demonstrate the existence of pole-skipping
in holographic conformal field theories with higher-derivative gravity duals. In particular,
we first consider Einstein-Hilbert gravity deformed by curvature-squared ($R^2$) corrections
and then type IIB supergravity theory with the $\alpha'^3 R^4$ term, where $\alpha'$ is set by the
length of the fundamental string. The former case allows us to discuss the effects of leading-order
$1/N_c$ corrections (with $N_c$ being the number of colours of the dual gauge group) and phenomenological
coupling constant dependence. In Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theory, pole-skipping turns out to be
valid non-perturbatively in the Gauss-Bonnet coupling. The $\alpha'^3 R^4$ deformation enables
us to study perturbative inverse 't Hooft coupling corrections ($\alpha'^3 \sim 1 / \lambda^{3/2}$)
in $SU(N_c)$, $\mathcal{N} = 4$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory with infinite $N_c$. While the
maximal Lyapunov exponent characterising quantum chaos remains uncorrected, the butterfly velocity
is shown to depend both on $N_c$ and the coupling. Several implications of the relation between hydrodynamics
and chaos are discussed, including an intriguing similarity between the dependence of the butterfly
velocity and the ratio of shear viscosity to entropy density on stringy corrections.
