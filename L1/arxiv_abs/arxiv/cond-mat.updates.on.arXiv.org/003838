We show that the two dimensional spatial inversion-symmetry (SIS) broken square lattice antiferromagnet
with easy-plane spin anisotropy exhibits a thermal Hall effect and the edge modes characterized
by the Z 2 topological invariant. These topological properties require a nonzero Berry curvature,
and its origin is ascribed to the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interactions or the noncoplanar magnetic
ordering generating a U(1) gauge field that couples to the kinetic motion of magnons. Although this
picture is established in ferromagnets on the kagome and pyrochlore lattices, it does not apply
to our square lattice model since such gauge field cancels out in an edge shared geometry. Instead,
our case has an analogy with the anomalous Hall effect of Rashba electronic system where the spin
orbit coupling generates an SU(2) gauge field. The two species of magnons defined on antiferromagnetic
sublattices can be regarded as the pseudo-spin degrees of freedom of magnons. The DM interactions
that emerge due to the SIS breaking serve as a pseudo-spin orbit coupling of magnons and generate
a Berry curvature, when the direction of the magnetic moments is properly controlled by the magnetic
field. The thermal Hall conductivity of our antiferromagnet shows rapid growth in temperature
T beyond the power-law, reflecting the almost gapless low energy branch of the antiferromagnet,
which distinctively differs from the T^7/2 -dependence in the pyrochlore ferromagnets. The present
system serves as a standard model for the noncentrosymmetric crystals Ba2MnGe2O7 and Ba2CoGe2O7.
