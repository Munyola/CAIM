Extended defects with one dimensionality smaller than that of the host, such as 2D grain boundaries
in 3D materials or 1D grain boundaries in 2D materials, can be particularly damaging since they directly
impede the transport of charge, spin or heat, and can introduce a metallic character into otherwise
semiconducting systems. Unfortunately, a technique to rapidly and non-destructively image 1D
defects in 2D materials is lacking. Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), Raman,
photoluminescence and nonlinear optical spectroscopies, are all extremely valuable, but current
implementations suffer from low throughput and a destructive nature (STEM) or limitations in their
unambiguous sensitivity at the nanoscale. Here we demonstrate that dark-field second harmonic
generation (SHG) microscopy can rapidly, efficiently, and non-destructively probe grain boundaries
and edges in monolayer dichalcogenides (i.e. MoSe2, MoS2 and WS2). Dark-field SHG efficiently
separates the spatial components of the emitted light and exploits interference effects from crystal
domains of different orientations to localize grain boundaries and edges as very bright 1D patterns
through a Cerenkov-type SHG emission. The frequency dependence of this emission in MoSe2 monolayers
is explained in terms of plasmon-enhanced SHG related to the defects metallic character. This new
technique for nanometer-scale imaging of the grain structure, domain orientation and localized
1D plasmons in 2D different semiconductors, thus enables more rapid progress towards both applications
and fundamental materials discoveries.
