ZrSe2 is a band semiconductor studied long time ago. It has interesting electronic properties,
and because its layers structure can be intercalated with different atoms to change some of the physical
properties. In this investigation we found that Zr deficiencies alter the semiconducting behavior
and the compound can be turned into a superconductor. In this paper we report our studies related
to this discovery. The decreasing of the number of Zr atoms in small proportion according to the formula
ZrxSe2, where x is varied from about 8.1 to 8.6 K, changing the semiconducting behavior to a superconductor
with transition temperatures ranging between 7.8 to 8.5 K, it depending of the deficiencies. Outside
of those ranges the compound behaves as semiconducting with the properties already known. In our
experiments we found that this new superconductor has only a very small fraction of superconducting
material determined by magnetic measurements with applied magnetic field of 10 Oe. Our conclusions
is that superconductivity is filamentary. However, in one studied sample the fraction was about
10.2 %, whereas in others is only about 1 % or less. We determined the superconducting characteristics;
the critical fields that indicate a type two superonductor with Ginzburg-Landau ? parameter of
the order about 2.7. The synthesis procedure is quite normal fol- lowing the conventional solid
state reaction. In this paper are included, the electronic characteristics, transition temperature,
and evolution with temperature of the critical fields.
