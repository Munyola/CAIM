Conductive ferroelectric domain walls--ultra-narrow and configurable conduction paths, have
been considered as essential building blocks for future programmable domain wall electronics.
For applications in high density devices, it is imperative to explore the conductive domain walls
in small confined systems while earlier investigations have hitherto focused on thin films or bulk
single crystals, noting that the size-confined effects will certainly modulate seriously the
domain structure and wall transport. Here, we demonstrate an observation and manipulation of conductive
domain walls confined within small BiFeO3 nano-islands aligned in high density arrays. Using conductive
atomic force microscopy (CAFM), we are able to distinctly visualize various types of conductive
domain walls, including the head-to-head charged walls (CDWs), zigzag walls (zigzag-DWs), and
typical 71{\deg} head-to-tail neutral walls (NDWs). The CDWs exhibit remarkably enhanced metallic
conductivity with current of ~ nA order in magnitude and 104 times larger than that inside domains
(0.01 ~ 0.1 pA), while the semiconducting NDWs allow also much smaller current ~ 10 pA than the CDWs.
The substantially difference in conductivity for dissimilar walls enables additional manipulations
of various wall conduction states for individual addressable nano-islands via electrically tuning
of their domain structures. A controllable writing of four distinctive states by applying various
scanning bias voltages is achieved, offering opportunities for developing multilevel high density
memories.
