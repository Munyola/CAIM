The study of elementary bosonic excitations is essential toward a complete description of quantum
electronic solids. In this context, resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) has recently risen
to becoming a versatile probe of electronic excitations in strongly correlated electron systems.
The nature of the radiation-matter interaction endows RIXS with the ability to resolve the charge,
spin and orbital nature of individual excitations. However, this capability has been only marginally
explored to date. Here, we demonstrate a systematic method for the extraction of the character of
excitations as imprinted in the azimuthal dependence of the RIXS signal. Using this novel approach,
we resolve the charge, spin, and orbital nature of elastic scattering, (para-)magnon/bimagnon
modes, and higher energy dd excitations in magnetically-ordered and superconducting copper-oxide
perovskites (Nd2CuO4 and YBa2Cu3O6.75). Our method derives from a direct application of scattering
theory, enabling us to deconstruct the complex scattering tensor as a function of energy loss. In
particular, we use the characteristic tensorial nature of each excitation to precisely and reliably
disentangle the charge and spin contributions to the low energy RIXS spectrum. This procedure enables
to separately track the evolution of spin and charge spectral distributions in cuprates with doping.
Our results demonstrate a new capability that can be integrated into the RIXS toolset, and that promises
to be widely applicable to materials with intertwined spin, orbital, and charge excitations.
