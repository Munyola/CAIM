Polarized light microscopy, as a contrast-enhancing technique for optically anisotropic materials,
is a method well suited for the investigation of a wide variety of effects in solid-state physics,
as for example birefringence in crystals or the magneto-optical Kerr effect (MOKE). We present
a microscopy setup that combines a widefield microscope and a confocal scanning laser microscope
with polarization-sensitive detectors. By using a high numerical aperture objective, a spatial
resolution of about 240 nm at a wavelength of 405 nm is achieved. The sample is mounted on a $^4$He continuous
flow cryostat providing a temperature range between 4 K and 300 K, and electromagnets are used to
apply magnetic fields of up to 800 mT with variable in-plane orientation and 20 mT with out-of-plane
orientation. Typical applications of the polarizing microscope are the imaging of the in-plane
and out-of-plane magnetization via the longitudinal and polar MOKE, imaging of magnetic flux structures
in superconductors covered with a magneto-optical indicator film via Faraday effect or imaging
of structural features, such as twin-walls in tetragonal SrTiO$_3$. The scanning laser microscope
furthermore offers the possibility to gain local information on electric transport properties
of a sample by detecting the beam-induced voltage change across a current-biased sample. This combination
of magnetic, structural and electric imaging capabilities makes the microscope a viable tool for
research in the fields of oxide electronics, spintronics, magnetism and superconductivity.
