We present new results on cavity-photon-assisted electron transport through two lateral quantum
dots embedded in a finite quantum wire. The double quantum dot system is weakly connected to two leads
and strongly coupled to a single quantized photon cavity mode with initially two linearly polarized
photons in the cavity. Including the full electron-photon interaction, the transient current
controlled by a plunger-gate in the central system is studied by using quantum master equation.
Without a photon cavity, two resonant current peaks are observed in the range selected for the plunger
gate voltage: The ground state peak, and the peak corresponding to the first-excited state. The
current in the ground state is higher than in the first-excited state due to their different symmetry.
In a photon cavity with the photon field polarized along or perpendicular to the transport direction,
two extra side peaks are found, namely, photon-replica of the ground state and photon-replica of
the first-excited state. The side-peaks are caused by photon-assisted electron transport, with
multiphoton absorption processes for up to three photons during an electron tunneling process.
The inter-dot tunneling in the ground state can be controlled by the photon cavity in the case of the
photon field polarized along the transport direction. The electron charge is delocalized from
the dots by the photon cavity. Furthermore, the current in the photon-induced side-peaks can be
strongly enhanced by increasing the electron-photon coupling strength for the case of photons
polarized along the transport direction.
