Investigation of elementary excitations has advanced our understanding of many-body physics
governing most physical properties of matter. Recently spin-orbit excitons have drawn much attention,
whose condensates near phase transitions exhibit Higgs mode oscillations, a long-sought physical
phenomenon [Nat. Phys. {\bf 13}, 633 (2017)]. These critical transition points resulting from
competing spin-orbit coupling (SOC), local crystalline symmetry and exchange interactions,
are not obvious in Iridium based materials, where SOC prevails in general. Here, we present results
of resonant inelastic x-ray scattering on a spin-orbital liquid Ba$_3$ZnIr$_2$O$_9$ and three
other 6H-hexagonal perovskite iridates which show magnetism, contrary to non-magnetic singlet
ground state expected due to strong SOC. Our results show that substantial hopping between closely
placed Ir$^{5+}$ ions within Ir$_2$O$_9$ dimers in these 6H-iridates, modifies spin-orbit coupled
states and reduces spin-orbit excitation energies. Here, we are forced to use at least a two-site
model, to match the excitation spectrum going in line with the strong intra-dimer hopping. Apart
from SOC, low energy physics of iridates is thus critically dependent on hopping, and may not be ignored
even for systems having moderate hopping, where the excitation spectra can be explained using an
atomic model. SOC which is generally found to be 0.4-0.5~eV in iridates, is scaled in effect down
to $\sim$0.26~eV for the 6H-systems, sustaining the hope to achieve quantum criticality by tuning
Ir-Ir separation.
