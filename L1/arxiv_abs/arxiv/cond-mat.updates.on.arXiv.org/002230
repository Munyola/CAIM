Constructed to satisfy all known exact constraints and appropriate norms for a semilocal density
functional, the strongly constrained and appropriately normed (SCAN) meta-generalized gradient
approximation functional has shown early promise for accurately describing the electronic structure
of molecules and solids. One open question is how well SCAN predicts the formation energy, a key quantity
for describing the thermodynamic stability of solid-state compounds. To answer this question,
we perform an extensive benchmark of SCAN by computing the formation energies for a diverse group
of nearly one thousand crystalline compounds for which experimental values are known. Due to an
enhanced exchange interaction in the covalent bonding regime, SCAN substantially decreases the
formation energy errors for strongly-bound compounds, by approximately 50% to 110 meV/atom, as
compared to the generalized gradient approximation of Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof (PBE). However,
for intermetallic compounds, SCAN performs moderately worse than PBE with an increase in formation
energy error of approximately 20%, stemming from SCAN's distinct behavior in the weak bonding regime.
The formation energy errors can be further reduced via elemental chemical potential fitting. We
find that SCAN leads to significantly more accurate predicted crystal volumes, moderately enhanced
magnetism, and mildly improved band gaps as compared to PBE. Overall, SCAN represents a significant
improvement in accurately describing the thermodynamics of strongly-bound compounds.
