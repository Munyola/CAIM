Noncollinear spin textures in ferromagnetic ultrathin films are currently the subject of renewed
interest since the discovery of the interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI). This
antisymmetric exchange interaction selects a given chirality for the spin textures and allows
stabilising configurations with nontrivial topology. Moreover, it has many crucial consequences
on the dynamical properties of these topological structures, including chiral domain walls (DWs)
and magnetic skyrmions. In the recent years the study of noncollinear spin textures has been extended
from single ultrathin layers to magnetic multilayers with broken inversion symmetry. This extension
of the structures in the vertical dimension allows very efficient current-induced motion and room-temperature
stability for both N\'eel DWs and skyrmions. Here we show how in such multilayered systems the interlayer
interactions can actually lead to more complex, hybrid chiral magnetisation arrangements. The
described thickness-dependent reorientation of DWs is experimentally confirmed by studying
demagnetised multilayers through circular dichroism in x-ray resonant magnetic scattering.
We also demonstrate a simple yet reliable method for determining the magnitude of the DMI from static
domains measurements even in the presence of these hybrid chiral structures, by taking into account
the actual profile of the DWs. The advent of these novel hybrid chiral textures has far-reaching
implications on how to stabilise and manipulate DWs as well as skymionic structures in magnetic
multilayers.
