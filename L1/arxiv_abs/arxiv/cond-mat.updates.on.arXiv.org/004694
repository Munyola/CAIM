Adsorption at an attractive surface in a system with particles self-assembling into small clusters
is studied by Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. We assume Lennard-Jones plus repulsive Yukawa
tail interactions, and focus on small densities. The relative increase of the temperature at the
critical cluster concentration near the attractive surface (CCCS) shows a power-law dependence
on the strength of the wall-particle attraction. At temperatures below the CCCS, the adsorbed layer
consists of undeformed clusters if the wall-particle attraction is not too strong. Above the CCCS,
or for strong attraction leading to flattening of the adsorbed aggregates, we obtain a monolayer
that for strong or very strong attraction consists of flattened clusters or stripes respectively.
The accumulated repulsion from the particles adsorbed at the wall leads to a repulsive barrier that
slows down the adsorption process, and the accession time grows rapidly with the strength of the
wall-particle attraction. Beyond the adsorbed layer of particles, a depletion region of a thickness
comparable with the range of the repulsive tail of interactions occurs, and the density in this region
decreases with increasing strength of the wall-particle attraction. At larger separations, the
exponentially damped oscillations of density agree with theoretical predictions for self-assembling
systems. Structural and thermal properties of the bulk are also determined. In particular, a new
structural crossover associated with the maximum of the specific heat, and a double-peaked histogram
of the cluster size distribution are observed.
