The entropy of a monomer-dimer system on an infinite bipartite lattice can be written as a mean-field
part plus a series expansion in the dimer density. In a previous paper it has been conjectured that
all coefficients of this series are positive. Analogously on a connected regular graph with $v$
vertices, the "entropy" of the graph ${\rm ln} N(i)/v$, where $N(i)$ is the number of ways of setting
down $i$ dimers on the graph, can be written as a part depending only on the number of the dimer configurations
over the completed graph plus a Newton series in the dimer density on the graph. In this paper, we investigate
for which connected regular graphs all the coefficients of the Newton series are positive (for short,
these graphs will be called positive). In the class of connected regular bipartite graphs, up to
$v=20$, the only non positive graphs have vertices of degree $3$. From $v=14$ to $v=30$, the frequency
of the positivity violations in the $3$-regular graphs decreases with increasing $v$. In the case
of connected $4$-regular bipartite graphs, the first violations occur in two out of the $2806490$
graphs with $v=22$. We conjecture that for each degree $r$ the frequency of the violations, in the
class of the $r-$regular bipartite graphs, goes to zero as $v$ tends to infinity. This graph-positivity
property can be extended to non-regular or non-bipartite graphs. We have examined a large number
of rectangular grids of size $N_x \times N_y $ both with open and periodic boundary conditions. We
have observed positivity violations only for $min(N_x, N_y) = 3$ or $4$.
