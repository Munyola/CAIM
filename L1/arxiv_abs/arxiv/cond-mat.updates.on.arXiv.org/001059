"Fluid polyamorphism" is the existence of two alternative amorphous structures in a single-component
fluid. It is either found or predicted, usually at extreme conditions, for a broad group of very different
materials, including helium, sulfur, phosphorous, carbon, silicon, cerium, tin tetraiodide,
tellurium, and hydrogen. This phenomenon is also hypothesized for metastable and deeply supercooled
water, presumably located a few degrees below the experimental limit of homogeneous ice formation.
We present a generic phenomenological approach to describe polyamorphism in a single-component
fluid, which is completely independent of the molecular origin of the phenomenon. We show that fluid
polyamorphism occurs either in the presence or the absence of fluid phase separation. In the latter
case, it is associated with a continuous transition, such as in liquid helium or liquid sulfur. To
specify the phenomenology, we consider a fluid with thermodynamic equilibrium between two distinct
interconvertible states or molecular structures. A fundamental signature of fluid polyamorphism
is the identification of the equilibrium fraction of molecules involved in each of these alternative
structures. However, the existence of the alternative structures may result in polyamorphic fluid
phase separation only if the mixing of these structures is not ideal. The two-state thermodynamics
unifies all the debated scenarios of fluid polyamorphism with or without phase separation and qualitatively
describes the thermodynamic anomalies typically observed in polyamorphic materials.
