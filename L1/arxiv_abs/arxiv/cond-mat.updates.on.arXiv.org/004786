We consider the random-field O($N$) spin model with long-range exchange interactions which decay
with distance $r$ between spins as $r^{-d-\sigma}$ and/or random fields which correlate with distance
$r$ as $r^{-d+\rho}$, and reexamine the critical phenomena near the lower critical dimension by
use of the perturbative functional renormalization group. We compute the analytic fixed points
in the one-loop beta functions, and study their stability. We also calculate the critical exponents
at the analytical fixed points. We show that the analytic fixed point which governs the phase transition
in the system with the long-range correlations of random fields can be destabilized by the nonanalytic
perturbation in both cases where the exchange interactions between spins are short ranged and long
ranged. For the system with the long-range exchange interactions and uncorrelated random fields,
we show that the $d\to d-\sigma$ dimensional reduction at the leading order of the $d-2\sigma$ expansion
holds only for $N>2(4+3{\sqrt{3}})\simeq 18.3923\cdots$. Our investigation into the system
with the long-range exchange interactions and uncorrelated random fields also gives the value
of the boundary between critical behaviors in systems with long-range and short-range exchange
interactions, which is identical to that predicted by Sak [Phys. Rev. B {\bf{8}}, 281 (1973)]. For
the system with the long-range exchange interactions and the long-range correlated random fields,
we show that the $d\to d-\sigma-\rho$ dimensional reduction does not hold within the present framework,
as far as $N$ is finite.
