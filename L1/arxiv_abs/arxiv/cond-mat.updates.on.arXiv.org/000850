The impact of confinement on self-assembly of particles interacting with short-range attraction
and long-range repulsion (SALR) potential is studied for thermodynamic states corresponding
to local ordering of clusters or layers in the bulk. Exact and asymptotic expressions for the local
density and for the effective potential between the confining surfaces are obtained for a one-dimensional
lattice model introduced in [J. P\k{e}kalski et al. $J. Chem. Phys.$ ${\bf 140}$, 144903 (2013)].The
simple asymptotic formulas are shown to be in good quantitative agreement with exact results for
slits containing at least 5 layers. We observe that the incommensurability of the system size and
the average distance between the clusters or layers in the bulk leads to structural deformations
that are different for different values of the chemical potential $\mu$. The change of the type of
defects is reflected in the dependence of density on $\mu$ that has a shape characteristic for phase
transitions. Our results may help to avoid misinterpretation of the change of the type of defects
as a phase transition in simulations of inhomogeneous systems. Finally, we show that a system confined
by soft elastic walls may exhibit bistability such that two system sizes that differ approximately
by the average distance between the clusters or layers are almost equally probable. This may happen
when the equilibrium separation between the soft boundaries of an empty slit corresponds to the
largest stress in the confined self-assembling system.
