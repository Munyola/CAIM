Perovskite structure SrMnO$_3$ is a rare example of a multiferroic material where strain-tuning
and/or cation substitution could lead to coinciding magnetic and ferroelectric ordering temperatures,
which would then promise strong magnetoelectric coupling effects. Here, we establish the temperature
and strain dependent ferroic phase diagram of SrMnO$_3$ using first-principles-based effective
Hamiltonians. All parameters of these Hamiltonians are calculated using density functional theory,
i.e., no fitting to experimental data is required. Temperature dependent properties are then obtained
from Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics simulations. We observe a sequence of several magnetic
transitions under increasing tensile strain, with a moderate variation of the corresponding critical
temperatures. In contrast, the ferroelectric Curie temperature increases strongly after its
onset around 2.5\,\% strain, and indeed crosses the magnetic transition temperature just above
3\,\% strain. Our results indicate pronounced magnetoelectric coupling, manifested in dramatic
changes of the magnetic ordering temperatures and different magnetic ground states as function
of the ferroelectric distortion. In addition, coexisting ferroelectric and ferromagnetic order
is obtained for strains above 4\,\%. Our calculated phase diagram suggests the possibility to control
the magnetic properties of SrMnO$_3$ through an applied electric field, significantly altering
the magnetic transition temperatures, or even inducing transitions between different magnetic
states.
