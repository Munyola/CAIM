The electronic structure of Si(110)"$16\times2$" double- and single-domain and $1\times1$ surfaces
has been investigated using angle- and spin-resolved photoemission at sample temperatures of
77 K and 300 K. Angle-resolved photoemission was conducted using horizontally and vertically polarised
60 eV and 80 eV photons. Band-dispersion maps revealed four surface-states ($S_1$ to $S_4$) which
were assigned to silicon dangling bonds on the basis of measured binding energies and intensity
changes between horizontal and vertical light polarisations. Three surface-states ($S_1$, $S_2$
and $S_4$) were assigned to Si atoms present at the edges of the reconstructed surface. Only one of
the four surface states, $S_3$, was observed in both the "$16\times2$" and $1\times1$ band maps
and consequently attributed to the pervasive Si zigzag chains present on the step faces of the corrugated
surface. A state in the bulk-band region was attributed to an in-plane bond. All data were consistent
with the Adatom-Buckling model of the Si(110)"$16\times2$" surface. Spin polarisation data were
measured with optimised and fully characterised VLEED polarimeters allowing polarisation measurements
with a precision of better than 1\%. Room temperature measurements of $P_y$ and $P_z$ for the Si(110)"$16\times2$"
surface gave, as anticipated, zero polarisation but longitudinal polarisation measurements,
$P_x$, for $S_3$ at a higher resolution and lower temperature gave a very small average polarisation
of $2.8\pm 1.9\%$. An upper limit of 3\% may thus be taken for the longitudinal polarisation.
