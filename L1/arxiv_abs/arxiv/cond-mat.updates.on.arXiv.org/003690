Various types of walks on complex networks have been used in recent years to model search and navigation
in several kinds of systems, with particular emphasis on random walks. This gives valuable information
on network properties, but self-avoiding walks (SAWs) may be more suitable than unrestricted random
walks to study long-distance characteristics of complex systems. Here we study SAWs in clustered
scale-free networks, characterized by a degree distribution of the form $P(k) \sim k^{-\gamma}$
for large $k$. Clustering is introduced in these networks by inserting three-node loops (triangles).
The long-distance behavior of SAWs gives us information on asymptotic characteristics of such
networks. The number of self-avoiding walks, $a_n$, has been obtained by direct enumeration, allowing
us to determine the {\em connective constant} $\mu$ of these networks as the large-$n$ limit of the
ratio $a_n / a_{n-1}$. An analytical approach is presented to account for the results derived from
walk enumeration, and both methods give results agreeing with each other. In general, the average
number of SAWs $a_n$ is larger for clustered networks than for unclustered ones with the same degree
distribution. The asymptotic limit of the connective constant for large system size $N$ depends
on the exponent $\gamma$ of the degree distribution: For $\gamma > 3$, $\mu$ converges to a finite
value as $N \to \infty$; for $\gamma = 3$, the size-dependent $\mu_N$ diverges as $\ln N$, and for
$\gamma < 3$ we have $\mu_N \sim N^{(3 - \gamma) / 2}$.
