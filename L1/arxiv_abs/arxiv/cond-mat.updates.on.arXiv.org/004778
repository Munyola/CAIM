A model of superconducting computer memory exploiting the orthogonal spin transfer (OST) in the
pseudospin valve (PS) that is controlled by the three-terminal Josephson superconducting-ferromagnetic
transistor (SFT) is developed. The building blocks of the memory are hybrid PS and SFT structures.
The memory model is formulated in terms of the equation-defined PS and SFT devices integrated into
the PS/SFT memory cell (MC) circuit. Logical units "0" and "1" are associated with the two PS states
respectively characterized by two different values of resistance. Elementary logical operations
comprising the read/write processes occur when a word pulse applied to the SFT's injector coincides
with the respective bit pulse acting on MC. Physically, a word pulse triggers SFT to a resistive state,
causing the PS switching between the logical "0" and "1" states. Thus, the whole switching dynamics
of MC depends on the non-equilibrium and nonstationary properties of PS and SFT. Modeling the single
MC as well as the larger MC-based circuits comprising respectively twelve and thirty elements suggest
that such the memory cells can undergo ultrafast switching (sub-ns) and low energy consumption
per operation (sub-100 fJ). The suggested model allows studying the influence of noises, punch-through
effect, crosstalk, parasitic, etc. The obtained results suggest that the hybrid PS/SFT structures
are well-suited to superconducting computing circuits as they are built of magnetic and non-magnetic
transition metals and therefore have low impedances (1-30 Ohm).
