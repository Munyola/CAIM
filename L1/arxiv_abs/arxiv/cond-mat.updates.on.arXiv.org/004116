We study possible superconductivity in a carrier-doped iridium oxide insulator Sr$_{2}$IrO$_{4}$
based on an effective $t_{2g}$ three-orbital Hubbard model on the square lattice with a large spin-orbit
coupling (SOC). Numerically solving the linearized Eliashberg equation for the superconducting
(SC) gap function with the random phase approximation, we systematically examine both singlet
and triplet SC gap functions with possible pairing symmetries and the parameter dependence of the
superconductivity. For the realistic SOC $\lambda$ and Hund's coupling $J/U$ relevant to Sr$_{2}$IrO$_{4}$,
namely, for a large $\lambda$ and small $J/U$ region, we find that the intra-band antiferromagnetic
(AF) pseudospin $\bm{j}_{\text{eff}} = -\bm{l}+\bm{s}$ fluctuations favor a $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$-wave
pseudospin $j_{\text{eff}}=1/2$ singlet pairing in the electron-doping. We also find that the
$d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$-wave pairing is more stabilized with increasing the SOC and decreasing the
Hund's coupling. Furthermore, we show for a small $\lambda$ and large $J/U$ region that an $s_{\pm}$-wave
singlet pairing is favored in the hole-doped region. The origin of the $s_{\pm}$-wave pairing is
due to the inter-band pair scattering arising from the intra-orbital AF spin $\bm s$ fluctuations.
Although the possibility of a pseudospin triplet pairing is considered, we find it always unfavorable
for all parameters studied here. The experimental consequences for other strongly correlated
materials with a large SOC are also discussed.
