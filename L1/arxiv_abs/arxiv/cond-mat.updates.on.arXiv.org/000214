Noncolliding diffusion processes are dynamical extensions of random matrix models such that any
spatio-temporal correlation function is expressed by a determinant and such processes are said
to be determinantal. The time-dependent correlation kernel is a functional of initial configuration
of the stochastic process and in order to determine it, we have had to deal with multiple orthogonal
functions, which should be prepared depending on the initial configuration. From the view point
of probability theory, the noncolliding diffusion processes are interesting, since they are realized
as the harmonic transforms of absorbing particle systems in the Weyl chambers. Determinantal structure
of correlations has not been clear, however, from this view-point. In the present paper, we show
direct connections between harmonic transforms and determinantal correlation functions. In
this new approach, spatio-temporal correlation kernels can be determined without constructing
any system of orthogonal functions. Key quantities are local martingales, which are stochastic
processes preserving their expectations in time. By introducing integral transforms, we prove
that the harmonic functions of diffusions, which are used for the harmonic transforms, give determinants
of matrices whose elements are all martingales. We call them determinantal martingales. We demonstrate
how to calculate them depending on processes and initial configurations and show a variety of spatio-temporal
correlation kernels are readily derived from them. In special cases, the present martingales are
expressed by using complex diffusion processes.
