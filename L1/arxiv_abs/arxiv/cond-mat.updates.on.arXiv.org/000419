Synchrotron X-ray diffraction measurements have been conducted on liquid phosphorus trichloride,
tribromide and triiodide. Molecular Dynamics simulations for these molecular liquids were performed
with a dual purpose: (1) to establish whether existing intermolecular potential functions can
provide a picture that is consistent with diffraction data; (2) to generate reliable starting configurations
for subsequent Reverse Monte Carlo modelling. Structural models (i.e., sets of coordinates of
thousands of atoms) that were fully consistent with experimental diffraction information, within
errors, have been prepared by means of the Reverse Monte Carlo method. Comparison with reference
systems, generated by hard sphere-like Monte Carlo simulations, was also carried out to demonstrate
the extent to which simple space filling effects determine the structure of the liquids (and thus,
also estimating the information content of measured data). Total scattering structure factors,
partial radial distribution functions and orientational correlations as a function of distances
between the molecular centres have been calculated from the models. In general, more or less antiparallel
arrangements of the primary molecular axes that are found to be the most favourable orientation
of two neighbouring molecules. In liquid PBr3 electrostatic interactions seem to play a more important
role in determining intermolecular correlations than in the other two liquids; molecular arrangements
in both PCl3 and PI3 are largely driven by steric effects.
