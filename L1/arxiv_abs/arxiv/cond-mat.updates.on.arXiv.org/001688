Continuous Time Random Walk models (CTRW) of anomalous diffusion are studied, where the anomalous
exponent $\beta(x) \in (0,1)$ varies in space. This type of situation occurs e.g. in biophysics,
where the density of the intracellular matrix varies throughout a cell. Scaling limits of CTRWs
are known to have probability distributions which solve fractional Fokker-Planck type equations
(FFPE). This correspondence between stochastic processes and FFPE solutions has many useful extensions
e.g. to nonlinear particle interactions and reactions, but has not yet been established for FFPEs
of the "variable order" type with non-constant $\beta(x)$. In this article, variable order FFPEs
(VOFFPE) are derived from scaling limits of CTRWs. The key mathematical tool is the 1-1 correspondence
of a CTRW scaling limit to a bivariate Langevin process, which tracks the cumulative sum of jumps
in one component and the cumulative sum of waiting times in the other. The spatially varying anomalous
exponent is modelled by spatially varying $\beta(x)$-stable L\'evy noise in the waiting time component.
The VOFFPE displays a unique temporal scaling behaviour: at a time scale $T_0$, the factor $T_0^{-\beta(x)}$
enters in both the drift and diffusivity coefficients of the Fokker-Planck operator. A consequence
of the mathematical derivation of a VOFFPE from CTRW limits in this article is that a solution of a
VOFFPE can be approximated via Monte Carlo simulations. We check the consistency of VOFFPEs at two
different time scales $T_0$ by calculating probability densities at a sequence of times.
