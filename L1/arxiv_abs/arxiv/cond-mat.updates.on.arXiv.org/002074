The mixed spin-(1,1/2) Ising-Heisenberg double sawtooth ladder containing mixture of both spin-1
and spin-1/2 nodal atoms, and the spin-1/2 interstitial dimers is approximately solved by the transfer-matrix
method. Here, we study in detail the ground-state phase diagrams, also influences of the bilinear
exchange coupling on the rungs and cyclic four-spin exchange interaction in square plaquette of
each block on the magnetization and magnetic susceptibility of the suggested ladder at low temperature.
Such a double sawtooth ladder may be found in a Shastry-Sutherland Lattice-type. In spite of odd
and even blocks spin ordering are different from each other, but due to the commutation relation
between all different block Hamiltonians, phase diagrams, magnetization behavior and thermodynamic
properties of the model are the same for odd and even blocks. We show that at low temperature, both
exchange couplings can change the quality and quantity of the magnetization plateaus versus the
magnetic field changes. Specially, we find a new magnetization plateau M/Ms = 5/6 for this model.
Besides, we examine the magnetic susceptibility and specific heat of the model in detail. It is proven
that behaviors of the magnetization and the magnetic susceptibility coincide at low temperature.
The specific heat displays diverse temperature dependencies, which include a Schottky-type peak
at a special temperature interval. We observe that with increase of the bilinear exchange coupling
on the rungs, second peak temperature dependence grows.
