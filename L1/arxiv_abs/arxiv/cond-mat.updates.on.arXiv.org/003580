Various latest experiments have proven the theoretical prediction that domain walls in planar
magnetic structures can channel spin waves as outstanding magnonic waveguides, establishing
a superb platform for building magnonic devices. Recently, three-dimensional nanomagnetism
has been boosted up and become a significant branch of magnetism, because three-dimensional magnetic
structures expose a lot of emerging physics hidden behind planar ones and will inevitably provide
broader room for device engineering. Skyrmions and antiSkyrmions, as natural three-dimensional
magnetic configurations, are not considered yet in the context of spin-wave channeling and steering.
Here, we show that skyrmion tubes can act as nonplanar magnonic waveguides if excited suitably.
An isolated skyrmion tube in a magnetic nanoprism induces spatially separate internal and edge
channels of spin waves; the internal channel has a narrower energy gap, compared to the edge channel,
and accordingly can transmit signals at lower frequencies. Additionally, we verify that those
spin-wave beams along magnetic nanoprism are restricted to the regions of potential wells. Transmission
of spin-wave signals in such waveguides results from the coherent propagation of locally driven
eigenmodes of skyrmions, i.e., the breathing and rotational modes. Finally, we find that spin waves
along the internal channels are less susceptible to magnetic field than those along the edge channels.
Our work will open a new arena for spin-wave manipulation and help bridge skyrmionics and magnonics.
