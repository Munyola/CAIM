Non-monotonic retention profiles (NRP) have been observed in numerous studies of colloidal-nano
flows in porous media. For the first time, we explain the phenomenon by distributed particle properties
(size, shape, surface charge). We discuss colloidal-nano transport with fines attachment considering
stochastically distributed filtration coefficient (particle attachment probability) and the
influence of area occupation by particles on the rock surface. The distributed dynamic system allows
for exact averaging (up-scaling) yielding a novel 3x3 system of equations for total concentrations.
Besides the traditional equations of particle mass balance and capture-rate, the novel system
contains a third independent equation for kinetics of site occupation during particle attachment.
Ten laboratory tests exhibiting NRP have been successfully matched by the upscaled system for binary
colloids. Ten laboratory tests with 7-parametric data arrays have been successfully matched by
the 5-parameter model, which validates the model. The tuned parameters belong to their common intervals.
The laboratory data tuning was significantly simplified by deriving the exact solution of upscaled
equations. These results provide valuable insights for understanding the transport mechanisms
and environmental impact in colloidal-nano flows exhibiting NRP. Besides, the upscaled system
and the analytical model for 1D transport facilitate interpretation of the laboratory coreflood
data and allows for the laboratory-based predictions for 3D colloidal-nano transport at the field
scale.
