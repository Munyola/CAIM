Pentamode material is a kind of elastic solids with vanishing shear modulus, it has a great potential
in controlling water sound due to its broadband and solid state merits. Practical pentamode materials
realized with microstructures however have inevitable small shear modulus required by material
stability, and this shear rigidity may have important influence on the performance of devices designed.
This work systematically examined the cloaking effect of cylindrical acoustic cloak made of unideal
pentamode material with small shear modulus. In contrast to the expected broadband performance,
it is found that the non-vanishing shear modulus may induce intense discrete resonances over frequency.
These resonances are explained as standing shear waves along radial direction in the cloak, different
fundamentally from the resonances caused by whispering-gallery waves of cylindrical objects.
These discrete shear resonances may be eliminated by introducing a small material damping. We also
show that the cloaking performance depends also on boundary condition on the cloak inner surface,
the radially fixed boundary condition provides better cloaking performance, however this boundary
is hardly possible for water sound environment. Alternatively, a cloak supported by a shell with
free inner surface is proposed. It is found that the radially fixed boundary could be achieved through
an appropriate shell thickness, and a broadband cloaking performance almost without resonance
can be obtained. These results will provide valuable guidance for the practical applications of
pentamode acoustic cloak.
