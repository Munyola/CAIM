Clean hydrogen production through efficient and cost-effective electrochemical water splitting
is highly promising to meeting future global energy demands. The design of Earth-abundant materials
with both high activity for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and electrochemical stability in
both acidic and alkaline environments summarize the outcomes needed for practical applications.
Here, we report a non-noble 3d metal Cl-chemical doping of liquid phase exfoliated single/few-layer
flakes of MoSe2 for creating MoSe2 nanoflakes/3d metal oxide-hydr(oxy)oxide hybrid HER-catalysts.
We propose that the electron-transfer from MoSe2 nanoflakes to metal cations and the chlorine complexation-induced
both neutralization, as well as the in situ formation of metal oxide-hydr(oxy)oxides on MoSe2 nanoflake's
surface, tailor the proton affinity of the derived catalysts, increasing the number and HER-kinetic
of their active sites in both acidic and alkaline electrolytes. The electrochemical coupling between
the doped-MoSe2 nanoflakes/metal oxide-hydr(oxy)oxide hybrids and single-walled carbon nanotubes
heterostructures further accelerates the HER process. Lastly, monolithic stacking of multiple
heterostructures is reported as a facile electrode assembly strategy to achieve overpotential
for a cathodic current density of 10mAcm-2 of 0.081V and 0.064V in 0.5M H2SO4 and 1M KOH, respectively.
This opens up new opportunities to address the current density vs. overpotential requirements
targeted in pH-universal H2 production.
