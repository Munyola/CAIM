One of key challenges in current material research is to search for new topological materials with
inverted bulk-band structure. In topological insulators, the band inversion caused by strong
spin-orbit coupling leads to opening of a band gap in the entire Brillouin zone, whereas an additional
crystal symmetry such as point-group and nonsymmorphic symmetries sometimes prohibits the gap
opening at/on specific points or line in momentum space, giving rise to topological semimetals.
Despite many theoretical predictions of topological insulators/semimetals associated with
such crystal symmetries, the experimental realization is still relatively scarce. Here, using
angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy with bulk-sensitive soft x-ray photons, we experimentally
demonstrate that hexagonal pnictide CaAgAs belongs to a new family of topological insulators characterized
by the inverted band structure and the mirror reflection symmetry of crystal. We have established
the bulk valence-band structure in three-dimensional Brillouin zone, and observed the Dirac-like
energy band and ring-torus Fermi surface associated with the line node, where bulk valence and conducting
bands cross on a line in the momentum space under negligible spin-orbit coupling. Intriguingly,
we found that no other bands cross the Fermi level and therefore the low-energy excitations are solely
characterized by the Dirac-like band. CaAgAs provides an excellent platform to study the interplay
among low-energy electron dynamics, crystal symmetry, and exotic topological properties.
