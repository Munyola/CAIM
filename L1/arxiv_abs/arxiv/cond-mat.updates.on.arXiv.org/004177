The Fe/MgO magnetic tunnel junction is a classic spintronic system, with current importance technologically,
and interest for future innovation. The key magnetic properties are linked directly to the structure
of hard-to-access buried interfaces, and the Fe and MgO components near the surface are unstable
when exposed to air, making a deeper probing, non-destructive, in-situ measurement ideal for this
system. We have thus applied hard x-ray photoemission spectroscopy (HXPS) and standing-wave (SW)
HXPS in the few keV energy range to probe the structure of an epitaxially-grown MgO/Fe superlattice.
The superlattice consists of 9 repeats of MgO grown on Fe by magnetron sputtering on an MgO (001) substrate,
with a protective Al2O3 capping layer. We determine through SW-HXPS that 8 of the 9 repeats are similar
and ordered, with a period of 33 $\pm$ 4 angstrom, with minor presence of FeO at the interfaces and
a significantly distorted top bilayer with ca. 3 times the oxidation of the lower layers at the top
MgO/Fe interface. There is evidence of asymmetrical oxidation on the top and bottom of the Fe layers.
We find agreement with dark-field scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) and x-ray
reflectivity measurements. Through the STEM measurements we confirm an overall epitaxial stack
with dislocations and warping at the interfaces of ca. 5 angstrom. We also note a distinct difference
in the top bilayer, especially MgO, with possible Fe inclusions. We thus demonstrate that SW-HXPS
can be used to probe deep buried interfaces of novel magnetic devices with few angstrom precision.
