In the present work, we investigate the effects of long-range interactions on the phase transitions
of two-dimensional ferromagnetic models with single-ion anisotropy at zero and finite temperatures.
The Hamiltonian is given by $H=\sum_{i\neq j} J_{ij}(S_i^xS_j^x+S_i^yS_j^y+\lambda S_i^zS_j^z)+D\sum_{i}(S_i^z)^2$,
where $J_{ij}=-J |r_j-r_i|^{-p}$ ($p\geq 3$) is a long-range ferromagnetic interaction ($J>0$),
$0\leq \lambda\leq 1$ is an anisotropic constant and $D$ is the single-ion anisotropic constant.
It is well-known that the single-ion anisotropy $D$ creates a competition between an ordered state
(favored by the exchange interaction) and a disordered state, even at zero temperature. For small
values of $D$, the system has a spontaneous magnetization $m_z\neq 0$, while in the large-D phase
$m_z=0$ because a state with $\langle S^z\rangle\neq 0$ is energetically unfavorable. Therefore,
a phase transition due to quantum fluctuations occurs in some critical value $D_c$. For systems
with short-range interaction $D_c\approx 6J$, depending of $\lambda$ constant, but in our model
we have found larger values of $D$ due to the higher cost to flip a spin. Since low-dimensional magnetic
systems with long range interaction can be ordered at finite temperature, we also have analyzed
the thermal phase transitions (similar to the BKT transition). The model has been studied by using
a Schwinger boson formalism as well as the Self-consistent Harmonic Approximation (SCHA) and both
methods provide according results.
