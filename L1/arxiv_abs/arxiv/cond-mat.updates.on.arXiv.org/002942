A theoretical framework is proposed for the spin-current driven synchronized self-oscillations
in ferromagnets in the spin Hall geometry. The spin current generated by the spin Hall effect in a
bottom nonmagnetic heavy metal excites a self-oscillation of the magnetization in an attached
ferromagnet through spin-transfer effect. The spin current simultaneously creates spin accumulation
inside the ferromagnet. Therefore, when the top surfaces of two ferromagnets are connected by a
nonmagnetic material having a long spin diffusion length, another spin current flows according
to the gradient of the spin accumulations between the ferromagnets. This additional spin current
excites an additional spin torque leading to a coupled motion of the magnetizations. This coupling
mechanism comes purely from spin degree of freedom in the system without using electric and/or magnetic
interactions. The additional spin torque acts as a repulsive force between the magnetizations,
and prefers an antiphase synchronization between the oscillators. The phase difference in a synchronized
state is determined by the competition between this additional spin torque and spin pumping. Eventually,
either an in-phase or antiphase synchronization is spontaneously excited in the individual ferromagnets,
depending on the current magnitude. These conclusions are obtained by deriving the theoretical
formula of the additional spin torque from the diffusive spin transport theory and solving the equation
of motion of the magnetizations both numerically and analytically.
