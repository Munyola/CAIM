Temperature- and field- dependent $^1$H-, $^{19}$F-, and $^{79,81}$Br- NMR measurements together
with zero - field $^{79,81}$Br-NQR measurements on polycrystalline samples of barlowite, Cu$_4$(OH)$_6$FBr
are conducted to study the magnetism and possible structural distortions on a microscopic level.
The temperature dependence of the $^{79,81}$Br- NMR spin-lattice relaxation rates 1/$T_1$ indicate
a phase transition at $T_{\rm N}\simeq$15 K which is of magnetic origin, but with an unusually weak
slowing down of fluctuations below $T_{\rm N}$. Moreover, 1/$T_1T$ scales linear with the bulk
susceptibility which indicates persisting spin fluctuations down to 2 K. Quadupolare resonance
(NQR) studies reveal a pair of zero-field NQR- lines associated with the two isotopes of Br with the
nuclear spins of $I$ = 3/2. Quadrupole coupling constants of $\nu_Q\simeq$ 28.5~MHz and 24.7~MHz
for $^{79}$Br- and $^{81}$Br- nuclei are determined from Br-NMR and the asymmetry parameter of
the electric field gradient was estimated to $\eta \simeq 0.2$. The Br-NQR lines are consistent
with our findings from Br-NMR and they are relatively broad, even above $T_{\rm N}$. This broadening
and the relative large $\eta $ value suggests a symmetry reduction at the Br- site reflecting the
presence of a local distortion in the lattice. Our density-functional calculations show that the
displacements of Cu2 atoms located between the kagome planes do not account for this relatively
large $\eta$. On the other hand, full structural relaxation, including the deformation of kagome
planes, leads to a better agreement with the experiment.
