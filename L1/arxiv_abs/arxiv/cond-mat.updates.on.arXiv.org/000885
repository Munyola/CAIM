We revisit the problem of electron transport in clean and disordered zigzag graphene nanoribbons,
and expose numerous hitherto unknown peculiar properties of these systems at zero energy, where
both sublattices decouple because of chiral symmetry. For clean ribbons, we give a quantitative
description of the unusual power-law dispersion of the central energy bands and of its main consequences,
including the strong divergence of the density of states near zero energy, and the vanishing of the
transverse localization length of the corresponding edge states. In the presence of off-diagonal
disorder, which respects the lattice chiral symmetry, all zero-energy localization properties
are found to be anomalous. Recasting the problem in terms of coupled Brownian motions enables us
to derive numerous asymptotic results by analytical means. In particular the typical conductance
$g_N$ of a disordered sample of width $N$ and length $L$ is shown to decay as $\exp(-C_Nw\sqrt{L})$,
for arbitrary values of the disorder strength $w$, while the relative variance of $\ln g_N$ approaches
a non-trivial constant $K_N$. The dependence of the constants $C_N$ and $K_N$ on the ribbon width
$N$ is predicted. From the mere viewpoint of the transfer-matrix formalism, zigzag ribbons provide
a case study with many unusual features. The transfer matrix describing propagation through one
unit cell of a clean ribbon is not diagonalizable at zero energy. In the disordered case, we encounter
non-trivial random matrix products such that all Lyapunov exponents vanish identically.
