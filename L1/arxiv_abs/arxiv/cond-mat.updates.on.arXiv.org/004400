While of paramount importance in material science and engineering, the rupture of solids is often
described by empirical observations rather than by fully understood physical models. The earliest
formalism is probably that by Griffith: the propagation of cracks is described as a threshold phenomenon,
only obtained when fractures are loaded above a critical fracture energy. This view matches the
behaviour of brittle matter, which suddenly snaps passed a certain elastic deformation. It is however
acknowledged that a crack loaded below the mentioned threshold is still growing, but at rates that
are orders of magnitude below that of a `dynamic' fracture. One possible approach is to consider
that the fracture energy is dependent on the propagation velocity, rather than being a strict medium
property. Alternatively, these slow creep regimes are well modelled by thermally activated sub-critical
laws such as Arrhenius-like growth rate. It was suggested that the description of both the slow and
the fast regimes, as well as that of the threshold phenomena, could be unified if accounting for the
plasticity around the crack tip, in particular as the associate induced heat might locally soften
the matter. We here propose a unifying model which neglects such an effect of the thermal dissipation,
but focuses instead on how temperature affects the front sub-critical growth. We show how this model
accounts for experimental data gathered during the failure of two different materials, at all velocities
over eight orders of magnitude, thus shedding new light on fracture physics.
