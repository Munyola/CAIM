We study correlated quantum wires subject to harmonic modulation of the onsite-potential concentrating
on the limit of large times, where the response of the system has synchronized with the drive. We identify
the ratio $\Delta\epsilon/\Omega$ of the driving amplitude $\Delta\epsilon$ and the frequency
of driving $\Omega$ as the scale determining the crossover from a modified Luttinger liquid picture
to a system that behaves effectively like a higher dimensional one. We exemplify this crossover
by studying the frequency dependency of the boundary density of state $\rho_{\rm B}(\omega)$ as
well as the temperature dependency of the linear conductance $G(T)$ through the wire, if the latter
is contacted to leads. Both observables are known to exhibit Luttinger liquid physics without driving
given by characteristic power-law suppression as $\omega\to\epsilon_{\rm F}$ (with $\epsilon_{\rm
F}$ the Fermi energy) or $T\to 0$, respectively. With driving we find that this suppression is modified
from a single power-law to a superposition of an infinite number of power laws. At small $\Delta\epsilon/\Omega\ll
1$ only a few terms of this infinite sum are relevant as the prefactors of higher terms are suppressed
exponentially. Thus a picture similar to the equilibrium Luttinger liquid one emerges. Increasing
$\Delta\epsilon/\Omega$ an increasing number of power laws contribute to the sum and approaching
$\Delta\epsilon/\Omega\gg 1$ the system behaves effectively two dimensional, for which the suppression
is wiped out completely.
