The Casimir force between two short-range charge sources, embedded in a background of one dimensional
massive Dirac fermions, is explored by means of the original $\ln\text{[Wronskian]}$ contour
integration techniques. For identical sources with the same (positive) charge, we find that in
the non-perturbative region the Casimir interaction between them can reach sufficiently large
negative values and simultaneously reveal the features of a long-range force in spite of nonzero
fermion mass, that could significantly influence the properties of such quasi-one-dimensional
QED systems. For large distances $s$ between sources we recover that their mutual interaction is
governed first of all by the structure of the discrete spectrum of a single source, in dependence
on which it can be tuned to give an attractive, a repulsive, or an (almost) compensated Casimir force
with various rates of the exponential fall-down, quite different from the standard $\exp (-2 m s)$
law. By means of the same $\ln\text{[Wronskian]}$ techniques, the case of two $\delta$-sources
is also considered in a self-consistent manner with similar results for the variability of the Casimir
force. A quite different behavior of the Casimir force is found for the antisymmetric source-anti-source
system. In particular, in this case, there is no possibility for a long-range interaction between
sources. The asymptotics of the Casimir force follows the standard $\exp (-2 m s)$ law. Moreover,
for small separations between sources, the Casimir force for symmetric and antisymmetric cases
turns out to be of opposite sign.
