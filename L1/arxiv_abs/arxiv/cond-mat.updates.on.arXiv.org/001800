Solar cells based on organic-inorganic metal halide perovskites show efficiencies close to highly-optimized
silicon solar cells. However, current-voltage hysteresis impedes large-scale commercial applications.
This hysteresis is commonly attributed to ion migration within the perovskite layer due to the presence
of vacancies, interstitials, or substitutions. We use transient ion-drift measurements to quantify
activation energy, concentration, and diffusion coefficient of mobile ions in methylammonium
lead triiodide (MAPbI3) perovskite solar cells. We identify three migrating ion species which
we attribute to the migration of iodide (I-) and methylammonium (MA+). The estimated activation
energies for the migration of mobile ions in the tetragonal phase are 0.37 eV for I- and 0.95 eV for
MA+ near grain boundaries. The latter changes to 0.28 eV near the tetragonal-to-cubic phase-transition
temperature. In the cubic phase, we find an additional activation energy of 0.43 eV which we attribute
to the migration of MA+ ions in the bulk. We find that the concentration of mobile MA+ ions is significantly
higher than the one of mobile I- ions, and that the diffusion coefficient of mobile MA+ ions is three
to four orders of magnitude lower than the one for I- ions. From the associated timescale, we conclude
that MA+ ions are mainly responsible for the observed current-voltage hysteresis in solar cells
at typical operating temperatures. This quantification of mobile ions in MAPbI3 will lead to a better
understanding of ion migration and its role in degradation of perovskite solar cells.
