The sensing of external fields using quantum systems is a prime example of an emergent quantum technology.
Generically, the sensitivity of a quantum sensor consisting of $N$ independent particles is proportional
to $\sqrt{N}$. However, interactions invariably occuring at high densities lead to a breakdown
of the assumption of independence between the particles, posing a severe challenge for quantum
sensors operating at the nanoscale. Here, we show that interactions in quantum sensors can be transformed
from a nuisance into an advantage when strong interactions trigger a dissipative phase transition
in an open quantum system. We demonstrate this behavior by analyzing dissipative quantum sensors
based upon nitrogen-vacancy defect centers in diamond. Using both a variational method and numerical
simulation of the master equation describing the open quantum many-body system, we establish the
existence of a dissipative first order transition that can be used for quantum sensing. We investigate
the properties of this phase transition for two- and three-dimensional setups, demonstrating
that the transition can be observed using current experimental technology. Finally, we show that
quantum sensors based on dissipative phase transitions are particularly robust against imperfections
such as disorder or decoherence, with the sensitivity of the sensor not being limited by the $T_2$
coherence time of the device. Our results can readily be applied to other applications in quantum
sensing and quantum metrology where interactions are currently a limiting factor.
