We study 2+1 dimensional phases with topological order, such as fractional quantum Hall states
and gapped spin liquids, in the presence of global symmetries. Phases that share the same topological
order can then differ depending on the action of symmetry, leading to symmetry enriched topological
(SET) phases. Here we present a K-matrix Chern-Simons approach to identify all distinct phases
with Abelian topological order, in the presence of unitary or anti-unitary global symmetries .
A key step is the identification of an edge sewing condition that is used to check if two putative phases
are indeed distinct. We illustrate this method for the case of Z2 topological order (Z2 spin liquids),
in the presence of an internal Z2 global symmetry. We find 6 distinct phases. The well known quantum
number fractionalization patterns account for half of these states. Phases also differ due to the
addition of a symmetry protected topological (SPT) phase. Also, we allow for the unconventional
possibility that anyons are exchanged by the symmetry. This leads to 4 additional phases with symmetry
protected Majorana edge modes. Other routes to realizing protected edge states in SET phases are
identified. Symmetry enriched Laughlin states and double semion theories are also discussed.
Two surprising lessons that emerge are: (i) gauging the global symmetry of distinct SET phases can
lead to states with the same topological order (ii) gauge theories with distinct Dijkgraaf-Witten
topological terms may have the same topological order.
