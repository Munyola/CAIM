We present a mode-coupling theory (MCT) for the high-density dynamics of two-dimensional spherical
active Brownian particles (ABP). The theory is based on the integration-through-transients (ITT)
formalism and hence provides a starting point for the calculation of non-equilibrium averages
in active-Brownian particle systems. The ABP are characterized by a self-propulsion velocity
$v_0$, and by their translational and rotational diffusion coefficients, $D_t$ and $D_r$. The
theory treats both the translational and the orientational degrees of freedom of ABP explicitly.
This allows to study the effect of self-propulsion of both weak and strong persistence of the swimming
direction, also at high densities where the persistence length $\ell_p=v_0/D_r$ is large compared
to the typical interaction length scale. While the low-density dynamics of ABP is characterized
by a single P\'eclet number, $Pe=v_0^2/D_rD_t$, close to the glass transition the dynamics is found
to depend on $Pe$ and $\ell_p$ separately. At fixed density, increasing the self-propulsion velocity
causes structural relaxatino to speed up, while decreasing the persistence length slows down the
relaxation. The theory predicts a non-trivial idealized-glass-transition diagram in the three-dimensional
parameter space of density, self-propulsion velocity and rotational diffusivity. The active-MCT
glass is a nonergodic state where correlations of initial density fluctuations never fully decay,
but also an infinite memory of initial orientational fluctuations is retained in the positions.
