We studied solvent-driven ordering dynamics of block copolymer films supported by a densely cross-linked
polymer network designed as organic hard mask (HM) for lithographic fabrications. The ordering
of microphase separated domains at low degrees of swelling corresponding to intermediate/strong
segregation regimes was found to proceed significantly faster in films on a HM layer as compared
to similar block copolymer films on silicon wafers. The ten-fold enhancement of the chain mobility
was evident in the dynamics of morphological phase transitions and of related process of terrace-formation
on a macroscale, as well as in the degree of long-range lateral order of nanostructures. The effect
is independent of the chemical structure and on the volume composition (cylinder-/ lamella-forming)
of the block copolymers. In-situ ellipsometric measurements of the swelling behavior revealed
a cumulative increase in 1-3 vol. % in solvent up-take by HM-block copolymer bilayer films, so that
we suggest other than dilution effect reasons for the observed significant enhancement of the chain
mobility in concentrated block copolymer solutions. Another beneficial effect of the HM-support
is the suppression of the film dewetting which holds true even for low molecular weight homopolymer
polystyrene films at high degrees of swelling. Apart from immediate technological impact in block
copolymer-assisted nanolithography, our findings convey novel insight into effects of molecular
architecture on polymer-solvent interactions.
