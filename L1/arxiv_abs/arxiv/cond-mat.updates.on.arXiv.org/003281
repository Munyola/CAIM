Like silicon-based semiconductor devices, van der Waals heterostructures will require integration
with high-K oxides. This is needed to achieve suitable voltage scaling, improved performance as
well as allowing for added functionalities. Unfortunately, commonly used high-k oxide deposition
methods are not directly compatible with 2D materials. Here we demonstrate a method to embed a multi-functional
few nm thick high-k oxide within van der Waals devices without degrading the properties of the neighbouring
2D materials. This is achieved by in-situ laser oxidation of embedded few layer HfS2 crystals. The
resultant oxide is found to be in the amorphous phase with a dielectric constant of k~15 and break-down
electric fields in the range of 0.5-0.6 V/nm. This transformation allows for the creation of a variety
of fundamental nano-electronic and opto-electronic devices including, flexible Schottky barrier
field effect transistors, dual gated graphene transistors as well as vertical light emitting and
detecting tunnelling transistors. Furthermore, upon dielectric break-down, electrically conductive
filaments are formed. This filamentation process can be used to electrically contact encapsulated
conductive materials. Careful control of the filamentation process also allows for reversible
switching between two resistance states. This allows for the creation of resistive switching random
access memories (ReRAMs). We believe that this method of embedding a high-k oxide within complex
van der Waals heterostructures could play an important role in future flexible multi-functional
van der Waals devices.
