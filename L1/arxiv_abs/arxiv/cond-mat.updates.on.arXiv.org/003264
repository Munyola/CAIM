Robust topologically-trivial low-energy Andreev bound states (ABSs) induced by position-dependent
effective potentials have recently come under renewed focus in light of a remarkable set of recent
experiments observing robust quantized zero bias conductance plateaus in semiconductor-superconductor
(SM-SC) heterostructures. We clarify the mechanisms for the formation of such states in SM-SC hybrid
nanowires under the application of a parallel magnetic field. Specifically, we show that, (1) the
partial spatial separation of the wave functions of the component Majorana bound states (MBSs)
is crucial for the creation and robustness of topologically trivial near-zero-energy ABSs, (2)
this partial separation can be induced by monotonic smooth confinement potentials or by non-monotonic
valley or hill potentials, which can be induced by potential gates or by a position-dependent work
function difference, (3) the signs of the spin polarizations of the component MBSs can be either
the same or opposite, depending on the profile of the inducing potential, (4) these spin polarizations
do not play a fundamental role in generating vastly different coupling strengths to local probes
and/or ensuring the robustness of the near-zero-energy ABS, and hence, in contrast to the claims
in a recent theoretical work (Ref. [51]) (5) a robust, quantized, zero bias conductance plateau
of height 2e^2/h measured in the topologically trivial regime necessarily requires partially
separated ABSs (ps-ABSs), independent of the relative signs of the spin-polarizations.
