The superconducting state in vanadium characterizes with the critical temperature ($T_{c}$)
equal to $5.3$~K. The Coulomb pseudopotential, calculated with the help of the Eliashberg equations,
possesses anomalously high value $\mu^{\star}\left(3\Omega_{\rm max}\right)=0.259$ or $\mu^{\star}\left(10\Omega_{\rm
max}\right)=0.368$ ($\Omega_{\rm max}$ denotes the maximum phonon frequency). Despite the relatively
large electron-phonon coupling constant ($\lambda=0.91$), the quantities such as: the order
parameter ($\Delta$), the specific heat ($C$), and the thermodynamic critical field ($H_{c}$)
determine the values of the dimensionless ratios not deviating much from the predictions of the
BCS theory: $R_{\Delta}=2\Delta\left(0\right)/ k_{B}T_{c}=3.68$, $R_{C}=\Delta C\left(T_{c}\right)/
C^{N}\left(T_{c}\right)=1.69$, and $R_{H}=T_{c}C^{N}\left(T_{c}\right)/ H^{2}_{c}\left(0\right)=0.171$.
This result is associated with the reduction of the strong-coupling and the retardation effects
by the high value of the Coulomb pseudopotential. It has been shown that the results of the Eliashberg
formalism can be relatively precisely reproduced with the help of the semi-analytical formulas,
if the value of $\mu^{\star}$ is determined on the basis of the $T_{c}$-Allen-Dynes expression
($\mu^{\star}_{AD}=0.198$). The attention should be paid to the fact that in the numerical and
in the semi-analytical approach the comparable values of the thermodynamic parameters for the
same $\mu^{\star}$ have been obtained only in the vicinity of the point $\mu^{\star}=0.1$.
