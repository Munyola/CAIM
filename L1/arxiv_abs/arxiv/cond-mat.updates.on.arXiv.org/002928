Udalov and Beloborodov in the recent papers [Phys. Rev. B 95, 134106 (2017); Phys. Rev. B 96, 125425
(2017)] report the strong influence of image forces on the conductance of ferroelectric tunnel
junctions. In particular, the authors state that there is enhancement of the electroresistance
effect due to polarization hysteresis in symmetric tunnel junctions at nonzero bias. This conjecture
seems to be a breakthrough --- the common knowledge is that the considerable effect, linear over
voltage bias, takes place only in NONsymmetric junctions. We show that the influence of image forces
on the conductance of ferroelectric tunnel junctions is highly overestimated due to neglecting
the difference between characteristic ferroelectric relaxation and electron tunneling times.
We argue that notable enhancement of the electroresistance effect from image forces due to polarization
hysteresis in symmetric tunnel junctions at nonzero bias might be observed only at anomalously
slow electron tunneling through the barrier. The same applies to magnetic tunnel junctions with
a ferroelectric barrier also considered by Udalov et al: there is no significant increase of the
magnetoelectric effect due to image forces for typical electron tunneling times. Udalov and Beloborodov
completely missed the development of image force theory since 1950's and they forgot that electrons
move much faster than atoms in condensed matter. We underline that taking into account dynamical
effects in charge tunneling can bring new insight on physics of ferroelectric tunnel junctions.
