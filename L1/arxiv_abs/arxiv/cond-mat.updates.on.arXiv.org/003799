The artificial magnetic fields engineered for ultra cold gases depend on the internal structure
of the neutral atoms. Therefore the components of a mixture composed of two atomic gases can exhibit
a different response to an artificial magnetic field. Such a mixture can be interpreted as a mixture
of two atomic gases, carrying different synthetic charges. In this article, we consider such mixtures
of two superfluids with unequal synthetic charges in a ring trap subject to a uniform artificial
magnetic field. The charge imbalance in such a mixture changes the distribution of excited particles
over angular momentum states compared to that of an equally charged mixture. This microscopic difference
exhibits macroscopic consequences; such as the occurrence of an angular momentum transfer between
two unequally charged components. Due to the inter-fluid atomic interactions in a ring, the angular
momentum transfer can create a counter flowing persistent current in the weakly charged superfluid.
Even in the limiting case of a charged and an uncharged superfluid mixture, a persistent current
can be induced in the uncharged superfluid, despite the fact that it is not directly coupled to the
magnetic field. The stability analysis shows that the induction depends on the interplay between
inter-fluid interaction and the applied magnetic field. We obtain instability boundaries of the
system and construct phase diagrams as a function of the inter-fluid interaction and the magnetic
field. We investigate these properties employing the Bogoliubov approximation.
