The detailed analysis of the problem of possible magnetic behavior of the carbon-based structures
was fulfilled to elucidate and resolve (at least partially) some unclear issues. It was the purpose
of the present paper to look somewhat more critically into some conjectures which have been made
and to the peculiar and contradictory experimental results in this rather indistinct and disputable
field. Firstly the basic physics of magnetism was briefly addressed. Then a few basic questions
were thoroughly analyzed and critically reconsidered to elucidate the possible relevant mechanism
(if any) which may be responsible for observed peculiarities of the "magnetic" behavior in these
systems. The arguments supporting the existence of the intrinsic magnetism in carbon-based materials,
including pure graphene were analyzed critically. It was concluded that recently published works
have shown clearly that the results of the previous studies, where the "ferromagnetism" was detected
in pure graphene, were incorrect. Rather, graphene is strongly diamagnetic, similar to graphite.
Thus the possible traces of a quasi-magnetic behavior which some authors observed in their samples
may be attributed rather to induced magnetism due to the impurities, defects, etc. On the basis of
the present analysis the conclusion was made that the thorough and detailed experimental studies
of these problems only may shed light on the very complicated problem of the magnetism of carbon-based
materials. Lastly the peculiarities of the magnetic behavior of some related materials and the
trends for future developments were mentioned.
