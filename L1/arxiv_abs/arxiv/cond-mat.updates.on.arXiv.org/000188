The kinetic performance of graphite particles is difficult to deconvolute from half-cell experiments,
where the influences of the working electrode porosity and the counter electrode contribute nonlinearly
to the electrochemical re-sponse. Therefore, thin-layer electrodes of circa 1 {\mu}m thickness
were prepared with standard, highly crystalline graphite particles to evaluate their rate capability.
The performance was evaluated based on the different stage transitions. We found that the tran-sitions
towards the dense stages 1 and 2 with LiC6 in-plane densi-ty are one of the main rate limitations for
charge and discharge. But surprisingly, the transitions towards the dilute stages 2L, 3L, 4L, and
1L progress very fast and can even compensate for the initial diffusion limitations of the dense
stage transitions during discharge. We show the existence of a substantial difference between
the diffusion coefficients of the liquid-like stages and the dense stages. We also demonstrate
that graphite can be charged at a rate of ~6C (10 min) and discharged at 600C (6 s) while maintaining
80 % of the total specific charge for particles of 3.3 {\mu}m median diameter. Based on these findings,
we propose a shrinking annuli mechanism which describes the propagation of the different stages
in the particle at medium and high rates. Besides the limited applicable overpotential during charge,
this mechanism can explain the long-known but as yet unexplained asymmetry between the charge and
discharge rate performance of lithium intercalation in graphite.
