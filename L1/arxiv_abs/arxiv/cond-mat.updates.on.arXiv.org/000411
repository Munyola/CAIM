Anisotropy refers to the property of a material exhibiting directionally dependent features.
In this paper, we introduce black phosphorous (BP), the most stable allotrope of phosphorus in layered
orthorhombic structure with a bandgap of 0.3 eV in bulk, as a unique 2D material in which electrons,
phonons and their interactions with photons behave in a highly anisotropic manner within the plane
of the layers. The unique anisotropic nature of BP thin films is revealed using angle-resolved Raman
and infrared spectroscopies, together with angle-resolved transport study. For 15 nm thick BP,
we measure Hall mobility of 1000 and 600 cm^2/Vs for holes along the light (x) and heavy (y) effective
mass directions, respectively, at 120 K. These BP thin films also exhibit large and anisotropic
in-plane optical conductivity from 2 to 5 micrometer wavelength. Field effect transistors using
4 to 30 layers of BP (2 to 15 nm) as channel material exhibit an on-off current ratio exceeding 10^5,
a field-effect mobility of 205 cm^2/Vs, and good saturation properties all at room temperature,
suggesting its promising future in high performance thin film electronics. By introducing narrow
bandgap BP into the 2D material family, we fill the space between semi-metallic graphene and large
bandgap TMDCs, where great potentials for infrared optoelectronics lie. Most importantly, the
unique anisotropic nature of this intriguing material creates unprecedented possibilities for
the realization of conceptually new optoelectronic and electronic devices in which angle-dependent
physical properties are highly desirable.
