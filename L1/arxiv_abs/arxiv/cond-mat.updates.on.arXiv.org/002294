We consider the position-position correlation function of the Slicer Map, a one-dimensional dynamical
systems whose trajectories neither converge nor separate in time, except at discrete instants,
when a slicer intervenes, making their distance jump discontinuously. The Slicer Map shows sub-,
super-, and normal diffusion as a function of its control parameter $\alpha$ that characterises
the power-law distribution of the length of ballistic flights. In a recent paper, Salari et al, CHAOS
25, 073113 (2015), analytically expressed the time dependence of the moments of positions as a function
of $\alpha$, and compared it with the mean-square displacement of the L\'evy-Lorentz gas, that
also depends on a single parameter $\beta$. Although the L\'evy-Lorentz gas is a stochastic process
with properties that are much more complex than those of the Slicer Map, it was found that the moments
of the positions distributions of the two transport processes have the same asymptotic behaviour
when $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are chosen in order to match the exponent of the mean-square displacement.
Indeed, the moments only partially characterise transport processes. Here, we derive analytic
expressions for the position-position correlations of the Slicer Map, and we compare them with
the numerically estimated position-position correlations of the L\'evy-Lorentz gas. Remarkably,
the same relation that produces the agreement of the moments leads to the agreement of the position-position
correlation functions, at least for small values of $\beta$. No parameter is adjusted to achieve
this agreement.
