Recently we have proposed an effective Hartree-Fock (EHF) theory for the electrons of the muonic
molecules that is formally equivalent to the HF theory within the context of the Nuclear-Electronic
Orbital theory [Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. 20, 4466 (2018)]. In the present report we extend the muon-specific
effective electronic structure theory beyond the EHF level by introducing the effective second
order Muller-Plesset perturbation theory (EMP2) and the effective coupled-cluster theory at
single and double excitation levels (ECCSD) as well as an improved version including perturbative
triple excitations (ECCSD(T)). These theories incorporate electron-electron correlation into
the effective paradigm and through their computational implementation, a diverse set of small
muonic species is considered as a benchmark at these post-EHF levels. A comparative computational
study on this set demonstrates that the muonic bond length is in general non-negligibly longer than
corresponding hydrogenic analogs. Next, the developed post-EHF theories are applied for the muoniated
N-Heterocyclic carbene/silylene/germylene and the muoniated triazolium cation revealing the
relative stability of the sticking sites of the muon in each species. The computational results,
in line with previously reported experimental data demonstrate that the muon generally prefers
to attach to the divalent atom with carbeneic nature. A detailed comparison of these muonic adducts
with the corresponding hydrogenic adducts reveals subtle differences that have already been overlooked.
