We theoretically study the quench dynamics for an isolated Heisenberg spin chain with a random on-site
magnetic field, which is one of the paradigmatic models of a many-body localization transition.
We use the time-dependent variational principle as applied to matrix product states, which allows
us to controllably study chains of a length up to $L=100$ spins, i.e., much larger than $L \simeq 20$
that can be treated via exact diagonalization. For the analysis of the data, three complementary
approaches are used: (i) determination of the exponent $\beta$ which characterizes the power-law
decay of the antiferromagnetic imbalance with time; (ii) similar determination of the exponent
$\beta_\Lambda$ which characterizes the decay of a Schmidt gap in the entanglement spectrum, (iii)
machine learning with the use, as an input, of the time dependence of the spin densities in the whole
chain. We find that the consideration of the larger system sizes substantially increases the estimate
for the critical disorder $W_c$ that separates the ergodic and many-body localized regimes, compared
to the values of $W_c$ in the literature. On the ergodic side of the transition, there is a broad interval
of the strength of disorder with slow subdiffusive transport. In this regime, the exponents $\beta$
and $\beta_\Lambda$ increase, with increasing $L$, for relatively small $L$ but saturate for $L
\simeq 50$, indicating that these slow power laws survive in the thermodynamic limit. From a technical
perspective, we develop an adaptation of the ``learning by confusion'' machine learning approach
that can determine $W_c$.
