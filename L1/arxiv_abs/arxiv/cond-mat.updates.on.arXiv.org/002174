In this paper we present a simple and effective numerical method which allows a fast Fourier transformation-based
evaluation of stress generated by dislocations with arbitrary directions and Burgers vectors
if the (site-dependent) dislocation density is known. Our method allows the evaluation of the dislocation
stress using a rectangular grid with shape-anisotropic discretization cells without employing
higher multipole moments of the dislocation interaction coefficients. Using the proposed method,
we first simulate the stress created by relatively simple nonhomogeneous distributions of vertical
edge and so-called 'mixed' dislocations in a disk-shaped sample, which is necessary to understand
the dislocation behavior in more complicated systems. The main part of our research is devoted to
the stress distribution in polycrystalline layers with the dislocation density rapidly varying
with the distance to the layer bottom. Considering GaN as a typical example of such systems, we investigate
dislocation-induced stress for edge and mixed dislocations, having random orientations of Burgers
vectors among crystal grains. We show that the rapid decay of the dislocation density leads to many
highly nontrivial features of the stress distributions in such layers and study in detail the dependence
of these features on the average grain size. Finally we develop an analytical approach which allows
us to predict the evolution of the stress variance with the grain size and compare analytical predictions
with numerical results.
