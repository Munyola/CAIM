The loss factor of supercooled water at the frequencies 11...180 GHz has been measured. A measuring
technique has been proposed, in which wetted nanoporous silicate materials, silica gels, with
the mean diameter of the pores being 6-9 nm, were used to obtain deeply supercooled water. Results
have been obtained for the loss factor of supercooled water, close to volume water for its properties,
when cooled down to -45 {\deg}C. To ascertain the mechanism of pore water losses, measurements have
been made in the range of temperatures 0...-90 {\deg}C. The results obtained have demonstrated
the existence of significant excessive losses at the temperatures below -30 {\deg}C, compared
to the results of computations based on the known models. To allow mathematical description of the
increment loss factor, a new addend has been introduced as a sum of two Gaussian functions in the formula
described in [T. Meissner, F. J. Wentz, IEEE Trans. Geosci. Remote Sens. 2004. vol. 42, p. 1836].
One of these functions has the extremum near -45 {\deg}C, and the second one has the extremum in the
range of -60...-70 {\deg}C. Additional attenuation at -45 {\deg}C is supposed to be connected with
the second critical point of water. Attenuation with the center in the range of temperatures -60...-70
{\deg}C is determined by the emergence of conductive films at the boundary between the hard matrix
and ferroelectric ice 0. This modification is a transitional form to ice Ih or ice Ic and is formed
at the temperature below -23 {\deg}C.
