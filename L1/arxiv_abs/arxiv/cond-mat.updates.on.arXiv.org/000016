It is shown that the qualitative model of the high-temperature superconductivity suggested earlier
for cuprates and doped picene and based on the idea that the valence electron state depends on the
character of the chemical bonds they form and on the Coulomb interaction between the electrons is
not only confirmed by the experimental data on iron pnictides but is also improved. From the chemical
point of view, the high-temperature superconductivity is associated with additional $\pi$ bonding
along chains of covalently bonded ions via a delocalized $\pi$ orbital, just like in cuprates. From
the physical point of view, as the data on iron pnictides show, the superconductivity is associated
with a FeAs layer transition into the state similar to a macroscopic quantum system characterized
by a highly correlated electron state, formation of two-dimensional crystals of electron pairs
with quantized energy levels, and a strong Coulomb interaction between these crystals. Superconductivity
in such a system is accomplished by a two-dimensional Wigner crystal consisting of one-dimensional
Wigner crystals formed by bosons, i.e., singlet electron pairs that are in the same quasi-one-dimensional
state extending along the ion chain, which corresponds to a delocalized $\pi$ orbital in chemistry.
The model applicability to three different classes of materials (cuprates, picene, iron pnictides)
indicates that it can prove useful for development of the theory of superconductivity taking into
consideraion the highly correlated state of valence electrons and strong Coulomb interactions
between the electrons.
