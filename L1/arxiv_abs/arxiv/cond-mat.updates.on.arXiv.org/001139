We present a systematic study of the effects of structural disorder on LN photonic crystal slab cavities,
ranging from short to long length scales (N=3-29), employing a fully three-dimensional Bloch mode
expansion technique. We compute the optical density of states (DOS), quality factors and effective
mode volumes of the cavity modes and compare with the localized modes of a corresponding disordered
photonic crystal waveguide. We show that the quality factors and effective mode volumes saturate
at a specific cavity length and become bounded by the corresponding values of the Anderson modes
appearing in the disordered waveguide. We also show that the field confinement in the LN cavities
is mainly determined by Anderson localization as long as the confinement region is far enough from
the cavity mirrors and if the effective mode localization length is much smaller than the cavity
length. Surprisingly, we find that the Anderson-localized modes do not appear as new disorder-induced
resonances in the main spectral region of the LN cavities and, moreover, the disordered DOS enhancement
is largest for the disordered waveguide system with the same length. These results are fundamentally
interesting for applications such as lasing and cavity-QED, and provide new insights into the role
of the boundary condition (e.g., open versus mirrors) on a finite-size slow-light waveguide. They
also point out the clear failure of using models based on the cavity boundaries/mirrors and a single
slow-light Bloch mode to describe cavity systems with large N, which has been common practise.
