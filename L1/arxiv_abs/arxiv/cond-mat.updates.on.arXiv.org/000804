Light-activated self-propelled colloids are synthesized and their active motion is studied using
optical microscopy. We propose a versatile route using different photoactive materials, and demonstrate
a multiwavelength activation and propulsion. Thanks to the photoelectrochemical properties
of two semiconductor materials (\alpha Fe2 O3 and TiO2 ), a light with an energy higher than the bandgap
triggers the reaction of decomposition of hydrogen peroxide and produces a chemical cloud around
the particle. It induces a phoretic attraction with neighbouring colloids as well as an osmotic
self- propulsion of the particle on the substrate. We use these mechanisms to form colloidal cargos
as well as self-propelled particles where the light-activated component is embedded into a dielectric
sphere. The particles are self-propelled along a direction otherwise randomized by thermal fluctuations,
and exhibit a persistent random walk. For sufficient surface density, the particles spontaneously
form "living crystals" which are mobile, break apart and reform. Steering the particle with an external
magnetic field, we show that the formation of the dense phase results from the collisions heads-on
of the particles. This effect is intrinsically non-equilibrium and a novel principle of organization
for systems without detailed balance. Engineering families of particles self-propelled by different
wavelength demonstrate a good understanding of both the physics and the chemistry behind the system
and points to a general route for designing new families of self-propelled particles.
