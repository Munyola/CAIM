The one-dimensional (1D) Hubbard model, describing electrons on a lattice with an on-site repulsive
interaction, provides a paradigm for the physics of quantum many-body phenomena. However, the
Hubbard model with an attractive interaction is notoriously difficult to study due to the presence
of charge bound states of multi-electrons on the 1D lattice. Here by solving the thermodynamic Bethe
ansatz equations we study the universal thermodynamics, quantum criticality, magnetism of the
1D attractive Hubbard model. We show that the compressibility and the susceptibility obey simple
additivity rules at low temperatures, indicating a free-Fermi liquid nature of the Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov
(FFLO)-like state. The magnetization reveals three physical regions: a Fermi liquid at low temperatures,
a non-Fermi liquid at high temperatures and the Fermi liquid to non-Fermi liquid crossover in between.
The lattice interaction is seen to significantly influence the nature of the FFLO-like state in
1D. Furthermore, we show that the dimensionless Wilson ratio provides an ideal parameter to map
out the various phase boundaries and to characterize the free-Fermi liquid nature of the FLLO-like
state. The quantum scaling functions for the thermal and magnetic properties yield the dynamic
critical exponent $z=2$ and correlation critical exponent $\nu=1/2$ in the quantum critical region
whenever a phase transition occurs. Our results provide a rigorous understanding of quantum criticality
and quantum liquids of many-body systems in a fundamental 1D attractive model.
