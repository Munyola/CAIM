The electronic dispersions of the quasi-one-dimensional organic conductor TTF-TCNQ are studied
by angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy (ARPES) with higher angular resolution and accordingly
smaller step width than in previous studies. Our experimental results suggest that a refinement
of the single-band 1D Hubbard model that includes finite-range interactions is needed to explain
these photoemission data. To account for the effects of these finite-range interactions we employ
a mobile quantum impurity scheme that describes the scattering of fractionalized particles at
energies above the standard Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid limit. Our theoretical predictions agree
quantitatively with the location in the (k,omega) plane of the experimentally observed ARPES structures
at these higher energies. The non-perturbative microscopic mechanisms that control the spectral
properties are found to simplify in terms of the exotic scattering of the charge fractionalized
particles. We find that the scattering occurs in the unitary limit of (minus) infinite scattering
length, which limit occurs within neutron-neutron interactions in shells of neutron stars and
in the scattering of ultra-cold atoms but not in perturbative electronic condensed-matter systems.
Our results provide important physical information on the exotic processes involved in the finite-range
electron interactions that control the high-energy spectral properties of TTF-TCNQ. Our results
also apply to a wider class of 1D and quasi-1D materials and systems that are of theoretical and potential
technological interest.
