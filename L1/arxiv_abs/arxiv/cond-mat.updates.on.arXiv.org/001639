It is highly desirable to combine the full spin polarization of carriers with modern semiconductor
technology for spintronic applications. For this purpose, one needs good crystalline ferromagnetic
(or ferrimagnetic) semiconductors with high Curie temperatures. Rutile CrO$_2$ is a half-metallic
spintronic material with Curie temperature 394 K and can have nearly-full spin polarization at
room temperature. Here, we find through first-principles investigation that when a biaxial compressive
stress is applied on rutile CrO$_2$, the density of states at the Fermi level decreases with the in-plane
compressive strain, there is a structural phase transition to an orthorhombic phase at the strain
of -5.6\%, and then appears an electronic phase transition to a semiconductor phase at -6.1\%. Further
analysis shows that this structural transition, accompanying the tetragonal symmetry breaking,
is induced by the stress-driven distortion and rotation of the oxygen octahedron of Cr, and the half-metal-semiconductor
transition originates from the enhancement of the crystal field splitting due to the structural
change. Importantly, our systematic total-energy comparison indicates the ferromagnetic Curie
temperature remains almost independent of the strain, near 400 K. This biaxial stress can be realized
by applying biaxial pressure or growing the CrO$_2$ epitaxially on appropriate substrates. These
results should be useful for realizing full (100\%) spin polarization of controllable carriers
as one uses in modern semiconductor technology.
