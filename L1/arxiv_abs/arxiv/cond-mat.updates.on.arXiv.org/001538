While, theoretically, the degree of entanglement of a two-qubit state can be quantified by the concurrence,
the experimental determination of a two-qubit state, such as via quantum state tomography of the
two-photon state generated by the biexciton cascade in a quantum dot, typically involves the summation
of many data points corresponding to a time integration. In the prevalent literature on the biexciton
cascade in quantum dots, it is therefore common to define the concurrence in terms of single- or double-time-integrated
two-time correlation functions. Here, we compare the behavior of the concurrence according to
the different definitions found in the literature and study the relation between the time-integrated
concurrences and the actual degree of entanglement of the two-photon states generated by the biexciton
cascade in a quantum dot embedded in a microcavity. We focus mainly on the often-discussed situation
of a dot with finite biexciton binding energy in a cavity tuned to the two-photon resonance. Analytic
and numerical calculations reveal that in this case the single-time-integrated concurrence indeed
agrees well with the typical value of the concurrence according to its original definition, even
when the interaction between the quantum dot and longitudinal acoustic phonons is taken into account.
However, the double-time-integrated concurrence shows completely different trends with respect
to changes in the exciton fine structure splitting or the cavity loss rate and should not be interpreted
as a measure for the degree of entanglement.
