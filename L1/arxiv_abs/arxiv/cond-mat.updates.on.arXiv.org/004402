We present a molecular dynamics study of the motion of cylindrical polymer droplets on striped surfaces.
We first consider the equilibrium properties of droplets on different surfaces, we show that for
small stripes the Cassie-Baxter equation gives a good approximation of the equilibrium contact
angle. As the stripe width becomes non-negligible compared to the dimension of the droplets, the
droplet has to deform significantly to minimize its free energy, this results in a smaller value
of the contact angle than the continuum model predicts. We then evaluate the slip length, and thus
the damping coefficient as a function of the stripe width. For very small stripes, the heterogeneous
surface behaves as an effective surface, with the same damping as an homogeneous surface with the
same contact angle. However, as the stripe width increases, damping at the surface increases until
reaching a plateau. Afterwards, we study the dynamics of droplets under a bulk force. We show that
if the stripes are large enough the droplets are pinned until a critical acceleration. The critical
acceleration increases linearly with stripe width. For large enough accelerations, the average
velocity increases linearly with the acceleration, we show that it can then be predicted by a model
depending only the size of droplet, viscosity and slip length. We show that the velocity of the droplet
varies sinusoidally as a function of its position on the substrate. On the other hand, for accelerations
just above the depinning acceleration we observe a characteristic stick-slip motion, with successive
pinnings and depinnings.
