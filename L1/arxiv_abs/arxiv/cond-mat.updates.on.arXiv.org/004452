Anisotropic photonic materials with linear dichroism are crucial components in many sensing,
imaging and communication applications. Such materials play an important role as polarizers,
filters and wave-plates in photonic devices and circuits. Conventional crystalline materials
with optical anisotropy typically show unidirectional linear dichroism over a broad wavelength
range. The linear dichroism conversion phenomenon has not been observed in crystalline materials.
Here, we report the investigation of the unique linear dichroism conversion phenomenon in quasi-one-dimensional
(quasi-1D) hexagonal perovskite chalcogenide BaTiS3. The material shows record level of optical
anisotropy within the visible wavelength range. In contrast to conventional anisotropic optical
materials, the linear dichroism polarity in BaTiS3 makes an orthogonal change at an optical wavelength
corresponding to the photon energy of 1.78 eV. First principle calculations reveal that this anomalous
linear dichroism conversion behavior originates from different selection rules of the optical
transitions from the parallel bands in the BaTiS3 material. Wavelength dependent polarized Raman
spectroscopy further confirms this phenomenon. Such material with linear dichroism conversion
property can facilitate new ability to control and sense the energy and polarization of light, and
lead to novel photonic devices such as polarization-wavelength selective detectors and lasers
for multispectral imaging, sensing and optical communication applications.
