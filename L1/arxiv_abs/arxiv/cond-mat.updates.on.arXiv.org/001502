We study the influence of a randomly switching reproduction-predation rate on the survival behavior
of the non-spatial cyclic Lotka-Volterra model, also known as the zero-sum rock-paper-scissors
game, used to metaphorically describe the cyclic competition between three species. In large and
finite populations, demographic fluctuations (internal noise) drive two species to extinction
in a finite time, while the species with the smallest reproduction-predation rate is the most likely
to be the surviving one ("law of the weakest"). Here, we model environmental (external) noise by
assuming that the reproduction-predation rate of the "strongest species" (the fastest to reproduce/predate)
in a given static environment randomly switches between two values corresponding to more and less
favorable external conditions. We study the joint effect of environmental and demographic noise
on the species survival probabilities and on the mean extinction time. In particular, we investigate
whether the survival probabilities follow the law of the weakest and analyze their dependence of
the external noise intensity and switching rate. Remarkably, when, on average, there is a finite
number of switches prior to extinction, the survival probability of the predator of the species
whose reaction rate switches typically varies non-monotonically with the external noise intensity
(with optimal survival about a critical noise strength). We also outline the relationship with
the case where all reaction rates switch on markedly different time scales.
