In this work we derive and analyze coarse-grained descriptions of self-propelled particles with
selective attraction-repulsion interaction, where individuals may respond differently to their
neighbours depending on their relative state of motion (approach versus movement away). Based
on the formulation of a nonlinear Fokker-Planck equation, we derive a kinetic description of the
system dynamics in terms of equations for the Fourier modes of a one-particle density function.
This approach allows effective numerical investigation of the stability of possible solutions
of the system. The detailed analysis of the interaction integrals entering the equations demonstrates
that divergences at small wavelengths can appear at arbitrary expansion orders. Further on, we
also derive a hydrodynamic theory by performing a closure at the level of the second Fourier mode
of the one-particle density function. We show that the general form of equations is in agreement
with the theory formulated by Toner and Tu. Finally, we compare our analytical predictions on the
stability of the disordered homogeneous solution with results of individual-based simulations.
They show good agreement for sufficiently large densities and non-negligible short-ranged repulsion.
Disagreements of numerical results and the hydrodynamic theory for weak short-ranged repulsion
reveal the existence of a previously unknown phase of the model consisting of dense, nematically
aligned filaments, which cannot be accounted for by the present Toner and Tu type theory of polar
active matter.
