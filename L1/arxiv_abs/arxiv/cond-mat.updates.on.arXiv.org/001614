We investigate the doping-induced changes in the electronic structure of CeB$_6$ on a series of
substituted Ce$_{1-x}R_x$B$_6$ samples ($R$ = La, Nd) using diffuse neutron scattering. We observe
a redistribution of magnetic spectral weight across the Brillouin zone, which we associate with
the changes in the Fermi-surface nesting properties related to the modified charge carrier concentration.
In particular, a strong diffuse peak at the corner of the Brillouin zone ($R$ point), which coincides
with the propagation vector of the elusive antiferroquadrupolar (AFQ) order in CeB$_6$, is rapidly
suppressed by both La and Nd doping, like the AFQ order itself. The corresponding spectral weight
is transferred to the $X(00\frac{1}{2})$ point, ultimately stabilizing a long-range AFM order
at this wave vector at the Nd-rich side of the phase diagram. At an intermediate Nd concentration,
a broad diffuse peak with multiple local maxima of intensity is observed around the $X$ point, evidencing
itinerant frustration that gives rise to multiple ordered phases for which Ce$_{1-x}$Nd$_x$B$_6$
is known. On the La-rich side of the phase diagram, however, dilution of the magnetic moments prevents
the formation of a similar $(00\frac{1}{2})$-type order despite the presence of nesting. Our results
demonstrate how diffuse neutron scattering can be used to probe the nesting vectors in complex f-electron
systems directly, without reference to the single-particle band structure, and emphasize the
role of Fermi surface geometry in stabilizing magnetic order in rare-earth hexaborides.
