The distribution of superconducting properties among metal hydrides was investigated via the-state-of-the-art
computational simulation techniques. We proposed a search rule for high-$T_{C}$ metal-hydrogen
systems based on analysis of electronic structure of atomic s,d,f-orbitals. Results of the study
of actinides and lanthanides show that they form highly symmetric superhydrides $XH_{7-9}$. However,
actinides do not exhibit high-temperature superconductivity (except Th-H system) and might not
be considered as promising materials for experimental studies as well as all $d^m$-elements with
m > 4, including metal hydrides of the noble elements. A refinement rule based on monotonic behavior
of the maximum achievable critical temperature as a function of number of d+f electrons, max$T_{C}$($N_{d+f}$),
was proposed for already known results. Using this rule, the reported $T_{C}$ values for higher
hydrides in K-H, Zr-H, Hf-H and Ti-H systems were corrected. The dependences of max$T_{C}$ on the
group number, period, pressure and phase composition of hydrides were investigated. Developed
model allows one to make new targeted predictions on the existence of novel superconducting compounds.
For Mg-H, Sr-H, Ba-H, Cs-H, Rb-H we predict new high-$T_{C}$ phases $XH_{n}$ with n > 10, but Ta-H
and Nb-H systems should be recalculated because of anomalous values of max$T_{C}$ for $TaH_{6}$
and $NbH_{4}$. Electron doping of H-sublattice by pressure-driven delocalization of d,f-electrons
is suggested as the key factor for determining superconductive properties of polyhydrides.
