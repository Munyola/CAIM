The description of the chemical bond between a solid surface and an atom or a molecule is the fundamental
basis for understanding a broad range of scientific problems in heterogeneous catalysis, semiconductor
device fabrication, and fuel cells. Widespread understandings are based on the molecular orbital
theory and focused on the degree of filling of antibonding surface-adsorbate states that weaken
bonding on surfaces. The unoccupied antibonding surface-adsorbate states are often tacitly assumed
to be irrelevant. Here, we show that most antibonding states become unoccupied because the electrons
that would occupy these antibonding states are transferred to the lower-energy Fermi level. Such
antibonding electron transfer goes beyond molecular orbital theory. It leads to an energy gain
that largely controls the trends of surface adsorption strength and can serve as a primary descriptor
for bonding on surfaces. This finding is illustrated from the first-principles study of hydrogen
adsorption on MoS$_2$ surfaces. A clear linear relationship between the energies of antibonding
electron transfer and hydrogen adsorption is identified. The hydrogen evolution reaction on MoS$_2$
is found to originate from the in-gap states induced by sulfur vacancies or edges. The effects of
surface inhomogeneity (e.g., defects, step edges) on surface catalysis can be understood from
the corresponding different energies gained from antibonding electron transfer. The emerging
picture also offers a physically different explanation for the well-known $d$-band theory for
hydrogen adsorption on transition metal surfaces.
