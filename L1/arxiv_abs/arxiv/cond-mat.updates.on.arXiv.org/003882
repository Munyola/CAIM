The asymmetric responses of the system between the external force of right and left directions are
called "nonreciprocal". There are many examples of nonreciprocal responses such as the rectification
by p-n junction. However, the quantum mechanical wave does not distinguish between the right and
left directions as long as the time-reversal symmetry is intact, and it is a highly nontrivial issue
how the nonreciprocal nature originates in quantum systems. Here we demonstrate by the quantum
ratchet model, i.e., a quantum particle in an asymmetric periodic potential, that the dissipation
characterized by a dimensionless coupling constant $\alpha$ plays an essential role for nonlinear
nonreciprocal response. The temperature ($T$) dependence of the second order nonlinear mobility
$\mu_2$ is found to be $\mu_2 \sim T^{6/\alpha -4 }$ for $\alpha<1$, and $\mu_2 \sim T^{2(\alpha
-1)}$ for $\alpha>1$, respectively, where $\alpha_c=1$ is the critical point of the localization-delocalization
transition, i.e., Schmid transition. On the other hand, $\mu_2$ shows the behavior $\mu_2 \sim
T^{-11/4}$ in the high temperature limit. Therefore, $\mu_2$ shows the nonmonotonous temperature
dependence corresponding to the classical-quantum crossover. The generic scaling form of the
velocity $v$ as a function of the external field $F$ and temperature $T$ is also discussed. These
findings are relevant to the heavy atoms in metals, resistive superconductors with vortices and
Josephson junction system, and will pave a way to control the nonreciprocal responses.
