The first-passage time (FPT), i.e., the moment when a stochastic process reaches a given threshold
value for the first time, is a fundamental mathematical concept with immediate applications. In
particular, it quantifies the statistics of instances when biomolecules in a biological cell reach
their specific binding sites and trigger cellular regulation. Typically, the first-passage properties
are given in terms of mean first-passage times. However, modern experiments now monitor single-molecular
binding-processes in living cells and thus provide access to the full statistics of the underlying
first-passage events, in particular, inherent cell-to-cell fluctuations. We here present a robust
explicit approach for obtaining the distribution of FPTs to a small partially-reactive target
in cylindrical-annulus domains, which represent typical bacterial and neuronal cell shapes.
We investigate various asymptotic behaviours of this FPT distribution and show that it typically
is very broad in many biological situations: thus, the mean FPT can differ from the most probable
FPT by orders of magnitude. The most probable FPT is shown to strongly depend only on the starting
position within the geometry and to be almost independent of the target size and reactivity. These
findings demonstrate the dramatic relevance of knowing the full distribution of FPTs and thus open
new perspectives for a more reliable description of many intracellular processes initiated by
the arrival of one or few biomolecules to a small, spatially localised region inside the cell.
