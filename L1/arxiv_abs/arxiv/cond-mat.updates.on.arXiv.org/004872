We present a theoretical study of non-local magnetoelectric effects in diffusive hybrid structures
with an intrinsic linear-in-momentum spin-orbit coupling (SOC) which is assumed to be spatially
inhomogeneous. Our analysis is based on the SU(2)-covariant drift-diffusion equations from which
we derive the BC at hybrid interfaces. Within this formulation, the spin current is covariantly
conserved when the spin relaxation is only due to the intrinsic SOC. This conservation leads to the
absence of spin Hall (SH) currents in homogeneous systems. We also consider extrinsic sources of
relaxation (ESR), as magnetic impurities, which break the covariant spin conservation, and may
lead to SH currents. We apply our model to describe non-local transport in a system with an interface
separating two regions: one normal region without intrinsic SOC and one with a Rashba SOC. We first
explore the inverse spin-galvanic effect, i.e., a spin polarization induced by an electric field.
We demonstrate how the spatial behavior of such spin density depends on both, the direction of the
electric field and the strength of the ESR rate. We also study the spin-to-charge conversion, and
compute the charge current and the distribution of electrochemical potential in the Rashba region
induced by a spin current injected into the normal region. In systems with an inhomogeneous SOC varying
in one spatial direction, we find an interesting non-local reciprocity between the spin density
induced by a charge current at a given point in space, and the spatially integrated current induced
by a spin density injected at the same point.
