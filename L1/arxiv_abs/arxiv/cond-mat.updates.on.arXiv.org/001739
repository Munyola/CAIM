Free-standing nanoribbons of InAs quantum membranes (QMs) transferred onto a (Si/Mo) multilayer
mirror substrate are characterized by hard x-ray photoemission spectroscopy (HXPS), and by standing-wave
HXPS (SW-HXPS). Information on the chemical composition and on the chemical states of the elements
within the nanoribbons was obtained by HXPS and on the quantitative depth profiles by SW-HXPS. By
comparing the experimental SW-HXPS rocking curves to x-ray optical calculations, the chemical
depth profile of the InAs(QM) and its interfaces were quantitatively derived with angstrom precision.
We determined that: i) the exposure to air induced the formation of an InAsO$_4$ layer on top of the
stoichiometric InAs(QM); ii) the top interface between the air-side InAsO$_4$ and the InAs(QM)
is not sharp, indicating that interdiffusion occurs between these two layers; iii) the bottom interface
between the InAs(QM) and the native oxide SiO$_2$ on top of the (Si/Mo) substrate is abrupt. In addition,
the valence band offset (VBO) between the InAs(QM) and the SiO$_2$/(Si/Mo) substrate was determined
by HXPS. The value of $VBO = 0.2 \pm 0.04$ eV is in good agreement with literature results obtained
by electrical characterization, giving a clear indication of the formation of a well-defined and
abrupt InAs/SiO$_2$ heterojunction. We have demonstrated that HXPS and SW-HXPS are non-destructive,
powerful methods for characterizing interfaces and for providing chemical depth profiles of nanostructures,
quantum membranes, and 2D layered materials.
