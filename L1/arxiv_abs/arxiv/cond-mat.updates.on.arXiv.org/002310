The success of first principles electronic structure calculation for predictive modeling in chemistry,
solid state physics, and materials science is constrained by the limitations on simulated length
and time scales due to computational cost and its scaling. Techniques based on machine learning
ideas for interpolating the Born-Oppenheimer potential energy surface without explicitly describing
electrons have recently shown great promise, but accurately and efficiently fitting the physically
relevant space of configurations has remained a challenging goal. Here we present a Gaussian Approximation
Potential for silicon that achieves this milestone, accurately reproducing density functional
theory reference results for a wide range of observable properties, including crystal, liquid,
and amorphous bulk phases, as well as point, line, and plane defects. We demonstrate that this new
potential enables calculations that would be extremely expensive with a first principles electronic
structure method, such as finite temperature phase boundary lines, self-diffusivity in the liquid,
formation of the amorphous by slow quench, and dynamic brittle fracture. We show that the uncertainty
quantification inherent to the Gaussian process regression framework gives a qualitative estimate
of the potential's accuracy for a given atomic configuration. The success of this model shows that
it is indeed possible to create a useful machine-learning-based interatomic potential that comprehensively
describes a material, and serves as a template for the development of such models in the future.
