We study a $T=0$ quantum phase transition between a quantum paramagnetic state and a magnetically
ordered state for a spin $S=1$ XXZ Heisenberg antiferromagnet on a two-dimensional triangular
lattice. The transition is induced by an easy plane single-ion anisotropy $D$. At the mean-field
level, the system undergoes a direct transition at a critical $D = D_c$ between a paramagnetic state
at $D>D_c$ and an ordered state with broken $U(1)$ symmetry at $D<D_c$. We show that beyond mean-field
the phase diagram is very different and includes an intermediate, partially ordered chiral liquid
phase. Specifically, we find that inside the paramagnetic phase the Ising ($J_z$) component of
the Heisenberg exchange binds magnons into a two-particle bound state with zero total momentum
and spin. This bound state condenses at $D>D_c$, before single particle excitations become unstable,
and gives rise to a chiral liquid phase, which spontaneously breaks spatial inversion symmetry,
but leaves the spin-rotational $U(1)$ and time-reversal symmetries intact. This chiral liquid
phase is characterized by a finite vector chirality without long range dipolar magnetic order.
In our analytical treatment, the chiral phase appears for arbitrary small $J_z$ because the magnon-magnon
attraction becomes singular near the single-magnon condensation transition. This phase exists
in a finite range of $D$ and transforms into the magnetically ordered state at some $D<D_c$. We corroborate
our analytic treatment with numerical density matrix renormalization group calculations.
