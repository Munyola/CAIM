We report a fast, efficient and credible statistical reconstruction of any two-phase patterns
of islands of miscellaneous shapes and poly-dispersed in sizes. In the proposed multi-scale approach
called a weighted doubly-hybrid, two different pairs of hybrid descriptors are used. As the first
pair, we employ entropic quantifiers, while correlation functions are the second pair. Their competition
allows considering a wider spectrum of morphological features. Instead of a standard random initial
configuration, a synthetic one with the same number of islands as that of the target is created by
a cellular automaton. This is the key point for speeding-up of microstructure reconstruction,
making use of the simulated annealing technique. The program procedure allows requiring the same
values for the reconstructed and target interface. The reconstruction terminates when three conditions
related to the accuracy, interface and number of islands are fulfilled. We verify the approach on
digitized images of a thin metallic film and a concrete sample cross-section. For a given accuracy,
our method significantly reduces the number of accepted Monte Carlo steps when compared to the standard
approach. At the same time, it provides credible shapes and similar areas of islands, keeping their
number and the total interface of the target. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt
to obtain such an outcome. The cost-effective reconstructions suggest that the present technique
could also be used for patterns of islands with strongly jagged border lines.
