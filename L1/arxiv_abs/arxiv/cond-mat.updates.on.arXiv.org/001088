Noncollinear antiferromagnets have recently been attracting considerable interest partly due
to recent surprising discoveries of the anomalous Hall effect (AHE) in them and partly because they
have promising applications in antiferromagnetic spintronics. Here we study the anomalous Nernst
effect (ANE), a phenomenon having the same origin as the AHE, and also the spin Nernst effect (SNE)
as well as AHE and the spin Hall effect (SHE) in noncollinear antiferromagnetic Mn$_3X$ ($X$ = Sn,
Ge, Ga) within the Berry phase formalism based on {\it ab initio} relativistic band structure calculations.
For comparison, we also calculate the anomalous Nernst conductivity (ANC) and anomalous Hall conductivity
(AHC) of ferromagnetic iron as well as the spin Nernst conductivity (SNC) of platinum metal. Remarkably,
the calculated ANC at room temperature (300 K) for all three alloys is huge, being 10$\sim$40 times
larger than that of iron. Moreover, the calculated SNC for Mn$_3$Sn and Mn$_3$Ga is also larger,
being about five times larger than that of platinum. This suggests that these anitferromagnets
would be useful materials for thermoelectronic devices and spin caloritronic devices. The calculated
ANC of Mn$_3$Sn and iron are in reasonably good agreement with the very recent experiments. The calculated
SNC of platinum also agrees with the very recent experiments in both sign and magnitude. The calculated
thermoelectric and thermomagnetic properties are analyzed in terms of the band structures as well
as the energy-dependent AHC, ANC, SNC and spin Hall conductivity via the Mott relations.
