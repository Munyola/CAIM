We describe the development of a new object kinetic Monte Carlo code where the elementary defect
objects are off-lattice atomistic configurations. Atomic-level transitions are used to transform
and translate objects, to split objects and to merge them together. This gradually constructs a
database of atomic configurations -- a set of relevant defect objects and their possible events
generated on-the-fly. Elastic interactions are handled within objects with empirical potentials
at short distances, and between spatially distinct objects using the dipole tensor formalism.
The model is shown to evolve mobile interstitial clusters in tungsten faster than an equivalent
molecular dynamics simulation, even at elevated temperatures. We apply the model to the evolution
of complex defects generated using molecular dynamics simulations of primary radiation damage
in tungsten. We show that we can evolve defect structures formed in cascade simulations to experimentally
observable timescales of seconds while retaining atomistic detail. We conclude that the first
few nanoseconds of simulation following cascade initiation would be better performed using molecular
dynamics, as this will capture some of the near-temperature-independent evolution of small highly-mobile
interstitial clusters. We also conclude that, for the 20keV PKA cascades annealing simulations
considered here, internal relaxations of sessile objects difficult to capture using conventional
object KMC with idealised object geometries establish the conditions for long timescale evolution.
