Copper borate Cu$_3$(BO$_3$)$_2$ is a complex compound with a layered crystallographic structure
in which the Jahn-Teller active and magnetic copper Cu$^{2+}$ ions occupy sixteen nonequivalent
positions in the unit cell displaying controversial magnetic behavior. In this paper, we report
on the infrared and Raman spectroscopic studies of the lattice dynamics and the electronic structure
of 3$d^9$ copper states below the fundamental absorption band. The lattice dynamics is characterized
by a large number of phonons due to a low $P\overline{1}$ space group symmetry and a large unit cell
with Z=10. Unusually rich set of phonons was found in the low-energy part of the infrared and Raman
spectra below 100 cm$^{-1}$, which we tentatively assign to interlayer vibrations activated by
a crystal superstructure and/or to weak force constants for modes related to some structural groups.
Several phonons show anomalous behavior in the vicinity of the magnetic phase transition at $T_N$=10
K thus evidencing pronounced magnetoelastic interaction. No new phonons were found below $T_N$,
which excludes the spin-Peierls type of the magnetic transition. In the region of electronic transitions,
a strong broad absorption band centered at $\sim$1.8 eV is observed, which we assign to overlapping
of transitions between the crystal-field-split 3$d^9$ states of Cu$^{2+}$ ions split by the crystal
field in nonequivalent positions. The fundamental charge-transfer absorption band edge has a
complex structure and is positioned around $\sim$2.8-3.0 eV.
