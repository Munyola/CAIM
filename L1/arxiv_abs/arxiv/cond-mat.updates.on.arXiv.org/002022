The understanding of strongly-correlated materials, and in particular unconventional superconductors,
has puzzled physicists for decades. Such difficulties have stimulated new research paradigms,
such as ultra-cold atom lattices for simulating quantum materials. Here we report on the realization
of intrinsic unconventional superconductivity in a 2D superlattice created by stacking two graphene
sheets with a small twist angle. For angles near $1.1^\circ$, the first `magic' angle, twisted bilayer
graphene (TBG) exhibits ultra-flat bands near charge neutrality, which lead to correlated insulating
states at half-filling. Upon electrostatic doping away from these correlated insulating states,
we observe tunable zero-resistance states with a critical temperature $T_c$ up to 1.7 K. The temperature-density
phase diagram shows similarities with that of the cuprates, including superconducting domes.
Moreover, quantum oscillations indicate small Fermi surfaces near the correlated insulating
phase, in analogy with under-doped cuprates. The relative high $T_c$, given such small Fermi surface
(corresponding to a record-low 2D carrier density of $10^{11} \textrm{cm}^{-2}$ , renders TBG
among the strongest coupling superconductors, in a regime close to the BCS-BEC crossover. These
novel results establish TBG as the first purely carbon-based 2D superconductor and as a highly tunable
platform to investigate strongly-correlated phenomena, which could lead to insights into the
physics of high-$T_c$ superconductors and quantum spin liquids.
