A theory of magnetization transport of a single spin-species in a spatially varying magnetic field
is derived from entropic considerations. The theory describes thermodynamic transport in the
language of differential geometry. Both magnetization diffusion and separation are predicted
from a sample geometry, a magnetic field geometry, an entropy density function, and a single space-time
scale. It is expressed first and most generally as coupled nonlinear partial differential equations,
which are valid for the regime of high dipole-energy and magnetization. Second, the nonlinear model
is explored in the limit of low dipole-energy (semi-linear), from which is derived a physical parameter
characterizing separative magnetization transport (SMT). It is shown that the necessary and sufficient
condition for SMT to occur is that the SMT parameter is spatially inhomogeneous. Third, the high
spin-temperature (linear) limit is derived, and is shown to be equivalent to the model of nuclear
spin transport of Genack and Redfield. Differences among the three models are illustrated by numerical
solution. A family of analytic, steady-state solutions to the nonlinear transport equation is
derived and shown to be the spin-temperature analog of the Langevin paramagnetic equation and Curie's
law. A steady-state solution for the magnetization is shown to be equivalent to the widely applied
separation equation of Fenske. Moreover, we show that the SMT parameter is functionally related
to the relative volatility parameter of Fenske.
