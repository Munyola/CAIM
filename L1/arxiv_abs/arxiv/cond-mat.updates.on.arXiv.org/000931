Problems of particle dynamics involving unsteady Stokes flows in confined geometries are typically
harder to solve than their steady counterparts. Approximation techniques are often the only resort.
Felderhof (see e.g. 2005, 2009b) has developed a point-particle approximation framework to solve
such problems, especially in the context of Brownian motion. Despite excellent agreement with
past experiments, this framework has an inconsistency which we address in this work. Upon implementing
our modifications, the framework passes consistency checks that it previously failed. Further,
it is not obvious that such an approximation should work for short time-scale motion. We investigate
its validity by deriving it from a general formalism based on integral equations through a series
of systematic approximations. We also compare results from the point-particle framework against
a calculation performed using the method of reflections, for the specific case of a sphere near a
full-slip plane boundary. We find from our analysis that the reasons for the success of the point-particle
approximation are subtle and have to do with the nature of the unsteady Oseen tensor. Finally, we
provide numerical predictions for Brownian motion near a full-slip and a no-slip plane wall based
on the point-particle approximation as used by Felderhof, our modified point-particle approximation,
and the method of reflections. We show that our modifications to Felderhof's framework would become
significant for systems of metallic nanoparticles in liquids.
