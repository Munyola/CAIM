We study the SYK model in the large $N$ limit beyond the replica-diagonal approximation. First we
show that there are exact replica-nondiagonal solutions of the saddle point equations for $q=2$
for any finite replica number $M$. In the interacting $q=4$ case we are able to construct the numerical
solutions, which are in one-to-one correspondence to the analytic solutions of the quadratic model.
The defining feature of these solutions in both quadratic and quartic interaction cases is singular
behavior in the $M \to 0$ limit. Meanwhile, at finite $M$ calculations of the on-shell action on the
solutions reveal the nontrivial phase structure both in $q=2$ and $q=4$ cases. We also study replica-nondiagonal
solutions of the SYK in the strong coupling limit. For arbitrary $q$ we show that besides the usual
solutions of the replica-diagonal saddle point equations in the conformal limit, there are also
replica-nondiagonal solutions for any value of $M$ (including zero). The specific configurations,
that we study, have factorized time and replica dependencies. The corresponding saddle point equations
are separable at strong coupling, and can be solved using the Parisi ansatz from spin glass theory.
We construct the solutions which correspond to the replica-symmetric case and to one-step replica
symmetry breaking. We compute the regularized free energy on these solutions in the limit of zero
replicas. It is observed that there are nondiagonal solutions with the regularized free energy
lower than that of the standard diagonal conformal solution.
