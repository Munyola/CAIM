Molecular origin of the well-known specific heat anomaly in supercooled liquid water is investigated
here by using extensive computer simulations and theoretical analyses. A rather sharp increase
in the values of isobaric specific heat with lowering temperature and the weak temperature dependence
of isochoric specific heat in the same range are reproduced in simulations. We calculated the spatiotemporal
correlation among temperature fluctuations and examined the frequency dependent specific heat.
The latter shows a rapid growth in the low frequency regime as temperature is cooled below 270 K. In
order to understand the microscopic basis of this increase, we have performed a shell wise decomposition
of contributions of distant molecules to the temperature fluctuations in a central molecule. This
decomposition reveals the emergence, at low temperatures, of temporally slow, spatially long
ranged large temperature fluctuations. The temperature fluctuation time correlation function
(TFCF) can be fitted to a William-Watts stretched exponential form with the stretching parameter
close to 0.6 at low temperatures, indicating highly non-exponential relaxation. Temperature
dependence of the relaxation time of the correlation function can be fitted to Vogel-Fulcher-Tamermann
expression which provides a quantitative measure of the fragility of the liquid. Interestingly,
we find that the rapid growth in the relaxation time of TFCF with lowering temperature undergoes
a sharp crossover from a markedly fragile state to a weakly fragile state around 220 K.
