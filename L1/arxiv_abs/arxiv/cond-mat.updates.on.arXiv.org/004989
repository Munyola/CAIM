The normal phase of many unconventional superconductors is a "bad metal," identified by incoherence
in the quasi-particle spectrum, among other features. Hund's correlation has been identified
as one strong source of bad metallicity in multi-band superconducting manifold. Using FeSe as a
representative Hund's metal, we show that the superconducting critical temperature $T_{c}$ is
controlled by incoherence. In FeSe it is the $d_{xy}$ orbital which becomes strongly incoherent,
in presence of Hund's coupling J, when it is proximate to the Fermi level. Small excursions in $J$
cause colossal changes in $T_{c}$. By applying a recently developed, high-fidelity \emph{ab initio}
theory as a starting reference to crystalline FeSe, we consider various kinds excursions in parameter
space around the \emph{ab initio} values, to determine what controls $T_{c}$. In addition to tuning
\emph{J} we consider doping, and structural changes by varying the Se position in both bulk and monolayer
variants of FeSe. The twin combination of proximity of the $d_{xy}$ state to the Fermi energy, and
the strength of $J$ emerge as the primary criterion for incoherent spectral response that in turn
controls $T_{c}$. Using constrained RPA we show that experimentally accessible techniques can
modify \emph{J} by of order 100\,meV, and give rise to dramatic changes in $T_{c}$. Our study, effectively,
opens a paradigm for a unified understanding what controls $T_{c}$ in bulk, layers, and interfaces
of Hund's metals by hole pocket and electron screening cloud engineering.
