Significant scientific and technological progress in the field of spintronics is based on trilayer
magnetic tunnel junction devices which principally rely on the physics of single barrier tunneling.
While technologically relevant devices have been prototyped, the physics of single barrier tunneling
poses ultimate limitations on the performance of magnetic tunnel junction devices. Here, we propose
a fresh route toward high performance magnetic tunnel junctions by making electronic analogs of
optical phenomena such as anti-reflections and Fabry-P\`erot resonances. The devices we propose
feature anti-reflection enabled superlattice heterostructures sandwiched between the fixed
and the free ferromagnets of the magnetic tunnel junction structure. Our predictions are based
on the non-equilibrium Green's function spin transport formalism coupled self-consistently
with the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert-Slonczewski equation. Owing to the physics of bandpass spin
filtering in the bandpass Fabry-P\`erot magnetic tunnel junction device, we demonstrate an ultra-high
boost in the tunnel magneto-resistance (TMR$\approx5\times10^4\%$) and nearly 1200% suppression
of spin transfer torque switching bias in comparison to a traditional trilayer magnetic tunnel
junction device. We rationalize improvised spin transfer torque switching via analysis of the
Slonczewski spin current transmission spectra. The proof of concepts presented here can lead to
next-generation spintronics device design harvesting the rich physics of superlattice heterostructures
and exploiting spintronic analogs of optical phenomena.
