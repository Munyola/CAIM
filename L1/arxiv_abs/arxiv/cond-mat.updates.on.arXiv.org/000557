A quantum spin Hall insulator is a two-dimensional state of matter consisting of an insulating bulk
and one-dimensional helical edge states. While these edge states are topologically protected
against elastic backscattering in the presence of disorder, interaction-induced inelastic terms
may yield a finite conductivity. By using a kinetic equation approach, we find the backscattering
rate $\tau^{-1}$ and the semiclassical conductivity in the regimes of high ($\omega \gg \tau^{-1}$)
and low ($\omega \ll \tau^{-1}$) frequency. By comparing the two limits, we find that the parametric
dependence of conductivity is described by the Drude formula for the case of a disordered edge. On
the other hand, in the clean case where the resistance originates from umklapp interactions, the
conductivity takes a non-Drude form with a parametric suppression of scattering in the dc limit
as compared to the ac case. This behavior is due to the peculiarity of umklapp scattering processes
involving necessarily the state at the "Dirac point". In order to take into account Luttinger liquid
effects, we complement the kinetic equation analysis by treating interactions exactly in bosonization
and calculating conductivity using the Kubo formula. In this way, we obtain the frequency and temperature
dependence of conductivity over a wide range of parameters. We find the temperature and frequency
dependence of the transport scattering time in a disordered system as $\tau \sim [\max{(\omega,T)}]^{-2K-2}$,
for $K>2/3$ and $\tau \sim [\max{(\omega,T)}]^{-8K+2}$ for $K <2/3$.
