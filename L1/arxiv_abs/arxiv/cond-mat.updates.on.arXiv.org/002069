The 1144 iron arsenide (e.g. CaKFe4As4) has recently been discovered and inspired a tide of search
for superconductors. Such far, the discovered compounds are confined to iron arsenides (ABFe4As4),
where A and B are either alkali metals or alkaline earth elements. In this work, we propose two directions
in searching 1144 structures: (i) using tri-valence cations for A; (ii) substituting the transition
metal, e.g. replacing Fe by Co. Following the two directions, we employ density functional theory
to study stability and electronic structures of 1144 pnictides of various tri-valence cations
(La, Y, In, Tl, Sm and Gd), as well as cobalt arsenides. For LaAFe4As4, the 1144 phase can be stabilized
in three systems: LaKFe4As4, LaRbFe4As4 and LaCsFe4As4, which show quasi-two-dimensional semi-metal
features similar to the iron pnictide superconductors: hole-type Fermi surface at Gama point and
electron-type Fermi surface at M point in B.Z. In addition, LaKFe4As4 feature an extra bubble shaped
Fermi surface sheets, distinct from the other two peers. Y does not support any 1144 phase within
our search. For In and Tl, substitute Fe by Co and two unknown compounds of the 122 phase are stabilized:
InCo2As2 and TlCo2As2. The two cobalt arsenides have Fermi surfaces of similar topology as iron
arsenides, but the Fermi surfaces are all electron-type, showing potentials to be undiscovered
superconductors. Stable 1144 phases are also found in InKCo4As4 and InRbCo4As4. For Sm and Gd, most
1144 and 122 iron arsenides are found unstable.
