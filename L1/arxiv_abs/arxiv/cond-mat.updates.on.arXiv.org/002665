Inorganic halide perovskite \ce{Cs(Rb)PbI3} has attracted significant research interest in
the application of light-absorbing material of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Although there
have been extensive studies on structural and electronic properties of inorganic halide perovskites,
the investigation on their thermodynamic stability is lack. Thus, we investigate the effect of
substituting Rb for Cs in \ce{CsPbI3} on the chemical decomposition and thermodynamic stability
using first-principles thermodynamics. By calculating the formation energies of solid solutions
\ce{Cs$_{1-x}$Rb$_x$PbI3} from their ingredients \ce{Cs$_{1-x}$Rb$_x$I} and \ce{PbI2}, we
find that the best match between efficiency and stability can be achieved at the Rb content $x\approx$
0.7. The calculated Helmholtz free energy of solid solutions indicates that \ce{Cs$_{1-x}$Rb$_x$PbI3}
has a good thermodynamic stability at room temperature due to a good miscibility of \ce{CsPbI3}
and \ce{RbPbI3}. Through lattice-dynamics calculations, we further highlight that \ce{RbPbI3}
never stabilize in cubic phase at any temperature and pressure due to the chemical decomposition
into its ingredients \ce{RbI} and \ce{PbI2}, while \ce{CsPbI3} can be stabilized in the cubic phase
at the temperature range of 0$-$600 K and the pressure range of 0$-$4 GPa. Our work reasonably explains
the experimental observations, and paves the way for understanding material stability of the inorganic
halide perovskites and designing efficient inorganic halide PSCs.
