We derive an effective Hamiltonian system describing the low energy dynamics of circular magnetic
skyrmions and antiskyrmions. Using scaling and symmetry arguments we model (anti-)skyrmion dynamics
through a finite set of coupled, canonically conjugated, collective coordinates. The resulting
theoretical description is independent of both micromagnetic details as well as any specificity
in the ansatz of the skyrmion profile. Based on the Hamiltonian structure we derive a general description
for breathing dynamics of (anti-)skyrmions in the limit of radius much larger than the domain wall
width. The effective energy landscape reveals two qualitatively different types of breathing
behavior. For small energy perturbations we reproduce the well-known small breathing mode excitations,
where the magnetic moments of the skyrmion oscillate around their equilibrium solution. At higher
energies we find a breathing behavior where the in-plane angle of the skyrmion continuously precesses,
transforming N\'eel to Bloch skyrmions and vice versa. For a damped system we observe the transition
from the continuously rotating and breathing skyrmion into the oscillatory one. We analyze the
characteristic frequencies of both breathing types, as well as their amplitudes and distinct energy
dissipation rates. For rotational (oscillatory) breathing modes we predict on average a linear
(exponential) decay in energy. We argue that this stark difference in dissipative behavior should
be observable in the frequency spectrum of excited (anti-)skyrmions.
