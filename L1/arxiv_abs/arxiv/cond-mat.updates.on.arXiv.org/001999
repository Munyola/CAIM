We study the ultrafast structural dynamics, in response to electronic excitations, in heterostructures
composed of Au$_{923}$ nanoclusters on thin-film substrates with the use of femtosecond electron
diffraction. Various forms of atomic motion, such as thermal vibrations, thermal expansion and
lattice disordering, manifest as distinct and quantifiable reciprocal-space observables. In
photo-excited, supported nanoclusters thermal equilibration proceeds through intrinsic heat
flow, between their electrons and their lattice, and extrinsic heat flow between the nanoclusters
and their substrate. For an in-depth understanding of this process, we have extended the two-temperature
model to the case of 0D/2D heterostructures and used it to describe energy flow among the various
subsystems, to quantify interfacial coupling constants, and to elucidate the role of the optical
and thermal substrate properties. When lattice heating of Au nanoclusters is dominated by intrinsic
heat flow, a reversible disordering of atomic positions occurs, which is absent when heat is injected
as hot substrate-phonons. The present analysis indicates that hot electrons can distort the lattice
of nanoclusters, even if the lattice temperature is below the equilibrium threshold for surface
pre-melting. Based on simple considerations, the effect is interpreted as activation of surface
diffusion due to modifications of the potential energy surface at high electronic temperatures.
We discuss the implications of such a process in structural changes during surface chemical reactions.
