We consider 1D lattices described by Hubbard or Bose-Hubbard models, in the presence of periodic
high-frequency perturbations, such as uniform ac force or modulation of tunnelling constants.
Effective Hamiltonians for interacting particles are derived using an averaging method resembling
classical canonical perturbation theory. Previous studies demonstrated renormalization of
tunnelling constants by the high-frequency force leading to interesting phenomena such as coherent
destruction of tunnelling and creation of artificial gauge fields. We find explicitly second-order
corrections to the effective Hamiltonians due to interactions. These corrections correspond
to non-trivial processes such as single-particle density-dependent tunnelling, correlated
pair hoppings, nonlocal (extended) pair hopping, nearest neighbour interactions, superexchange
interactions. Some of these processes arise also in multiband lattice models, and are capable to
give rise to a rich variety of quantum phases. Using a suitable driving protocol, it is possible to
supress or enhance a particular process in the effective Hamiltonian. Our approach and results
differ from that of the recent study based on flow equation method [A. Verdeny and coworkers, Phys.Rev.Lett
111, 175301 (2013)], and allow to reproduce known single- and two-particle solutions obtained
by multiple time-scale method (e.g., [S.Longhi, Phys. Rev. B 77, 195326 (2008)]). The results may
found applications in designing effective Hamiltonian models in experiments with ultracold atoms
in optical lattices, e.g. for simulating solid-state phenomena via optical means.
