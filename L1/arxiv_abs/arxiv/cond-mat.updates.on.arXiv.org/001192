In the context of the celebrated Kuramoto model of globally-coupled phase oscillators of distributed
natural frequencies, which serves as a paradigm to investigate spontaneous collective synchronization
in many-body interacting systems, we report on a very rich phase diagram in presence of thermal noise
and an additional non-local interaction on a one-dimensional periodic lattice. Remarkably, the
phase diagram involves both equilibrium and non-equilibrium phase transitions. In two contrasting
limits of the dynamics, we obtain exact analytical results for the phase transitions. These two
limits correspond to (i) the absence of thermal noise, when the dynamics reduces to that of a non-linear
dynamical system, and (ii) the oscillators having the same natural frequency, when the dynamics
becomes that of a statistical system in contact with a heat bath and relaxing to a statistical equilibrium
state. In the former case, our exact analysis is based on the use of the so-called Ott-Antonsen ansatz
to derive a reduced set of nonlinear partial differential equations for the macroscopic evolution
of the system. Our results for the case of statistical equilibrium are on the other hand obtained
by extending the well-known transfer matrix approach for nearest-neighbor Ising model to consider
non-local interactions. The work offers a case study of exact analysis in many-body interacting
systems. The results obtained underline the crucial role of additional non-local interactions
in either destroying or enhancing the possibility of observing synchrony in mean-field systems
exhibiting spontaneous synchronization.
