In multicomponent superfluids and superconductors, co- and counter-flows of components have
in general different properties. It was discussed in 1975 by Andreev and Bashkin, in the context
of He$^3$/He$^4$ superfluid mixtures, that inter-particle interactions produce a dissipationless
drag. The drag can be understood as a superflow of one component induced by phase gradients of the
other component. Importantly the drag can be both positive (entrainment) and negative (counter-flow).
The effect is known to be of crucial importance for many properties of diverse physical systems ranging
from the dynamics of neutron stars, rotational responses of Bose mixtures of ultra-cold atoms to
magnetic responses of multicomponent superconductors. Although there exists a substantial literature
that includes the drag interaction phenomenologically, much fewer regimes are covered by quantitative
studies of the microscopic origin of the drag and its dependence on microscopic parameters. Here
we study the microscopic origin and strength of the drag interaction in a quantum system of two-component
bosons on a lattice with short-range interaction. By performing quantum Monte-Carlo simulations
of a two-component Bose-Hubbard model we obtain dependencies of the drag strength on the boson-boson
interactions and properties of the optical lattice. Of particular interest are the strongly-correlated
regimes where the ratio of co-flow and counter-flow superfluid stiffnesses can diverge, corresponding
to the case of saturated drag.
