A new approach to the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition in the two-dimensional Coulomb
gas model is explored by MC simulation and finite size scaling. The usual mapping of a neutral two-dimensional
superconductor in zero magnetic field to a Coulomb gas leads to an unscreened logarithmic interaction
between the vortices, and with periodic boundary conditions vortex configurations are always
vorticity neutral with an equal number of plus and minus vortices. We demonstrate that relaxing
the neutrality condition has certain advantages. It leads to non-neutral vortex configurations
that can appear in real systems with open boundary conditions and permits calculation of the compressibility,
which for thin film superconductors corresponds to the magnetic permeability. The vortex-number
fluctuation has remarkable scaling properties at and below the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless
transition. The fugacity variable becomes dangerously irrelevant in the low-temperature phase
and leads to a multiplicative scaling correction to the mean-square vortex-number fluctuation
and to the magnetic permeability. This multiplicative correction strongly affects the scaling
properties of the vorticity fluctuation at and below the transition. Consequences of these findings
are demonstrated using Monte Carlo simulations. Inclusion of the next-higher order correction
to scaling is found to play an important role in the analysis of numerical data for the vortex number
fluctuation and permits accurate determination of the critical properties.
