We report the structural, transport, electronic, and magnetic properties of Co$_2$FeGa Heusler
alloy nanoparticles. The Rietveld refinements of x-ray diffraction (XRD) data with the space group
Fm$\bar {3}$m clearly demonstrates that the nanoparticles are of single phase. The particle size
(D) decreases with increasing the SiO$_2$ concentration. The Bragg peak positions and the inter-planer
spacing extracted from high-resolution transmission electron microscopy image and selected
area electron diffraction are in well agreement with data obtained from XRD. The coercivity initially
increases from 127~Oe to 208~Oe between D = 8.5~nm and 12.5~nm, following the D$^{-3/2}$ dependence
and then decreases with further increasing D up to 21.5~nm with a D$^{-1}$ dependence, indicating
the transition from single domain to multidomain regime. The effective magnetic anisotropic constant
behaves similarly as coercivity, which confirms this transition. A complex scattering mechanisms
have been fitted to explain the electronic transport properties of these nanoparticles. In addition
we have studied core-level and valence band spectra using photoemission spectroscopy, which confirm
the hybridization between $d$ states of Co/Fe. Further nanoparticle samples synthesized by co-precipitation
method show higher saturation magnetization. The presence of Raman active modes can be associated
with the high chemical ordering, which motivates for detailed temperature dependent structural
investigation using synchrotron radiation and neutron sources.
