Motivated by the observation of nonmetallic nature in double perovskite Ca2CrReO6 and Ca2FeReO6
with two electrons for their three Re t2g bands, we systematically investigate the structural,
electronic, and magnetic properties of Ca2MReO6 (M=Cr,Fe) through first-principles calculations.
Our full optimization confirms the stable ground-state structure with P21/n symmetry. Our mBJ
calculation show that they are both ferrimagnetic semiconductors with semiconductor gaps of 0.38
and 0.05 eV, respectively, in contrast with wrong metallic phases from the generalized gradient
approximation (GGA). The origin of semiconductor gap is due to the further distortion of ReO6 octahedra
caused by John-Teller effect, which drives the three partially-occupied Re t2g bands split into
two fully-filled doublet bands and one empty singlet band in the minority-spin channel. With the
spin-orbit coupling (SOC) taken into account, the Ca2MReO6 (M=Cr,Fe) shows high magnetocrystalline
anisotropy, and the total magnetic moments increase by 0.209 and 0.25 muB per formula unit, respectively.
Fortunately, the semiconductor gaps remain open, reducing to 0.31 and 0.03 eV, in spite of the SOC
broadening of the Re t2g-related bands. Therefore, our DFT investigation with mBJ has established
the correct ferrimagnetic semiconductor ground state for the double perovskites Ca2MReO6 (M=Cr,Fe),
which originate mainly from the crystalline field splitting of the otherwise partially-occupied
Re t2g bands in one spin channel. This mechanism is different from that in Sr2CrOsO6, and can help
understand other similar compounds.
