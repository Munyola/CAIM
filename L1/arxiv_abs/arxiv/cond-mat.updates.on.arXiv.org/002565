We calculate the drag coefficient of a circular liquid domain, which is put in a flat fluid membrane
composed of a binary fluid mixture lying in the homogeneous phase near the demixing critical point.
Assuming a sufficiently small correlation length, we regard the domain dynamics as independent
of the critical fluctuation and use the Gaussian free-energy functional for the mixture. Because
of the near-criticality, the preferential attraction between the domain component and one of the
mixture components generates the composition gradient outside the domain significantly and can
affect the drag coefficient. We first consider a domain having the same membrane viscosity as the
domain exterior. The drag coefficient is expanded with respect to a dimensionless strength of the
preferential attraction. It is numerically shown that the magnitude of the expansion coefficient
decreases much as the order of the strength increases and that the first-order term of the series
usually gives a good approximation for practical material constants. The effect of the preferential
attraction is shown to be able to become significantly large in practice. We second consider cases
where the membrane viscosities of the domain interior and exterior are different. The first-order
term of the expansion series decreases to approach zero as the domain viscosity increases to infinity.
This agrees with previous numerical results showing that the hydrodynamics makes the effect of
the preferential attraction negligibly small for a rigid disk.
