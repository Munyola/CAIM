In our study we investigate the behaviour of the net force (NF) emerging between an ellipsoidal particle
and a thick plate (slab), when the interaction takes place in a near critical fluid medium with account
for the omnipresent van der Waals forces (vdWF). Here we consider the case of complete wetting of
the objects surfaces by the medium, due to strong adsorbing local surface potentials, exerted by
thin solid coating films. The influence of the bulk inner regions of the particle and the slab on the
constituents of the fluid results in long-ranged competing dispersion potentials. As a consequence
from the critical fluctuations of the medium, the system experiences an additional effective interaction,
traditionally termed critical Casimir force (CCF). The forces of interest are evaluated numerically
from integral expressions obtained utilizing general scaling arguments and mean-field type calculations
in combination with the so-called "surface integration approach" (SIA). Within the scenario considered
here, this technique is applicable if one has knowledge of the forces between two parallel semi-infinite
plates, confining in between some fluctuating fluid medium characterized by its temperature $T$
and chemical potential $\mu$. It is demonstrated that for a suitable set of particle-fluid, slab-fluid,
and fluid-fluid coupling parameters the competition between the effects due to the coatings and
the core regions of the objects result, when one changes $T$ or $\mu$, in {\it sign change} of the NF
acting between the ellipsoid and the slab.
