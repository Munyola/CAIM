Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM) has enabled mapping of atomic structures of
solids with sub-pm precision, providing insight to the physics of ferroic phenomena and chemical
expansion. However, only a subset of information is available, due to projective nature of imaging
in the beam direction. Correspondingly, the analysis often relies on the postulated known form
of macroscopic Landau-Ginzburg energy, and some predefined relationship between experimentally
determined atomic coordinates and the order parameter field. Here, we propose an approach for exploring
the structure of ferroics using reduced order parameter models constructed based on experimental
data only. We develop a four sublattices model (FSM) for the analytical description of A-cation
displacement in (anti)ferroelectric-antiferrodistortive perovskites of ABO3-type. The model
describes the displacements of cation A in four neighboring unit cells and determines the conditions
of different structural phases appearance and stability in ABO3. We show that FSM explains the coexistence
of rhombohedral (R), orthorhombic (O) and spatially modulated (SM) phases, observed by atomic-resolution
STEM in La-doped BiFeO3. Using this approach, we atomically resolve and theoretically model the
sublattice asymmetry inherent to the case of the A-site La/Bi cation sublattice in LaxBi1-xFeO3
polymorphs. This approach allows exploring the ferroics behaviors from experimental data only,
without additional assumptions on the nature of the order parameter.
