Interfaces remain one of the major issues in limiting the understanding and designing polymer nanocomposites
due to their complexity and pivotal role in determining the ultimate composites properties. In
this study, we take multi-walled carbon nanotubes/silicone rubber nanocomposites as a representative
example, and have for the first time studied the correlation between high-frequency dielectric
dispersion and static/dynamic interfacial characteristics. We have found that the interface
together with other meso-structural parameters (volume fraction, dispersion, agglomeration)
play decisive role in formulating the dielectric patterns. The calculation of the relaxation times
affords the relative importance of interfacial polarization to dipolar polarization in resultant
dielectric relaxation. Dielectric measurements coupled with cyclic loading further reveals
the remarkable capability of dielectric frequency dispersion in capturing the evolution of interfacial
properties, such as a particular interface reconstruction process occurred to the surfactant-modified
samples. All these results demonstrate that high-frequency dielectric spectroscopy is instrumental
to probing both static and dynamic meso-structural characteristics, especially effective for
the composites with relative weak interfaces which remains a mission impossible for many other
techniques. The insights provided here based on the analyses of dielectric frequency dispersion
will pave the way for optimized design and precise engineering of meso-structure in polymer nanocomposites.
