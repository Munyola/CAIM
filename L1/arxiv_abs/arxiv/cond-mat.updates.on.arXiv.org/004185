Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) is used to study the energy and momentum dependence
of the inelastic scattering rates and the mass renormalization of charge carriers in LiFeAs at several
high symmetry points in the Brillouin zone. A strong and linear-in-energy scattering rate is observed
for sections of the Fermi surface having predominantly Fe $3d_{xy/yz}$ orbital character on the
inner hole and on electron pockets. We assign them to hot spots with marginal Fermi liquid character
inducing high antiferromagnetic and pairing susceptibilities. The outer hole pocket, with Fe
$3d_{xy}$ orbital character, has a reduced but still linear in energy scattering rate. Finally,
we assign sections on the middle hole pockets with Fe $3d_{xz,yz}$ orbital character and on the electron
pockets with Fe $3d_{xy}$ orbital character to cold spots because there we observe a quadratic-in-energy
scattering rate with Fermi-liquid behavior. These cold spots prevail the transport properties.
Our results indicate a strong $\it{momentum}$ dependence of the scattering rates. We also have
indications that the scattering rates in correlated systems are fundamentally different from
those in non-correlated materials because in the former the Pauli principle is not operative. We
compare our results for the scattering rates with combined density functional plus dynamical mean-field
theory calculations. The work provides a generic microscopic understanding of macroscopic properties
of multiorbital unconventional superconductors.
