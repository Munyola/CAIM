Synthetic microswimmers mimicking biological movements at the microscale have been developed
in recent years. Actuating helical magnetic materials with a homogeneous rotating magnetic field
is one of the most widespread techniques for propulsion at the microscale, partly because the actuation
strategy revolves around a simple linear relationship between the actuating field frequency and
the propeller velocity. However, the full control of the swimmers' motion has remained a challenge.
Increasing the controllability of micropropellers is crucial to achieve complex actuation schemes
that in turn are directly relevant for numerous applications. The simplicity of the linear relationship
though limits the possibilities and flexibilities of swarm control. Using a pool of randomly-shaped
magnetic microswimmers, we show that the complexity of shape can advantageously be translated
into enhanced control. In particular, directional reversal of sorted micropropellers is controlled
by the frequency of the actuating field. This directionality change is linked to the balance between
magnetic and hydrodynamic forces. We further show an example how this behavior can experimentally
lead to simple and effective sorting of individual swimmers from a group. The ability of these propellers
to reverse swimming direction solely by frequency increases the control possibilities and is an
example for propeller designs, where the complexity needed for many applications is embedded directly
in the propeller geometry rather than external factors such as actuation sequences.
