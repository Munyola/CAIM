The metastable 1$T'$ phase of layered transition metal dichalcogenides has recently attracted
considerable interest due to electronic properties, possible topological electronic phases
and catalytic activity. We report a comprehensive theoretical investigation of intrinsic point
defects in the 1$T'$ crystalline phase of single-layer molybdenum disulfide (1$T'$-MoS$_2$),
and provide comparison to the well-studied semiconducting 2$H$ phase. Based on density functional
theory calculations, we explore a large number of configurations of vacancy, adatom and antisite
defects and analyse their atomic structure, thermodynamic stability, electronic and magnetic
properties. The emerging picture suggests that, under thermodynamic equilibrium, 1$T'$-MoS$_2$
is more prone to hosting lattice imperfections than the 2$H$ phase. More specifically, our findings
reveal that the S atoms that are closer to the Mo atomic plane are the most reactive sites. Similarly
to the 2$H$ phase, S vacancies and adatoms in 1$T'$-MoS$_2$ are very likely to occur while Mo adatoms
and antisites induce local magnetic moments. Contrary to the 2$H$ phase, Mo vacancies in 1$T'$-MoS$_2$
are expected to be an abundant defect due to the structural relaxation that plays a major role in lowering
the defect formation energy. Overall, our study predicts that the realization of high-quality
flakes of 1$T'$-MoS$_2$ should be carried out under very careful laboratory conditions but at the
same time the facile defects introduction can be exploited to tailor physical and chemical properties
of this polymorph.
