Single-layer pentagonal materials are an emerging family of two-dimensional (2D) materials that
could exhibit novel properties due to the building blocks being pentagons instead of hexagons as
in numerous 2D materials. Based on our recently predicted single-layer pentagonal CoS$_2$ that
is an antiferromagnetic (AFM) semiconductor, we replace two S atoms by As atoms in a unit cell to form
single-layer pentagonal CoAsS. The resulting single-layer material is dynamically stable ac-cording
to the phonon calculations. We find two drastic changes in the properties of single-layer pentagonal
CoAsS in comparison with those of CoS$_2$. First, we find a magnetic transition from the AFM to FM
ordering. We understand that the transition is caused by the lower electronegativity of As atoms,
leading to the weakened bridging roles on the superexchange interactions be-tween Co ions. Single-layer
pentagonal CoAsS also shows significantly stronger magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy due
to stronger spin-orbit coupling. We additionally perform Monte Carlo simulations to calculate
the Curie temperature of single-layer pentagonal CoAsS and the predicted Curie temperature is
103 K. Second, we find that single-layer pentagonal CoAsS exhibits piezoelectricity, which is
absent in single-layer pentagonal CoS$_2$ due to its center of symmetry. The computed piezoelectric
coefficients are also sizable. The rare coexistence of FM ordering and piezoelectric properties
makes single-layer pentagonal CoAsS a promising multifunctional 2D material.
