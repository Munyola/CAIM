The development of electronic devices, especially those which involve heterogeneous integration
of materials, has led to increased challenges in addressing their thermal operational temperature
demands. The heat flow in these systems is significantly influenced or even dominated by thermal
boundary resistance (TBR) that exists at the interface between dissimilar materials found in their
device architecture. Recently, it has been shown that selective patterning of features at an interface
can greatly impact the TBR. However, a good understanding of interface features affecting material
growth and subsequently heat transport across the interface and the adjacent materials is still
lacking. Our work addresses this gap and experimentally demonstrates a link between nanopatterned
interfaces and TBR for Si-diamond interfaces. Moreover, we find that this interfacial patterning
influences both the TBR as well as the texture of the diamond grown on the interface by chemical vapor
deposition. It was found that the preferred microstructural orientation can also lead to an enhancement
in thermal properties. Through these experiments, we observed the lowest diamond-silicon TBR
measured to date and a 28% increase in diamond thermal conductivity in 2-{\mu}m-thick films due
to the strong texturing induced in the diamond near the interface. These results show that through
the judicious selection of interfacial patterns, it is possible to create multiple synergistic
effects that result in an overall reduction in thermal resistance in heterogeneously integrated
electronics that involve polycrystalline materials.
