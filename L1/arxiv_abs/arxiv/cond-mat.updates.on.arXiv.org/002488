Perovskite oxynitrides are a promising class of material for photocatalytic water-splitting
due to their small band gaps and suitably aligned band edges. Recently, epitaxially strained oxynitrides
started to attract interest due to the possibility to engineer the anion order and ferroelectric
distortions. However, contrary to oxides there have been no studies on the band-gap evolution in
oxynitrides with epitaxial strain. Here, we investigate, using density functional theory calculations,
the influence of epitaxial strain on the band gap of two different oxynitrides and compare our results
with oxides. As opposed to cubic oxides, where both compressive and tensile strain narrow the band-gap,
we find that the anion order leads to non-degenerate N \textit{2p} bands already at zero strain,
which leads to opposite and anion order-dependent evolutions of the band gap under compressive
and tensile strain. Further, we find that in oxynitrides polar distortions increase the band gap
by up to 1 eV for 4% strain whereas for oxides the increase is only about 0.1 eV for the same amount of
strain. The reason for this difference is the larger ionic radius of nitrogen leading to larger ferroelectric
distortions and a stronger dependence of the band gap on the distortions amplitude. These results
imply that ferroelectric distortions are strongly detrimental to light absorption and that their
suppression, for example above a critical temperature, should result in a marked decrease in band
gap and enhanced absorption of visible light.
