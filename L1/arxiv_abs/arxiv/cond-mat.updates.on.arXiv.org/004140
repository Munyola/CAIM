Defect engineering has been a powerful tool to enable the creation of exotic phases and the discovery
of intriguing phenomena in ferroelectric oxides. However, accurate control the concentration
of defects remains a big challenge. In this work, ion implantation, that can provide controllable
point defects, allows us the ability to produce a controlled defect-driven true super-tetragonal
(T) phase with enhanced tetragonality in ferroelectric BiFeO3 thin films. This point defect engineering
is found to drive the phase transition from the as-grown mixed rhombohedral-like (R) and tetragonal-like
(MC) phase to true tetragonal (T) symmetry. By further increasing the injected dose of He ion, we
demonstrate an enhanced tetragonality super-tetragonal (super-T) phase with the largest c/a
ratio (~ 1.3) that has ever been experimentally achieved in BiFeO3. A combination of morphology
change and domain evolution further confirm that the mixed R/MC phase structure transforms to the
single-domain-state true tetragonal phase. Moreover, the re-emergence of R phase and in-plane
stripe nanodomains after heat treatment reveal the memory effect and reversible phase transition.
Our findings demonstrate the control of R-Mc-T-super T symmetry changes and the creation of true
T phase BiFeO3 with enhanced tetragonality through controllable defect engineering. This work
also provides a pathway to generate large tetragonality (or c/a ratio) that could be extended to
other ferroelectric material systems (such as PbTiO3, BaTiO3 and HfO2) which may lead to strong
polarization enhancement.
