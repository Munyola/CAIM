Unconventional superconductivity in Sr$_{2}$RuO$_{4}$ has been intensively studied for decades.
The origin and nature of the pairing continues to be widely debated, in particular, the possibility
of an odd parity origin of Cooper pairs, and the reason for the recent discovery that the critical
temperature increases with strain. Emergence of multiple low-energy scales, involving subtle
interplay among spin, charge and orbital degrees of freedom, calls for advanced theoretical approaches
which treat on equal footing all electronic effects and can overcome the limitations of minimal
model Hamiltonian based approaches. Such formulations generally assume planar superconductivity
topology, reflecting the 2D character of the electronic structure. Here we develop an alternative
approach, a detailed \emph{ab initio} theory, coupling quasiparticle self-consistent \emph{GW}
approximation with dynamical mean field theory (DMFT), including both local and non-local correlations.
We report that the superconducting order parameter has nodal lines along all three crystalline
directions. We identify a complex mechanism where charge fluctuations and spin fluctuations compete
to stabilize different pairing symmetries, with a relatively low associated critical temperature.
As moderate strain is applied, we observe a pathway toward harmonious interplay between spin and
charge in even-parity channel which leads to increment in $T_c$. At large strain, the spin fluctuations
become incoherent with formation of secondary incommensurate peaks and are detrimental to superconductivity.
