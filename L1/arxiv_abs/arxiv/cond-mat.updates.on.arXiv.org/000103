Several years back Angliker et al. [Chem. Phys. Lett. 87, 208 (1982)] predicted nonacene to be the
first linear acene with the triplet state 1^{3}B_{2u} as the ground state, instead of the singlet
1^{1}A_{g} state. However, contrary to that prediction, in a recent experimental work T\"onshoff
and Bettinger [Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 49, 4125 (2010)] demonstrated that nonacene has a singlet ground
state. Motivated by this experimental finding, we decided to perform a systematic theoretical
investigation of the triplet states of polyacenes, with an emphasis on singlet-triplet splitting,
starting from naphthalene, all the way up to decacene. Methodology adopted in our work is based upon
Pariser-Parr-Pople model (PPP) Hamiltonian, along with large-scale multi-reference singles-doubles
configuration interaction (MRSDCI) approach. Our results predict that the singlet-triplet gap
decreases with acene size and octacene onwards, it reaches saturation. Thus no singlet-triplet
crossover takes place in longer acenes and the ground state is of singlet multiplicity. We also analyze
the nature of many-particle wavefunction of the correlated singlet ground state and find that the
longer acenes exhibit tendency towards a open-shell singlet diradical ground state. Moreover,
when we compare the experimental absorption spectra of octacene and nonacene with their calculated
singlet and triplet absorption spectra, we observe very good agreement for the singlet case. Hence,
the optical absorption results also confirm the singlet nature of the ground state for longer acenes.
