Many physical properties of small organic molecules are dependent on the current crystal packing,
or polymorph, of the material, including bioavailability of pharmaceuticals, optical properties
of dyes, and charge transport properties of semiconductors. Predicting the most stable crystalline
form requires determining the crystalline form with the lowest relative Gibbs free energy. Effective
computational prediction of the most stable polymorph could save significant time and effort in
the design of novel molecular crystalline solids or predict their behavior under new conditions.
In this study, we introduce a new approach using multistate reweighting to address the problem of
determining solid-solid phase diagrams, and apply this approach to the phase diagram of solid benzene.
For this approach, we perform sampling at a selection of temperature and pressure states in the region
of interest. We use multistate reweighting methods to determine the reduced free energy differences
between $T$ and $P$ states within a given polymorph. The relative stability of the polymorphs at
the sampled states can be successively interpolated from these points to create the phase diagram
by combining these reduced free energy differences with a reference Gibbs free energy difference
between polymorphs. The method also allows for straightforward estimation of uncertainties in
the phase boundary. We also find that when properly implemented, multistate reweighting for phase
diagram determination scales better with size of system than previously estimated.
