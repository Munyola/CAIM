The mechanism responsible for the compaction of the genomic DNA of bacteria inside a structure called
the nucleoid is a longstanding but still lively debated question. Most puzzling is the fact that
the nucleoid occupies only a small fraction of the cell, although it is not separated from the rest
of the cytoplasm by any membrane and would occupy a volume about thousand times larger outside from
the cell. Here, by performing numerical simulations with coarse-grained models, we elaborate
on the conjecture that the formation of the nucleoid may result from a segregative phase separation
mechanism driven by the demixing of the DNA coil and non-binding globular macromolecules present
in the cytoplasm, presumably functional ribosomes. Simulations performed with crowders having
spherical, dumbbell or octahedral geometry highlight the sensitive dependence of the level of
DNA compaction on the dissymmetry of DNA/DNA, DNA/crowder, and crowder/crowder repulsive interactions,
thereby supporting the segregative phase separation scenario. Simulations also consistently
predict much stronger DNA compaction close to the jamming threshold. Moreover, simulations performed
with crowders of different sizes suggest that the final density distribution of each species results
from the competition between thermodynamic forces and steric hindrance, so that bigger crowders
are expelled selectively from the nucleoid only at moderate total crowder concentrations. This
work leads to several predictions, which may eventually be tested experimentally.
