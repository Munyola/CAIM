The unique physical and optical properties of nanoparticles make their reliable and rapid assembly
an important goal for nanotechnology. To this end, many competing driving forces have been targeted
to control the self-assembly, though issues with reliability and efficiency indicate that interfaces
on the nanoscale are not yet fully understood. In this letter we report for the first time that the
flow of water media from the interface between chemically nanopatterned hydrophobic surfaces
and adjacent hydrophilic regions (a Janus interface) can effectively be employed for rapid nanoparticle
assembly with single nanoparticle resolution. We find that the dewetting of water molecules from
this Janus interface drives the assembly of nanoparticles from electrostatically stabilised
nanoparticle colloids onto the hydrophobic areas, expedited by removing the resistance to adhesion
between wetted interfaces exerted by any hydration barrier, such that nanoparticle assembly is
achieved in under a minute. We call this method of controlled nanoparticle assembly Janus Interface
Nanoparticle Assembly - JINA. We then demonstrate control of this mechanism through pH switching
and prove its effectiveness for fabrication by rapidly creating single-nanoparticle sites and
single particle wide lines whilst simultaneously densely coating macro-scale features. Not only
does this assembly method have far-reaching implications in nanomanufacturing, the unanticipated
nature of this mechanism also challenges many commonly held assumptions about the interfacial
interactions of nanoparticle self-assembly.
