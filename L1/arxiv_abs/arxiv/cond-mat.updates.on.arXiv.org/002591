Introducing both the Berry curvature and chiral anomaly into the Landau's Fermi-liquid theory,
we investigate collective dynamics of Fermi-surface fluctuations and reveal their instabilities
in an interacting Weyl metal phase with broken time reversal symmetry. Based on the Boltzmann-equation
framework, we find criteria for the stability of the topological Fermi-liquid state as a function
of forward scattering Landau's interaction parameters and the distance of a pair of Weyl points
given by an external magnetic field. In addition to these instability criteria for general angular
momentum channels, we investigate the dispersion relation of the zero-sound mode as the simplest
example of such Fermi-surface fluctuations. Zero sound modes are well-defined collective excitations
in a Landau's Fermi-liquid state, given by the collective dynamics of Fermi-surface deformations
in the spin-singlet channel with zero angular momentum, where their instability is related with
phase separation. We find that the role of the Berry curvature changes the instability criteria
of the Landau's Fermi-liquid state. Even if the zero-sound mode is stable in the region of the forward-scattering
amplitude, the Berry curvature gives rise to Landau damping beyond the Landau's Fermi-liquid theory.
Based on the instability criterion of the zero-sound mode, we propose a phase diagram for a topological
Fermi-liquid state against the phase separation in the plane of Landau's interaction parameter
and effective Berry curvature, which generalizes the one-dimensional phase diagram of the Landau's
Fermi-liquid theory.
