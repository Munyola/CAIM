In order to understand superconductivity in low carrier density systems we have grown a high quality
single crystal of Lu$_3$Os$_4$Ge$_{13}$ by Czochralski method and studied its normal and superconducting
state properties. Lu$_3$Os$_4$Ge$_{13}$ crystallizes in cubic crystal structure with the space
group $\it{Pm3n}$. Lu$_3$Os$_4$Ge$_{13}$ is a low carrier density superconductor ($n\approx10^{18}/cm^3$)
as determined by the electrical transport, magnetization, heat capacity and hall effect measurements.
The measurements confirm that Lu$_3$Os$_4$Ge$_{13}$ is a type-II superconductor ($T{_c} =3.1$~K)
and exhibits anomalous superconducting properties. The analysis of the heat capacity below $T{_c}$
and reduced heat capacity jump at $T{_c}$ suggest that Lu$_3$Os$_4$Ge$_{13}$ is a moderately coupled
multi-band BCS superconductor. The dc-magnetization ($M-H$) study shows a large reversible region
in the superconducting mixed state. This reversible region consists of unpinned vortices in the
magnetic phase diagram, similar to what is known as the vortex liquid phase in high-$T{_c}$ superconductors.
The estimation of the Ginzburg number $G_{i}$ suggests that the thermal fluctuations may not play
an important role in the unpinning of the vortices in this compound. The thermopower measurements
show a large phonon drag effect at low temperatures. The electronic band structure calculations
show a multi-valley type band structure and a complex Fermi surface in Lu$_3$Os$_4$Ge$_{13}$,
making it a possible candidate to observe a magnetic field induced triplet superconductivity at
ultra-low temperatures.
