We address a three-dimensional, coarse-grained description of dislocation networks at grain
boundaries between rotated crystals. The so-called amplitude expansion of the phase-field crystal
model is exploited with the aid of Finite Element Method calculations. This approach allows for
the description of microscopic features, such as dislocations, while simultaneously being able
to describe length scales that are orders of magnitude larger than the lattice spacing. Moreover,
it allows for the direct description of extended defects by means of a scalar order parameter. The
versatility of this framework is shown by considering both fcc and bcc lattice symmetries and different
rotation axes. First, the specific case of planar, twist grain boundaries is illustrated. The details
of the method are reported and the consistency of the results with literature is discussed. Then,
the dislocation networks forming at the interface between a spherical, rotated crystal embedded
in an unrotated crystalline structure, are shown. Although explicitly accounting for dislocations
which lead to an anisotropic shrinkage of the rotated grain, the extension of the spherical grain
boundary is found to decrease linearly over time in agreement with the classical theory of grain
growth and recent atomistic investigations. It is shown that the results obtained for a system with
bcc symmetry agree very well with existing results, validating the methodology. Conversely, fully
original results are shown for fcc lattice symmetry, revealing the generality of the reported observations.
