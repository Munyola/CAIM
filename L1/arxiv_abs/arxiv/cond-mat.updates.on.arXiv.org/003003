In insulating materials with ordered magnetic spiral phases, ferroelectricity can emerge due
to the breaking of inversion symmetry. This property is of both fundamental and practical interest,
in particular with a view to exploiting it in low-power electronic devices. Advances towards technological
applications have been hindered, however, by the relatively low ordering temperatures $T_\mathrm{spiral}$
of most magnetic spiral phases, which rarely exceed 100 K. We have recently established that the
ordering temperature of a magnetic spiral can be increased up to 310 K by the introduction of chemical
disorder. Here we explore the design space opened up by this novel mechanism by combining it with
a targeted lattice control of some magnetic interactions. In Cu-Fe layered perovskites we obtain
$T_\mathrm{spiral}$ values close to 400 K, comfortably far from room temperature and almost 100
K higher than using chemical disorder alone. Moreover, we reveal a linear, universal relationship
between the spiral's wave vector and the onset temperature of the spiral phase. This linear law ends
at a paramagnetic-collinear-spiral triple point, which defines the highest spiral ordering temperature
that can be achieved in this class of materials. Based on these findings, we propose a general set
of rules for designing magnetic spirals in layered perovskites using external pressure, chemical
substitutions and/or epitaxial strain, which should guide future efforts to engineer magnetic
spiral phases with ordering temperatures suitable for technological applications.
