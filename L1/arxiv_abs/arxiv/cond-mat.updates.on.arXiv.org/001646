We report $^{139}$La and $^{63}$Cu NMR investigation of the successive charge order, spin order,
and superconducting transitions in super-oxygenated La$_2$CuO$_{4+y}$ single crystal with
stage-4 excess oxygen order at $T_{stage}\simeq 290$ K. We show that the stage-4 order induces tilting
of CuO$_6$ octahedra below $T_{stage}$, which in turn causes $^{139}$La NMR line broadening. The
structural distortion continues to develop far below $T_{stage}$, and completes at $T_{charge}\simeq
60$ K, where charge order sets in. This sequence is reminiscent of the the charge order transition
in Nd co-doped La$_{1.88}$Sr$_{0.12}$CuO$_4$ that sets in once the low temperature tetragonal
(LTT) phase is established. We also show that the paramagnetic $^{63}$Cu NMR signals are progressively
wiped out below $T_{charge}$ due to enhanced low frequency spin fluctuations, but the residual
$^{63}$Cu NMR signals continue to exhibit the characteristics expected for optimally doped superconducting
CuO$_2$ planes. This indicates that charge order in La$_2$CuO$_{4+y}$ does not take place uniformly
in space. Low frequency Cu spin fluctuations as probed by $^{139}$La nuclear spin-lattice relaxation
rate are mildly glassy, and do not exhibit critical divergence at $T_{spin}$($\simeq T_{c}$)=42
K. These findings, including the spatially inhomogeneous nature of the charge ordered state, are
qualitatively similar to the case of La$_{1.885}$Sr$_{0.115}$CuO$_4$ [T. Imai et al., Phys. Rev.
B 96 (2017) 224508, and A. Arsenault et al., Phys. Rev. B (submitted)], but both charge and spin order
take place more sharply in the present case.
