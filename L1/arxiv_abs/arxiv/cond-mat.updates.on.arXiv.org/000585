We study the local equilibrium properties of two-dimensional electron gases at high magnetic fields
in the presence of random smooth electrostatic disorder, Rashba spin-orbit coupling, and the Zeeman
interaction. Using a systematic magnetic length ($l_B$) expansion within a Green's function framework
we derive quantum functionals for the local spin-resolved particle and current densities which
can be useful for future studies combining disorder and mean-field electron-electron interaction
in the quantum Hall regime. We point out that the spin polarization presents a peculiar spatial dependence
which can be used to determine the strength of the Rashba coupling by local probes. The spatial structure
of the current density, consisting of both compressible and incompressible contributions, also
essentially reflects the effects of Rashba spin-orbit interaction on the energy spectrum. We show
that in the semiclassical limit $l_B \rightarrow 0$ the local Hall conductivity remains, however,
still quantized in units of $e^2/h$ for any finite strength of the spin-orbit interaction. In contrast,
it becomes half-integer quantized when the latter is infinite, a situation which corresponds to
a disordered topological insulator surface consisting of a single Dirac cone. Finally, we argue
how to define at high magnetic fields a spin Hall conductivity related to a dissipationless angular
momentum flow, which is characterized by a sequence of plateaus as a function of the inverse magnetic
field (thus free of resonances).
