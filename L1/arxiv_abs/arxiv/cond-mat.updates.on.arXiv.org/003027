Recent experiments [arXiv: 1808.07865] on twisted bilayer graphene (TBLG) show that under hydrostatic
pressure, an insulating state at quarter-filling of the moir\'e superlattice (i.e., one charge
per supercell) emerges, in sharp contrast with the previous ambient pressure measurements of Cao
et al. where the quarter--filling state (QFS) is a metal [Nature 556, 43 & 80 (2018)]. In fact, the
insulating state at the other commensurate fillings of two and three charges per supercell is also
enhanced under applied pressure. Based on realistic computations of the band structure for TBLG
which show that the bandwidth first shrinks and then expands with increasing hydrostatic pressure,
we compute the ratio of the potential to the kinetic energy, $r_s$. We find an experimentally relevant
window of pressure for which $r_s$ crosses the threshold for a triangular Wigner crystal, thereby
corroborating our previous work [Nano Lett. (2018)] that the insulating states in TBLG are due to
Wigner rather than Mott physics. A key prediction of this work is that the window for the onset of the
hierarchy of Wigner states that obtains at commensurate fillings is dome-shaped as a function of
the applied pressure, which can be probed experimentally. Theoretically, we find a peak for crystallization
around $1.5$ GPa relative to the experimental optimal pressure of $1.33$ GPa for the observation
of the insulating states. Consequently, TBLG provides a new platform for the exploration of Wigner
physics and its relationship with superconductivity.
