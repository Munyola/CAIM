We present simulation results and an explanatory theory on how antagonistic salts affect the spinodal
decomposition of binary fluid mixtures. We find that spinodal decomposition is arrested and complex
structures form only when electrostatic ion-ion interactions are small. In this case fluid and
ion concentrations couple and the charge field can be approximated as a polynomial function of the
relative fluid concentrations alone. When the solvation energy associated with transfering an
ion from one fluid phase to the other is of the order of a few k_BT, the coupled fluid and charge fields
evolve according to the Ohta-Kawasaki free energy functional. This allows us to accurately predict
structure sizes and reduce the parameter space to two dimensionless numbers. The lamellar structures
induced by the presence of antagonistic salt in our simulations exhibit a high degree of nematic
ordering and the growth of ordered domains over time seems to follow a power law. This power law carries
a time exponent proportional to the salt concentration. We reproduce and interpret neutron scattering
data from previous experiments of similar systems. The dissolution of structures at high salt concentrations
observed in these experiments agrees with our simulations and we explain it as the result of a vanishing
surface tension due to electrostatic contributions. We conclude by presenting preliminary 3D
results showing the same morphologies as predicted by the Ohta-Kawasaki model as a function of volume
fraction and suggesting that our findings from 2D systems remain valid in 3D.
