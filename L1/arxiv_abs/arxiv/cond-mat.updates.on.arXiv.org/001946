Experimental studies of the variation of the mean square displacement (MSD) of a particle in a confined
colloid suspension that exhibits density variations on the scale length of the particle diameter
are not in agreement with the prediction that the spatial variation in MSD should mimic the spatial
variation in density. The predicted behavior is derived from the expectation that the MSD of a particle
depends on the system density and the assumption that the force acting on a particle is a point function
of position. The experimental data come from studies of the MSDs of particles in narrow ribbon channels
and between narrowly spaced parallel plates, and from new data, reported herein, of the radial and
azimuthal MSDs of a colloid particle in a dense colloid suspension confined to a small circular cavity.
In each of these geometries a dense colloid suspension exhibits pronounced density oscillations
with spacing of a particle diameter. We remove the discrepancy between prediction and experiment
using the Fisher-Methfessel interpretation of how local equilibrium in an inhomogeneous system
is maintained to argue that the force acting on a particle is delocalized over a volume with radius
equal to a particle diameter. Our interpretation has relevance to the relationship between the
scale of inhomogeneity and the utility of translation of the particle MSD into a position dependent
diffusion coefficient, and to the use of a spatially dependent diffusion coefficient to describe
mass transport in a heterogeneous system.
