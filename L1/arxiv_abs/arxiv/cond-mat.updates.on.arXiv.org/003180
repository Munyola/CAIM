In this paper, a finite-volume discrete unified gas kinetic scheme (DUGKS) based on the non-gray
phonon transport model is developed for multiscale heat transfer problem with arbitrary temperature
difference. Under large temperature difference, the phonon Boltzmann transport equation (BTE)
is essentially multiscale, not only in the frequency space, but also in the spatial space. In order
to realize the efficient coupling of the multiscale phonon transport, the phonon scattering and
advection are coupled together in the present scheme on the reconstruction of the distribution
function at the cell interface. The Newtonian method is adopted to solve the nonlinear scattering
term for the update of the temperature at both the cell center and interface. In addition, the energy
at the cell center is updated by a macroscopic equation instead of taking the moment of the distribution
function, which enhances the numerical conservation. Numerical results of the cross-plane heat
transfer prove that the present scheme can describe the multiscale heat transfer phenomena accurately
with arbitrary temperature difference in a wide range. In the diffusive regime, even if the time
step is larger than the relaxation time, the present scheme can capture the transient thermal transport
process accurately. Compared to that under small temperature differences, as the temperature
difference increases, the variation of the temperature distribution behaves quite differently
and the average temperature in the domain increases in the ballistic regime but decreases in the
diffusive regime.
