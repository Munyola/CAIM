The complex structure and magnetism of Pr$_{2-x}$Bi$_x$Ru$_2$O$_7$ was investigated by neutron
scattering and EXAFS. Pr has an approximate doublet ground-state and the first excited state is
a singlet. This overall crystal field level scheme is similar to metallic Pr$_2$Ir$_2$O$_7$, which
is also reported here. While the B-site (Ru) is well ordered throughout, this is not the case for the
A-site (Pr/Bi). A distribution of the Pr-O2 bond length indicates the Pr environment is not uniform
even for $x=0$. The Bi environment is highly disordered ostensibly due to the 6s lone pairs on Bi$^{3+}$.
Correspondingly we find the non-Kramers doublet ground state degeneracy otherwise anticipated
for Pr in the pyrochlore structure is lifted so as to produce a quadrupolar singlet ground state with
a spatially varying energy gap. For $x=0$, below T$_N$, the Ru sublattice orders antiferromagnetically,
with propagation vector \textbf{k}= (0,0,0), as for Y$_2$Ru$_2$O$_7$. No ordering associated
with the Pr sublattice is observed down to 100 mK. The low energy magnetic response of Pr$_{2-x}$Bi$_x$Ru$_2$O$_7$
features a broad spectrum of magnetic excitations associated with inhomogeneous splitting of
the Pr quasi-doublet ground state. For $x=0$ ($x=0.97$) the spectrum is temperature dependent
(independent). It appears disorder associated with Bi alloying enhances the inhomogeneous Pr
crystal field level splitting so that inter-site interactions become irrelevant for $x=0.97$.
The structural complexity for the A-site may be reflected in the hysteretic uniform magnetization
of B-site ruthenium in the N\'{e}el phase.
