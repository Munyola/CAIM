Quantum error correction was invented to allow for fault-tolerant quantum computation. Topological
ordered systems turned out to give a natural physical realization of quantum error correcting codes
(QECC) in their grounspaces. More recently, in the context of the AdS/CFT correspondence, it has
been argued that eigenstates of CFTs with a holographic dual should also form QECCs. These two examples
lead to the question of how generally do eigenstates of many-body models form quantum codes. In this
work we establish new connections between quantum chaos and translation-invariance in many-body
spin systems, on one hand, and approximate quantum error correcting codes (AQECC), on the other
hand. We first observe that quantum chaotic systems exhibiting the Eigenstate Thermalization
Hypothesis (ETH) have eigenstates forming quantum error-correcting codes. Then we show that AQECC
can be obtained probabilistically from the spectrum of every translation-invariant spin chains,
even for integrable models, by taking translation-invariant energy eigenstates. Applying this
result to 1D classical systems, we show that local symmetries can be used to construct parent Hamiltonians
which embed these codes into the low-energy subspace of gapless 1D spin chains. As explicit examples
we obtain local AQECC in the ground space of the 1D ferromagnetic Heisenberg model and the Motzkin
spin chain model with periodic boundary conditions, thereby yielding non-stabilizer codes in
the ground space and low energy subspace of physically plausible 1D gapless models.
