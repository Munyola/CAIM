The exchange of energy between a classical open system and its environment can be analysed for a single
run of an experiment using the phase space trajectory of the system. By contrast, in the quantum regime
such energy exchange processes must be defined for an {\it ensemble} of runs of the same experiment
based on the reduced system density matrix. Single-shot approaches have been proposed for quantum
systems that are weakly coupled to a heat bath. However, a single-shot analysis for a quantum system
that is entangled or strongly interacting with external degrees of freedom has not been attempted
because no system wave function exists for such a system within the standard formulation of quantum
theory. Using the notion of the {\it conditional} wave function of a quantum system, we derive here
an exact formula for the rate of total energy change in an open quantum system, valid for arbitrary
coupling between the system and the environment. In particular, this allows us to identify three
distinct contributions to the total energy flow: an external contribution coming from the explicit
time dependence of the Hamiltonian, an interaction contribution associated with the interaction
part of the Hamiltonian, and an entanglement contribution, directly related to the presence of
entanglement between the system and its environment. Given the close connection between weak values
and the conditional wave function, the approach presented here provides a new avenue for experimental
studies of energy fluctuations in open quantum systems.
