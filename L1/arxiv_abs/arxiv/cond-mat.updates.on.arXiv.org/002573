We consider the scaling behavior of thermodynamic quantities in the one-dimensional transverse-field
Ising model near its quantum critical point (QCP). Our study has been motivated by the question about
the thermodynamical signatures of this paradigmatic quantum critical system and, more generally,
by the issue of how quantum criticality accumulates entropy. We find that the crossovers in the phase
diagram of temperature and (the non-thermal control parameter) transverse field obey a general
scaling ansatz, and so does the critical scaling behavior of the specific heat and magnetic expansion
coefficient. Furthermore, the Gr\"{u}neisen ratio diverges in a power-law way when the QCP is accessed
as a function of the transverse field at zero temperature, which follows the prediction of quantum
critical scaling. However, at the critical field, upon decreasing the temperature, the Gr\"uneisen
ratio approaches a constant instead of showing the expected divergence. We are able to understand
this unusual result in terms of a peculiar form of the quantum critical scaling function for the free
energy; the contribution to the Gr\"uneisen ratio vanishes at the linear order in a suitable Taylor
expansion of the scaling function. In spite of this special form of the scaling function, we show
that the entropy is still maximized near the QCP, as expected from the general scaling argument.
Our results establish the telltale thermodynamic signature of a transverse-field Ising chain,
and will thus facilitate the experimental identification of this model quantum-critical system
in real materials.
