Residual stress is ubiquitous and indispensable in most biological and artificial materials,
where it sustains and optimizes many biological and functional mechanisms. The theory of volume
growth, starting from a stress-free initial state, is widely used to explain the creation and evolution
of growth-induced residual stress and the resulting changes in shape, and to model how growing bio-tissues
such as arteries and solid tumors develop a strategy of pattern creation according to geometrical
and material parameters. This modelling provides promising avenues for designing and directing
some appropriate morphology of a given tissue or organ and achieve some targeted biomedical function.
In this paper, we rely on a modified, augmented theory to reveal how we can obtain growth-induced
residual stress and pattern evolution of a layered artery by starting from an existing, non-zero
initial residual stress state. We use experimentally determined residual stress distributions
of aged bi-layered human aortas and quantify their influence by a magnitude factor. Our results
show that initial residual stress has a more significant impact on residual stress accumulation
and the subsequent evolution of patterns than geometry and material parameters. Additionally,
we provide an essential explanation for growth-induced patterns driven by differential growth
coupled to an initial residual stress. Finally, we show that initial residual stress is a readily
available way to control growth-induced pattern creation for tissues and thus may provide a promising
inspiration for biomedical engineering.
