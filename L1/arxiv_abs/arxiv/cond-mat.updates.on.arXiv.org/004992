The last decade has witnessed a swiftly increasing interest in the design and production of novel
multivalent molecules as powerful alternatives for conventional antibodies in the fight against
cancer and infectious diseases. However, while it is widely accepted that large-scale flexibility
($10-100$ nm) and free/constrained dynamics (100 ns $- \mu$s) control the activity of such novel
molecules, computational strategies at the mesoscale still lag behind experiments in optimizing
the design of crucial features, such as the binding cooperativity (a.k.a. avidity). In this study,
we introduced different coarse-grained models of a polymer-linked, two-nanobody composite molecule,
with the aim of laying down the physical bases of a thorough computational drug design protocol at
the mesoscale. We show that the calculation of suitable potentials of mean force allows one to apprehend
the nature, range and strength of the thermodynamic forces that govern the motion of free and wall-tethered
molecules. Furthermore, we develop a simple computational strategy to quantify the encounter/dissociation
dynamics between the free end of a wall-tethered molecule and the surface, at the roots of binding
cooperativity. This procedure allows one to pinpoint the role of internal flexibility and weak
non-specific interactions on the kinetic constants of the NB-wall encounter and dissociation.
Finally, we quantify the role and weight of rare events, which are expected to play a major role in
real-life situations, such as in the immune synapse, where the binding kinetics is likely dominated
by fluctuations.
