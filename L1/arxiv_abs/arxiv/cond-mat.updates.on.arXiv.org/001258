Weyl nodes have been realized experimentally in photonic, electronic, and phononic crystals.
However, magnonic Weyl nodes have not been experimentally verified. Unfortunately, the existing
theoretical predictions of Weyl magnon nodes in pyrochlore (anti)ferromagnets involve nodes
at high energy above the lowest excitation possibly prohibiting an experimental observation due
to the population effect of bosonic quasiparticles in the lowest excitation at low temperatures.
In this paper, we propose an experimentally accessible Weyl magnon nodes in the stacked frustrated
noncoplanar kagome antiferromagnets as realized in various real materials. In stark contrast
to the existing predictions, the present Weyl nodes do not rely on time-reversal symmetry breaking
by the magnetic order, rather they result from explicit macroscopically broken time reversal symmetry
by the scalar spin chirality of noncoplanar spin textures, and can be generalized to chiral spin
liquid states. The scalar spin chirality gives a real space Berry curvature which is not available
in other systems. We show the existence of magnon arc surface states connecting projected Weyl magnon
nodes on the surface Brillouin zone. Most importantly, the Weyl nodes occur at the lowest excitation
and carry the dominant contribution to the topological (anomalous) thermal Hall effect. We also
uncover the first realization of triply degenerate nodal-line magnons when the scalar spin chirality
is zero and the out-of-plane Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction is nonzero.
