Recent technological development has enabled researchers to study social phenomena scientifically
in detail and financial markets has particularly attracted physicists since the Brownian motion
has played the key role as in physics. In our previous report (arXiv:1703.06739; to appear in Phys.
Rev. Lett.), we have presented a microscopic model of trend-following high-frequency traders
(HFTs) and its theoretical relation to the dynamics of financial Brownian motion, directly supported
by a data analysis of tracking trajectories of individual HFTs in a financial market. Here we show
the mathematical foundation for the HFT model paralleling to the traditional kinetic theory in
statistical physics. We first derive the time-evolution equation for the phase-space distribution
for the HFT model exactly, which corresponds to the Liouville equation in conventional analytical
mechanics. By a systematic reduction of the Liouville equation for the HFT model, the Bogoliubov-Born-Green-Kirkwood-Yvon
hierarchal equations are derived for financial Brownian motion. We then derive the Boltzmann-like
and Langevin-like equations for the order-book and the price dynamics by making the assumption
of molecular chaos. The qualitative behavior of the model is asymptotically studied by solving
the Boltzmann-like and Langevin-like equations for the large number of HFTs, which is numerically
validated through the Monte-Carlo simulation. Our kinetic description highlights the parallel
mathematical structure between the financial Brownian motion and the physical Brownian motion.
