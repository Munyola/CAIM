The charge-density-wave (CDW) instability in the underdoped, pseudogap part of the cuprate phase
diagram has been a major recent research focus, yet measurements of dynamic, energy-resolved CDW
correlations are still in their infancy. We report a high-resolution resonant inelastic X-ray
scattering (RIXS) study of the underdoped cuprate superconductor HgBa$_{2}$CuO$_{4+\delta}$
($T_c = 70$ K). At $T=250$ K, above the CDW order temperature $T_\mathrm{CDW} \approx 200$ K, we observe
significant dynamic CDW correlations at about 40 meV. This energy scale is comparable to both the
superconducting gap and the previously reported low-energy pseudogap. At $T = T_c$, a strong elastic
CDW peak appears, but the dynamic correlations around 40 meV remain virtually unchanged. In addition,
we observe a new feature: dynamic correlations at significantly higher energy, with a characteristic
scale of about 160 meV. A similar scale was previously identified in other experiments as a high-energy
pseudogap. The existence of three distinct features in the charge response is highly unusual for
a CDW system, and suggests that charge order in the cuprates is closely related to the pseudogap phenomenon
and more complex than previously thought. We further observe the paramagnon dispersion along [1,0],
across the two-dimensional CDW wavevector $\boldsymbol{q}_\mathrm{CDW}$, which is consistent
with magnetic excitations measured by inelastic neutron scattering. Unlike for some other cuprates,
our results point to the absence of a discernible coupling between CDW and magnetic excitations.
