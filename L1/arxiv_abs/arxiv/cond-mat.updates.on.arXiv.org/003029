Self-assembly is the autonomous organization of components into patterns or structures: an essential
ingredient of biology and a desired route to complex organization. At equilibrium, the structure
is encoded through specific interactions, at an unfavorable entropic cost for the system. An alternative
approach, widely used by Nature, uses energy input to bypass the entropy bottleneck and develop
features otherwise impossible at equilibrium. Dissipative building blocks that inject energy
locally were made available by recent advance in colloidal science but have not been used to control
self-assembly. Here we show the robust formation of self-powered rotors and dynamical superstructures
from active particles and harness non-equilibrium phoretic phenomena to tailor interactions
and direct self-assembly. We use a photoactive component that consumes fuel, hematite, to devise
phototactic microswimmers that form self-spinning microgears following spatiotemporal light
patterns. The gears are coupled via their chemical clouds and constitute the elementary bricks
of synchronized superstructures, which autonomously regulate their dynamics. The results are
quantitatively rationalized on the basis of a stochastic description of diffusio-phoretic oscillators
dynamically coupled by chemical gradients to form directional interactions. Our findings demonstrate
that non-equilibrium phenomena can be harnessed to shape interactions and program hierarchical
constructions. It lays the groundwork for the self-assembly of dynamical architectures and synchronized
micro-machinery.
