The magnetoelectric coupling, i.e., cross-correlation between electric and magnetic orders,
is a very desirable property to combine functionalities of materials for next-generation switchable
devices. Multiferroics with spin-driven ferroelectricity presents such a mutual interaction
concomitant with magneto- and electro-active excitations called electromagnons. TbMnO3 is a
paradigmatic material in which two electromagnons have been observed in the cycloidal magnetic
phase. However, their observation in TbMnO3 is restricted to the cycloidal spin phase and magnetic
ground states that can support the electromagnon excitation are still under debate. Here, we show
by performing Raman spectroscopy measurements under pressure that the lower-energy electromagnon
(4 meV) disappears when the ground state enters from a cycloidal phase to an antiferromagnetic phase
(E-type). On the contrary, the magnetoelectric activity of the higher-energy electromagnon (8
meV) increases in intensity by one order of magnitude. Using microscopic model calculations, we
demonstrate that the lowerenergy electromagnon, observed in the cycloidal phase, originates
from a higher harmonic of the magnetic cycloid, and we determine that the symmetric exchange-striction
mechanism is at the origin of the higher-energy electromagnon which survives even in the E-type
phase. The colossal enhancement of the electromagnon activity in TbMnO3 paves the way to use multiferroics
more efficiently for generation, conversion and control of spin waves in magnonic devices.
