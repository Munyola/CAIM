Fluids confined in nanopores exhibit properties different from the properties of the same fluids
in bulk, among these properties are the isothermal compressibility or elastic modulus. The modulus
of a fluid in nanopores can be extracted from ultrasonic experiments or calculated from molecular
simulations. Using Monte Carlo simulations in the grand canonical ensemble, we calculated the
modulus for liquid argon at its normal boiling point (87.3~K) adsorbed in model silica pores of two
different morphologies and various sizes. For spherical pores, for all the pore sizes (diameters)
exceeding 2~nm, we obtained a logarithmic dependence of fluid modulus on the vapor pressure. Calculation
of the modulus at saturation showed that the modulus of the fluid in spherical pores is a linear function
of the reciprocal pore size. The calculation of the modulus of the fluid in cylindrical pores appeared
too scattered to make quantitative conclusions. We performed additional simulations at higher
temperature (119.6~K), at which Monte Carlo insertions and removals become more efficient. The
results of the simulations at higher temperature confirmed both regularities for cylindrical
pores and showed quantitative difference between the fluid moduli in pores of different geometries.
Both of the observed regularities for the modulus stem from the Tait-Murnaghan equation applied
to the confined fluid. Our results, along with the development of the effective medium theories
for nanoporous media, set the groundwork for analysis of the experimentally-measured elastic
properties of fluid-saturated nanoporous materials.
