The superconductor to normal metal phase transition induced by the in-plane magnetic field is studied
in free-standing Pb(111) nanofilms. In such structures the energy quantization induced by the
confinement leads to a multiband character of the system which results in the so-called shape resonances
and the thickness-dependent oscillations of the critical field. First, we examine the influence
of the orbital effect on the critical magnetic field and show that the orbital term suppresses the
critical field (in comparison with the Pauli approximation) and reduces the amplitude of the thickness-dependent
critical field oscillations. We demonstrate that due to the orbital effect, the slope $H_{c,||}-T_c$
at $T_c(0)$ becomes finite and decreases with increasing film thickness in agreement with recent
experiments. The temperature $t^*$ at which the superconductor to normal metal phase transition
becomes of the first order is also reduced by the orbital effect. Next, we focus on the Fulde-Ferrel-Larkin-Ovchinnikov
(FFLO) phase and its interplay with the shape resonances as well as the influence of the multiband
effects on its stability. We show that the range of the magnetic field for which the FFLO state is stable
oscillates as a function of the film thickness with the phase shift equal to one half of the period
corresponding to the critical magnetic field oscillations. Moreover, the multiband effects lead
to a division of the FFLO phase stability region into subregions number of which depends on the number
of bands participating in the paired state.
