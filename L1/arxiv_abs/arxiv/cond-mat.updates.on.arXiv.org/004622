By tuning the angle between graphene layers to specific "magic angles" the lowest energy bands of
twisted bilayer graphene (TBLG) can be made flat. The flat nature of the bands favors the formation
of collective ground states and, in particular, TBLG has been shown to support superconductivity.
When the energy bands participating in the superconductivity are well-isolated, the superfluid
weight scales inversely with the effective mass of such bands. For flat-band systems one would therefore
conclude that even if superconducting pairing is present most of the signatures of the superconducting
state should be absent. This conclusion is at odds with the experimental observations for TBLG.
We calculate the superfluid weight for TBLG taking into account both the conventional contribution
and the contribution arising from the quantum geometry of the bands. We find that both contributions
are larger than one would expect treating the bands as well-isolated, that at the magic angle the
geometric contribution is larger than the conventional one, and that for small deviations away
from the magic angle the conventional contribution is larger than the geometric one. Our results
show that, despite the flatness of the bands the superfluid weight in TBLG is finite and consistent
with experimental observations. We also show how the superfluid weight can be tuned by varying the
chemical potential and the twist angle opening the possibility to tune the nature of the superconducting
transition between the standard BCS transition and the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition.
