The statistical effects of different conditions in physical vapor deposition, such as sputter
deposition, have on thin film morphology has long been the subject of interest. One notable effect
is that of column development due to differential chamber pressure in the well-known empirical
model called Thornton's Structure Zone Model. The model is qualitative in nature and theoretical
understanding with quantitative predictions of the morphology is still lacking due to, in part,
the absence of a quantitative description of the incident flux distribution on the growth front.
In this work, we propose an incident Gaussian flux model developed from a series of binary hard-sphere
collisions and simulate its effects using Monte Carlo methods and a solid-on-solid growth scheme.
We also propose an approximate cosine-power distribution for faster Monte Carlo sampling. With
this model, it is observed that higher chamber pressures widen the average deposition angle, and
similarly increase the growth of column diameters (or lateral correlation length) and the column-to-column
separation (film surface wavelength). We treat both the column diameter and the surface wavelength
as power laws. It is seen that both the column diameter exponent and the wavelength exponent are very
sensitive to changes in pressure for low pressures (0.13 Pa to 0.80 Pa); meanwhile both exponents
saturate for higher pressures (0.80 Pa to 6.7 Pa) around a value of 0.6. These predictions will serve
as guides to future experiments for quantitative description of film morphology under a wide range
of vapor pressure.
