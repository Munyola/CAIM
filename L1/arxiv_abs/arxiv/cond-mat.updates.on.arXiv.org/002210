Colloidal gels have unique mechanical and transport properties that stem from their bicontinous
nature, in which a colloidal network is intertwined with a viscous solvent, and have found numerous
applications in foods, cosmetics, construction materials, and for medical applications, such
as cartilage replacements. So far, our understanding of the process of colloidal gelation is limited
to long-time dynamical effects, where gelation is viewed as a phase separation process interrupted
by the glass transition. However, this picture neglects two important effects: the influence of
hydrodynamic interactions, and the emergence of mechanical stability. With confocal microscopy
experiments, here we successfully follow the entire process of gelation with a single-particle
resolution, yielding time-resolved measures of internal stress and viscoelasticity from the
very beginning of the aggregation process. First, we demonstrate that the incompressible nature
of a liquid component constrains the initial stage of phase separation, assisting the formation
of a percolated network. Then we show that this network is not mechanically stable and undergoes
rearrangements driven by self-generated internal stress. Finally, we show that mechanical metastability
is reached only after percolation of locally isostatic environments, proving isostaticity a necessary
condition for the stability and load bearing ability of gels rather than the glass transition. Our
work reveals the crucial roles of momentum conservation in gelation in addition to the conventional
purely out-of-equilibrium thermodynamic picture.
