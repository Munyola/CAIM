Using first principles calculations, we systematically study the elastic stiffness constants,
mechanical properties, elastic wave velocities, Debye temperature, melting temperature, and
specific heat of several thermodynamically stable crystal structures of Bi$_{x}$Sb$_{1-x}$
($0 < x < 1$) binaries, which are of great interest due to their numerous inherent rich properties,
such as thermoelectricity, thermomagnetic cooling, strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC) effects,
and topological features in the electronic bandstructure. We analyze the bulk modulus ($B$), Young's
modulus ($E$), shear modulus ($G$), $B/G$ ratio, and Poisson's ratio ($\nu$) as a function of the
Bi concentration in Bi$_{x}$Sb$_{1-x}$. The effect of SOC on above mentioned properties is further
investigated. In general, we observe that the SOC effects cause elastic softening in most of the
studied structures. Three monoclinic structures of Bi-Sb binaries are found to exhibit significantly
large auxeticity. The Debye temperature and the magnitude of the elastic wave velocities monotonically
decrease with increasing Bi-concentration. We also discuss the specific heat capacity versus
temperature data for all studied binaries. Our theoretical results are in excellent agreement
with the existing experimental and theoretical data. The comprehensive understanding of the material
properties such as hardness, mechanical strength, melting temperature, propagation of the elastic
waves, auxeticity, and heat capacity is vital for practical applications of the studied binaries.
