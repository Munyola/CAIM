It is well known that there are two methods for alignment of liquid crystals, namely: rubbing technology
and photoalignment technology. In this manuscript, on the basis of a considerably low-cost method
of laser-induced periodic surface structuring and further coating of polyimide film without any
machining or photoinduced processing, a new perspective method of the alignment of nematic liquid
crystals was proposed. By means of the periodic surface structuring method, with the usage of laser
scanning with femtosecond pulse, the nanostructures (ripples) with 1{\mu}m period of grooves
were received on Ti layer. The layer of the structured Ti was coated with oxidianiline-polyimide
film from DMF solution, with annealing of the polymer film followed. Aligning properties of periodic
structures of the layer of pure Ti and Ti coated by polyimide film without any further processing
were examined by using the method of combined twist LC cell. The dependence of the twist angle of LC
cell on the scanning speed of coating of ripples onto Ti layer was the focus of our studies as well.
The azimuthal anchoring energy of layers having the periodic structure Ti without and with polyimide
films was calculated. It was found that after the deposition of polyimide film, the gain effect of
the azimuthal anchoring energy of layer Ti with periodic structure is observed. The dependence
of anchoring energy on both the changing of scanning speed and intensity of laser beam during processing
of the Ti layer was studied too. Also, AFM study of aligning surfaces was carried out.
