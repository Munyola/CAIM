Motor proteins are active enzymatic molecules that drive a variety of biological processes, including
transfer of genetic information, cellular transport, cell motility and muscles contraction.
It is known that these biological molecular motors usually perform their cellular tasks by acting
collectively, and there are interactions between individual motors that specify the overall collective
behavior. One of the fundamental issues related to the collective dynamics of motor proteins is
the question if they function at stationary-state conditions. To investigate this problem, we
analyze a relaxation to the stationary state for the system of interacting molecular motors. Our
approach utilizes a recently developed theoretical framework, which views the collective dynamics
of motor proteins as a totally asymmetric simple exclusion process of interacting particles, where
interactions are taken into account via a thermodynamically consistent approach. The dynamics
of relaxation to the stationary state is analyzed using a domain-wall method that relies on a mean-field
description, which takes into account some correlations. It is found that the system quickly relaxes
for repulsive interactions, while attractive interactions always slow down reaching the stationary
state. It is also predicted that for some range of parameters the fastest relaxation might be achieved
for a weak repulsive interaction. Our theoretical predictions are tested with Monte Carlo computer
simulations. The implications of our findings for biological systems are briefly discussed.
