A system of confined charged electrons interacting via the long-range Coulomb interaction can
form a Wigner crystal due to their mutual repulsion. This happens when the potential energy of the
system dominates over its kinetic energy, i.e., at low temperatures for a classical system and at
low densities for a quantum one. At T=0, the system is governed by quantum mechanics, and hence, the
spatial density peaks associated with crystalline charge localization are sharpened in a lower
average density. Conversely, in the classical limit of high temperatures, the crystalline spatial
density peaks are suppressed (recovered) at a lower (higher) average density. In this paper, we
study those two limits separately using an exact diagonalization of small one-dimensional (1D)
systems and propose an approximate method to connect them into a unified effective phase diagram
for Wigner crystallization. The result is a qualitative quantum-classical crossover phase diagram
of an effective 1D Wigner crystal. We show that although such a 1D system is at best an effective crystal
with no true long-range order (and thus no real phase transition), the spatial density peaks associated
with the quasi-crystallization should be experimentally observable in a few-electron 1D system.
We find the effective crystalline structure slowly disappears with both the crossover average
density and crossover temperature for crystallization decreasing with increasing particle number,
consistent with the absence of any true long-range 1D order.
