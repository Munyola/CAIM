Polymer composites with thermally conductive nanoscale filler particles, such as graphene and
hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), are promising for certain heat transfer applications. While graphene-polymer
composites have been extensively investigated, studies on h-BN-polymer composites has been relatively
rare. In this paper, we use molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to study the interfacial thermal
conductance (ITC) involved in the h-BN-polymer composites. We first compare the ITC across h-BN/hexane
(C6H14) interfaces to that of graphene/hexane interfaces, where we found that the electrostatic
interaction due to the partial charge on h-BN atoms can play an important role in such interfacial
thermal transport. Based this finding, we further explore the thermal transport across different
h-BN interfaces, including h-BN/hexanamine (C6H13NH2), h-BN/hexanol (C6H13OH), h-BN/hexanoic
acid (C5H11COOH), where the increasingly polar molecules lead to systematic changes in the electrostatic
interactions between h-BN and polymers. Heat flux decomposition and atom number density calculations
are performed to understand the role of electrostatic interaction in thermal transport across
h-BN-polymer interfaces. It was observed that stronger electrostatic interactions across the
interfaces can help attract the polymer molecules closer to h-BN, and the reduced interface distance
leads to larger heat flux contributed from both van der Waals and electrostatic forces. These results
may provide useful information to guide the design of thermally conductive h-BN-polymer nanocomposites.
