We develop an effective field theory to study the large wavelength exchange spin-wave excitations
on honeycomb nanoribbons characterized by armchair boundaries and N\'eel state magnetic ordering.
Appropriate boundary conditions are derived by requiring that bulk and edge spins oscillate with
the same frequency for a given spin-wave eigenmode. A set of characteristic boundary equations,
common for bulk and edge spin-waves, are derived from the boundary conditions. The equations of
motion are then solved consistently with the characteristic boundary equation to determine the
propagating and evanescent exchange spin-wave modes on the honeycomb nanoribbon. We prove that
the bulk spin-wave spectrum is quantized due to the finite width of the nanoribbon. In a magnetically
isotropic nanoribbon, the Dirac cone is reduced to a single linear dispersion curve due to this quantization.
The number and wavelengths of allowed bulk modes are determined from the derived characteristic
boundary equations and found to depend on the finite width of the nanoribbon. Evanescent modes with
non-linear dispersion relations are obtained for anisotropic nanoribbons, even those with the
slightest anisotropy. The spatial variation of the evanescent exchange spin-waves amplitudes
across the finite width of the nanoribbon is found to be strongly dependent on the magnetic anisotropy
and the width of the nanoribbon. The magnetic anisotropy is also found to lift the degeneracy in the
allowed bulk modes. The developed approach is general and can be applied for nanoribbons with all
edge types and any magnetic ordering.
