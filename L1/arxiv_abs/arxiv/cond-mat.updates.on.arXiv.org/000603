Yield stress materials flow if a sufficiently large shear stress is applied. Although such materials
are ubiquitous and relevant for industry, there is no accepted microscopic description of how they
yield, even in the simplest situations where temperature is negligible and where flow inhomogeneities
such as shear bands or fractures are absent. Here we propose a scaling description of the yielding
transition in amorphous solids made of soft particles at zero temperature. Our description makes
a connection between the Herschel-Bulkley exponent characterizing the singularity of the flow
curve near the yield stress $\Sigma_c$, the statistics and length scale of avalanches of plasticity
at $\Sigma_c$, and the density $P(x)$ of soft spots, or shear transformation zones, as a function
of the stress increment $x$ beyond which they yield. We propose three scaling relations, and argue
that all exponents characterizing these properties can be expressed in terms of three exponents
$\theta$, $d_f$ and $z$, characterizing respectively the density of soft spots, the fractal dimension
of the avalanches, and their duration. Our description shares some similarity with the depinning
transition that occurs when an elastic manifold is driven through a random potential, but also presents
some striking differences. We test our three scaling relations in an elasto-plastic model, an automaton
model similar to those used in depinning, but with a different interaction kernel, and find satisfying
agreement with our predictions both in two and three dimensions.
