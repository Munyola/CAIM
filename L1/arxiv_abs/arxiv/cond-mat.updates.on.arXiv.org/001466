We determine the frequency dependence of the four independent Cartesian tensor elements of the
dielectric function for monoclinic symmetry Y$_2$SiO$_5$ using generalized spectroscopic ellipsometry
from 40-1200 cm$^{-1}$. Three different crystal cuts, each perpendicular to a principle axis,
are investigated. We apply our recently described augmentation of lattice anharmonicity onto
the eigendielectric displacement vector summation approach [A. Mock et al., Phys. Rev. B 95, 165202
(2017)], and we present and demonstrate the application of an eigendielectric displacement loss
vector summation approach with anharmonic broadening. We obtain excellent match between all measured
and model calculated dielectric function tensor elements and all dielectric loss function tensor
elements. We obtain 23 A$_{\mathrm{u}}$ and 22 B$_{\mathrm{u}}$ symmetry long wavelength active
transverse and longitudinal optical mode parameters including their eigenvector orientation
within the monoclinic lattice. We perform density functional theory calculations and obtain 23
A$_{\mathrm{u}}$ symmetry and 22 B$_{\mathrm{u}}$ transverse and longitudinal optical mode
parameters and their orientation within the monoclincic lattice. We compare our results from ellipsometry
and density functional theory and find excellent agreement. We also determine the static and above
reststrahlen spectral range dielectric tensor values and find a recently derived generalization
of the Lyddane-Sachs-Teller relation for polar phonons in monoclinic symmetry materials satisfied
[M. Schubert, Phys. Rev. Lett. 117, 215502 (2016)].
