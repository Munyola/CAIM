Optical excitation in the cuprates has been shown to induce transient superconducting correlations
above the thermodynamic transition temperature, $T_C$, as evidenced by the terahertz frequency
optical properties in the non-equilibrium state. In YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6+x}$ this phenomenon
has so far been associated with the nonlinear excitation of certain lattice modes and the creation
of new crystal structures. In other compounds, like La$_{2-x}$Ba$_x$CuO$_4$, similar effects
were reported also for excitation at near infrared frequencies, and were interpreted as a signature
of the melting of competing orders. However, to date it has not been possible to systematically tune
the pump frequency widely in any one compound, to comprehensively compare the frequency dependent
photo-susceptibility for this phenomenon. Here, we make use of a newly developed optical parametric
amplifier, which generates widely tunable high intensity femtosecond pulses, to excite YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6.5}$
throughout the entire optical spectrum (3 - 750 THz). In the far-infrared region (3 - 25 THz), signatures
of non-equilibrium superconductivity are induced only for excitation of the 16.4 THz and 19.2 THz
vibrational modes that drive $c$-axis apical oxygen atomic positions. For higher driving frequencies
(25 - 750 THz), a second weaker resonance is observed around the charge transfer band edge at ~350
THz. These observations highlight the importance of coupling to the electronic structure of the
CuO$_2$ planes, either mediated by a phonon or by charge transfer.
