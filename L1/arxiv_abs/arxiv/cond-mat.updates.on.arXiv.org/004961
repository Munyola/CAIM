Atomically thin films of Pb on Si(111) provide an experimentally tunable system comprising a highly
structured electronic density of states. The lifetime of excited electrons in these states is limited
by both electron-electron (e-e) and electron-phonon (e-ph) scattering. We employ the description
by a Master equation for the electronic occupation numbers to analyze the relative importance of
both scattering mechanisms. The electronic and phononic band structures, as well as the matrix
elements for electron-phonon coupling within deformation potential theory were obtained from
density functional calculations, thus taking into account quantum confinement effects. For the
relaxation dynamics, the contribution of impact ionization processes to the lifetime is estimated
from the imaginary part of the electronic self-energy calculated in the GW approximation. By numerically
solving rate equations for the occupations of the Pb-derived electronic states coupled to a phononic
heat bath, we are able to follow the distribution of the electronic excitation energy to the various
modes of Pb lattice vibrations. While e-e scattering is the dominant relaxation mechanism, we demonstrate
that the e-ph scattering is highly phonon-mode-specific, with a large contribution from surface
phonons. At electron energies of about 0.3eV above the Fermi surface, a 'phonon bottleneck' characteristic
of relaxation in nanostructures with well-separated electronic states is observed. The time scales
extracted from the simulations are compared to data from pump-probe experiments using time-resolved
two-photon photoemission.
