Different peak trends in tiny grains carbon film have been observed under the investigations of
Raman spectroscopy and energy loss spectroscopy. Carbon films known in nanocrystalline and ultra-nanocrystalline
diamond films are synthesized by employing microwave-based vapor deposition system. Carbon atom
deals several state behaviors depending on the incurred positions of electrons. This results into
evolve tiny grains having different phases in the film. Those tiny grains of carbon film evolved
in graphitic state atoms, they converted to structure of smooth elements where elongation of atoms
of one-dimensional arrays is as per exerting surface format force along opposite poles from their
centers. Such tiny grains are the cause of v1 peak in the Raman spectrum of their film because of enhanced
propagation of input laser signals through channelized inter-state electron gap of uniformly
elongated atoms. Those tiny grains of carbon film evolved in fullerene state of atoms, they are the
cause of v2 peak. The tiny grains of v1 peak possess its low intensity as compared to the ones comprised
atoms having state behaviors known in exceptional hardness. Tiny grains of v1 peak are also the cause
of enhanced field emission characteristics of a carbon film. Interacting laser beam to certain
region of film recording peaks at different wave numbers indicating different state behavior of
atoms for each phase of tiny grains, namely, graphitic state, lonsdaleite state, diamond state,
fullerene state and graphene state where revealing not a different behavior for energy loss spectroscopy
of that film.
