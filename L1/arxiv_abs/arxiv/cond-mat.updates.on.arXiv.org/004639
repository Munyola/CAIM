Although magnesium alloys deform extensively through shear strains and crystallographic re-orientations
associated with the growth of twins, little is known about the strengthening mechanisms associated
with this deformation mode. A crystal plasticity based phase field model for twinning is employed
in this work to study the strengthening mechanisms resulting from the interaction between twin
growth and precipitates. The full-field simulations reveal in great detail the pinning and de-pinning
of a twin boundary at individual precipitates, resulting in a maximum resistance to twin growth
when the precipitate is partially embedded in the twin. Furthermore, statistically representative
precipitate distributions are used to systematically investigate the influence of key microstructural
parameters such as precipitate orientation, volume fraction, size, and aspect ratio on the resistance
to twin growth. The results indicate that the effective critical resolved shear stress (CRSS) for
twin growth increases linearly with precipitate volume fraction and aspect ratio. For a constant
volume fraction of precipitates, reduction of the precipitate size below a critical level produces
a strong increase in the CRSS due to the Orowan-like strengthening mechanism between the twin interface
and precipitates. Above this level the CRSS is size independent. The results are quantitatively
and qualitatively comparable with experimental measurements and predictions of mean-field strengthening
models. Based on the results, guidelines for the design of high strength magnesium alloys are discussed.
