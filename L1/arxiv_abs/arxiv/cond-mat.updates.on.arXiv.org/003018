In the present work, a detailed analysis of the glassy behavior and the relaxation dynamics of the
liquid crystal dimer {\alpha}-(4-cyanobiphenyl-4'-yloxy)-{\omega}-(1-pyrenimine-benzylidene-4'-oxy)
heptane (CBO7O.Py) throughout both nematic and smectic A mesophases by means of broadband dielectric
spectroscopy has been performed. CBO7O.Py shows three different dielectric relaxation modes
and two glass transition (Tg) temperatures: the higher Tg is due to the freezing of the molecular
motions responsible of the relaxation mode with the lowest frequency (\mu 1L); the lower Tg is due
to the motions responsible of the two relaxation modes with highest frequencies (\mu 1H and \mu 2),
which converge just at their corresponding Tg. It is shown how the three modes follow a critical-like
description via the dynamic scaling model. The two modes with lowest frequencies (\mu 1L and \mu
1H) are cooperative in the whole range of the mesophases, whereas the highest frequency mode (\mu
2) is cooperative just below some cross-over temperature. In terms of fragility, at the glass transition,
the ensemble (\mu 1H +\mu 2) presents a value of the steepness index and \mu 1L a different one, meaning
that fragility is a property intrinsic of the molecular motion itself. Finally, the steepness index
seem to have a universal behavior with temperature for the dielectric relaxation modes of liquid
crystal dimers, being almost constant at high temperatures and increasing drastically when cooling
the compound down to the glass transition from a temperature about (3/4)TNI.
