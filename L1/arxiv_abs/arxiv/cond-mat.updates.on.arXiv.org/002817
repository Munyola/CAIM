Relaxation effects are of primary importance in the description of magnetic excitations, leading
to a myriad of methods addressing the phenomenological damping parameters. In this work, we consider
the well-established forms of calculating the intrinsic Gilbert damping within a unified theoretical
framework, mapping out their connections and the approximations required to derive each method.
This scheme enables a direct comparison of the different methods on the same footing and a consistent
evaluation of their range of validity. Utilizing simulated ferromagnetic resonance spectra based
on the underlying electronic structure, we unambiguously demonstrate that the damping parameter
diverges for three-dimensional bulk magnets in the clean limit, while it remains finite for monolayers.
Most methods lead to very similar results for the bulk ferromagnets Fe, Co and Ni, due to the low spin-orbit
interaction strength and the absence of the spin pumping mechanism. The effects of inhomogeneities,
temperature and other sources of finite electronic lifetime are often accounted for by an empirical
broadening of the electronic energy levels. We show that the contribution to the damping introduced
by this broadening is additive, and so can be extracted by comparing the results of the calculations
performed with and without spin-orbit interaction. Our work puts into perspective the several
methods available to describe and compute the Gilbert damping, building a solid foundation for
future investigations of magnetic relaxation effects in any kind of material.
