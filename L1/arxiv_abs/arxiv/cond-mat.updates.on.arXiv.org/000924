The correct identification of topological magnetic objects in experiments is an important issue.
In the present work we report on the characterization of metastable skyrmionic spin structures
with various topological charges ($Q=-3,-2,-1,0,+1,+2$) in the (Pt$_{1-x}$Ir$_{x}$)Fe/Pd(111)
ultrathin magnetic film by performing spin-polarized scanning tunneling microscopy (SP-STM)
calculations. We find that an out-of-plane magnetized tip already results in distinguished SP-STM
contrasts for the different skyrmionic structures corresponding to their symmetries. Our work
also establishes an understanding of the relationship between in-plane SP-STM contrasts and skyrmionic
topologies through an investigation of the variation of the in-plane angle between the spins along
the perimeter of the structures, which can be characterized by the local vorticity or linear density
of the winding number. For spin structures exhibiting a uniform sign of the local vorticity throughout
the whole skyrmionic area, we demonstrate that (i) $|Q|$ can be determined from a single SP-STM image
taken by any in-plane magnetized tip, and (ii) an in-plane tip magnetization rotation provides
the sign of $Q$ independently of the sign of the effective spin polarization in the tunnel junction.
We also discuss cases where the local vorticity is changing sign. Finally, by increasing the Ir content
of the PtIr overlayer, we find an appearing secondary outer ring in-plane SP-STM contrast that is
indicative of attractive skyrmions or antiskyrmions.
