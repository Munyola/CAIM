We report a dc magnetization study of the critical phenomenon around the ferromagnetic transition
temperature T_C in high-quality single crystals of uranium ferromagnetic superconductors UGe2
and URhGe. The critical exponents, beta for the temperature dependence of the magnetization below
T_C, gamma for the magnetic susceptibility, and delta for the magnetic isothermal at T_C have been
determined with a modified Arrott plot, a Kouvel-Fisher plot, and the scaling analysis. Magnetization
in the ferromagnetic state has strong uniaxial magnetic anisotropy in the two compounds. However,
the universality class of the critical phenomena do not belong to the three dimensional (3D) Ising
system. Although the values of beta in UGe2 and URhGe are close to those in the 3D magnets, the values
of gamma are close to unity, that expected from the mean field theory. Similar critical exponents
have been reported previously for the 3D Ising ferromagnet UIr where superconductivity appears
under high pressure. The critical behavior may be limited to a very narrow Ginzburg critical region
of 1 mK because of the strong itinerant character of the 5f electrons in the ferromagnetic superconductor
UCoGe where the mean field behavior of the magnetization has been reported. The unconventional
critical scaling of magnetization in UGe2, URhGe and UIr cannot be explained via previous approaches
to critical phenomena. The ferromagnetic correlation between the 5f electrons differs from that
in the 3D Ising system and this difference may be a key point for the understanding of the ferromagnetism
where superconductivity emerges.
