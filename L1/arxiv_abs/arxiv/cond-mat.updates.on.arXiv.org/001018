Binary mixtures of dry grains avalanching down a slope are experimentally studied in order to determine
the interaction among coarse and fine grains and their effect on the deposit morphology. The distance
travelled by the massive front of the avalanche over the horizontal plane of deposition area is measured
as a function of mass content of fine particles in the mixture, grain-size ratio, and flume tilt.
A sudden transition of the runout is detected at a critical content of fine particles, with a dependence
on the grain-size ratio and flume tilt. This transition is explained as two simultaneous avalanches
in different flowing regimes (a viscous-like one and an inertial one) competing against each other
and provoking a full segregation and a split-off of the deposit into two well-defined, separated
deposits. The formation of the distal deposit, in turn, depends on a critical amount of coarse particles.
This allows the condensation of the pure coarse deposit around a small, initial seed cluster, which
grows rapidly by braking and capturing subsequent colliding coarse particles. For different grain-size
ratios and keeping a constant total mass, the change in the amount of fines needed for the transition
to occur is found to be always less than 7%. For avalanches with a total mass of 4 kg we find that, most
of the time, the runout of a binary avalanche is larger than the runout of monodisperse avalanches
of corresponding constituent particles, due to lubrication on the coarse-dominated side or to
drag by inertial particles on the fine-dominated side.
