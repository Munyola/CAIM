We ask which topological phases can and cannot be realized by exactly soluble string-net models.
We answer this question for the simplest class of topological phases, namely those with abelian
braiding statistics. Specifically, we find that an abelian topological phase can be realized by
a string-net model if and only if (i) it has a vanishing thermal Hall conductance and (ii) it has at
least one Lagrangian subgroup --- a subset of quasiparticles with particular topological properties.
Equivalently, we find that an abelian topological phase is realizable if and only if it supports
a gapped edge. We conjecture that the latter criterion generalizes to the non-abelian case. We establish
these results by systematically constructing all possible abelian string-net models and analyzing
the quasiparticle braiding statistics in each model. We show that the low energy effective field
theories for these models are multicomponent U(1) Chern-Simons theories, and we derive the K-matrix
description of each model. An additional feature of this work is that the models we construct are
more general than the original string-net models, due to several new ingredients. First, we introduce
two new objects $\gamma, \alpha$ into the construction which are related to $\mathbb{Z}_2$ and
$\mathbb{Z}_3$ Frobenius-Schur indicators. Second, we do not assume parity invariance. As a result,
we can realize topological phases that were not accessible to the original construction, including
phases that break time-reversal and parity symmetry.
