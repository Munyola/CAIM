Herein we employed high-resolution spectroscopic techniques in combination with periodic ab
initio density functional theory (DFT) calculations to establish the different polarization
processes for a porous copper-based MOF, termed HKUST-1. We used alternating current measurements
to determine its dielectric response between 4 Hz and 1.5 MHz where orientational polarization
is predominant, while synchrotron infrared (IR) reflectance was used to probe the far-IR, mid-IR,
and near-IR dielectric response across the 1.2 THz to 150 THz range (ca. 40 - 5000 cm^-1) where vibrational
and optical polarizations are principal contributors to its dielectric permittivity. We demonstrate
the role of pressure on the evolution of broadband dielectric response, where THz vibrations reveal
distinct blue and red shifts of phonon modes from structural deformation of the copper paddle-wheel
and the organic linker, respectively. We also investigated the effect of temperature on dielectric
constants in the MHz region pertinent to microelectronics, to study temperature-dependent dielectric
losses via dissipation in an alternating electric field. The DFT calculations offer insights into
the physical mechanisms responsible for dielectric transitions observed in the experiments and
enable us to explain the frequency shifts phenomenon detected under pressure. Together, the experiments
and theory have enabled us to glimpse into the complex dielectric response and mechanisms underpinning
a prototypical MOF subject to pressure, temperature, and vast frequencies.
