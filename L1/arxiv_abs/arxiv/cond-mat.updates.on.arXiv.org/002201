Black phosphorus (bP) has been recently investigated for next generation nanoelectronic multifunctional
devices. However, the intrinsic instability of exfoliated bP (the bP nanoflakes) towards both
moisture and air has so far overshadowed its practical implementation. In order to contribute to
fill this gap, we report here the preparation of new hybrid polymer-based materials where bP nanoflakes
exhibit a significantly improved stability. The new materials have been prepared by different
synthetic paths including: i) the mixing of conventionally liquid-phase exfoliated bP (in DMSO)
with PMMA solution; ii) the direct exfoliation of bP in a polymeric solution; iii) the in situ radical
polymerization after exfoliating bP in the liquid monomer (methyl methacrylate, MMA). This last
methodology concerns the preparation of stable suspensions of bPn-MMA by sonication-assisted
liquid phase exfoliation (LPE) of bP in the presence of MMA followed by radical polymerization.
The hybrids characteristics have been compared in order to evaluate the bP dispersion and the effectiveness
of the bPn interfacial interactions with polymer chains aimed at their long-term environmental
stabilization. The passivation of bPn results particularly effective when the hybrid material
is prepared by in situ polymerization. By using this synthetic methodology, the nanoflakes, even
if with a gradient of dispersion (size of aggregates), preserve their chemical structure from oxidation
(as proved by both Raman and 31P-Solid State NMR studies) and are particularly stable to air and UV
light exposure.
