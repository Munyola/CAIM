Boron bulk crystals are marked by exceptional structural complexity and unusual related physical
phenomena. Recent reports of hydrogenated $\alpha$-tetragonal and a new $\delta$-orthorhombic
boron B$_{52}$ phase have raised many fundamental questions. Using density functional theory
calculations it is shown that hydrogenated $\alpha$-tetragonal boron has at least two stable stoichiometric
compositions, B$_{51}$H$_{7}$ and B$_{51}$H$_{3}$. Thermodynamic modeling was used to qualitatively
reproduce the two-step phase transition reported by Ekimov et al. [J. Mater. Res. 31, 2773 (2016)]
upon annealing, which corresponds to successive transitions from B$_{51}$H$_{7}$ to B$_{51}$H$_{3}$
to pure B$_{52}$. The so obtained $\delta$-orthorhombic boron is an ordered, low-temperature
phase and $\alpha$-tetragonal boron is a disordered, high-temperature phase of B$_{52}$. The
two phases are connected by an order-disorder transition, that is associated with the migration
of interstitial boron atoms. Atom migration is usually suppressed in strongly bound, covalent
crystals. It is shown that the migration of boron atoms is likely to be assisted by the migration of
hydrogen atoms upon annealing. These results are in excellent agreement with the above mentioned
experiment and they represent an important step forward for the understanding of boron and hydrogenated
boron crystals. They further open a new avenue to control or remove the intrinsic defects of covalently
bound crystals by utilizing volatile, foreign atoms.
