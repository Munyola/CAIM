We use the general formulation of irreversible thermodynamics and study the minimally nonlinear
irreversible model for heat engines operating between a time varying hot heat source of finite size
and a cold heat reservoir of infinite size. We explicitly calculate the condition for obtaining
optimized work output for this model once the system reaches the final thermal equilibrium state
with that of the cold heat reservoir. We find that our condition resembles with the generalized condition
to achieve an optimized work output for generalized irreversible heat engines in the nonlinear
regime [Y. Wang, Phys. Rev. E {\bf 93}, 012120 (2016)]. We also find that the optimized efficiency
obtained by this minimally nonlinear irreversible heat engine can reach the reversible efficiency
under the tight coupling condition in which there is no heat leakage between the system and the reservoirs.
Under this condition, we find that the reversible efficiency is obtain for any finite time interval
with arbitrary power. We also calculate the efficiency at maximum power from the minimally nonlinear
irreversible heat engine under the non-tight coupling condition. We find that the efficiency at
maximum power is equal to the half of the reversible efficiency and the corresponding maximum work
is half of the exergy for a specific choice of the heat leakage term. Our result matches exactly with
the efficiency and the work at maximum power obtained in Ref. [Y. Izumida and K. Okuda, Phys. Rev.
Lett. {\bf 112}, 180603 (2014)] for the exergy study of linear irreversible heat engines under the
tight coupling condition.
