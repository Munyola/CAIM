We study fluid-fluid equilibrium in the simplest model of ionic solutions where the solvent is explicitly
included, i.e., a binary mixture consisting of a restricted primitive model (RPM) and neutral hard-spheres
(RPM-HS mixture). First, using the collective variable method we find free energy, pressure and
partial chemical potentials in the random phase approximation (RPA) for a rather general model
that takes into consideration solvent-solvent and solvent-ion interactions beyond the hard core.
In the special case of a RPM-HS mixture, we consider two regularizations of the Coulomb potential
inside the hard core, i.e., the Weeks-Chandler-Andersen (WCA) regularization leading to the WCA
approximation and the optimized regularization giving the optimized RPA (ORPA) or the mean spherical
approximation (MSA). Furthermore, we calculate the phase coexistence using the associative mean
spherical approximation (AMSA). In general, the three approximations produce qualitatively
similar phase diagrams of the RPM-HS mixture, i.e., a fluid-fluid coexistence envelope with an
upper critical solution point, a shift of the coexistence region towards higher total number densities
and higher solvent concentrations with increasing pressure, and a small increase of the critical
temperature with an increase of pressure. As for a pure RPM, the AMSA leads to the best agreement with
the available simulation data when the association constant proposed by Olaussen and Stell is used.
We also discuss the peculiarities of the phase diagrams in the WCA approximation.
