Understanding the thermodynamics of the duplication process is a fundamental step towards a comprehensive
physical theory of biological systems. However, the immense complexity of real cells obscures
the fundamental tensions between free energy gradients and entropic contributions that underlie
duplication. The study of synthetic, feasible systems reproducing part of the key ingredients
of living entities but overcoming major sources of biological complexity is of great relevance
to deepen the comprehension of the fundamental thermodynamic processes underlying life and its
prevalence. In this paper an abstract --yet realistic-- synthetic system made of small synthetic
protocell aggregates is studied in detail. A fundamental relation between free energy and entropic
gradients is derived for a general, non-equilibrium scenario, explicitly setting the thermodynamic
conditions for the occurrence and prevalence of duplication phenomena. This relation sets explicitly
how the energy gradients invested in creating and maintaining structural --and eventually, functional--
elements of the system must always compensate the entropic gradients, whose contributions come
from changes in the translational, configurational and macrostate entropies, as well as from dissipation
due to irreversible transitions. Work/energy relations are also derived, defining lower bounds
on the energy required for the duplication event to take place. This theoretical contribution seeks
to explicitly define and identify the key actors that participate in the physics of a process that
is fundamental to life.
