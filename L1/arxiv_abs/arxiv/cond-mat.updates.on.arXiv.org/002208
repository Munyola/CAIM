The single crystal of RuAs obtained by Bi-flux method shows obvious successive metal-insulator
transitions at T_MI1~255 K and T_MI2~195$ K. The X-ray diffraction measurement reveals a formation
of superlattice of 3x3x3 of the original unit cell below T_MI2, accompanied by a change of the crystal
system from the orthorhombic structure to the monoclinic one. Simple dimerization of the Ru ions
is nor seen in the ground state. The multiple As sites observed in nuclear quadrupole resonance (NQR)
spectrum also demonstrate the formation of the superlattice in the ground state, which is clarified
to be nonmagnetic. The divergence in 1/T_1 at T_MI1 shows that a symmetry lowering by the metal-insulator
transition is accompanied by strong critical fluctuations of some degrees of freedom. Using the
structural parameters in the insulating state, the first principle calculation reproduces successfully
the reasonable size of nuclear quadrupole frequencies for the multiple As sites, ensuring the high
validity of the structural parameters. The calculation also gives a remarkable suppression in
the density of states (DOS) near the Fermi level, although the gap opening is insufficient. A coupled
modulation of the calculated Ru d electron numbers and the crystal structure proposes a formation
of charge density wave (CDW) in RuAs. Some lacking factors remain, but it shows that a lifting of degeneracy
protected by the non-symmorphic symmetry through the superlattice formation is a key ingredient
for the metal-insulator transition in RuAs.
