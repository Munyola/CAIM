The quantum spin liquid is a highly entangled magnetic state characterized by the absence of long-range
magnetic order or any static magnetism in its ground state. Instead the spins are continuously fluctuating
in a highly correlated way down to the lowest temperatures. The spin liquid state is very rare and
is confined to a few specific cases where the interactions between the magnetic ions cannot be simultaneously
satisfied (known as frustration). In particular, lattices with magnetic ions in triangular or
tetrahedral arrangements which interact via isotropic antiferromagnetic interactions can generate
frustration because it is impossible to connect all the bonds with magnetic moments that are aligned
antiparallel. This leads to highly degenerate ground states between which the magnetic moments
fluctuate continuously. Three-dimensional isotropic spin liquids have mostly been sought in
materials where the magnetic ions form pyrochlore or hyperkagome lattices. Here we discover a new
type of three-dimensional lattice that enables spin liquid behavior called the hyper-hyperkagome
lattice which manifests in the compound PbCuTe$_{2}$O$_{6}$. Using a combination of experiment
and theory we show that this system satisfies all the requirements for a quantum spin liquid including
the absence of static magnetism, the presence of a degenerate manifold of ground states, and the
characteristic continuum of spinon excitations. This result is important because, it points to
new ways to engineer spin liquid behavior.
