We analyze the effect of quenched disorder on spin-1/2 quantum magnets in which magnetic frustration
promotes the formation of local singlets. Our results include a theory for 2d valence-bond solids
subject to weak bond randomness, as well as extensions to stronger disorder regimes where we make
connections with quantum spin liquids. We find, on various lattices, that the destruction of a valence-bond
solid phase by weak quenched disorder leads inevitably to the nucleation of topological defects
carrying spin-1/2 moments. This renormalizes the lattice into a strongly random spin network with
interesting low-energy excitations. Similarly when short-ranged valence bonds would be pinned
by stronger disorder, we find that this putative glass is unstable to defects that carry spin-1/2
magnetic moments, and whose residual interactions decide the ultimate low energy fate. Motivated
by these results we conjecture Lieb-Schultz-Mattis-like restrictions on ground states for disordered
magnets with spin-1/2 per statistical unit cell. These conjectures are supported by an argument
for 1d spin chains. We apply insights from this study to the phenomenology of YbMgGaO$_4$, a recently
discovered triangular lattice spin-1/2 insulator which was proposed to be a quantum spin liquid.
We instead explore a description based on the present theory. Experimental signatures, including
unusual specific heat, thermal conductivity, and dynamical structure factor, and their behavior
in a magnetic field, are predicted from the theory, and compare favorably with existing measurements
on YbMgGaO$_4$ and related materials.
