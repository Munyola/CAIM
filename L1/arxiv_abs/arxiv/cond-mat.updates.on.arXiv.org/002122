Equilibrium crystal structures, electron band dispersions and band gap values of layered GaSe
and InSe semiconductors, each being represented by four polytypes, are studied via first-principles
calculations within the density functional theory (DFT). A number of practical algorithms to take
into account dispersion interactions are tested, from empirical Grimme corrections to many-body
dispersion schemes. Due to the utmost technical accuracy achieved in the calculations, nearly
degenerate energy-volume curves of different polytypes are resolved, and the conclusions concerning
the relative stability of competing polytypes drawn. The predictions are done as for how the equilibrium
between different polytypes will be shifted under the effect of hydrostatic pressure. The band
structures are inspected under the angle of identifying features specific for different polytypes,
and with respect to modifications of the band dispersions brought about by the use of modified Becke-Johnson
(mBJ) scheme for the exchange-correlation (XC) potential. As another way to improve the predictions
of band gaps values, hybrid functional calculations according to the HSE06 scheme are performed
for the band structures, and the relation with the mBJ results discussed. Both methods nicely agree
with experimental results and with state-of-the-art GW calculations. Some discrepancies are
identified in cases of close competition between the direct and indirect gap (e.g., in GaSe); moreover,
the accurate placement of bands revealing relatively localized states is slightly different according
to mBJ and HSE06 schemes.
