Active colloidal systems contain active particle, which converts energy from the environment
into directed or persistent motion. An outstanding question, debated to date, pertains to how a
quantitative and well-defined means can be established to quantify the differences between the
statistical behavior of an active particle and a passive Brownian particle. To address this question,
we set out to investigate the motions of a single, induced-charge electrophoretic (ICEP) metallic
Janus particles in a quadratic potential of an optical trap, by experiments and numerical simulations.
The positions of the particle under different driving forces were measured by experiments and simulated
numerically using a generalized Langevin equation. The 1-D positional histograms of the active
particle, distinctively different from that of a Boltzmann distribution, reveal splitting of
the positional distribution of a single peak centered at the bottom of the well into two symmetrical
peaks, whose centers move away from the center to a distance increasing with the driven force. We
provide a convolutional method to capture how and when the non-thermal histogram appears. The temporal
fluctuations of the active particle in the well are analyzed by their power spectral density (PSD).
We found that the fluctuation power spectral density (PSD) plots have two characteristic frequencies,
which reveal a frequency-dependent effective temperature by the fluctuation-dissipation theorem.
The relationship between spatial and temporal fluctuation are discussed at the end.
