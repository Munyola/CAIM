The recent observation of a half-integer quantized thermal Hall effect in $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ is
interpreted as a unique signature of a chiral spin liquid with a Majorana edge mode. A similar quantized
thermal Hall effect is expected in chiral topological superconductors. The unavoidable presence
of gapless acoustic phonons, however, implies that, in contrast to the quantized electrical conductivity,
the thermal Hall conductivity $\kappa_xy$ is never exactly quantized in real materials. Here,
we investigate how phonons affect the quantization of the thermal conductivity focusing on the
edge theory. As an example we consider a Kitaev spin liquid gapped by an external magnetic field coupled
to acoustic phonons. The coupling to phonons destroys the ballistic thermal transport of the edge
mode completely, as energy can leak into the bulk, thus drastically modifying the edge-picture
of the thermal Hall effect. Nevertheless, the thermal Hall conductivity remains approximately
quantized and we argue, that the coupling to phonons to the edge mode is a necessary condition for
the observation of the quantized thermal Hall effect. The strength of this edge coupling does, however,
not affect the conductivity. We argue that for sufficiently clean systems the leading correction
to the quantized thermal Hall effect, $\Delta \kappa_{xy}/T \sim \text{sign(B)} \, T^2$, arises
from a intrinsic anomalous Hall effect of the acoustic phonons due to Berry phases imprinted by the
chiral (spin) liquid in the bulk. This correction depends on the sign but not the amplitude of the
external magnetic field.
