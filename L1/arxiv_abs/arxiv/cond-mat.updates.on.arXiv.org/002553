We study the meniscus on the outside of a small spherical particle with radius $R$ at a liquid-vapor
interface. The liquid is confined in a cylindrical container with a finite radius $L$ and has a contact
angle $\pi/2$ at the container surface. The center of the particle is placed at various heights along
the central axis of the container. By varying $L$, we are able to systematically study the crossover
of the meniscus from nanometer to macroscopic scales. The meniscus rise or depression on the particle
is found to grow as $\ln (2L/R)$ when $R\ll L\ll \kappa^{-1}$ with $\kappa^{-1}$ being the capillary
length and saturate to a value predicted by the Derjaguin-James formula when $R \ll \kappa^{-1}
\ll L$. The capillary force on the particle exhibits a linear dependence on the particle's displacement
from its equilibrium position at the interface when the displacement is small. The associated spring
constant is found to be $2\pi\gamma\ln^{-1} (2L/R)$ for $L\ll \kappa^{-1}$ and saturates to $2\pi\gamma\ln^{-1}
(3.7\kappa^{-1}/R)$ for $L\gg \kappa^{-1}$. At nanometer scales, we perform molecular dynamics
simulations of the described geometry and the results agree well with the predictions of the macroscopic
theory of capillarity. At micrometer to macroscopic scales, comparison to experiments by Anachkov
\textit{et al.} [Soft Matter {\bf 12}, 7632 (2016)] shows that the finite span of a liquid-vapor
or liquid-liquid interface needs to be considered to interpret experimental data collected with
$L \sim \kappa^{-1}$.
