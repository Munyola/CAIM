Solid oxide oxygen ion and proton conductors are a highly important class of materials for renewable
energy conversion devices like solid oxide fuel cells. Ba2In2O5 (BIO) exhibits both oxygen ion
and proton conduction, in dry and humid environment, respectively. In dry environment, the brownmillerite
crystal structure of BIO exhibits an ordered oxygen ion sublattice, which has been speculated to
result in anisotropic oxygen ion conduction. The hydrated structure of BIO, however, resembles
a perovskite and the protons in it were predicted to be ordered in layers. To complement the significant
theoretical and experimental efforts recently reported on the potentially anisotropic conductive
properties in BIO, we measure here the proton and oxygen ion conductivity along different crystallographic
directions. Using epitaxial thin films with different crystallographic orientations the charge
transport for both charge carriers is shown to be anisotropic. The anisotropy of the oxygen ion conduction
can indeed be explained through the layered structure of the oxygen sublattice in brownmillerite
BIO. The anisotropic proton conduction however, further supports the suggested ordering of the
protonic defects in the material. The differences in proton conduction along different crystallographic
directions attributed to proton ordering in BIO are of a similar extent as those observed along different
crystallographic directions in materials where proton ordering is not present but where protons
find preferential conduction pathways through chain-like or layered structures.
