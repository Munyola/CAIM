Electric field induced collective reorientation of nematic molecules placed between two flat
parallel electrodes is of importance for both fundamental science and practical applications.
This reorientation is either homogeneous over the area of electrodes, as in liquid crystal displays,
or periodically modulated, as in the phenomenon called electroconvection1, similar to Rayleigh-B\'enard
thermal convection. The question is whether the electric field can produce spatially localized
propagating solitons of molecular orientation. Here we demonstrate electrically driven three-dimensional
particle-like solitons representing self-trapped waves of oscillating molecular orientation.
The solitons propagate with a very high speed perpendicularly to both the electric field and the
initial alignment direction. The propulsion is enabled by rapid collective reorientations of
the molecules with the frequency of the applied electric field and by lack of fore-aft symmetry.
The solitons preserve spatially-confined shapes while moving over distances hundreds of times
larger than their size and survive collisions. During collisions, the solitons show repulsions
and attractions, depending on the impact parameter. The solitons are topologically equivalent
to the uniform state and have no static analogs, thus exhibiting a particle-wave duality. We anticipate
the observations to be a starting point for a broad range of studies since the system allows for a precise
control over a broad range of parameters that determine the shape, propagation speed, and interactions
of the solitons.
