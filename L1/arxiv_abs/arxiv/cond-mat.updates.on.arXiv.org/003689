We consider a stochastic interface $h(x,t)$, described by the $1+1$ Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ)
equation on the half-line $x\geq0$ with the reflecting boundary at $x=0$. The interface is initially
flat, $h(x,t=0)=0$. We focus on the short-time probability distribution $\mathcal{P}\left(H,L,t\right)$
of the height $H$ of the interface at point $x=L$. Using the optimal fluctuation method, we determine
the (Gaussian) body of the distribution and the strongly asymmetric non-Gaussian tails. We find
that the slower-decaying tail scales as $-\sqrt{t}\,\ln\mathcal{P}\simeq\left|H\right|^{3/2}f_{-}\left(L/\sqrt{\left|H\right|t}\right)$,
and calculate the function $f_{-}(\dots)$ analytically. Remarkably, this tail exhibits a first-order
dynamical phase transition at a critical value of $L$, $L_{c}=0.60223\dots\sqrt{\left|H\right|t}$.
The transition results from a competition between two different fluctuation paths of the system.
The faster decaying tail scales as $-\sqrt{t}\,\ln\mathcal{P}\simeq|H|^{5/2}f_{+}\left(L/\sqrt{|H|t}\right)$.
We evaluate the function $f_{+}(\dots)$ using a specially developed numerical method, which involves
solving a nonlinear second-order elliptic equation in Lagrangian coordinates. The faster-decaying
tail also involves a sharp transition, which occurs at a critical value $L_{c}\simeq2\sqrt{2|H|t}/\pi$.
This transition is similar to the one recently found for the KPZ equation on a ring, and we believe
that it has the same fractional order $5/2$. It is smoothed, however, by small diffusion effects.
