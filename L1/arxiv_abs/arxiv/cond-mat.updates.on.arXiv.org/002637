Topological systems are inherently robust to disorder and continuous perturbations, resulting
in dissipation-free edge transport of electrons in quantum solids, or reflectionless guiding
of photons and phonons in classical wave systems characterized by Chern or spin-Chern topological
invariants. These established examples of topological physics, however, do not exhaust all possible
topological phases, and recently a new class of topological metamaterials characterized by bulk
polarization has been introduced. In addition to edge conduction, these systems have been shown
to host higher-order topological modes. Here, we introduce and measure topological bulk polarization
in 3D printed two-dimensional acoustic meta-structures, and observe topological transitions
as the design parameters are tuned. We also demonstrate that our topological meta-structure hosts
both 1D edge and higher-order 0D corner states with unique acoustic properties. The edge states
have spin polarization that reverses for opposite propagation direction, thus supporting directional
excitation. Corner states are pinned to the meta-structure corners, and rapidly decay both along
the edges and into the bulk. Interestingly, these 0D states can spectrally overlap with the continuum
of bulk states, but are not compatible with radiation, thus enabling embedded topological eigenstates
within the continuum of bulk modes. Their confinement and inherent topological robustness is experimentally
confirmed by deliberately introducing disorder. Our findings open new directions in acoustics
for advanced sound propagation and manipulation.
