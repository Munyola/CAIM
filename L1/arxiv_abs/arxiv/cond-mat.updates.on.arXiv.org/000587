We study the low-energy physics of topological insulator (TI) nanoribbons proximity-coupled
to $s$-wave superconductors (SCs) by explicitly incorporating the proximity effects that emerge
at the TI-SC interface. We construct a low-energy effective theory that incorporates the proximity
effect through an interface contribution containing both normal and anomalous terms and an energy-renormalization
matrix. We show that the strength of the proximity-induced gap is determined by the transparency
of the interface and the amplitude of the low-energy TI states at the interface. Consequently, the
induced gap is strongly band-depended and collapses for bands containing states with low amplitude
at the interface. We find that states with energies within the bulk TI gap have surface-like character
and, in the presence of proximity-induced or applied bias potentials, have most of their weight
near either the top or the bottom surface of the nanoribbon. As a result, single interface TI-SC structures
are susceptible to experience a collapse of the induced gap whenever the chemical potential is far
enough from the value corresponding to the bulk TI Dirac point and crosses weakly coupled bands.
We also find that changing the chemical potential in single-interface structures using gate potentials
may be ineffective, as it does not result in a significant increase of the induced gap. On the other
hand, we find that symmetric structures, such as a TI nanowire sandwiched between two superconductors,
are capable to realize the full potential of TI-based structures to harbor robust topological superconducting
phases.
