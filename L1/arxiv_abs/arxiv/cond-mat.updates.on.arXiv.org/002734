We report on the frictional behaviour of thin poly(dimethylacrylamide) (PDMA) hydrogels films
grafted on glass substrates in sliding contact with a glass spherical probe. Friction experiments
are carried out at various velocities and applied normal loads with the contact fully immersed in
water. In addition to friction force measurements, a novel optical set-up is designed to image the
shape of the contact under steady-state sliding. The velocity-dependence of both friction force
$F_t$ and contact shape is found to be controlled by a P\'eclet number Pe defined as the ratio of the
time $\tau$ needed to drain the water out of the contact region to a contact time $a/v$, where $v$ is
the sliding velocity and $a$ is the contact radius. When Pe<1, the equilibrium circular contact
achieved under static normal indentation remains unchanged during sliding. Conversely, for Pe>1,
a decrease in the contact area is observed together with the development of a contact asymmetry when
the sliding velocity is increased. A maximum in $F_t$ is also observed at Pe~$\approx$~1. These
experimental observations are discussed in the light of a poroelastic contact model based on a thin
film approximation. This model indicates that the observed changes in contact geometry are due
to the development of a pore pressure imbalance when Pe>1. An order of magnitude estimate of the friction
force and its dependence on normal load and velocity is also provided under the assumption that most
of the frictional energy is dissipated by poroelastic flow at the leading and trailing edges of the
sliding contact.
