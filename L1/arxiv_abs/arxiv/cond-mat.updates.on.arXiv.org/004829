We study the anomalous Hall effect, magneto-optical properties, and nonlinear optical properties
of twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) aligned with hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) substrate as well
as twisted double bilayer graphene systems. We show that non-vanishing valley polarizations in
twisted graphene systems would give rise to anomalous Hall effect which can be tuned by in-plane
magnetic fields. The valley polarized states are also associated with giant Faraday/Kerr rotations
in the terahertz frequency regime. Moreover, both hBN-aligned TBG and TDBG exhibit colossal nonlinear
optical responses by virtue of the inversion-symmetry breaking, the small bandwidth, and the small
excitation gaps of the systems. Our calculations indicate that in both systems the nonlinear optical
conductivities of the shift currents are on the order of $10^3\,\mu$A/V$^2$; and the second harmonic
generation (SHG) susceptibilities are on the order of $10^6\,$pm/V in the terahertz frequency
regime. Moreover, in TDBG with $AB\textrm{-}BA$ stacking, we find that a finite orbital magnetization
would generate a new component $\sigma^{x}_{xx} $ of the nonlinear photoconductivity tensor;
while in $AB$-$AB$ stacked TDBG with vertical electric fields, the valley polarization and orbital
magnetization would make significant contributions to the $\sigma^{y}_{xx}$ component of the
photoconductivity tensor. These nonlinear photo-conductivities are proportional to the orbital
magnetizations of the systems, thus they are expected to exhibit hysteresis behavior in response
to out-of-plane magnetic fields.
