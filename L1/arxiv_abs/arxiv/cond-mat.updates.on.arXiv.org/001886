Based on group theoretical arguments we derive the most general Hamiltonian for the $\text{Bi}_2\text{Se}_3$-class
of materials including terms to third order in the wave vector, first order in electric and magnetic
fields, first order in strain and first order in both strain and wave vector. We determine analytically
the effects of strain on the electronic structure of $\text{Bi}_2\text{Se}_3$. For the most experimentally
relevant surface termination we analytically derive the surface state spectrum, revealing an
anisotropic Dirac cone with elliptical constant energy counturs giving rise to different velocities
in different in-plane directions. The spin-momentum locking of strained $\text{Bi}_2\text{Se}_3$
is shown to be modified and for some strain configurations we see a non-zero spin component perpendicular
to the surface. Hence, strain control can be used to manipulate the spin degree of freedom via the
spin-orbit coupling. We show that for a thin film of $\text{Bi}_2\text{Se}_3$ the surface state
band gap induced by coupling between the opposite surfaces changes opposite to the bulk band gap
under strain. Tuning the surface state band gap by strain, gives new possibilities for the experimental
investigation of the thickness dependent gap and optimization of optical properties relevant
for, e.g., photodetector and energy harvesting applications. We finally derive analytical expressions
for the effective mass tensor of the Bi$_2$Se$_3$ class of materials as a function of strain and electric
field.
