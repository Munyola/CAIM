We have investigated optical conductivity spectra of $n$- and $p$-type Ba$_8$Ga $_{16}$Sn$_{30}$
($\alpha$-BGS) with type-VIII clathrate structure, at temperatures from 296\,K down to 6\,K with
a terahertz time-domain spectrometer (0.2\,-\,2.5\,THz). The continuous spectra contributed
from charge carriers are dispersive in this frequency range and also temperature- and carrier type-dependent.
The Drude-Smith model taking multiple-scatterings of charge carriers into account well reproduces
those data. The relaxation rate of the $n$-type carriers decreases more sharply than that in the
$p$-type material, suggesting that a stronger electron-phonon interaction may exist in the $n$-type
than in the $p$-type. On the other hand, the localized infrared-active modes observed at 1.3\,THz
and 1.7\,THz, identified as the rattling phonons of the Ba$^{2+}$ ion's quasi-on-center vibrations,
become soft and broad significantly with decreasing temperature as well as observed in type-I BGS
and BGG (Ba$_8$Ga$_{16}$Ge$_{30}$) clathrates. The softening in the $n$-type is smaller by about
30% than in the $p$-type, whereas the linewidth brodening is almost the same independently on the
carrier type. The difference in the softening is discussed with a scenario where the interaction
of rattling phonons with carriers can modify the anharmonic potential of the guest ions. The anomalous
broadening at low temepratures is also discussed by the impurity-scattering model presented for
a rattling-phonon system strongly hybridized with acoustic cage phonons.
