Topological crystalline states are short-range entangled states jointly protected by onsite
and crystalline symmetries. While the non-interacting limit of these states, e.g., the topological
crystalline insulators, have been intensively studied in band theory and have been experimentally
discovered, the classification and diagnosis of their strongly interacting counterparts are
relatively less well understood. Here we present a unified scheme for constructing all topological
crystalline states, bosonic and fermionic, free and interacting, from real-space "building blocks"
and "connectors". Building blocks are finite-size pieces of lower dimensional topological states
protected by onsite symmetries alone, and connectors are "glue" that complete the open edges shared
by two or multiple pieces of building blocks. The resulted assemblies are selected against two physical
criteria we call the "no-open-edge condition" and the "bubble equivalence", which, respectively,
ensure that each selected assembly is gapped in the bulk and cannot be deformed to a product state.
The scheme is then applied to obtaining the full classification of bosonic topological crystalline
states protected by several onsite symmetry groups and each of the 17 wallpaper groups in two dimensions
and 230 space groups in three dimensions. We claim that our real-space recipes give the complete
set of topological crystalline states for bosons and fermions, and prove the boson case analytically
using a spectral sequence expansion of group cohomology.
