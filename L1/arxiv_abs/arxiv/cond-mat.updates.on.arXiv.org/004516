Tunneling of spinless electrons from a single-channel emitter into an empty collector through
an interacting resonant level of the quantum dot (QD) is studied, when all Coulomb screening of charge
variations on the dot is realized by the emitter channel and the system is mapped onto an exactly solvable
model of a dissipative qubit. In this model we describe the qubit density matrix evolution with a
generalized Lindblad equation, which permit us to count the tunneling electrons and therefore
relate the qubit dynamics to the charge transfer statistics. In particular, the coefficients of
its generating function equal to the time dependent probabilities to have the fixed number of electrons
tunneled into the collector are expressed through the parameters of a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian
evolution of the qubit pure states in between the successive electron tunnelings. From the long
time asymptotics of the generating function we calculate Fano factors of the second and third order
(skewness) and establish their relation to the extra average and cumulant, respectively, of the
charge accumulated in the transient process of the empty QD evolution beyond their linear time dependence.
It explains the origin of the sub and super Poisson shot noise in this system and shows that the super
Poisson signals existence of a non-monotonous oscillating transient current and the qubit coherent
dynamics. The mechanism is illustrated with particular examples of the generating functions,
one of which coincides in the large time limit with the $1/3$ fractional Poissonian realized without
the real fractional charge tunneling.
