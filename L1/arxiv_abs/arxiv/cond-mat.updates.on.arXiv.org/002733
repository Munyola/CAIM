We investigate the magnetization dynamics of ferromagnetic nanoparticles in the atomistic approach
taking account of surface anisotropy and the spin misalignment it causes. We demonstrate that such
inhomogeneous spin configurations induce nutation in the dynamics of the particle's magnetization.
More precisely, in addition to the ordinary precessional motion with frequency $f_{p}\sim10\,{\rm
GHz}$, we find that the dynamics of the net magnetic moment exhibits two more resonance peaks with
frequencies $f_{c}$ and $f_{n}$ which are higher than the frequency $f_{p} : f_{c}=4\times f_{p}\sim40\,{\rm
GHz}$ is related with the oscillations of the particle's magnetic moment between the minima of the
effective potential induced by weak surface anisotropy. On the other hand, the much higher frequency
$f_{n}\sim1\,{\rm THz}$ is attributed to the magnetization fluctuations at the atomic level driven
by exchange interaction. We have compared our results on nutation induced by surface effects with
those rendered by the macroscopic approach based on the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation augmented
by an inertial term (proportional to the second-order time derivative of the macroscopic moment)
with a phenomenological coefficient. The good agreement between the two models have allowed us
to estimate the latter coefficient in terms of the atomistic parameters such as the surface anisotropy
constant. We have thus proposed a new origin for the magnetization nutations as being induced by
surface effects and have interpreted the corresponding resonance peaks and their frequencies.
