We investigate the anomalous effects due to the Berry correction and the considerable perturbations
in the silicene-like hexagonal lattice system. The Berry curvature in periodic Bloch band system
which related to the electromagnetic field is explored, the induced transverse anomalous velocity
gives rise to the intrinsic Hall conductivity (without the vertex correction) expecially in the
quantum anomalous Hall phase. The quantum anomalous Hall effect which related to the anomalous
velocity term is detected, including the band avoided corssing effect and the generated special
band gap. %{Enlarged Galilean symmetry of anyons and the Hall effect} The topological spin transport
is affected by the Berry curvature %{Topological spin transport of a relativistic electron} %{Anomalous
direction for skyrmion bubble motion} and the spin-current-induced Skyrmion spin texture motion
is contrasted between the quantum spin Hall effect and quantum anomalous Hall effect. Since silicene
involving the orbital degree of freedom, the orbital magnetic moment and orbital magnetization
contributes significantly to the electronic transport properties of silicene %{Photoinduced
quantum spin and valley Hall effects, and orbital magnetization in monolayer MoS2} as explored
in this article. We also investigate the electronic tunneling properties of silicene in Josephon
junction with the electric-field-induced Rashba-coupling, the anomalous effect due to the Berry
phase is mentioned. Our results is meaningful to the application of the spintronics and valleytronics
base on the silicene-like topological insulators.
