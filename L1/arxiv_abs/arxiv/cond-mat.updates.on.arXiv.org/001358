Proper design and manufacturing thermal bridges based on molecular junctions at the contact between
graphene platelets or other thermally conductive nanoparticles would provide a fascinating way
to produce efficient heat transport networks for the exploitation in heat management applications.
In this work, using Non Equilibrium Molecular Dynamics, we calculated thermal conductance of alkyl
chains used as molecular junctions between two graphene nanoribbons, both as covalently bound
and Van der Waals interdigitated chains. Effect of chain length, grafting density, temperature
and chain interdigitation were systematically studied. A clear reduction of conductivity was
found with increasing chain length and decreasing grafting density, while lower conductivity
was observed for Van der Waals interdigitated chains compared to covalently bound ones. The importance
of molecular junctions in enhancing thermal conductance at graphene nanoribbons contacts was
further evidenced by calculating the conductance equivalence between a single chain and an overlapping
of un-functionalized graphene sheets. As an example, one single pentyl covalently bound chain
was found to have a conductance equivalent to the overlapping of an area corresponding to about 152
carbon atoms. These results contribute to the understanding of thermal phenomena occurring within
networks of thermally conductive nanoparticles, including graphene nanopapers and graphene-based
polymer nanocomposites, which are or high interest for the heat management application in electronics
and generally in low-temperature heat exchange and recovery.
