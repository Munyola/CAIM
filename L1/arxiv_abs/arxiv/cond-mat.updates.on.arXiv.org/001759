Semiconducting quantum wires defined within two-dimensional electron gases and strongly coupled
to thin superconducting layers have been extensively explored in recent experiments as promising
platforms to host Majorana bound states. We study numerically such a geometry, consisting of a quasi-one-dimensional
wire coupled to a disordered three-dimensional superconducting layer. We find that, in the strong-coupling
limit of a sizable proximity-induced superconducting gap, all transverse subbands of the wire
are significantly shifted in energy relative to the chemical potential of the wire. For the lowest
subband, this band shift is comparable in magnitude to the spacing between quantized levels that
arise due to the finite thickness of the superconductor (which typically is $\sim500$ meV for a 10-nm-thick
layer of Aluminum); in higher subbands, the band shift is much larger. Additionally, we show that
the width of the system, which is usually much larger than the thickness, and moderate disorder within
the superconductor have almost no impact on the induced gap or band shift. We provide a detailed discussion
of the ramifications of our results, arguing that a huge band shift and significant renormalization
of semiconducting material parameters in the strong-coupling limit make it challenging to realize
a topological phase in such a setup, as the strong coupling to the superconductor essentially metallizes
the semiconductor. This metallization of the semiconductor can be tested experimentally through
the measurement of the band shift.
