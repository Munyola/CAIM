Despite their fundamental role in determining material properties, detailed momentum-dependent
information on the strength of electron-phonon and phonon-phonon coupling (EPC and PPC, respectively)
across the entire Brillouin zone (BZ) has proved difficult to obtain. Here we demonstrate that ultrafast
electron diffuse scattering (UEDS) directly provides such information. By exploiting symmetry-based
selection rules and time-resolution, scattering from different phonon branches can be distinguished
even without energy resolution. Using graphite as a model system, we show that UEDS patterns map
the relative EPC and PPC strength through their profound sensitivity to photoinduced changes in
phonon populations. We measure strong EPC to the $K$-point transverse optical phonon of $A_1'$
symmetry ($K-A_1'$) and along the entire longitudinal optical branch between $\Gamma-K$, not
only to the $\Gamma-E_{2g}$ phonon as previously emphasized. We also determine that the subsequent
phonon relaxation pathway involves three stages; decay via several identifiable channels to transverse
acoustic (TA) and longitudinal acoustic (LA) phonons (1-2 ps), intraband thermalization of the
non-equilibrium TA/LA phonon populations (30-40 ps) and interband relaxation of the LA/TA modes
(115 ps). Combining UEDS with ultrafast angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy will yield
a complete picture of the dynamics within and between electron and phonon subsystems, helping to
unravel complex phases in which the intertwined nature of these systems have a strong influence
on emergent properties.
