We report on a study of the structural, magnetic and superconducting properties of Nb(25nm)/Gd($d_f$)/Nb(25nm)
hybrid structures of a superconductor/ ferromagnet (S/F) type. The structural characterization
of the samples, including careful determination of the layer thickness, was performed using neutron
and X-ray scattering with the aid of depth sensitive mass-spectrometry. The magnetization of the
samples was determined by SQUID magnetometry and polarized neutron reflectometry and the presence
of magnetic ordering for all samples down to the thinnest Gd(0.8nm) layer was shown. The analysis
of the neutron spin asymmetry allowed us to prove the absence of magnetically dead layers in junctions
with Gd interlayer thickness larger than one monolayer. The measured dependence of the superconducting
transition temperature $T_c(d_f)$ has a damped oscillatory behavior with well defined positions
of the minimum at $d_f$=3nm and the following maximum at $d_f$=4nm; the behavior, which is in qualitative
agreement with the prior work (J.S. Jiang et al, PRB 54, 6119). The analysis of the $T_c(d_f)$ dependence
based on Usadel equations showed that the observed minimum at $d_f$=3nm can be described by the so
called "$0$" to "$\pi$" phase transition of highly transparent S/F interfaces with the superconducting
correlation length $\xi_f \approx 4$nm in Gd. This penetration length is several times higher than
for strong ferromagnets like Fe, Co or Ni, simplifying thus preparation of S/F structures with $d_f
\sim \xi_f$ which are of topical interest in superconducting spintronics.
