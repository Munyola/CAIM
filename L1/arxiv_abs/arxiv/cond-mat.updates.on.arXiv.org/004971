Recently amorphous oxide semiconductors (AOS) have gained commercial interest due to their low-temperature
processability, high mobility and areal uniformity for display backplanes and other large area
applications. A multi-cation amorphous oxide (a-IGZO) has been researched extensively and is
now being used in commercial applications. It is proposed in the literature that overlapping In-5s
orbitals form the conduction path and the carrier mobility is limited due to the presence of multiple
cations which create a potential barrier for the electronic transport in a-IGZO semiconductors.
A multi-anion approach towards amorphous semiconductors has been suggested to overcome this limitation
and has been shown to achieve hall mobilities up to an order of magnitude higher compared to multi-cation
amorphous semiconductors. In the present work, we compare the electronic structure and electronic
transport in a multi-cation amorphous semiconductor, a-IGZO and a multi-anion amorphous semiconductor,
a-ZnON using computational methods. Our results show that in a-IGZO, the carrier transport path
is through the overlap of outer s-orbitals of mixed cations and in a-ZnON, the transport path is formed
by the overlap of Zn-4s orbitals, which is the only type of metal cation present. We also show that
for multi-component ionic amorphous semiconductors, electron transport can be explained in terms
of orbital overlap integral which can be calculated from structural information and has a direct
correlation with the carrier effective mass which is calculated using computationally expensive
first principle DFT methods.
