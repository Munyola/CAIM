Ground-state properties of bosons interacting via inverse square potential are analyzed. A number
of quantities scale with the density and can be naturally expressed in units of the Fermi energy and
Fermi momentum multiplied by a dimensionless constant (Bertsch parameter). Two analytical approaches
are developed: Bogoliubov theory for weak and harmonic approximation (HA) for strong interactions.
Diffusion Monte Carlo method is used to obtain the ground-state properties in a non-perturbative
manner. We report the dependence of the Bertsch parameter on the interaction strength and construct
a Pad\'e approximant which fits the numerical data and reproduces correctly the asymptotics in
the limits of weak and strong interactions. We find good agreement with beyond-mean field theory
for the energy and the condensate fraction. Pair distribution function and the static structure
factor are reported for a number of characteristic interactions. We demonstrate that the system
experiences gas-solid phase transition as a function of the dimensionless interaction strength.
A peculiarity of the system is that by changing the density it is not possible to induce the phase transition.
We show that the low-lying excitation spectrum contains plasmons in both phases, in agreement with
Bogoliubov and HA theories. Finally, we argue that this model can be interpreted as a realization
of the unitary limit in Bose system with the advantage that the system stays in the genuine ground
state contrarily to the metastable state realized in experiments with short-range Bose gases.
