We present the results of numerical simulation of magnetodielectric effect (MDE) in magnetorheological
elastomers (MRE) - the change of effective permittivity of elastomer placed under the external
magnetic field. The computer model of effect is based on the assumption about the displacement of
magnetic particles inside the elastic matrix under the external magnetic field and the formation
of chain-like structures. Such displacement of metallic particles between the planes of capacitor
leads to the change of capacity, which can be considered as a change of effective permittivity of
elastomer caused by magnetic field (magnetodielectric effect). In the literature mainly 2D approach
was used to model similar effect. In this paper we present the new approach of magnetorheological
elastomers simulation - 3D-model of magnetodielectric effect with ability to simulate systems
of around 100000 particles. Within the framework of the model three types of particle size distributions
were simulated which gives an advantage over previously reported approaches. Lognormal size distribution
was shown to give better qualitative match of the modeling and experimental results than monosized
type. The developed model resulted in perfect qualitative agreement with all experimental data
obtained earlier for Fe-based elastomers. The proposed model is useful to study these novel functional
materials, analyze the features of magnetodielectric effect and predict the optimal composition
of magnetorheological elastomers for further profound experimental study.
