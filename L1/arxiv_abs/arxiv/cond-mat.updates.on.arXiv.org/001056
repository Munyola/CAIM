To find the regularities of formed fingers in gravity driven coating flows on upper cylinder and
sphere, the mathematical formulation to model the fingering instability on cylindrical or spherical
surface which consists of a capillary wave equation and a linear perturbation equation is constructed,
based on the leading order governing equation in standard cylindrical or spherical coordinate
system. A disjoining pressure model is introduced to simulate the partial wetting process near
moving contact line. The fingering number in high $Bo$ coating flow is focused on from a linear perspective.
Using an asymptotic theory, the high $Bo$ limits of the linear perturbation equations for both the
cylindrical and spherical problems are proved to degenerate into a common eigenvalue problem.
Two analytical formulae concerning the most unstable wave number which can be described as two power
laws are derived via a method of modal analysis for the cylindrical and spherical problem, respectively.
These formulae provide a succinct method to estimate the fingering number if the onset of the fingering
instability is known. A method of transient growth analysis which makes no high $Bo$ assumptions
is used to verify the accuracy of the asymptotic theory and modal analysis. In particular, an asymptotic
behavior of the most unstable wave number as $Bo$ increases is highlighted. We show that the linear
growth rate may be improved by the disjoining pressure, which can be attributed to the effect of partial
wetting, but the most unstable wave number is insensitive to the wetting model.
