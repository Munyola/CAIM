Electrically conducting films in a time-varying transverse applied magnetic field are considered.
Their behavior is strongly influenced by the self-field of the induced currents, making the electrodynamics
nonlocal, and consequently difficult to analyze both numerically and analytically. We present
a formalism which allows many phenomena related to superconducting and Ohmic films to be modelled
and analyzed. The formalism is based on the Maxwell equations, and a material current-voltage characteristics,
linear for normal metals, and nonlinear for superconductors, plus a careful account of the boundary
conditions. For Ohmic films, we consider the response to a delta function source-field turned on
instantly. As one of few problems in nonlocal electrodynamics, this has an analytical solution,
which we obtain, in both Fourier and real space. Next, the dynamical behaviour of a square superconductor
film during ramping up of the field, and subsequently returning to zero, is treated numerically.
Then, this remanent state is used as initial condition for triggering thermomagnetic avalanches.
The avalanches tend to invade the central part where the density of trapped flux is largest, forming
dendritic patterns in excellent agreement with magneto-optical images. Detailed profiles of
current and flux density are presented and discussed. Finally, the formalism is extended to multiply
connected samples, and numerical results for a patterned superconducting film, a ring with a square
lattice of antidots, are presented and discussed.
