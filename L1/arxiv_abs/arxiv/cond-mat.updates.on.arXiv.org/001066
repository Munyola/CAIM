We present ab initio calculations of the photoemission spectra of bulk sodium using different flavors
of the cumulant expansion approximation for the Green's function. In particular, we study the dispersion
and intensity of the plasmon satellites. We show that the satellite spectrum is much more sensitive
to many details than the quasi-particle (QP) spectrum, which suggests that the experimental investigation
of satellites could yield additional information beyond the usual studies of the band structure.
In particular, a comparison to the homogeneous electron gas (HEG) shows that the satellites are
influenced by the crystal environment, although the crystal potential in sodium is weak. Moreover,
the temperature dependence of the lattice constant is reflected in the position of the satellites.
Details of the screening also play an important role; in particular, the contribution of transitions
from 2s and 2p semi-core levels influence the satellites, but not the QP. Moreover, inclusion of
contributions to the screening beyond the RPA has an effect on the satellites. Finally, we elucidate
the importance of the coupling of electrons and holes by comparing the results of the time-ordered
(TOC) and the retarded (RC) cumulant expansion approximations. Again, we find small but noticeable
differences. Since all the small effects add up, our most advanced calculation yields a satellite
position which is improved with respect to previous calculations by almost one eV. This stresses
the fact that the calculation of satellites is much more delicate than the calculation of a QP band
structure.
