Confinement can modify the dynamics, the thermodynamics and the structural properties of liquid
water, the prototypical anomalous liquid. By considering a general anomalous liquid, suitable
for globular proteins, colloids or liquid metals, we study by molecular dynamics simulations the
effect of a solvophilic structured and a solvophobic unstructured wall on the phases, the crystal
nucleation and the dynamics of the fluid. We find that at low temperatures the large density of the
solvophilic wall induces a high-density, high-energy structure in the first layer ("tempting"
effect). In turn, the first layer induces a "molding" effect on the second layer determining a structure
with reduced energy and density, closer to the average density of the system. This low-density,
low-energy structure propagates further through the layers by templating effect and can involve
all the existing layers at the lowest temperatures investigated. Therefore, although the high-density,
high-energy structure does not self-reproduce further than the first layer, the structured wall
can have a long-range effect thanks to a sequence of templating, molding and templating effects
through the layers. We find dynamical slowing down of the solvent near the solvophilic wall but with
largely heterogeneous dynamics near the wall due to superdiffusive liquid veins within a frozen
matrix of solvent. Hence, the partial freezing of the first hydration layer does not correspond
necessarily to an effective reduction of the channel section in terms of transport properties.
