We consider a general two-component plasma of classical pointlike charges $+e$ ($e$ is say the elementary
charge) and $-Z e$ (valency $Z=1,2,\ldots$), living on the surface of a sphere of radius $R$. The
system is in thermal equilibrium at the inverse temperature $\beta$, in the stability region against
collapse of oppositely charged particle pairs $\beta e^2 < 2/Z$. We study the effect of the system
excess charge $Q e$ on the finite-size expansion of the (dimensionless) grand potential $\beta\Omega$.
By combining the stereographic projection of the sphere onto an infinite plane, the linear response
theory and the planar results for the second moments of the species density correlation functions
we show that for any $\beta e^2 < 2/Z$ the large-$R$ expansion of the grand potential is of the form
$\beta\Omega \sim A_V R^2 + [\chi/6 - \beta (Qe)^2/2] \ln R$, where $A_V$ is the non-universal coefficient
of the volume (bulk) part and the Euler number of the sphere $\chi=2$. The same formula, containing
also a non-universal surface term proportional to $R$, was obtained previously for the disc domain
($\chi=1$), in the case of the symmetric $(Z=1)$ two-component plasma at the collapse point $\beta
e^2=2$ and the jellium model $(Z\to 0)$ of identical $e$-charges in a fixed neutralizing background
charge density at any coupling $\beta e^2$ being an even integer. Our result thus indicates that
the prefactor to the logarithmic finite-size expansion does not depend on the composition of the
Coulomb fluid and its non-universal part $-\beta (Qe)^2/2$ is independent of the geometry of the
confining domain.
