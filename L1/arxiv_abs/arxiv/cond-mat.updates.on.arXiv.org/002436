Analytical description of domain structure morphology and phase diagrams of ferroelectric nanoparticles
is evolved in the framework of Landau Ginzburg Devonshire approach. To model realistic conditions
of spontaneous polarization incomplete screening at the particle surface it was regarded covered
by an ultra thin layer of screening charge with finite screening length. The phase diagrams, calculated
for spherical Sn2P2S6 nanoparticles in coordinates "temperature and surface screening length"
by finite element modeling, demonstrate the appearance of polydomain region in the tricritical
point and its broadening with the screening length increase for the particle radius more than critical
value. Metastable labyrinthine domain region exists in Sn2P2S6 nanoparticles with radius 10 nm
and more, similarly to the case of CuInP2S6 nanoparticles considered previously. We derived simple
analytical expressions for the boundaries between paraelectric, singledomain and polydomain
ferroelectric phases, tricritical point and necessary condition for labyrinthine domain appearance,
and demonstrated their high accuracy in comparison with finite element modeling results. Analytical
description shows that phase diagrams and domain morphologies, which are qualitatively similar
to the ones calculated in this work, can be expected in other ferroelectric nanoparticles covered
by the screening charges, being rather different for the ferroelectrics with the first and second
order ferroelectric paraelectric transitions respectively.
