The electronic structure of Si(110)"16 x 2" double-domain, single-domain and 1 x 1 surfaces have
been investigated using spin- and angle-resolved photoemission at sample temperatures of 77 K
and 300 K. Angle-resolved photoemission was conducted using horizontally- and vertically-polarised
60 eV and 80 eV photons. Band-dispersion maps revealed four surface states ($S_1$ to $S_4$) which
were assigned to silicon dangling bonds on the basis of measured binding energies and photoemission
intensity changes between horizontal and vertical light polarisations. Three surface states
($S_1$, $S_2$ and $S_4$), observed in the Si(110)"16 x 2" reconstruction, were assigned to Si adatoms
and Si atoms present at the edges of the corrugated terrace structure. Only one of the four surface
states, $S_3$, was observed in both the Si(110)"16 x 2" and 1 x 1 band maps and consequently attributed
to the pervasive Si zigzag chains that are components of both the Si(110)"16 x 2" and 1 x 1 surfaces.
A state in the bulk-band region was attributed to an in-plane bond. All data were consistent with
the adatom-buckling model of the Si(110)"16 x 2" surface. Whilst room temperature measurements
of $P_y$ and $P_z$ were statistically compatible with zero, $P_x$ measurements of the enantiomorphic
A-type and B-type Si(110)"16 x 2" surfaces gave small average polarisations of around 1.5\% that
were opposite in sign. Further measurements at 77 K on A-type Si(110)"16 x 2" surface gave a smaller
value of +0.3\%. An upper limit of $\sim1\%$ may thus be taken for the longitudinal polarisation.
