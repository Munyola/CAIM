Topological orders and associated topological protected excitations satisfying Abelian or non-Abelian
statistics have been widely explored in various platforms. In recent years, the Majorana zero modes
with these features have been realized in experiments based on semiconductor and superconducting
hybrid structures, opening an exciting avenue for realization of fault-tolerant topological
quantum computations. The $\mathbb{Z}_3$ parafermions are regarded as the most natural generation
of the Majorana fermions for realizing of more intriguing topological orders. In this work, we investigate
the topological phase and emergent fermions in an extended parafermion chain using exact numerical
methods. This model exhibits rich variety of phases, including threefold degenerate topological
ferromagnetic phase, trivial paramagnetic phase, XX phase, dimer phase, chiral phase and commensurate
phase. We present a smooth connection between this model and the extended spin-${1\over 2}$ XX model,
by which we can generalize their measurements, such as the order parameters and long-range spin-spin
correlations {\it etc}, to fully characterize the properties of these phases and map out their corresponding
phase diagram. Strikingly, we find that all the phase boundaries finally merge to a single supercritical
point, determined by the extended three-state Potts model. This approach opens a wide range of intriguing
applications in investigating the phases and emergent phenomena in other $\mathbb{Z}_k$ parafermion
models, and may be also illuminating for their experimental realizations.
