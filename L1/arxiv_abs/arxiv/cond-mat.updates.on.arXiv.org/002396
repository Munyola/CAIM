The electric field induced quantum phase transition from topological to conventional insulator
has been proposed as the basis of a topological field effect transistor [1-4]. In this scheme an electric
field can switch 'on' the ballistic flow of charge and spin along dissipationless edges of the two-dimensional
(2D) quantum spin Hall insulator [5-9], and when 'off' is a conventional insulator with no conductive
channels. Such as topological transistor is promising for low-energy logic circuits [4], which
would necessitate electric field-switched materials with conventional and topological bandgaps
much greater than room temperature, significantly greater than proposed to date [6-8]. Topological
Dirac semimetals(TDS) are promising systems in which to look for topological field-effect switching,
as they lie at the boundary between conventional and topological phases [3,10-16]. Here we use scanning
probe microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/STS) and angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy (ARPES)
to show that mono- and bilayer films of TDS Na3Bi [3,17] are 2D topological insulators with bulk bandgaps
>400 meV in the absence of electric field. Upon application of electric field by doping with potassium
or by close approach of the STM tip, the bandgap can be completely closed then re-opened with conventional
gap greater than 100 meV. The large bandgaps in both the conventional and quantum spin Hall phases,
much greater than the thermal energy kT = 25 meV at room temperature, suggest that ultrathin Na3Bi
is suitable for room temperature topological transistor operation.
