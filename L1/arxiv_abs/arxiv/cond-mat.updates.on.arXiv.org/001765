Non-uniform fields are commonly used to study vesicle dielectrophoresis and can be used to hitherto
relatively unexplored areas of vesicle deformation and electroporation. A common but perplexing
problem in vesicle dynamics is the cross over from the entropic to enthalpic (stretching) tension
during vesicle deformation. A lucid demonstration of this concept is provided by the study of vesicle
deformation and dielectrophoresis under axisymmetric quadrupole electric field. Small deformation
theory incorporating the Maxwell stress approach is used (employing area and volume conservation
constraints) to estimate the dielectrophoretic velocity. The entropic and enthalpic tensions
are implemented to understand vesicle electrohydrodynamics in low and high tension limits. The
shapes obtained using the entropic and the enthalpic approaches, show significant differences.
A strong dependence of the final vesicle shapes on the ratio of electrical conductivities of the
fluids inside and outside the vesicle as well as on the frequency of the applied quadrupole electric
field is observed which could be used to estimate electromechanical properties of the vesicle.
Moreover, an excess area dependent transition between the entropic and enthalpic regimes is observed.
The Maxwell stress approach, used in this work, indicates that Clausius-Mossotti factor obtained
by the dipole moment method together with the drag on a rigid sphere explains vesicle dielectrophoresis.
Interestingly, the coupling of hydrodynamic and electric stress, important in drops is absent
in vesicle dielectrophoresis to linear order.
