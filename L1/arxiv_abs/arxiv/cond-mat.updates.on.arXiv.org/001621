Superconductivity in noncentrosymmetric compounds has attracted sustained interest in the last
decades. Here we present a detailed study on the transport, thermodynamic properties and the band
structure of the noncentrosymmetric superconductor La$_7$Ir$_3$ ($T_c$ $\sim$2.3 K) that was
recently proposed to break the time-reversal symmetry. It is found that La$_7$Ir$_3$ displays
a moderately large electronic heat capacity (Sommerfeld coefficient $\gamma_n$ $\sim$ 53.1 mJ/mol
$\text{K}^2$) and a significantly enhanced Kadowaki-Woods ratio (KWR $\sim$ 32 $\mu\Omega$ cm
mol$^2$ K$^2$ J$^{-2}$) that is greater than the typical value ($\sim$ 10 $\mu\Omega$ cm mol$^2$
K$^2$ J$^{-2}$) for strongly correlated electron systems. The upper critical field $H_{c2}$ was
seen to be nicely described by the single-band Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg model down to very
low temperatures. The hydrostatic pressure effects on the superconductivity were also investigated.
The heat capacity below $T_c$ reveals a dominant s-wave gap with the magnitude close to the BCS value.
The first-principles calculations yield the electron-phonon coupling constant $\lambda$ = 0.81
and the logarithmically averaged frequency $\omega_{ln}$ = 78.5 K, resulting in a theoretical
$T_c$ = 2.5 K, close to the experimental value. Our calculations suggest that the enhanced electronic
heat capacity is more likely due to electron-phonon coupling, rather than the electron-electron
correlation effects. Collectively, these results place severe constraints on any theory of exotic
superconductivity in this system.
