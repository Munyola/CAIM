Exploration of structure-property relationships as a function of dopant concentration is commonly
based on mean field theories for solid solutions. However, such theories that work well for semiconductors
tend to fail in materials with strong correlations, either in electronic behavior or chemical segregation.
In these cases, the details of atomic arrangements are generally not explored and analyzed. The
knowledge of the generative physics and chemistry of the material can obviate this problem, since
defect configuration libraries as stochastic representation of atomic level structures can be
generated, or parameters of mesoscopic thermodynamic models can be derived. To obtain such information
for improved predictions, we use data from atomically resolved microscopic images that visualize
complex structural correlations within the system and translate them into statistical mechanical
models of structure formation. Given the significant uncertainties about the microscopic aspects
of the material's processing history along with the limited number of available images, we combine
model optimization techniques with the principles of statistical hypothesis testing. We demonstrate
the approach on data from a series of atomically-resolved scanning transmission electron microscopy
images of Mo$_x$Re$_{1-x}$S$_2$ at varying ratios of Mo/Re stoichiometries, for which we propose
an effective interaction model that is then used to generate atomic configurations and make testable
predictions at a range of concentrations and formation temperatures.
