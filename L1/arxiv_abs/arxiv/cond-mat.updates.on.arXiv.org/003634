Metal-organic frameworks show both fundamental interest and great promise for applications in
adsorption-based technologies, such as the separation and storage of gases. The flexibility and
complexity of the molecular scaffold poses a considerable challenge to atomistic modeling, especially
when also considering the presence of guest molecules. We investigate the role played by quantum
and anharmonic fluctuations in the archetypical case of MOF-5, comparing the material at various
levels of methane loading. Accurate path integral simulations of such effects are made affordable
by the introduction of an accelerated simulation scheme and the use of an optimized force field based
on first-principles reference calculations. We find that the level of statistical treatment that
is required for predictive modeling depends significantly on the property of interest. The thermal
properties of the lattice are generally well described by a quantum harmonic treatment, with the
adsorbate behaving in a classical but strongly anharmonic manner. The heat capacity of the loaded
framework - which plays an important role in the characterization of the framework and in determining
its stability to thermal fluctuations during adsorption/desorption cycles - requires, however,
a full quantum and anharmonic treatment, either by path integral methods or by a simple but approximate
scheme. We also present molecular-level insight into the nanoscopic interactions contributing
to the material's properties and suggest design principles to optimize them
