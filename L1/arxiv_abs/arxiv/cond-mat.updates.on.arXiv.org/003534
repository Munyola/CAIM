I review the principal theories that have been proposed for the superconducting phases of UPt$_3$.
The detailed H-T phase diagram places constraints on any theory for the multiple superconducting
phases. I comment on the limitations of the models proposed so far for the superconducting phases
of UPt$_3$. I also find that a theory in which the order parameter belongs to an orbital 2D representation
coupled to a SBF is a viable model for the phases of UPt$_3$, based on the existing body of experimental
data. Specifically, I show that (1) the existing phase diagram (including an apparent tetracritical
point for all field orientations), (2) the anisotropy of the upper critical field over the full temperature
range, (3) the correlation between superconductivity and basal plane antiferromagnetism and
(4) low-temperature power laws in the transport and thermodynamic properties can be explained
qualitatively, and in many respects quantitatively, by an odd-parity, E$_{2u}$ order parameter
with a pair spin projection of zero along the ${\bf c}$-axis. The coupling of an AFM moment to the superconducting
order parameter acts as a symmetry breaking field (SBF) which is responsible for the apparent tetracritical
point, in addition to the zero-field double transition. The results presented here for the E$_{2u}$
representation are based on an analysis of the material parameters calculated within BCS theory
for the 2D representations, and a refinement of the SBF model of Hess, et al. [J. Phys. Condens. Matter,
1, 8135 (1989)]. I also discuss possible experiments to test the symmetry of the order parameter.
