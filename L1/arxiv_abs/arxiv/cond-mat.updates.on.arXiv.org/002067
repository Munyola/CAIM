Filtration, flow in narrow channels and traffic flow are examples of processes subject to blocking
when the channel conveying the particles becomes too crowded. If the blockage is temporary, which
means that after a finite time the channel is flushed and reopened, one expects to observe a maximum
throughput for a finite intensity of entering particles. We investigate this phenomenon by introducing
a queueing theory inspired, circular Markov model. Particles enter a channel with intensity $\lambda$
and exit at a rate $\mu$. If $N$ particles are present at the same time in the channel, the system becomes
blocked and no more particles can enter until the blockage is cleared after an exponentially distributed
time with rate $\mu^*$. We obtain an exact expression for the steady state throughput (including
the exiting blocked particles) for all values of $N$. For $N=2$ we show that the throughput assumes
a maximum value for finite $\lambda$ if $\mu^*/\mu < 1/4$. The time-dependent throughput either
monotonically approaches the steady state value, or reaches a maximum value at finite time. We demonstrate
that, in the steady state, this model can be mapped to a previously introduced non-Markovian model
with fixed transit and blockage times. We also examine an irreversible, non-Markovian blockage
process with constant transit time exposed to an entering flux of fixed intensity for a finite time
and we show that the first and second moments of the number of exiting particles are maximized for
a finite intensity.
