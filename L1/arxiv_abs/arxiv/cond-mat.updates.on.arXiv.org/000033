We develop statistical enumeration methods for self-avoiding walks using a powerful sampling
technique called the multicanonical Monte Carlo method. Using these methods, we estimate the numbers
of the two dimensional N-step self-avoiding walks up to N=256 with statistical errors. The developed
methods are based on statistical mechanical models of paths which include self-avoiding walks.
The criterion for selecting a suitable model for enumerating self-avoiding walks is whether or
not the configuration space of the model includes a set for which the number of the elements can be
exactly counted. We call this set a scale fixing set. We selected the following two models which satisfy
the criterion: the Go model for lattice proteins and the Domb-Joyce model for generalized random
walks. There is a contrast between these two models in the structures of the configuration space.
The configuration space of the Go model is defined as the universal set of self-avoiding walks, and
the set of the ground state conformation provides a scale fixing set. On the other hand, the configuration
space of the Domb-Joyce model is defined as the universal set of random walks which can be used as a
scale fixing set, and the set of the ground state conformation is the same as the universal set of self-avoiding
walks. From the perspective of enumeration performance, we conclude that the Domb-Joyce model
is the better of the two. The reason for the performance difference is partly explained by the existence
of the first-order phase transition of the Go model.
