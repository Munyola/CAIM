Quantum dots tuned to atomic resonances represent an emerging field of hybrid quantum systems where
the advantages of quantum dots and natural atoms can be combined. Embedding quantum dots in nanowires
boosts these systems with a set of powerful possibilities, such as precise positioning of the emitters,
excellent photon extraction efficiency and direct electrical contacting of quantum dots. Notably,
nanowire structures can be grown on silicon substrates, allowing for a straightforward integration
with silicon-based photonic devices. In this work we show controlled growth of nanowire-quantum-dot
structures on silicon, frequency tuned to atomic transitions. We grow GaAs quantum dots in AlGaAs
nanowires with a nearly pure crystal structure and excellent optical properties. We precisely
control the dimensions of quantum dots and their position inside nanowires, and demonstrate that
the emission wavelength can be engineered over the range of at least $30\,nm$ around $765\,nm$.
By applying an external magnetic field we are able to fine tune the emission frequency of our nanowire
quantum dots to the $D_{2}$ transition of $^{87}$Rb. We use the Rb transitions to precisely measure
the actual spectral linewidth of the photons emitted from a nanowire quantum dot to be $9.4 \pm 0.7
\mu eV$, under non-resonant excitation. Our work brings highly-desirable functionalities to
quantum technologies, enabling, for instance, a realization of a quantum network, based on an arbitrary
number of nanowire single-photon sources, all operating at the same frequency of an atomic transition.
