Recent demonstrations on manipulating antiferromagnetic (AF) order have triggered a growing
interest in antiferromagnetic metal (AFM), and potential high-density spintronic applications
demand further improvements in the anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR). The antiferromagnetic
semimetals (AFS) are newly discovered materials that possess massless Dirac fermions that are
protected by the crystalline symmetries. In this material, a reorientation of the AF order may break
the underlying symmetries and induce a finite energy gap. As such, the possible phase transition
from the semimetallic to insulating phase gives us a choice for a wide range of resistance ensuring
a large AMR. To further understand the robustness of the phase transition, we study thermal fluctuations
of the AF order in AFS at a finite temperature. For macroscopic samples, we find that the thermal fluctuations
effectively decrease the magnitude of the AF order by renormalizing the effective Hamiltonian.
Our finding suggests that the insulating phase exhibits a gap narrowing at elevated temperatures,
which leads to a substantial decrease in AMR. We also examine spatially correlated thermal fluctuations
for microscopic samples by solving the microscopic Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation finding
a qualitative difference of the gap narrowing in the insulating phase. For both cases, the semimetallic
phase shows a minimal change in its transmission spectrum illustrating the robustness of the symmetry
protected states in AFS. Our finding may serve as a guideline for estimating and maximizing AMR of
the AFS samples at elevated temperatures.
