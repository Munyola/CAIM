The Kondo and Periodic Anderson models describe many of the qualitative features of local moments
coupled to a conduction band, and thereby the physics of materials such as the heavy fermions. In
particular, when the exchange coupling $J$ or hybridization $V$ between the moments and the electrons
of the metallic band is large, singlets form, quenching the magnetism. In the opposite, small $J$
or $V$, limit, the moments survive, and the conduction electrons mediate an effective interaction
which can trigger long range, often antiferromagnetic, order. In the case of the Kondo model, where
the moments are described by local spins, Nozi\`eres considered the possibility that the available
conduction electrons within the Kondo temperature of the Fermi surface would be insufficient in
number to accomplish the screening. Much effort in the literature has been devoted to the study of
the temperature scales in the resulting `exhaustion' problem, and how the `coherence temperature'
where a heavy Fermi liquid forms is related to the Kondo temperature. In this paper, we study a version
of the Periodic Anderson model in which some of the conduction electrons are removed in a way which
avoids the fermion sign problem and hence allows low temperature Quantum Monte Carlo simulations
which can access both singlet formation and magnetic ordering temperature scales. We are then able
to focus on a somewhat different aspect of exhaustion physics than previously considered: the effect
of dilution on the critical $V$ for the singlet-antiferromagnetic transition.
