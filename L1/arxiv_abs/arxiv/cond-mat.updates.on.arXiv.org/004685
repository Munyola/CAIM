LaOBiPbS$_3$ is a kind of pnictogen-dichalcogenide layered compounds, which have recently been
experimentally investigated as thermoelectric materials owing to their low thermal conductivity
and high controllability of constituent elements. However, thermoelectric performance of LaOBiPbS$_3$
is at present not very high and that of its analogous compounds remains to be unknown. In this study,
we theoretically investigate thermoelectric properties of 24 possible variations of the constituent
elements in LaOBiPbS$_3$ from the viewpoint of the electronic structure. We find that some compounds
can have much better thermoelectric performance than LaOBiPbS$_3$; in particular, LaOSbPbSe$_3$
is predicted to have a power factor five times as large as that of LaOBiPbS$_3$. Here, the choice of
the pnictogen atom (As, Sb, and Bi), of which the low-energy conduction bands mainly consist, correlates
with the calculated power factor and the dimensionless figure of merit, $ZT$. Such correlation
comes from the fact that the low-dimensionality of the electronic structure, which enhances the
density of states near the band edge, strongly depends on the pnictogen atom through, e.g., the strength
of the spin-orbit coupling. Moreover, hybridization of the wave functions in the pnictogen-dichalcogenide
layer and those in the rock-salt layer plays a key role in gap opening, and thus is important for achieving
high thermoelectric performance. In LaOSbPbSe$_3$, such hybridization also pushes up the conduction
band bottom, which enhances the density of states near the band edge and thus the power factor.
