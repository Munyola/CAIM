Eco-evolutionary frameworks can explain certain features of communities in which ecological
and evolutionary processes occur over comparable timescales. In the particular case of prey-predator
systems, a combination of empirical and theoretical studies have explored this possibility, showing
that the evolution of prey traits, predator traits or the coevolution of both can contribute to the
stability of the community, as well as to the emergence of various types of population cycles. However,
these studies overlook that interactions are spatially constrained, a crucial ingredient known
to foster species coexistence per se. Here, we investigate whether evolutionary dynamics interacts
with the spatial structure of a prey-predator community in which both species show limited mobility
and predators perceptual ranges are subject to natural selection. In these conditions, our results
unveil an eco-evolutionary feedback between species spatial mixing and predators perceptual
range: different levels of species mixing select for different perceptual ranges, which in turn
reshape the spatial distribution of preys and their interaction with predators. This emergent
pattern of interspecific interactions feeds back to the efficiency of the various perceptual ranges,
thus selecting for new ones. Finally, since prey-predator mixing is the key factor that regulates
the intensity of predation, we explore the community-level implications of such feedback and show
that it controls both coexistence times and species extinction probabilities.
