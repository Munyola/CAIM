The particle-hole (PH) symmetry at half-filled Landau level requires the relationship between
the flux number N_phi and the particle number N on a sphere to be exactly N_phi - 2(N-1) = 1. It is shown
that the many-body composite electron wave function and its PH conjugated composite hole wave function
satisfying the N_phi and N relationship at half-filling can be formed from the two components of
the same spinor wave function of a massless Dirac fermion at zero-magnetic field. It is further shown
that away from half-filling, the many-body composite electron wave function at filling factor
nu and its PH conjugated composite hole wave function at 1-nu can be formed from the two components
of the very same spinor wave functions of a massless Dirac fermion at non-zero magnetic field. This
relationship leads naturally to a very simple Dirac composite fermion effective field theory,
where the two-component Dirac fermion field is a particle-hole spinor field coupled to the same
emergent gauge field, with one field component describing the composite electrons and the other
describing the PH conjugated composite holes. As such, the density of the Dirac spinor field is the
density sum of the composite electron and hole field components, and therefore is equal to the degeneracy
of the Lowest Landau level. On the other hand, the charge density coupled to the external magnetic
field is the density difference between the composite electron and hole field components, and is
therefore neutral at exactly half-filling.
