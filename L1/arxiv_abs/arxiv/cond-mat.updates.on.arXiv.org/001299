Analytical solutions for the surface state (SS) of an extended Wolff Hamiltonian, which is a common
Hamiltonian for strongly spin-orbit coupled systems, are obtained both for semi-infinite and
finite-thickness boundary conditions. For the semi-infinite system, there are three types of
SS solutions: (I-a) linearly crossing SSs in the direct bulk band gap, (I-b) SSs with linear dispersions
entering the bulk conduction or valence bands away from the band edge, and (II) SSs with nearly flat
dispersions entering the bulk state at the band edge. For the finite-thickness system, a gap opens
in the SS of solution I-a. Numerical solutions for the SS are also obtained based on the tight-binding
model of Liu and Allen [Phys. Rev. B, 52, 1566 (1995)] for Bi$_{1-x}$Sb$_x$ ($0\le x \le 0.1$). A perfect
correspondence between the analytic and numerical solutions is obtained around the $\bar{M}$
point including their thickness dependence. This is the first time that the character of the SS numerically
obtained is identified with the help of analytical solutions. The size of the gap for I-a SS can be
larger than that of bulk band gap even for a "thick" films ($\lesssim 200$ bilayers $\simeq 80$ nm)
of pure bismuth. Consequently, in such a film of Bi$_{1-x}$Sb$_x$, there is no apparent change in
the SSs through the band inversion at $x\simeq 0.04$, even though the nature of the SS is changed from
solution I-a to I-b. Based on our theoretical results, the experimental results on the SS of Bi$_{1-x}$Sb$_x$
($0\le x \lesssim 0.1$) are duscussed.
