Over the last decade, progress in wide bandgap, III-V materials systems based on gallium nitride
(GaN) has been a major driver in the realization of high power and high frequency electronic devices.
Since the highly conductive, two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) at the AlGaN/GaN interface is
based on built-in polarization fields (not doping) and is confined to very small thicknesses, its
charge carriers exhibit much higher mobilities in comparison to their doped counterparts. In this
study, we show that this heterostructured material also offers the unique ability to manipulate
electrical transport separately from thermal transport through the examination of fully-suspended
AlGaN/GaN diaphragms of varied GaN buffer layer thicknesses. Notably, we show that ~$100$ nm thin
GaN layers can considerably impede heat flow without electrical transport degradation, and that
a significant improvement (~$4$x) in the thermoelectric figure of merit ($\it zT$) over externally
doped GaN is observed in 2DEG based heterostructures. We also observe state-of-the art thermoelectric
power factors ($4-7\times$ $10^{-3}$$\,Wm^{-1}K^{-2}$) at room temperature) in the 2DEG of this
material system. This remarkable tuning behavior and thermoelectric enhancement, elucidated
here for the first time in a polarization-based heterostructure, is achieved since the electrons
are at the heterostructured interface, while the phonons are within the material system. These
results highlight the potential for using the 2DEG in III-V materials for on-chip thermal sensing
and energy harvesting.
