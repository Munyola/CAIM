Glassy carbon is a graphene-rich form of elemental carbon obtained from pyrolysis of polymers,
which is composed of three-dimensionally arranged, curved graphene fragments alongside fractions
of disordered carbon and voids. Pyrolysis encompasses gradual heating of polymers above 900 degree
C under inert atmosphere, followed by cooling to room temperature. Here we report on an experimental
method to perform in situ high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) for the direct
visualization of microstructural evolution in a pyrolyzing polymer in the 500-1200 degree C temperature
range. The results are compared with the existing microstructural models of glassy carbon. Reported
experiments are performed at 80 kV acceleration voltage using MEMS-based heating chips as sample
substrates to minimize any undesired beam-damage or sample preparation induced transformations.
The outcome suggests that the geometry, expansion and atomic arrangement within the resulting
graphene fragments constantly change during both heating and cooling, and that the intermediate
structures provide important cues on the evolution of glassy carbon from a precursor polymer. We
also detail how TEM data is easily misinterpreted due to projection effects, particularly in the
case of complex graphene-based materials. In addition to microstructural analysis, a complete
understanding of the pyrolysis process reported here will allow for a general process tuning specific
to the precursor polymer for obtaining glassy carbon with pre-defined properties.
