The control and manipulation of quantum systems without excitation is challenging, due to the complexities
in fully modeling such systems accurately and the difficulties in controlling these inherently
fragile systems experimentally. For example, while protocols to decompress Bose-Einstein condensates
(BEC) faster than the adiabatic timescale (without excitation or loss) have been well developed
theoretically, experimental implementations of these protocols have yet to reach speeds faster
than the adiabatic timescale. In this work, we experimentally demonstrate an alternative approach
based on a machine learning algorithm which makes progress towards this goal. The algorithm is given
control of the coupled decompression and transport of a metastable helium condensate, with its
performance determined after each experimental iteration by measuring the excitations of the
resultant BEC. After each iteration the algorithm adjusts its internal model of the system to create
an improved control output for the next iteration. Given sufficient control over the decompression,
the algorithm converges to a novel solution that sets the current speed record in relation to the
adiabatic timescale, beating out other experimental realizations based on theoretical approaches.
This method presents a feasible approach for implementing fast state preparations or transformations
in other quantum systems, without requiring a solution to a theoretical model of the system. Implications
for fundamental physics and cooling are discussed.
