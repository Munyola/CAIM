The inherent susceptibility of low-dimensional materials to thermal fluctuations has long been
expected to poses a major challenge to achieving intrinsic long-range ferromagnetic order in two-dimensional
materials. The recent explosion of interest in atomically thin materials and their assembly into
van der Waals heterostructures has renewed interest in two-dimensional ferromagnetism, which
is interesting from a fundamental scientific point of view and also offers a missing ingredient
necessary for the realization of spintronic functionality in van der Waals heterostructures.
Recently several atomically thin materials have been shown to be robust ferromagnets. Such ferromagnetism
is thought to be enabled by magneto crystalline anisotropy which suppresses thermal fluctuations.
In this article, we review recent progress in two-dimensional ferromagnetism in detail and predict
new possible two-dimensional ferromagnetic materials. We also discuss the prospects for applications
of atomically thin ferromagnets in novel dissipationless electronics, spintronics, and other
conventional magnetic technologies. Particularly atomically thin ferromagnets are promising
to realize time reversal symmetry breaking in two-dimensional topological systems, providing
a platform for electronic devices based on the quantum anomalous Hall Effect showing dissipationless
transport. Our proposed directions will assist the scientific community to explore novel two-dimensional
ferromagnetic families which can spawn new technologies and further improve the fundamental understanding
of this fascinating area.
