The theoretical and numerical models for gravity driven coating flow on upper cylinder and sphere
are formulated. Using a perturbation method, the governing equations which depend on one Bond number
$Bo$ are derived for a liquid film flow down the outside of a horizontal cylinder and a sphere. They
can be simplified to one-dimensional form due to the symmetries. The general structure of the two-dimensional
and axisymmetric capillary waves under high $Bo$ condition is focused on. An asymptotic theory
is used to solve for the free-surface profiles in the outer and inner region, respectively. Even
though the evolution in the outer region is essentially different, there are inherent similarities
in the inner region because the capillary ridges are proved to degenerate into the one-parameter
family in high $Bo$ limit. Using appropriate numerical techniques, some parametric studies are
performed on the profiles of the capillary waves. The spreading of the front recorded from the outer
solutions quantitatively accords with the scaling laws in a top region at early time, but deviates
obviously at later time. The comparison between the composite solutions constructed using the
asymptotic theory and direct solutions calculated from the evolution equations is highlighted
via both the global and local features. Agreement between the composite solutions and the direct
solutions is good for high $Bo$ cases. This asymptotic behavior is common on both of cylindrical
and spherical surfaces and not affected by the partial wetting process.
