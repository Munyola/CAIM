Recent ARPES measurement on electron-doped cuprate $\mathrm{Pr}_{1.3-x}\mathrm{La}_{0.7}\mathrm{Ce}_{x}\mathrm{CuO}_{4}$
find that the pseudogap along the boundary of the antiferromagnetic Brillouin zone(AFBZ) exhibits
dramatic momentum dependence. In particular, the pseudogap closes in a finite region around the
anti-nodal point, in which the electron spectral function evolves into a single broadened peak.
Such an observation is argued to be inconsistent with the antiferromagnetic(AFM) band folding
picture, which predicts a constant pseudogap along the AFBZ boundary. On the other hand, it is argued
that the experimental results are consistent with the prediction of the cluster-dynamical-mean-field-theory(CDMFT),
in which the pseudogap is interpreted as a s-wave splitting between the Hubbard bands and the in-gap
states in the Hubbard model. Here we show that the observed momentum dependence of the pseudogap
is indeed consistent with AFM band folding picture, provided that we assume the existence of a strongly
momentum dependent quasiparticle scattering rate. More specifically, we show that the quasiparticle
scattering rate acts to reduce the spectral gap induced by AFM band folding process. The spectral
gap can even be totally closed when the scattering rate exceeds the bare band folding gap. We thus
argue that it is the nodal-antinodal dichotomy in the quasiparticle coherence that is responsible
for the observed momentum dependence of the pseudogap in $\mathrm{Pr}_{1.3-x}\mathrm{La}_{0.7}\mathrm{Ce}_{x}\mathrm{CuO}_{4}$.
