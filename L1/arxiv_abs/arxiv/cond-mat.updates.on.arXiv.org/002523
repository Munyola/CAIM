Optical properties of Co-doped ZnO are analyzed within the generalized gradient approximation
to the density functional theory. Previous luminescence and/or absorption experiments revealed
two ionization and one intrashell transition of $d(\textrm{Co}^{2+})$ electrons. Our calculated
transition energies agree well with the measurements. The two ionization channels involve electron
excitations from the two $\textrm{Co}^{2+}$ gap states, the $t_{2\uparrow}$ triplet and the $e_{2\downarrow}$
doublet, to the conduction band. The third possible ionization channel, in which an electron is
excited from the valence band to the $\textrm{Co}^{2+}$ level, requires energy in excess of 4~eV,
and cannot lead to absorption below the ZnO band gap, contrary to earlier suggestions. We also consider
two recombination channels, the direct recombination and a two-step process, in which a photoelectron
is captured by $\textrm{Co}^{3+}$ and then recombines via the internal transition. Finally, the
observed increase the band gap with the Co concentration is well reproduced by theory. A correct
description of ZnO:Co is achieved after including $+U$ corrections to the relevant orbitals of
Zn, O, and Co. Ionization of Co induces large energy shifts of the gap levels, driven by the varying
Coulomb coupling between the $d(\textrm{Co})$ electrons, and by large lattice relaxations around
Co ions. In turn, over $\sim 1$~eV changes of $\textrm{Co}^{2+}$ levels during the internal transition
are mainly caused by the occupation-dependent $U(\textrm{Co})$ corrections.
