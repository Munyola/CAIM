To mitigate climate change, our global society is harnessing direct (solar irradiation) and indirect
(wind/water flow) sources of renewable electrical power generation. Emerging direct sources
include current-producing thermal gradients in thermoelectric materials, while quantum physics-driven
processes to convert quantum information into energy have been demonstrated at very low temperatures.
The magnetic state of matter, assembled by ordering the electron's quantum spin property, represents
a sizeable source of built-in energy. We propose that magnetic matter, when conditioned into a specific
current path containing so-called 'spinterfaces', can constitute a direct source of electrical
power at room temperature. As a rare experimental event, we demonstrate how this path can generate
0.1nW at room temperature across a spintronic device called the magnetic tunnel junction, assembled
using commonplace Co, C and MgO materials. The presence of this path in our experiment, which also
generates very high spintronic performance, is confirmed by analytical and ab-initio calculations.
With maintaining the magnetic state as its only requirement, this direct source of electrical power
can in principle operate autonomously and indefinitely if the device's heat dissipation is managed.
Further developing this concept can fundamentally alter our energy-driven society's global economic,
social and geopolitical constructs. Our work demonstrates how spinterfaces can enable a nano-object's
quantum properties within a solid-state device's operation at room temperature.
