We report a detailed first principles study on the structural, elastic, vibrational and thermodynamic
properties of layered structure energetic alkali metal azides KN$_3$ and RbN$_3$. All the calculations
were carried out by means of plane wave pseudopotential method with and without including van der
Waals interactions. The calculated ground state structural properties are improved to a greater
extent by the inclusion of dispersion corrections, implies that the van der Waals interactions
play a major role on the physical properties of these systems. The elastic constants and the related
bulk mechanical properties for the tetragonal KN$_3$ and RbN$_3$ have been calculated using both
the methods and found that the compounds are mechanically stable systems. The magnitude of the calculated
elastic constants increases in the order RbN$_3$ $<$ KN$_3$ implying higher elastic stiffness
for KN$_3$, the fact also confirmed by the higher values of bulk, shear and Young's moduli of KN$_3$
than RbN$_3$. Moreover, the calculated elastic constants follows the inequality C$_{33}$ $<$
C$_{11}$ which indicates the presence of more number of intermolecular interactions along a-axis
over c-axis of the azide lattices. A correlation has been proposed to relate the calculated elastic
constants to the decomposition phenomena for the metal azides. The experimentally reported vibrational
frequencies at the gamma point were exactly reproduced by the present calculations. In addition,
we also present the thermodynamic properties such as heat capacity which compares well with the
experiment.
