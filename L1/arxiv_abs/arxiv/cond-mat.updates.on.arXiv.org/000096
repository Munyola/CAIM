High engineering critical current density JE of >500 A/mm2 at 20 T and 4.2 K can be regularly achieved
in Ag-sheathed multifilamentary Bi2Sr2CaCu2Ox (Bi-2212) round wire when the sample length is
several centimeters. However, JE(20 T) in Bi-2212 wires of several meters length, as well as longer
pieces wound in coils, rarely exceeds 200 A/mm2. Moreover, long-length wires often exhibit signs
of Bi-2212 leakage after melt processing that are rarely found in short, open-end samples. We studied
the length dependence of JE of state-of-the-art powder-in-tube (PIT) Bi-2212 wires and gases released
by them during melt processing using mass spectroscopy, confirming that JE degradation with length
is due to wire swelling produced by high internal gas pressures at elevated temperatures [1,2].
We further modeled the gas transport in Bi-2212 wires and examined the wire expansion at critical
stages of the melt processing of as-drawn PIT wires and the wires that received a degassing treatment
or a cold-densification treatment before melt processing. These investigations showed that internal
gas pressure in long-length wires drives creep of the Ag sheath during the heat treatment, causing
wire to expand, lowering the density of Bi-2212 filaments, and therefore degrading the wire JE;
the creep rupture of silver sheath naturally leads to the leakage of Bi-2212 liquid. Our work shows
that proper control of such creep is the key to preventing Bi-2212 leakage and achieving high JE in
long-length Bi-2212 conductors and coils.
