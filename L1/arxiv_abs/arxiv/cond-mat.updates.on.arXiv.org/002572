We analyze the properties of the majority-vote (MV) model, one of the simplest nonequilibrium systems
exhibiting an order-disorder phase transition, in the presence of an additional noise in which
a local spin can be changed independently of its neighborhood. In the standard MV, spins are aligned
with their local majority with probability $1-f$ and with complementary probability $f$, the majority
rule is not followed. In the noisy MV (NMV), a random spin flip is succeeded with probability $p$ (with
complementary $1-p$ the usual rule is accomplished). Such extra ingredient was considered by Vieira
and Crokidakis [Physica A {\bf 450}, 30 (2016)] for the square lattice. Here, we generalize the NMV
for an arbitrary network, including homogeneous [random regular (RR) and Erd\"os Renyi (ER)] and
heterogeneous [Barabasi-Albert (BA)] structures, through mean-field calculations and numerical
simulations. Results coming from both approaches are in excellent agreement with each other. Our
results show that the presence of additional noise does not affect the classification of phase transition,
which remains continuous irrespective of the network degree and its distribution. The critical
point and the threshold probability $p_t$ marking the disappearance of the ordered phase depend
on the node distribution and increase with the connectivity $k$. The critical behavior, investigated
numerically, exhibits a common set of critical exponents for RR and ER topologies, but different
from BA and regular lattices. In addition, a previous proposition of a first-order transition in
the NMV for large $k$'s is dropped.
