The formation of self assembled structures such as micelles has been intensively studied and is
well understood. The ability of a solution of amphiphilic molecules to develop micelles is depending
on the concentration and characterized by the critical micelle concentration (cmc), above which
micelle formation does occur. Recent studies use a lattice approach in order to determine cmc and
show that the correct modelling and analysis of cluster formations is highly non-trivial. We developed
a minimalistic coarse grained model for amphiphilic molecules in the continuum and simulated the
time evolution via dynamic Monte Carlo simulations in the canonical (NVT) ensemble. Starting from
a homogeneous system we observed and characterized how the initial fluctuations, yielding small
aggregates of amphiphilic molecules, end up in the growth of complete micelles. Our model is sufficiently
versatile to account for different structures of surfactant systems such as membranes, micelles
of variable radius and tubes at high particle densities by adjusting particle density and potential
properties. Particle densities and micellization rates are investigated and an order parameter
is introduced, so that the dependence of the micellization process on temperature and surfactant
density can be studied. The constant density of free particles for concentrations above cmc, e.
g. as expected from theoretical considerations, can be reproduced when choosing a careful definition
of free volumes. In the cmc regime at low temperatures different non-equilibrium effects are reported,
occurring even for very long time-scales.
