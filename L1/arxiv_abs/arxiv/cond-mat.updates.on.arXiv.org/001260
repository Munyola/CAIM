Excited states of a single donor in bulk silicon have previously been studied extensively based
on effective mass theory. However, a proper theoretical description of the excited states of a donor
cluster is still scarce. Here we study the excitations of lines of defects within a single-valley
spherical band approximation, thus mapping the problem to a scaled hydrogen atom array. A series
of detailed full configuration-interaction and time-dependent hybrid density-functional theory
calculations have been performed to understand linear clusters of up to 10 donors. Our studies illustrate
the generic features of their excited states, addressing the competition between formation of
inter-donor ionic states and intra-donor atomic excited states. At short inter-donor distances,
excited states of donor molecules are dominant, at intermediate distances ionic states play an
important role, and at long distances the intra-donor excitations are predominant as expected.
The calculations presented here emphasise the importance of correlations between donor electrons,
and are thus complementary to other recent approaches that include effective mass anisotropy and
multi-valley effects. The exchange splittings between relevant excited states have also been
estimated for a donor pair and for a three-donor arrays; the splittings are much larger than those
in the ground state in the range of donor separations between 10 and 20 nm. This establishes a solid
theoretical basis for the use of excited-state exchange interactions for controllable quantum
gate operations in silicon.
