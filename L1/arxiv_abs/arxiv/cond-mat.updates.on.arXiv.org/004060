In many real-world systems, information can be transmitted in two qualitatively different ways:
by {\em copying} or by {\em transformation}. {\em Copying} occurs when messages are transmitted
without modification, for example when an offspring receives an unaltered copy of a gene from its
parent. {\em Transformation} occurs when messages are modified in a systematic way during transmission,
e.g., when non-random mutations occur during biological reproduction. Standard information-theoretic
measures of information transmission, such as mutual information, do not distinguish these two
modes of information transfer, even though they may reflect different mechanisms and have different
functional consequences. We propose a decomposition of mutual information which separately quantifies
the information transmitted by copying versus the information transmitted by transformation.
Our measures of copy and transformation information are derived from a few simple axioms, and have
natural operationalizations in terms of hypothesis testing and thermodynamics. In this later
case, we show that our measure of copy information corresponds to the minimal amount of work needed
by a physical copying process, having special relevance for the physics of replication of biological
information. We demonstrate our measures on a real world dataset of amino acid substitution rates.
Our decomposition into copy and transformation information is general and applies to any system
in which the fidelity of copying, rather than simple predictability, is of critical relevance.
