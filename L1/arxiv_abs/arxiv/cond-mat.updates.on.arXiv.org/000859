We report the existence of intervalence charge transfer (IVCT) luminescence in Yb-doped fluorites
associated with Yb2+-Yb3+ mixed valence pairs. We show that the very broad band, anomalous emission
of Yb2+-doped CaF2 and SrF2, usually associated with impurity-trapped excitons, is, rather, an
IVCT luminescence associated with Yb2+-Yb3+ mixed valence pairs. It is very efficiently excited
by a two-photon upconversion mechanism. The IVCT vertical transition leaves the pair moieties
very far from their equilibrium structures; this explains the unexpectedly large band width of
the emission band and its low peak energy, because the large reorganization energies are substracted
from the normal emission. The ab initio IVCT energy diagrams explain the different luminescent
properties of Yb-doped CaF2, SrF2, BaF2, and SrCl2: the presence of IVCT luminescence in Yb-doped
CaF2 and SrF2; its coexistence with regular 5d-4f emission in SrF2; its absence in BaF2 and SrCl2;
the quenching of all emissions in BaF2; and the presence of additional 5d-4f emissions in SrCl2 which
are absent in SrF2. They also allow to interpret and reproduce recent experiments on transient photoluminescence
enhancement in Yb2+-doped CaF2 and SrF2, the appearence of Yb2+ 4f -5d absorption bands in the excitation
spectra of the IR Yb3+ emission in partly reduced CaF2:Yb3+ samples, and to identify the broad band
observed in the excitation spectrum of the so far called anomalous emission of SrF2:Yb2+ as an IVCT
absorption, which corresponds to an Yb2+ 4f5/2 -> Yb3+ 4f7/2 electron transfer.
