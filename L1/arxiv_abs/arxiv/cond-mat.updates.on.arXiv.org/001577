We theoretically consider a quantum magnetic impurity weakly coupled to a superconductor and obtain
the spectrum of subgap Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) states taking into account the effect of quantum
fluctuations, anisotropy and thermal excitations. We consider the experimentally relevant case
of a quantum impurity with easy- or hard-axis uniaxial anisotropy term $H_\text{anis}=-D\left(S^z\right)^2$,
which typically arise in magnetic atoms deposited on the surface of clean metals due to the presence
of strong spin-orbit coupling and lack of inversion symmetry. Quantum fluctuations are taken into
account at second-order in the coupling $J_K$ in the impurity Green's functions self-energy, and
considerably modify the subgap spectrum compared to the classical-spin approximation. For an
impurity with easy-axis anisotropy (parameter $D>0$), when either the spin $S\rightarrow \infty$
or the anisotropy parameter $D\rightarrow \infty$, the classical results are recovered very slowly
(i.e., as $1/S$ or $1/D$, respectively), implying that this limit is very hard to reach experimentally.
On the other hand, when $D<0$ (hard-axis anisotropy) the impurity never reaches the classical limit,
and the position of the YSR states differ considerably from the usual formulas. Importantly, at
finite temperature a thermally-excited quasiparticle continuum induced by the anisotropy arises
inside the $T=0$ gap, and cannot be reproduced within the classical approximation. Our results
point towards the importance of taking into account quantum fluctuations for the correct interpretation
of STM experiments.
