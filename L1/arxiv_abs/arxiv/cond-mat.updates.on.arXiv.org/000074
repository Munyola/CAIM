Electronic spins in Silicon (Si) are rising contenders for qubits -- the logical unit of quantum
computation-- owing to its outstanding spin coherence properties and compatibility to standard
electronics. A remarkable limitation for spin quantum computing in Si hosts is the orbital degeneracy
of this material's conduction band, preventing the spin-1/2 states from being an isolated two-level
system. So far available samples of Si quantum wells cladded by Ge-Si alloy barriers provide relatively
small valley splitting (VS), with the order of 1 meV or less, degrading the fidelity of qubits encoded
in spin "up" and "down" states in Si. Here, based on an atomically resolved pseudopotential theory,
we demonstrate that ordered Ge-Si layered barriers confining a Si slab can be harnessed to enhance
the VS in the active Si region by up to one order of magnitude compared to the random alloy barriers
adopted so far. A biologically inspired genetic-algorithm search is employed to identify magic
Ge/Si layer sequences of the superlattice barriers that isolate the electron ground state in a single
valley composition with VS as large as ~9 meV. The enhanced VS is preserved with the reasonable inter-layer
mixing between different species, and is interestingly "protected" even if some larger mixing
occurs. Implementation of the optimized layer sequences of barriers, within reach of modern superlattice
growth techniques, overcomes in a practical systematic way the main current limitations related
to the orbital degeneracy, thus providing a roadmap for reliable spin-only quantum computing in
Si.
