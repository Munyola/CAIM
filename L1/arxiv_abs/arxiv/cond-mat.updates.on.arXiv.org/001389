The present research is the first attempt to systematically quantify the dislocation-precipitate
interaction in terms of applied shear stress, precipitate resistance, and the required time to
reach the critical state of dislocation-precipitate interaction when a dislocation line is about
to pass through precipitates. To model the dislocation-precipitate interaction, we adopt a modified
three-dimensional dislocation dynamics. Using the present modeling approach, which employs
three-dimensional dislocation dynamics simulations, we obtain thousands of data points, accounting
for various precipitate resistances, applied shear stresses, and precipitate spacing. The material
of reference is Copper (Cu). From the simulations, which quantify the dislocation-precipitate
interaction in terms of the applied shear stress, precipitate resistance scale, and dislocation-precipitate
interaction time, we found a universal equation. The dislocation-precipitate interaction time
versus precipitate resistance and stress, referred to as the "dislocation-precipitate interaction
map," determines the "pass" or "no-pass" state of the interaction. Using this map, we incorporate
the dislocation-precipitate interaction time in a two-dimensional multiscale framework which
adopts the dislocation dynamics approach at the micro-scale and the finite element method at the
macro-scale. We use this framework to model the mechanical behavior of free-standing copper thin
films. The results show a dual effect of the dislocation-precipitate interaction time on the hardening
level.
