In recent years, metal halide perovskites have generated tremendous interest for optoelectronic
applications and their underlying fundamental properties. Due to the large electron-phonon coupling
characteristic of soft lattices, self-trapping phenomena are expected to dominate hybrid perovskite
photoexcitation dynamics. Yet, while the photogeneration of small polarons was proven in low dimensional
perovskites, the nature of polaron excitations in technologically relevant 3D perovskites, and
their influence on charge carrier transport, remain elusive. In this study, we used a combination
of first principle calculations and advanced spectroscopy techniques spanning the entire optical
frequency range to pin down polaron features in 3D metal halide perovskites. Mid-infrared photoinduced
absorption shows the photogeneration of states associated to low energy intragap electronic transitions
with lifetime up to the ms time scale, and vibrational mode renormalization in both frequency and
amplitude. Density functional theory supports the assignment of the spectroscopic features to
large polarons leading to new intra gap transitions, hardening of phonon mode frequency, and renormalization
of the oscillator strength. Theory provides quantitative estimates of the charge carrier masses
and mobilities increase upon polaron formation, confirming experimental results. Overall, this
work contributes to complete the scenario of elementary photoexcitations in metal halide perovskites
and highlights the importance of polaronic transport in perovskite-based optoelectronic devices.
