Dendritic polyelectrolytes constitute high potential drugs and carrier systems for biomedical
purposes, still their biomolecular interaction modes, in particular those determining the binding
affinity to proteins, have not been rationalized. We study the interaction of the drug candidate
dendritic polyglycerol sulfate (dPGS) with serum proteins using Isothermal Titration Calorimetry
(ITC) interpreted and complemented with molecular computer simulations. Lysozyme is first studied
as a well-defined model protein to verify theoretical concepts, which are then applied to the important
cell adhesion protein family of selectins. We demonstrate that the driving force of the strong complexation
originates mainly from the release of only a few condensed counterions from the dPGS upon binding.
The binding constant shows a surprisingly weak dependence on dPGS size (and bare charge) which can
be understood by colloidal charge-renormalization effects and by the fact that the magnitude of
the dominating counterion-release mechanism almost exclusively depends on the interfacial charge
structure of the protein-specific binding patch. Our findings explain the high selectivity of
P- and L- selectins over E-selectin for dPGS to act as a highly anti-inflammatory drug. The entire
analysis demonstrates that the interaction of proteins with charged polymeric drugs can be predicted
by simulations with unprecedented accuracy. Thus, our results open new perspectives for the rational
design of charged polymeric drugs and carrier systems.
