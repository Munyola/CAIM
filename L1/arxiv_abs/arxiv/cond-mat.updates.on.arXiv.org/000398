In this paper a second-order homogenization approach for periodic material is derived from an appropriate
representation of the down-scaling that correlates the microdisplacement field to the macro-displacement
field and the macro-strain tensors involving unknown perturbation functions. These functions
take into account of the effects of the heterogeneities and are obtained by the solution of properly
defined recursive cell problems. Moreover, the perturbation functions and therefore the micro-displacement
fields result to be sufficiently regular to guarantee the anti-periodicity of the traction on the
periodic unit cell. A generalization of the macro-homogeneity condition is obtained through an
asymptotic expansion of the mean strain energy at the micro-scale in terms of the microstructural
characteristic size e; the obtained overall elastic moduli result to be not affected by the choice
of periodic cell. The coupling between the macro- and microstress tensor in the periodic cell is
deduced from an application of the generalised macrohomogeneity condition applied to a representative
portion of the heterogeneous material (cluster of periodic cell). The correlation between the
proposed asymptotic homogenization approach and the computational second-order homogenization
methods is obtained through an approximation of the macrodisplacement field based on a second-order
Taylor expansion. The form of the overall elastic moduli obtained through the two homogenization
approaches, here proposed, is analyzed and the differences are highlighted.
