A quantum spin liquid (QSL) is a state of matter where unpaired electrons' spins in a solid are quantum
entangled, but do not show magnetic order in the zero-temperature limit. Because such a state may
be important to the microscopic origin of high-transition temperature superconductivity and
useful for quantum computation, the experimental realization of QSL is a long-sought goal in condensed
matter physics. Although neutron scattering experiments on the two-dimensional (2D) spin-1/2
kagome-lattice ZnCu3(OD)6Cl2 and effective spin-1/2 triangular lattice YbMgGaO4 have found
evidence for a continuum of magnetic excitations, the hallmark of a QSL carrying 'fractionalized
quantum excitations', at very low temperature, magnetic and nonmagnetic site chemical disorder
complicates the interpretation of the data. Recently, the three-dimensional (3D) Ce3+ pyrochlore
lattice Ce2Sn2O7 has been suggested as a clean, effective spin-1/2 QSL candidate, but there is no
evidence of a spin excitation continuum. Here we use thermodynamic, muon spin relaxation ({\mu}
SR), and neutron scattering experiments on single crystals of Ce2Zr2O7, a compound isostructural
to Ce2Sn2O7, to demonstrate the absence of magnetic ordering and the presence of a spin excitation
continuum at 35 mK, consistent with the expectation of a QSL. Since our neutron diffraction and diffuse
scattering measurements on Ce2Zr2O7 reveal no evidence of oxygen deficiency and magnetic/nonmagnetic
ion disorder as seen in other pyrochlores, Ce2Zr2O7 may be the first example of a 3D QSL material with
minimum magnetic and nonmagnetic chemical disorder.
