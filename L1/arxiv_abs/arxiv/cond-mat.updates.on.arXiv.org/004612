We revisit the issue of the resistivity of a two-dimensional electronic system tuned to a nematic
quantum critical point (QCP), focusing on the non-trivial impact of the coupling to the acoustic
phonons. Due to the unavoidable linear coupling between the electronic nematic order parameter
and the lattice strain fields, long-range nematic interactions mediated by the phonons emerge
in the problem. By solving the semi-classical Boltzmann equation in the presence of scattering
by impurities and nematic fluctuations, we determine the temperature-dependence of the resistivity
as the nematic QCP is approached. One of the main effects of the nemato-elastic coupling is to smooth
the electronic non-equilibrium distribution function, making it approach the simple cosine angular
dependence even when the impurity scattering is not too strong. We find that at temperatures lower
than a temperature scale set by the nemato-elastic coupling, the resistivity shows the $T^2$ behavior
characteristic of a Fermi liquid. This is in contrast to the $T^{4/3}$ low-temperature behavior
expected for a lattice-free nematic quantum critical point. More importantly, we show that the
effective resistivity exponent $\alpha_\text{eff}$ in $\rho(T)-\rho_0\sim T^{\alpha_\text{eff}}$
displays a pronounced temperature dependence, implying that a nematic QCP cannot generally be
characterized by a simple resistivity exponent. We discuss the implications of our results to the
interpretation of experimental data, particularly in the nematic superconductor FeSe$_{1-x}$S$_x$.
