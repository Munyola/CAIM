Herbertsmithite and Zn-doped barlowite are two compounds for experimental realization of twodimensional
gapped kagome spin liquid. Theoretically, it has been proposed that charge doping a quantum spin
liquid gives rise to exotic metallic states, such as high-temperature superconductivity. However,
one recent experiment about herbertsmithite with successful Li-doping shows surprisingly the
insulating state even under the heavy doped scenario, which can hardly be explained by many-body
physics. Using first-principles calculation, we performed a comprehensive study about the Li
intercalated doping effect of these two compounds. For the Li-doped herbertsmithite, we identified
the optimized Li position at the Cl-(OH)$_3$-Cl pentahedron site instead of previously speculated
Cl-(OH)$_3$ tetrahedral site. With the increase of Li doping concentration, the saturation magnetization
decreases linearly due to the charge transfer from Li to Cu ions. Moreover, we found that Li forms
chemical bonds with the nearby (OH)$^-$ and Cl$^-$ ions, which lowers the surrounding chemical
potential and traps the electron, as evidenced by the localized charge distribution, explaining
the insulating behavior measured experimentally. Though with different structure from herbertsmithite,
Zn-doped Barlowite shows the same features upon Li doping. We conclude that Li doping this family
of kagome spin liquid cannot realize exotic metallic states, other methods should be further explored,
such as element substitution with different valence electrons.
