The remarkable properties and potential applications of Majorana fermions have led to considerable
efforts in recent years to realize topological matters that host these excitations. For a number-conserving
system, there have been a few proposals, using either coupled-chain models or multi-component
system with spin-orbit coupling, to create number fluctuation of fermion pairs in achieving Majorana
fermion. In this work, we show that Majorana edge states can occur in a spinless Fermi gas in 1D lattices
with tunable $p$-wave interaction. This is facilitated by the conversion between a pair of (open-channel)
fermions and a (close-channel) boson, thereby allowing the number fluctuation of fermion pairs
in a single chain. This scheme requires neither spin-orbit coupling nor multi-chain setup and can
be implemented easily. Using the density-matrix-renormalization-group method, we have identified
the Majorana phase in a wide range of parameter regime as well as its associated phase transitions.
The topological nature of the Majorana phase manifests itself in a strong edge-edge correlation
in an open chain that is robust against disorder, as well as in a non-trivial winding number in the
bulk generated by using twisted boundary condition. It is also shown that the Majorana phase in this
system can be stable against atom losses due to few-body collisions on the same site, and can be easily
identified from the fermion momentum distribution. These results pave the way for probing the intriguing
Majorana physics in a simple and stable cold atoms system.
