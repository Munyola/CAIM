Monolayer $\rm WTe_2$, a centrosymmetric transition metal dichacogenide, has recently been established
as a quantum spin Hall insulator and found superconducting upon gating. Here we show that generally
a superconducting inversion-symmetric quantum spin Hall material whose normal state is "effectively
gapped", such as gated monolayer $\rm WTe_2$, can be an inversion-protected topological crystalline
superconductor featuring possible "higher-order topology" if the superconductivity is parity-odd.
Instead of edge states, we explicitly show how zero-dimensional boundary modes can emerge in such
type of superconductor within a two-dimensional minimal model. We then study the pairing symmetry
of superconducting $\rm WTe_2$ with a microscopic model at mean-field level, and find two types
of exotic pairings. First is a time-reversal symmetric odd-parity pairing favored by nearest-neighbor
attractions. We numerically show that this self-consistently obtained paired state possesses
a nontrivial bulk symmetry indicator, and hosts two Majorana Kramers pairs localizing at opposite
corners. Even when on-site attractions dominate and favor the conventional pairing, we find that
an intermediate in-plane field exceeding the Pauli limit stabilizes an unconventional equal-spin
pairing aligning with the field. Our findings suggest gated monolayer $\rm WTe_2$ is a playground
for exotic odd-parity superconductivity, and possibly the first material realization for inversion-protected
Majorana corner modes \emph{without} utilizing proximity effect.
