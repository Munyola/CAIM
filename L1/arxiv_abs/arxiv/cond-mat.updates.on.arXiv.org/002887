We describe the first version (v1.0.0) of the code ADG that automatically (1) generates all valid
Bogoliubov many-body perturbation theory (BMBPT) diagrams and (2) evaluates their algebraic
expression to be implemented for numerical applications. This is achieved at any perturbative
order $p$ for a Hamiltonian containing both two-body (four-legs) and three-body (six-legs) interactions
(vertices). The automated generation of BMBPT diagrams of order $p$ relies on elements of graph
theory, i.e., it is achieved by producing all oriented adjacency matrices of size $(p+1) \times
(p+1)$ satisfying topological Feynman's rules. The automated evaluation of BMBPT diagrams of
order $p$ relies both on the application of algebraic Feynman's rules and on the identification
of a powerful diagrammatic rule providing the result of the remaining $p$-tuple time integral.
The diagrammatic rule in question constitutes a novel finding allowing for the straight summation
of large classes of time-ordered diagrams at play in the time-independent formulation of BMBPT.
Correspondingly, the traditional resolvent rule employed to compute time-ordered diagrams happens
to be a particular case of the general rule presently identified. The code ADG is written in Python2.7
and uses the graph manipulation package NetworkX. The code is also able to generate and evaluate
Hartree-Fock-MBPT (HF-MBPT) diagrams and is made flexible enough to be expanded throughout the
years to tackle the diagrammatics at play in various many-body formalisms that already exist or
are yet to be formulated.
