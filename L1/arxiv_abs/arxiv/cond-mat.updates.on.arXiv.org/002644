A new mathematical approach to condensed matter physics, based on the finite temperature field
theory, was recently proposed. The field theory is a scale-free formalism, thus, it denies absolute
values of thermodynamic temperature and uses dimensionless thermal variables, which are obtained
with the group velocities of sound and the interatomic distance. This formalism was previously
applied to the specific heat of condensed matter and predicted its fourth power of temperature behaviour
at sufficiently low temperatures, which was tested by experimental data for diamond lattice materials.
The range of temperatures with the quartic law varies for different materials, therefore, it is
called the quasi-low temperature regime. The quasi-low temperature behavior of specific heat
is verified here with experimental data for the fcc lattice materials, silver chloride and lithium
iodide. The conjecture that the fourth order behavior is universal for all condensed matter systems
is also supported the data for glassy matter: vitreous silica. This law is long known to hold for the
bcc solid helium-4. The characteristic temperatures of the threshold of the quasi-low temperature
regime are found for the studied materials. The scaling in the specific heat of condensed matter
is expressed by the dimensionless parameter, which is explored with the data for several glasses.
The explanation of the correlation of the 'boson peak' temperature with the shear velocity is proposed.
The critique of the Debye theory of specific heat and the Born-von Karman model of the lattice dynamics
is given.
