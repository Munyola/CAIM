We study the mass imbalanced Fermi-Fermi mixture within the framework of a two-dimensional lattice
fermion model. Based on the thermodynamic and species dependent quasiparticle behavior we map
out the finite temperature phase diagram of this system and show that unlike the balanced Fermi superfluid
there are now two different pseudogap regimes as PG-I and PG-II. While within the PG-I regime both
the fermionic species are pseudogapped, PG-II corresponds to the regime where pseudogap feature
survives only in the light species. We believe that the single particle spectral features that we
discuss in this paper are observable through the species resolved radio frequency spectroscopy
and momentum resolved photo emission spectroscopy measurements on systems such as, 6$_{Li}$-40$_{K}$
mixture. We further investigate the interplay between the population and mass imbalances and report
that at a fixed population imbalance the BCS-BEC crossover in a Fermi-Fermi mixture would require
a critical interaction (U$_{c}$), for the realization of the uniform superfluid state. The effect
of imbalance in mass on the exotic Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) superfluid phase
has been probed in detail in terms of the thermodynamic and quasiparticle behavior of this phase.
It has been observed that in spite of the s-wave symmetry of the pairing field a nodal superfluid gap
is realized in the LO regime. Our results on the various thermal scales and regimes are expected to
serve as benchmarks for the experimental observations on 6$_{Li}$-40$_{K}$ mixture.
