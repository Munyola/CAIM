We study inequivalence of canonical and microcanonical ensembles in the mean-field Blume-Emery-Griffiths
model. This generalizes previous results obtained for the Blume-Capel model. The phase diagram
strongly depends on the value of the biquadratic exchange interaction K, the additional feature
present in the Blume-Emery-Griffiths model. At small values of K, as for the Blume-Capel model,
lines of first and second order phase transitions between a ferromagnetic and a paramagnetic phase
are present, separated by a tricritical point whose location is different in the two ensembles.
At higher values of K the phase diagram changes substantially, with the appearance of a triple point
in the canonical ensemble which does not find any correspondence in the microcanonical ensemble.
Moreover, one of the first order lines that starts from the triple point ends in a critical point,
whose position in the phase diagram is different in the two ensembles. This line separates two paramagnetic
phases characterized by a different value of the quadrupole moment. These features were not previously
studied for other models and substantially enrich the landscape of ensemble inequivalence, identifying
new aspects that had been discussed in a classification of phase transitions based on singularity
theory. Finally, we discuss ergodicity breaking, which is highlighted by the presence of gaps in
the accessible values of magnetization at low energies: it also displays new interesting patterns
that are not present in the Blume-Capel model.
