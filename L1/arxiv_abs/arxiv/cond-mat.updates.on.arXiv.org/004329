Valley-selective optical selection rules and a spin-valley locking in transition-metal dichalcogenide
(TMDC) monolayers are at the heart of "valleytronic physics", which exploits the valley degree
of freedom and has been a major research topic in recent years. In contrast, valleytronic properties
of TMDC bilayers have not been in the focus so much by now. Here, we report on the valleytronic properties
and optical characterization of bilayers of WS2 as a representative TMDC material. In particular,
we study the influence of the relative layer alignment in TMDC homo-bilayer samples on their polarization-dependent
optical properties. Therefore, CVD-grown WS2 bilayer samples have been prepared that favor either
the inversion symmetric AA' stacking or AB stacking without inversion symmetry during synthesis.
Subsequently, a detailed analysis of reflection contrast and photoluminescence spectra under
different polarization conditions has been performed. We observe circular and linear dichroism
of the photoluminescence that is more pronounced for the AB stacking configuration. Our experimental
findings are supported by theoretical calculations showing that the observed dichroism can be
linked to optical selection rules, that maintain the spin-valley locking in the AB-stacked WS2
bilayer, whereas a spin-layer-locking is present the inversion symmetric AA' bilayer instead.
Furthermore, our theoretical calculations predict a small relative shift of the excitonic resonances
in both stacking configurations, which is also experimentally observed.
