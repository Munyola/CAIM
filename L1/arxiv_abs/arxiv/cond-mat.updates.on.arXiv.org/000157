We calculate the conductances of a three-terminal junction set-up of spinless Luttinger liquid
wires threaded by a magnetic flux, allowing for different interaction strength g_3 != g in the third
wire. We employ the fermionic representation in the scattering state picture, allowing for a direct
calculation of the linear response conductances, without the need of introducing contact resistances
at the connection points to the outer ideal leads. The matrix of conductances is parametrized by
three variables. For these we derive coupled renormalization group (RG) equations, by summing
up infinite classes of contributions in perturbation theory. The resulting general structure
of the RG equations may be employed to describe junctions with an arbitrary number of wires and arbitrary
interaction strength in each wire. The fixed point structure of these equations (for the chiral
Y-junction) is analyzed in detail. For repulsive interaction (g,g_3>0) there is only one stable
fixed point, corresponding to the complete separation of the wires. For attractive interaction
(g<0 and/or g_3<0) four fixed points are found, the stability of which depends on the interaction
strength. We confirm our previous weak-coupling result of lines of fixed points for special values
of the interaction parameters reaching into the strong coupling domain. We find new fixed points
not discussed before, even at the symmetric line g=g_3, at variance with the results of Oshikawa
et al. The pair tunneling phenomenon conjectured by the latter authors is not found by us.
