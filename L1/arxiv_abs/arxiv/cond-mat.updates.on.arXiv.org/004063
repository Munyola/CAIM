Unconventional superconductivity often arises from Cooper pairing between neighboring atomic
sites, stipulating a characteristic pairing symmetry in the reciprocal space. The twisted bilayer
graphene (TBG) presents a new setting where superconductivity emerges on the flat bands whose Wannier
wavefunctions spread over many graphene unit cells, forming the so-called Moir\'e pattern. To
unravel how Wannier states form Cooper pairs, we study the interplay between electronic, structural,
and pairing instabilities in TBG. For comparisons, we also study graphene on boron-nitride (GBN)
possessing a different Moir\'e pattern, and single-layer graphene (SLG) without a Moir\'e pattern.
For all cases, we compute the pairing eigenvalues and eigenfunctions by solving a linearized superconducting
gap equation, where the spin-fluctuation mediated pairing potential is evaluated from materials
specific tight-binding band structures. We find an extended $s$-wave as the leading pairing symmetry
in TBG, in which the nearest-neighbor Wannier sites form Cooper pairs with same phase. In contrast,
GBN assumes a $p+ip$-wave pairing between nearest-neighbor Wannier states with odd-parity phase,
while SLG has the $d+id$-wave symmetry for inter-sublattice pairing with even-parity phase. Moreover,
while $p+ip$, and $d+id$ pairings are chiral, and nodeless, but the extended $s$-wave channel possesses
accidental {\it nodes}. The nodal pairing symmetry makes it easily distinguishable via power-law
dependencies in thermodynamical entities, in addition to their direct visualization via spectroscopies.
