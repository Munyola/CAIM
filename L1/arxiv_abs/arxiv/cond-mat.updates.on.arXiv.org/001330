The discovery of new families of exfoliatable 2D crystals that have diverse sets of electronic,
optical, and spin-orbit coupling properties, enables the realization of unique physical phenomena
in these few-atom thick building blocks and in proximity to other materials. Herein, using NaSn2As2
as a model system, we demonstrate that layered Zintl phases having the stoichiometry ATt2Pn2 (A
= Group 1 or 2 element, Tt = Group 14 tetrel element and Pn = Group 15 pnictogen element) and feature
networks separated by van der Waals gaps can be readily exfoliated with both mechanical and liquid-phase
methods. We identified the symmetries of the Raman active modes of the bulk crystals via polarized
Raman spectroscopy. The bulk and mechanically exfoliated NaSn2As2 samples are resistant towards
oxidation, with only the top surface oxidizing in ambient conditions over a couple of days, while
the liquid-exfoliated samples oxidize much more quickly in ambient conditions. Employing angle-resolved
photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), density functional theory (DFT), and transport on bulk and
exfoliated samples, we show that NaSn2As2 is a highly conducting 2D semimetal, with resistivities
on the order of 10-6 {\Omega} m. Due to peculiarities in the band structure, the dominating p-type
carriers at low temperature are nearly compensated by the opening of n-type conduction channels
as temperature increases. This work further expands the family of exfoliatable 2D materials to
layered van der Waals Zintl phases, opening up opportunities in electronics and spintronics.
