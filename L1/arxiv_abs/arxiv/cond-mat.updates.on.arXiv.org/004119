We introduce a planar embedding of the k-regular k-XORSAT problem, in which solutions are encoded
in the ground state of a classical statistical mechanics model of reversible logic gates arranged
on a square grid and acting on bits that represent the Boolean variables of the problem. The special
feature of this embedding is that the resulting model lacks a finite-temperature phase transition,
thus bypassing the first-order thermodynamic transition known to occur in the random graph representation
of XORSAT. In spite of this attractive feature, the thermal relaxation into the ground state displays
remarkably slow glassy behavior. The question addressed in this paper is whether this planar embedding
can afford an efficient path to solution of k-regular k-XORSAT via quantum adiabatic annealing.
We first show that our model bypasses an avoided level crossing and consequent exponentially small
gap in the limit of small transverse fields. We then present quantum Monte Carlo results for our embedding
of the k-regular k-XORSAT that strongly support a picture in which second-order and first-order
transitions develop at a finite transverse field for k = 2 and k = 3, respectively. This translates
into power-law and exponential dependences in the scaling of energy gaps with system size, corresponding
to times-to-solution which are, respectively, polynomial and exponential in the number of variables.
We conclude that neither classical nor quantum annealing can efficiently solve our reformulation
of XORSAT, even though the original problem can be solved in polynomial time by Gaussian elimination.
