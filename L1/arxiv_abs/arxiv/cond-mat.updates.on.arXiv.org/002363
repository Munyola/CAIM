The chemical and magnetic structures of the series of compounds Ca$_{2-x}$La$_x$RuO$_4$ [$x =
0$, $0.05(1)$, $0.07(1)$, $0.12(1)$] have been investigated using neutron diffraction and resonant
elastic x-ray scattering. Upon La doping, the low temperature S-Pbca space group of the parent compound
is retained in all insulating samples [$x\leq0.07(1)$], but with significant changes to the atomic
positions within the unit cell. These changes can be characterised in terms of the local RuO$_6$
octahedral coordination: with increasing doping the structure, crudely speaking, evolves from
an orthorhombic unit cell with compressed octahedra to a quasi-tetragonal unit cell with elongated
ones. The magnetic structure on the other hand, is found to be robust, with the basic $k=(0,0,0)$,
$b$-axis antiferromagnetic order of the parent compound preserved below the critical La doping
concentration of $x\approx0.11$. The only effects of La doping on the magnetic structure are to
suppress the A-centred mode, favouring the B mode instead, and to reduce the N\'{e}el temperature
somewhat. Our results are discussed with reference to previous experimental reports on the effects
of cation substitution on the $d^4$ Mott insulator Ca$_2$RuO$_4$, as well as with regard to theoretical
studies on the evolution of its electronic and magnetic structure. In particular, our results rule
out the presence of a proposed ferromagnetic phase, and suggest that the structural effects associated
with La substitution play an important role in the physics of the system.
