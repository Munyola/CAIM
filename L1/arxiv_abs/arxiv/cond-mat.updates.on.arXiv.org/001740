This work integrates in-situ neutron diffraction and crystal plasticity finite element modeling
to study the kinematic stability of retained austenite in high carbon bearing steels. The presence
of a kinematically metastable retained austenite in bearing steels can significantly affect the
macro-mechanical and micro-mechanical material response. Mechanical characterization of metastable
austenite is a critical component in accurately capturing the micro-mechanical behavior under
typical application loads. Traditional mechanical characterization techniques are unable to
discretely quantify the micro-mechanical response of the austenite, and as a result, the computational
predictions rely heavily on trial and error or qualitative descriptions of the austenite phase.
In order to overcome this, in this present work, we use in-situ neutron diffraction of a uniaxial
tension test of an A485 Grade 1 bearing steel specimen. The mechanical response determined from
the neutron diffraction analysis was incorporated into a hybrid crystal plasticity finite element
model that accounts for the martensite's crystal plasticity and the stress-assisted transformation
from austenite to martensite in bearing steels. The modeling response was used to estimate the single
crystal elastic constants of the austenite and martensite phases. The results show that using in-situ
neutron diffraction coupled with a crystal plasticity model, can successfully predict both the
micro-mechanical and macro-mechanical responses of bearing steels while accounting for the martensitic
transformation of the retained austenite.
