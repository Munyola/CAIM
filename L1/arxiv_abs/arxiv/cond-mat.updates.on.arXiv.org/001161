A growing literature examines the effects of superdiffusive subballistic movement pre-measurement
(ageing or time lag) on observations arising from single-particle tracking. However, a neglected
aspect is the life and mortality of these L\'evy walkers, be they proteins, cells or larger structures.
In this work we examine the effects of ageing on the motility of mortal walkers, and discuss the means
by which inherent death of walkers may be distinguished from experimental artefacts arising from
e.g. low photostability or radiation damage. This is done by comparison of the walkers' mean squared
displacement (MSD) with the front velocity of propagation of a group of walkers, which is found to
be invariant under time lags. We consider both ageing arising from the walkers already having a fixed
running time at the start of measurement, as well as running times distributed according to their
survival probability as occurs if the walkers equilibrate pre-measurement. For any running time
distribution of a mortal random walker, the MSD is tempered by a decaying exponential governed by
the death rate $\theta$. This provides a physical interpretation for truncated heavy-tailed diffusion
processes and serves as a tool by which to better classify the underlying running time distribution
of the walkers. For certain running time distributions a fixed time lag is shown to result in a transition
to ballistic motion. Tempering of aged MSDs raises the issue of misinterpreting superdiffusive
motion which appears Brownian over certain time scales.
