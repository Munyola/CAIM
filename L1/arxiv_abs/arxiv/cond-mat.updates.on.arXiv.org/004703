Micro and nano-particles are systemically injected as drug carriers to specifically deliver therapeutics
into diseased tissue. Their vascular journey and adhesion mechanics are key ingredient to optimize
strategies mainly against cancer and cardiovascular disorders. This work focuses on the role of
carrier stiffness in modulating their migration towards capillary peripheries and then to firmly
adhere vascular walls. A Lattice Boltzmann Immersed Boundary method is used for predicting the
dynamics of rigid and deformable adhesive micro-metric particles (1 um) navigating a capillary
by the size of 10 um. Cells and microcarriers are modeled as a collection of mass-spring elements
responding to a bending potential, a worm-like chain potential and the area conservation constraint.
Furthermore, particle's surface is decorated with adhesive molecules interacting with vascular
walls. Particles transport and adhesion are characterized in terms of their ability to reach the
capillary peripheries (margination rate) and to firmly adhere the vascular walls. This analysis
is carried out systematically by varying particles' and cells' initial positions (five different
particles configurations are transported, one per time, within four red blood cells releasing
positions); stiffness and their chemical affinity with the capillary walls. Particle stiffness
is found to weekly influence the margination rate while do significantly affect the ability of such
constructs to efficiently interact with the endothelium by forming stable chemical bonds.
