We investigate topological characteristics of the photon-dressed band structure of $\alpha$-$\mathcal{T}_3$
lattice on being driven by off-resonant circularly polarized radiation. We obtain exact analytical
expressions of the quasienergy bands over the first Brillouin zone. The broken time-reversal symmetry
caused by the circularly polarized light lifts the triple point degeneracy completely at both the
Dirac points. The gaps become unequal at $ {\bf K}$ and ${\bf K}^{\prime}$ (except at $\alpha=0$
and 1), which reveals the absence of inversion symmetry in the system. At $\alpha=1/\sqrt{2}$,
the gap between flat and valence bands closes at ${\bf K}$, while that between conduction and flat
bands closes at ${\bf K}^{\prime}$, thereby restoring a semimetalic phase. At the gap closing point
($\alpha=1/\sqrt{2}$) which is independent of the radiation amplitude, there is a reappearance
of low-energy Dirac cones around ${\bf K}$ and ${\bf K}^{\prime}$ points. Under the influence of
the circularly polarized radiation, the $\alpha$-$\mathcal{T}_3$ lattice is transformed from
semimetal to a Haldane-like Chern insulator characterized by non-zero Chern number. The system
undergoes a topological phase transition from $\mathcal{C} = 1 (-1)$ to $\mathcal{C}=2 (-2)$ at
$\alpha =1/\sqrt{2}$, where $\mathcal{C}$ is the Chern number of the valence (conduction) band.
This sets an example of a multiband system having larger Chern number. These results are supported
by the appearance of chiral edge states in irradiated $\alpha$-$\mathcal{T}_3$ nanoribbon.
