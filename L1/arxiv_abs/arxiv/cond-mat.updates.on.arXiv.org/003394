We study the spin excitation spectra of two-dimensional spin-$1/2$ Heisenberg model with checkerboard
structures using stochastic analytic continuation of imaginary-time correlation function obtained
from quantum Monte Carlo simulation. The checkerboard models have two different antiferromagnetic
nearest-neighbor interactions $J_{1}$ and $J_{2}$, and the tuning parameter $g$ is defined as
$J_{2}/J_{1}$. The dynamic spin structure factors are systematically calculated in all phases
of the models as well as at the critical points. To give a full understanding of the dynamic spectra,
spin wave theory is employed to explain some features of numerical results, especially for the low-energy
part. When $g$ is close to $1$, the features of the spin excitation spectra of each checkerboard model
are roughly the same as those of the original square lattice antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model,
and the high-energy continuum among them are discussed. In contrast to the other checkerboard structures
investigated in this paper, the $3\times 3$ checkerboard model has distinctive excitation features,
like a gap between a low-energy gapless branch and a gapped high-energy part exists when $g$ is small.
The gapless branch in this case can be regarded as spin wave in N$\mathrm{\acute{e}}$el order formed
by "block spin" in each $3\times 3$ plaquette with effective exchange interaction originated from
renormalization. One finding is that the continuum also appears in this low-energy branch, which
may originated from nearly deconfined process in "block spin".
