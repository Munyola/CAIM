In-situ NMR spin-lattice relaxation measurements were performed on several vapor deposited ices.
The measurements, which span more than 6 orders of magnitude in relaxation times, show a complex
spin-lattice relaxation pattern that is strongly dependent on the growth conditions of the sample.
The relaxation patterns change from multi-timescale relaxation for samples grown at temperatures
below the amorphous-crystalline transition temperature to single exponential recovery for samples
grown above the transition temperature. The slow-relaxation contribution seen in cold-grown
samples exhibits a temperature dependence, and becomes even slower after the sample is annealed
at 200K. The fast-relaxation contribution seen in these samples, does not seem to change or disappear
even when heating to temperatures where the sample is evaporated. The possibility that the fast
relaxation component is linked to the microporous structures in amorphous ice samples is further
examined using an environmental electron scanning microscope. The images reveal complex meso-scale
microporous structures which maintain their morphology up to their desorption temperatures.
These findings, support the possibility that water molecules at pore surfaces might be responsible
for the fast-relaxation contribution. Furthermore, the results of this study indicate that the
pore-collapse dynamics observed in the past in amorphous ices using other experimental techniques,
might be effectively inhibited in samples which are grown by relatively fast vapor deposition.
