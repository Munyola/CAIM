Ti1-xMgxN(001) layers with 0.00 {\leq} x {\leq} 0.49 are deposited on MgO(001) by reactive magnetron
co-sputtering from titanium and magnesium targets in 5 mTorr pure N2 at 600 {\deg}C. X-ray diffraction
{\omega}-2{\theta} scans, {\omega}-rocking curves, {\phi}-scans, and high resolution reciprocal
space maps show that the Ti1-xMgxN layers are rock-salt structure single crystals with a cube-on-cube
epitaxial relationship with the substrates: (001)TiMgN{\parallel} (001)MgO and [100]TiMgN{\parallel}
[100]MgO. Layers with thickness d = 35-58 nm are fully strained, with an in-plane lattice parameter
of 4.212{\pm}0.001 {\AA} matching that of the MgO substrate, while the out-of-plane lattice parameter
increases with x from 4.251 {\AA} for TiN(001) to 4.289 {\AA} for Ti0.51Mg0.49N(001). This yields
a relaxed lattice parameter for Ti1-xMgxN(001) of ao = (1-x)aTiN + xaMgN - bx(1-x), where aTiN = 4.239
{\AA}, aMgN = 4.345 {\AA}, and the bowing parameter b = 0.113 {\AA}. In contrast, thicker Ti1-xMgxN(001)
layers with d = 110-275 nm are partially (pure TiN) or fully (x = 0.37 and 0.39) relaxed, indicating
a critical thickness for relaxation of 50-100 nm. The in-plane x-ray coherence length is large (100-400
nm) for fully strained layers with 0.00 {\leq} x {\leq} 0.45 but drops by an order of magnitude for
x = 0.49 as the composition approaches the phase stability limit. It is also an order of magnitude
smaller for thicker (d {\leq} 110 nm) layers, which is attributed to strain relaxation through the
nucleation and growth of misfit dislocations facilitated by glide of threading dislocations.
