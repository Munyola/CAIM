It is well known that long Josephson tunnel junctions (JTJs) act as active transmission lines for
the slow-mode propagation of magnetic flux-quanta (in the form of solitary waves) that is at the
base of many superconducting circuits. At the same time, they support the propagation of quasi-TEM
dispersive waves with which the magnetic flux non-linearly interact. In this work, we study the
properties of the electromagnetic resonances, under different conditions of practical interest,
in annular JTJs (AJTJs), in which the wavelengths are limited to the length of the circumference
divided by an integer. Our analysis is based on perturbed sine-Gordon equations the (1+1)-dimensional
space with periodic boundary conditions. We discuss the discrete modes of the travelling EM waves
in circular annular JTJs in the presence of an in-plane magnetic field, as well as in the recently
introduced confocal annular JTJs (in the absence of magnetic field). In both cases, a variable-separation
method leads to quantitatively different Mathieu equations characterized by even and odd spatially
periodic solutions with different eigen-frequencies. It implicates that a single mode circulating
wave is given by the superposition of two standing waves with the same wavelengths but different
frequencies, and so has a periodically inverting direction of propagation. The control parameters
of this frequency splitting are the in-plane magnetic field amplitude for the circular AJTJ and
the aspect ratio for the confocal AJTJs. In the appropriate limits, the previously known solutions
are recovered.
