We explore the effects of various kinds of random disorder on the quasiparticle density of states
of two-dimensional d-wave superconductors using an exact real-space method, incorporating realistic
details known about the cuprates. Random on-site energy and pointlike unitary impurity models
are found to give rise to a vanishing DOS at the Fermi energy for narrow distributions and low concentrations,
respectively, and lead to a finite, but suppressed, DOS at unrealistically large levels of disorder.
Smooth disorder arising from impurities located away from the copper-oxide planes meanwhile gives
rise to a finite DOS at realistic impurity concentrations. For the case of smooth disorder whose
average potential is zero, a resonance is found at zero energy for the quasiparticle DOS at large
impurity concentrations. We discuss the implications of these results on the computed low-temperature
specific heat, the behavior of which we find is strongly affected by the amount of disorder present
in the system. We also compute the localization length as a function of disorder strength for various
types of disorder and find that intermediate- and high-energy states are quasi-extended for low
disorder, and that states near the Fermi energy are strongly localized and have a localization length
that exhibits an unusual dependence on the amount of disorder. We comment on the origin of disorder
in the cuprates and provide constraints on these based on known results from scanning tunneling
spectroscopy and specific heat experiments.
