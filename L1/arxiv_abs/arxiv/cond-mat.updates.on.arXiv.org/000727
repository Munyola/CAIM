The Dirac-like surface states of the topological insulators (TIs) are protected by time reversal
symmetry (TRS) and exhibit a host of novel properties. Introducing magnetism into TI, which breaks
the TRS, is expected to create exotic topological magnetoelectric effects. A particularly intriguing
phenomenon in this case is the magnetic field dependence of electrical resistance, or magnetoresistance
(MR). The intricate interplay between topological protection and broken-TRS may lead to highly
unconventional MR behaviour that can find unique applications in magnetic sensing and data storage.
However, so far the MR of TI with spontaneously broken TRS is still poorly understood, mainly due
to the lack of well-controlled experiments. In this work, we investigate the magneto transport
properties of a ferromagnetic TI thin film fabricated into a field effect transistor device. We
observe an unusually complex evolution of MR when the Fermi level (EF) is tuned across the Dirac point
(DP) by gate voltage. In particular, MR tends to be positive when EF lies close to the DP but becomes
negative at higher energies. This trend is opposite to that expected from the Berry phase picture
for localization, but is intimately correlated with the gate-tuned magnetic order. We show that
the underlying physics is the competition between the topology-induced weak antilocalization
and magnetism-induced negative MR. The simultaneous electrical control of magnetic order and
magneto transport facilitates future TI-based spintronic devices.
