Orchestration of diverse synaptic plasticity mechanisms across different timescales produces
complex cognitive processes. To achieve comparable cognitive complexity in memristive neuromorphic
systems, devices that are capable to emulate short- and long-term plasticity (STP and LTP, respectively)
concomitantly are essential. However, this fundamental bionic trait has not been reported in any
existing memristors where STP and LTP can only be induced selectively because of the inability to
be decoupled using different loci and mechanisms. In this work, we report the first demonstration
of truly concomitant STP and LTP in a three-terminal memristor that uses independent physical phenomena
to represent each form of plasticity. The emerging layered material Bi2O2Se is used in memristor
for the first time, opening up the prospects for ultra-thin, high-speed and low-power neuromorphic
devices. The concerted action of STP and LTP in our memristor allows full-range modulation of the
transient synaptic efficacy, from depression to facilitation, by stimulus frequency or intensity,
providing a versatile device platform for neuromorphic function implementation. A recurrent
neural circuitry model is developed to simulate the intricate "sleep-wake cycle autoregulation"
process, in which the concomitance of STP and LTP is posited as a key factor in enabling this neural
homeostasis. This work sheds new light on the highly sophisticated computational capabilities
of memristors and their prospects for realization of advanced neuromorphic functions.
