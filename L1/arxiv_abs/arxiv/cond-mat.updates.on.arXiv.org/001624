Results of crystallographic refinement, the relationship between electron counts and structural
stability, and magnetic characterization of YT$_x$Ge$_2$ (T= Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni) prepared using
the arc melting method are presented. These YT$_x$Ge$_2$ compounds crystallize in the BaCuSn$_2$-CeNi$_1$$_-$$_x$Si$_2$-type
structure with space group Cmcm, and the site occupancies of 3d transition metals range from x = 0.22(1)
for Cr to x = 0.66(1) for Ni. Based on a combination of single crystal and powder X-ray diffraction
and scanning electron microscopy, the trends are clearly established that the smaller transition
metal atoms exhibit larger occupancies on T (Cu) site. Our investigation into the relationship
between electron count and site defect reveals that a stable configuration is obtained when reaching
10.3e- per transition metal (Y+T), which strongly correlates with the defect observed in the case
of T metals. Magnetic properties measurements indicate paramagnetism for T = Cr, Fe, and Co, but
ferromagnetism for T = Mn with a Curie temperature at 293 K and effective moment ~ 3.6 uB/Mn. The absence
of superconductivity in this series is surprising because they consist of similar building blocks
and electron counts to superconducting YGe$_1$$_.$$_5$$_+$$_d$Si$_2$ except for 3d transition
metals. Introducing 3d transition metals into the system plays a critical role in suppressing superconductivity,
offering new insights into the interplay between superconductivity and magnetism in layered intermetallics.
