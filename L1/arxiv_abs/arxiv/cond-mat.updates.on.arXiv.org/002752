X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) and x-ray emission spectroscopy (XES) are advanced x-ray
spectroscopies that impact a wide range of disciplines. However, unlike the majority of other spectroscopic
methods, XAFS and XES are accompanied by an unusual access model, wherein; the dominant use of the
technique is for premier research studies at world-class facilities, i.e., synchrotron x-ray
light sources. In this paper we report the design and performance of an improved spectrometer XAFS
and XES based on the general conceptual design of Seidler, et al., Rev. Sci. Instrum. 2014. New developments
include reduced mechanical degrees of freedom, much-increased flux, and a wider Bragg angle range
to enable extended x-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) for the first time with this type of modern
laboratory XAFS configuration. This instrument enables a new class of routine applications that
are incompatible with the mission and access model of the synchrotron light sources. To illustrate
this, we provide numerous examples of x-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES), EXAFS, and
XES results for a variety of problems and energy ranges. Highlights include XAFS and XES measurements
of battery electrode materials, EXAFS of Ni and V with full modeling of results to validate monochromator
performance, valence-to-core XES for 3d transition metal compounds, and uranium XANES and XES
for different oxidation states. Taken en masse, these results further support the growing perspective
that modern laboratory-based XAFS and XES have the potential to develop a new branch of analytical
chemistry.
