We present a multi-phase-field model to describe quantitatively nanowire growth by the vapor-liquid-solid
(VLS) process. The free-energy functional of this model depends on three non-conserved order parameters
that distinguish the vapor, liquid, and solid phases. The evolution equations for those order parameters
describe basic kinetic processes including the rapid (quasi-instantaneous) equilibration of
the liquid catalyst to a droplet shape with constant mean curvature, the slow incorporation of growth
atoms at the droplet surface, and crystallization within the droplet. The standard constraint
that the sum of the phase fields equals unity and the conservation of the number of catalyst atoms,
which relates the catalyst volume to the concentration of growth atoms inside the droplet, are handled
via separate Lagrange multipliers. An analysis of the model is presented that rigorously maps the
phase-field equations to a desired set of sharp-interface equations for the evolution of the phase
boundaries under the constraint of force-balance at three-phase junctions given by the Young-Herring
relation that includes torque term related to the anisotropy of the solid-liquid and solid-vapor
interface excess free energies. Numerical examples of growth in two dimensions are presented.
The simulations reproduce many of the salient features of nanowire growth observed experimentally,
including growth normal to the substrate with tapering of the side walls, transitions between different
growth orientations, and crawling growth along the substrate.
