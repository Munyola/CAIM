Time-periodically driven systems are a versatile toolbox for realizing interesting effective
Hamiltonians. Heating, caused by excitations to high-energy states, is a challenge for experiments.
While most setups address the relatively weakly-interacting regime so far, it is of general interest
to study heating in strongly correlated systems. Using Floquet dynamical mean-field theory, we
study non-equilibrium steady states (NESS) in the Falicov-Kimball model, with time-periodically
driven kinetic energy or interaction. We systematically investigate the nonequilibrium properties
of the NESS. For a driven kinetic energy, we show that resonant tunneling, where the interaction
is an integer multiple of the driving frequency, plays an important role in the heating. In the strongly
correlated regime, we show that this can be well understood using Fermi\textquoteright s Golden
rule and the Schrieffer-Wolff transformation for a time-periodically driven system. We furthermore
demonstrate that resonant tunneling can be used to control the population of Floquet states to achieve
"photo-doping". For driven interactions introduced by an oscillating magnetic field near a Feshbach
resonance widely adopted [1,2], we find that the double occupancy is strongly modulated. Our calculations
apply to shaken ultracold atom systems, and to solid state systems in a spatially uniform but time-dependent
electric field. They are also closely related to lattice modulation spectroscopy [3]. Our calculations
are helpful to understand the latest experiments on strongly correlated Floquet systems [4].
