The successes of superconducting quantum circuits at local manipulation of quantum information
and photonics technology at long-distance transmission of the same have spurred interest in the
development of quantum transducers for efficient, low-noise, and bidirectional frequency conversion
of photons between the microwave and optical domains. We propose to realize such functionality
through the coupling of electrical, piezoelectric, and optomechanical resonators. The coupling
of the mechanical subsystems enables formation of a resonant mechanical supermode that provides
a mechanically-mediated, efficient single interface to both the microwave and optical domains.
The conversion process is analyzed by applying an equivalent circuit model that relates device-level
parameters to overall figures of merit for conversion efficiency $\eta$ and added noise $N$. These
can be further enhanced by proper impedance matching of the transducer to an input microwave transmission
line. The performance of potential transducers is assessed through finite-element simulations,
with a focus on geometries in GaAs, followed by considerations of the AlN, LiNbO$_3$, and AlN-on-Si
platforms. We present strategies for maximizing $\eta$ and minimizing $N$, and find that simultaneously
achieving $\eta>50~\%$ and $N < 0.5$ should be possible with current technology. Our comprehensive
analysis of the full transduction chain enables us to outline a development path for the realization
of high-performance quantum transducers that will constitute a new resource for quantum information
science.
