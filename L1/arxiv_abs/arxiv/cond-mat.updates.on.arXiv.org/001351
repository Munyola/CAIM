Functional spintronic devices rely on spin-charge interconversion effects, such as the reciprocal
processes of electric field-driven spin torque and magnetization dynamics-driven spin and charge
flow. Both damping-like and field-like spin-orbit torques have been observed in the forward process
of current-driven spin torque and damping-like inverse spin-orbit torque has been well-studied
via spin pumping into heavy metal layers. Here we demonstrate that established microwave transmission
spectroscopy of ferromagnet/normal metal bilayers under ferromagnetic resonance can be used
to inductively detect the AC charge currents driven by the inverse spin-charge conversion processes.
This technique relies on vector network analyzer ferromagnetic resonance (VNA-FMR) measurements.
We show that in addition to the commonly-extracted spectroscopic information, VNA-FMR measurements
can be used to quantify the magnitude and phase of all AC charge currents in the sample, including
those due to spin pumping and spin-charge conversion. Our findings reveal that Ni$_{80}$Fe$_{20}$/Pt
bilayers exhibit both damping-like and field-like inverse spin-orbit torques. While the magnitudes
of both the damping-like and field-like inverse spin-orbit torque are of comparable scale to prior
reported values for similar material systems, we observed a significant dependence of the damping-like
magnitude on the order of deposition. This suggests interface quality plays an important role in
the overall strength of the damping-like spin-to-charge conversion.
