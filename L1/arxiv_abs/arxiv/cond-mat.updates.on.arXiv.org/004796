It is thought that growing large, oriented grains of perovskite can lead to more efficient devices.
We study MAPbI3 films fabricated via Flash Infrared Annealing (FIRA) consisting of highly oriented,
large grains. Domains observed in the SEM are often misidentified with crystallographic grains,
but SEM images don't provide diffraction information. We measure the grain size, crystal structure
and grain orientation using Electron Back-Scattered Diffraction (EBSD) and we study how these
affect the optoelectronic properties as characterized by local photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved
microwave conductivity measurements (TRMC). We find a spherulitic growth yielding large (tens
of micron), highly oriented grains along the (112) and (400) planes in contrast to randomly oriented,
smaller (400 nm) grains observed in films fabricated via conventional antisolvent (AS) dripping.
We observe a local enhancement and shift of the photoluminescence emission at different regions
of the FIRA clusters, but these can be explained with a combination of light-outcoupling and self-absorption.
We observe no effect of crystal orientation on the optoelectronic properties. Additionally, despite
a substantial difference in grain size between our FIRA sample and a conventional AS sample, we find
similar photoluminescence and charge carrier mobilities and lifetime for the two films. These
findings show that the optoelectronic quality is not necessarily related to the orientation and
size of crystalline domains in perovskite films indicating that fabrication requirements may
be more relaxed for perovskites.
