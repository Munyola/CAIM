A generic aggregate forming system in two dimensions (2D) is studied using canonical ensemble constant
temperature molecular dynamics simulation. The aggregates form due to the competition between
short range attraction and long range repulsion of pair-wise interactions. Choosing the appropriate
set of interaction parameters, we focus on characterising the collective dynamics in two specific
morphologies, {\it viz.} compact and string-like aggregates. We focus on the temporal evolution
of the mobility of an individual particle and the dynamic change in its nearest neighbourhood, measured
in terms of the Debye-Waller factor ($\bar{u}_i^2$) and the non-affine parameter ($\chi$), respectively
(defined in the text), and their interrelation over several lengths of observation time $\tau_w$.
The distribution for both measures are found to follow the relation: $P(x;\tau_w) \sim \tau_w^{-\gamma}x$
for the measured quantity $x$. The exponent $\gamma$ is equal to $2$ and $1$ respectively, for the
compact and string-like morphologies following the ideal fractal dimension of these aggregates.
A functional dependence between these two observables is determined from a detailed statistical
analysis of their joint and conditional distributions. The results obtained can readily be used
and verified by experiments on aggregate forming systems such as globular proteins, nanoparticle
self-assembly etc. Further, the insights gained from this study might be useful to understand the
evolution of collective dynamics in diverse glass-forming systems.
