We studied a system formed by a mixture of a thermoresponsive negatively charged graft copolymer
(Alg-g-PNIPAAm) with a brush-type structure, and an oppositely charged surfactant (DTAB), in
bulk and at the air-solution interface. We performed experiments of surface tension, electrophoretic
mobility, dynamic and static light scattering and atomic force microscopy in order to characterize
the complexes formed as a function of DTAB concentration and temperature. We found that these polymer-surfactant
complexes are able to respond by changing their sizes, both in bulk and at the air-solution interface,
when T is increased above the coil-globule transition temperature (LSCT) of the copolymer. However,
the thermoresponse was found to be dependent on surfactant concentration, cs: for cs < 2.8 mM, the
size of the aggregates decreases as T increases but, for cs >= 2.8 mM, the opposite behavior takes
place, i.e. the size increases with T. At the interface, the intensity of the effect produced on the
surface tension by increasing T above LCST diminishes continuously as cs increases, reducing the
ability of the interfacial complex to respond to temperature changes. We studied the stability
of aqueous foams formulated with these mixtures as a function of T and cs. We found that the stability
of the foam can be modulated by changing T, but we observed that this effect is dependent on the surfactant
concentration range. We found a correlation between changes in the aggregates sizes, the surface
tension behavior and the responsiveness of foam stability to changes of temperature.
