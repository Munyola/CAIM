In these four lectures I describe basic ideas and methods applicable to both classical and quantum
systems displaying slow relaxation and non-equilibrium dynamics. The first half of these notes
considers classical systems, and the second half, quantum systems. In Lecture 1, I briefly review
the glass transition problem as a paradigm of slow relaxation and dynamical arrest in classical
many-body systems. I discuss theoretical perspectives on how to think about glasses, and in particular
how to model them in terms of kinetically constrained dynamics. In Lecture 2, I describe how via large
deviation methods it is possible to define a statistical mechanics of trajectories which reveals
the dynamical phase structure of systems with complex relaxation such as glasses. Lecture 3 is about
closed (i.e. isolated) many-body quantum systems. I review thermalisation and many-body localisation,
and consider the possibility of slow thermalisation and quantum non-ergodicity in the absence
of disorder, thus connecting with some of the ideas of the first lecture. Lecture 4 is about open quantum
systems, that is, quantum systems interacting with an environment. I review the description of
open quantum dynamics within the Markovian approximation in terms of quantum master equations
and stochastic quantum trajectories, and explain how to extend the dynamical large deviation method
to study the statistical properties of ensembles of quantum jump trajectories. My overall aim is
to draw analogies between classical and quantum non-equilibrium and find connections in the way
we think about problems in these areas.
