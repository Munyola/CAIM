The paper investigates the coexistence and interplay of spin and mass superfluidity in the antiferromagnetic
spin-1 BEC. The hydrodynamical theory describes the spin degree of freedom by the equations similar
to the Landau--Lifshitz--Gilbert theory for bipartite antiferromagnetic insulator. The variables
in the spin space are two subspins with absolute value $\hbar/2$, which play the role of two sublattice
spins in the antiferromagnetic insulators. As well as in bipartite antiferromagnetic insulators,
in the antiferromagnetic spin-1 BEC there are two spin-wave modes, one is a gapless Goldstone mode,
another is gapped. The Landau criterion shows that in limit of small total spin (two subspins are
nearly antiparallel) instability of supercurrents starts from the gapped mode. In the opposite
limit of large total spin (two subspins are nearly parallel) the gapless modes become unstable earlier
than the gapped one. Mass and spin supercurrents decay via phase slips, when vortices cross streamlines
of supercurrent. The vortices participating in phase slips are nonsingular bicirculation vortices.
They are characterized by two topological charges, which are winding numbers describing circulations
of two angles around the vortex axis. The winding numbers can be half-integer. A particular example
of a half-integer vortex is a half-quantum vortex with the superfluid velocity circulation $h/2m$.
But the superfluid velocity circulation is not a topological charge, and in general the quantum
of this circulation can be continuously tuned from 0 to $h/2m$.
