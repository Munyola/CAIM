In this paper, we establish that Majorana zero modes emerging from a topological band structure
of a chain of magnetic atoms embedded in a superconductor can be distinguished from trivial localized
zero energy states that may accidentally form in this system using spin resolved measurements.
To demonstrate this key Majorana diagnostics, we study the spin composition of magnetic impurity
induced in-gap Shiba states in a superconductor using a quantum impurity model (at the mean-field
level). By examining the spin and spectral densities in the context of the Bogoliubov-de Gennes
(BdG) particle-hole symmetry, we derive a sum rule that relates the spin densities of localized
Shiba states with those in the normal state without superconductivity. Extending our investigations
to ferromagnetic chain of magnetic impurities, we identify key features of the spin properties
of the extended Shiba state bands, as well as those associated with a localized Majorana end mode
when the effect of spin-orbit interaction is included. We then formulate a phenomenological theory
for the measurement of the local spin densities with spin-polarized scanning tunneling microscopy
(STM) techniques. By combining the calculated spin densities and the measurement theory, we show
that spin-polarized STM measurements can reveal a sharp contrast in spin polarization between
an accidentally-zero-energy trivial Shiba state and a Majorana zero mode in a topological superconducting
phase in atomic chains. We further confirm our results with numerical simulations that address
generic parameter settings.
