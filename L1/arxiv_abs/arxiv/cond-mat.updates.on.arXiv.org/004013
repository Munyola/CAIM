A stopping time $T$ is the first time when a trajectory of a stochastic process satisfies a certain
criterion, which does not anticipate future events. In this paper, we derive using martingale theory
the integral fluctuation relation $\langle e^{-S_{\rm tot}(T)}\rangle=1$ for the stochastic
entropy production $S_{\rm tot}$ at stopping times $T$ of a non-equilibrium steady-state physical
system. This fluctuation relation implies a law of thermodynamics at stopping times, which is similar
to the second law and states that it is not possible to reduce entropy on average, even when stopping
a stochastic process at a cleverly chosen moment. Applying the integral fluctuation relation to
different examples of stopping times we derive universal equalities and inequalities for the fluctuations
of entropy production. For example, we bound the probability of entropy decreases by deriving bounds
on the statistics of negative records of entropy production and we derive generic bounds for splitting
probabilities of entropy production. For continuous processes we derive equalities for fluctuation
properties of entropy production, such as, splitting probabilities and the statistics of negative
records of entropy production. The integral fluctuation relation at stopping times can serve as
a proxy for the exponential martingale structure of the stochastic entropy production, and we solve
the problem of finite statistics for the integral fluctuation relation at stopping times, which
is relevant for empirical tests of this relation.
