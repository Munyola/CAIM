Perceptual decision making is the subject of many experimental and theoretical studies. Whereas
most modeling analysis are based on statistical processes of accumulation of evidence, less attention
is being devoted to the modeling with attractor network dynamics, even though they describe well
psychophysical and neurophysiological data. In particular, very few works confront attractor
models predictions with data from continuous sequences of trials. Recently however, a biophysical
competitive attractor network model has been used to describe such sequences of decision trials,
and has been shown to reproduce repetition biases observed in perceptual decision experiments.
Here we propose an extension of the reduced attractor network model of Wong and Wang (2006) to get
more insights into such effects. We make explicit the conditions under which such network can perform
a succession of decisions, and show that the model provides a mathematical framework for studying
the effects of a trial on the decision made on the next one. We study in details the reaction times properties
during a sequence of decision trials, and show that the model reproduces behavioral data, both qualitatively
and quantitatively. In particular, we find that the decision made on the current trial is biased
toward the one made on the previous trial. More remarkably, we show that, in the absence of any feedback
about the correctness of the decision, the network exhibits post-error slowing, a subtle effect
in agreement with empirical data.
