Highly efficient and widely applicable working mechanisms that allow nanomaterials and devices
to respond to external stimuli with controlled mechanical motions could make far-reaching impact
to reconfigurable, adaptive, and robotic nanodevices. Here, we report an innovative mechanism
that allows multifold reconfiguration of mechanical rotation of semiconductor nanoentities
in electric (E) fields by visible light stimulation. When illuminated by light in the visible to
infrared range, the rotation speed of semiconductor Si nanowires in electric fields can instantly
increase, decrease, and even reverse the orientation depending on the intensity of the applied
light and the AC E-field frequency. This multifold rotation configuration is highly efficient,
instant, and facile. Switching between different modes can be simply controlled by the light intensity
at an AC frequency. An array of experimentations, theoretical analysis, and simulations are carried
out to understand the underlying principle, which can be attributed to the optically tunable polarization
of Si nanowires in aqueous suspension and an external electric field. Finally, leveraging this
newly discovered effect, we successfully differentiate semiconductor and metallic nanoentities
in a non-contact and non-destructive manner. This research could inspire a new class of reconfigurable
nanoelectromechanical and nanorobotic devices for optical sensing, communication, molecule
release, detection, nanoparticle separation, and microfluidic automation.
