Suspensions of self-motile, elongated particles are a topic of significant current interest,
exemplifying a form of `active matter'. Examples include self-propelling bacteria, algae and
sperm, and artificial swimmers. Ericksen's model of a transversely-isotropic fluid [J. L. Ericksen,
Colloid Polym. Sci. 173(2):117-122 (1960)] treats suspensions of non-motile particles as a continuum
with an evolving preferred direction; this model describes fibrous materials as diverse as extracellular
matrix, textile tufts and plant cell walls. Director-dependent effects are incorporated through
a modified stress tensor with four viscosity-like parameters. By making fundamental connections
with recent models for active suspensions, we propose a modification to Ericksen's model, mainly
the inclusion of self motility; this can be considered the simplest description of an oriented suspension
including transversely-isotropic effects. Motivated by the fact that transversely-isotropic
fluids exhibit modified flow stability, we conduct a linear stability analysis of two distinct
cases, aligned and isotropic suspensions of elongated active particles. Novel aspects include
the anisotropic rheology and translational diffusion. In general anisotropic effects increase
the instability of small perturbations, whilst translational diffusion stabilises a range of
wave-directions and, in some cases, a finite range of wave-numbers, thus emphasising that both
anisotropy and translational diffusion can have important effects in these systems.
