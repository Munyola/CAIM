Frustrated spin systems on Kagome lattices have long been considered to be a promising candidate
for realizing exotic spin liquid phases. Recently, there has been a lot of renewed interest in these
systems with the discovery of materials such as Volborthite and Herbertsmithite that have Kagome
like structures. In the presence of an external magnetic field, these frustrated systems can give
rise to magnetization plateaus of which the plateau at $m=\frac{1}{3}$ is considered to be the most
prominent. Here we study the problem of the antiferromagnetic spin-1/2 quantum XXZ Heisenberg
model on a Kagome lattice by using a Jordan-Wigner transformation that maps the spins onto a problem
of fermions coupled to a Chern-Simons gauge field. This mapping relies on being able to define a consistent
Chern-Simons term on the lattice. Using a recently developed method to rigorously extend the Chern-Simons
term to the frustrated Kagome lattice we can now formalize the Jordan-Wigner transformation on
the Kagome lattice. We then discuss the possible phases that can arise at the mean-field level from
this mapping and focus specifically on the case of $\frac{1}{3}$-filling ($m=\frac{1}{3}$ plateau)
and analyze the effects of fluctuations in our theory. We show that in the regime of $XY$ anisotropy
the ground state at the $1/3$ plateau is equivalent to a bosonic fractional quantum Hall Laughlin
state with filling fraction $1/2$ and that at the $5/9$ plateau it is equivalent to the first bosonic
Jain daughter state at filling fraction $2/3$.
