The possibility of inducing superconductivity in Weyl semimetal through coupling its surface
to a superconductor was investigated. A single crystal of NbP, grown by chemical vapor transport
method, was carefully characterized by XRD, EDX, SEM, ARPES techniques and by electron transport
measurements. The mobility spectrum of the carriers was determined and it was found that there are
four separate sharp peaks visible, which indicates that the carriers participating in the conductance
have four different (almost discrete) mobilities. For the studies of interface transmission,
the (001) surface of the crystal was covered by several hundred nm thick metallic layers of either
Pb, or Nb, or In. DC current-voltage characteristics and AC differential conductance through the
interfaces were investigated. The measurements were carried out as a function of temperature and
the results were interpreted in terms of the modified Blonder-Tinkham-Klapwijk model. Upon cooling
of the devices during which the metals become superconducting, qualitatively different behavior
of each type of junctions was observed. The junctions with Nb and Pb show high interface transmission
pointing out the Andreev reflection as a prevalent contribution to the subgap conductance. This
also indicates that both Pb and Nb superconductors are promising candidates for further studies
of the proximity-induced superconducting Weyl semimetals. However, in the case of In, an alloyed
interface region is formed, which presumably excludes this metal from such studies.
