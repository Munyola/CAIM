Self-assembled one-dimensional atomic structures on the surface of semiconductors are sought
for their potential applications in novel quantum devices. Such systems with long-range interactions
of electrons confined to one-dimensional channels are interesting also for enabling fundamental
scientific discoveries. The further understanding of the microscopic mechanisms behind their
exotic spectral properties is one of the conditions for finding successful new applications. The
universal theory for the high-energy spectral properties of a wide class of one-dimensional correlated
lattice systems whose microscopic mechanisms involve phase shifts imposed by a mobile quantum
impurity has though not been extended to long-range interactions. Here that problem is addressed
by adding to the Hubbard model screened-Coulomb potentials of general form. A representation in
terms of charge fractionalized particles whose scattering corresponds to the unitary limit reveals
unexpected universality. It concerns the independence from the short-distance part of the potentials
of the high-energy one-electron spectral functions near and at the (k,omega)-plane singular features
where most of the spectral weight is located. Such systems are found to share universal properties
with three-dimensional atomic scattering problems for which the potential at small distances
can be replaced by a universal energy-independent boundary condition. The universal theory is
successfully applied to the angle-resolved-photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) in one-dimensional
states on an Indium Antimonide (001) surface covered with Bismuth.
