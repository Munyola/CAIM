We study spin and valley transports in junctions composed of graphene, silicene and topo- logical
crystalline insulators. We consider normal/magnetic/normal Dirac metal junctions where a gate
electrode is attached to the magnetic region. Our results are: (i) In the nor- mal/ferromagnetic/normal
graphene junctions, it is found that due to the combined effect of the exchange field and the Klein
tunneling, spin current through the junctions has an oscillatory be- havior with respect to the
chemical potential in the ferromagnetic graphene, which can be tuned by the gate voltage. Especially,
we obtain a controllable spin current reversal by the gate volt- age. (ii) In normal/(anti)ferromagnetic/normal
silicene junction, we show that the current through this junction is valley and spin polarized due
to the coupling between valley and spin degrees of freedom, and the valley and spin polarizations
can be tuned by local application of a gate voltage. In particular, we find a fully valley and spin
polarized current by applying the electric field. (iii) In normal/ferromagnetic/normal topological
crystalline insulator junction with a strain induced in the ferromagnetic segment, we investigate
valley resolved conductances and clarify how the valley polarization stemming from the strain
and exchange field appears in this junction. It is found that changing the direction of the magnetization
and the potential in the ferromagnetic region, one can control the dominant valley contribution
out of four valley degrees of freedom.
