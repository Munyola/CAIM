In this article, we briefly review dynamical and thermodynamical aspects of different forms of
quantum motors and quantum pumps. We then extend previous results to provide new theoretical tools
for a systematic study of those phenomena at far-from-equilibrium conditions. We mainly focus
on two key topics: (1) The steady-state regime of quantum motors and pumps, paying particular attention
to the role of higher-order terms in the nonadiabatic expansion of the current-induced forces.
(2) The thermodynamical properties of such systems, emphasizing systematic ways of studying the
relationship between different energy fluxes (charge and heat currents, and mechanical power)
passing through the system when beyond-first-order expansions are required. We derive a general
order-by-order scheme based on energy conservation to rationalize how every order of the expansion
of one form of energy flux is connected with the others. We use this approach to give a physical interpretation
of the leading terms of the expansion. Finally, we illustrate the above-discussed topics in a double
quantum dot within the Coulomb-blockade regime and capacitively coupled to a mechanical rotor.
We find many exciting features of this system for arbitrary nonequilibrium conditions: A definite
parity of the expansion coefficients with respect to the voltage or temperature biases; negative
friction coefficients; and the fact that, under fixed parameters, the device can exhibit multiple
steady states where it may operate as a quantum motor or as a quantum pump depending on the initial
conditions.
