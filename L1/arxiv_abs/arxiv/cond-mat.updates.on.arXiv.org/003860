Due to the wide range of applications, theoretical models of Fe3O4 films are found to be important.
Ultra thin Fe3O4 films with ferrite structure have been theoretically investigated using second
order perturbed modified Heisenberg Hamiltonian. Matrices for ultra thin films with two and three
spin layers are presented in this manuscript. Total magnetic energy was expressed in terms of spin
exchange interaction, magnetic dipole interaction, second order magnetic anisotropy and stress
induced magnetic anisotropy. Magnetic properties were observed for films with two spin layers
and variant second order magnetic anisotropy. For the film with three spin layers, second order
anisotropy constant was fixed to avoid tedious derivations. Magnetic easy axis rotates toward
the in plane direction as the number of spin layers is increased from two to three because the stress
induced anisotropy energy dominates at higher number of spin layers. According to some other experimental
data, the magnetic easy axis of thin films rotates toward the in plane direction as the thickness
is increased. For ferrite film with two spin layers, magnetic easy and hard directions can be observed
at 0.75 and 1.2 radians, respectively, when the ratio of stress induced anisotropy to the long range
dipole interaction strength is 3.9. For ferrite film with three spin layers, magnetic easy and hard
directions can be observed at 2.4 and 2.3 radians, respectively, when the ratio of stress induced
anisotropy to the long range dipole interaction strength is 4.2.
