Packing frustration for confined fluids, i.e., the incompatibility between the preferred packing
of the fluid particles and the packing constraints imposed by the confining surfaces, is studied
for a dense hard-sphere fluid confined between planar hard surfaces at short separations. The detailed
mechanism for the frustration is investigated via an analysis of the anisotropic pair distributions
of the confined fluid, as obtained from integral equation theory for inhomogeneous fluids at pair
correlation level within the anisotropic Percus-Yevick approximation. By examining the mean
forces that arise from interparticle collisions around the periphery of each particle in the slit,
we calculate the principal components of the mean force for the density profile - each component
being the sum of collisional forces on a particle's hemisphere facing either surface. The variations
of these components with the slit width give rise to rather intricate changes in the layer structure
between the surfaces, but, as shown in this paper, the basis of these variations can be easily understood
qualitatively and often also semi-quantitatively. It is found that the ordering of the fluid is
in essence governed locally by the packing constraints at each single solid-fluid interface. A
simple superposition of forces due to the presence of each surface gives surprisingly good estimates
of the density profiles, but there remain nontrivial confinement effects that cannot be explained
by superposition, most notably the magnitude of the excess adsorption of particles in the slit relative
to bulk.
