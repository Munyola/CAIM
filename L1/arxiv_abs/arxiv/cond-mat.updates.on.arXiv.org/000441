The physics of Mott insulators underlies diverse phenomena ranging from high temperature superconductivity
to exotic magnetism. Although both the electron spin and the structure of the local orbitals play
a key role in this physics, in most systems these are connected only indirectly --- via the Pauli exclusion
principle and the Coulomb interaction. Iridium-based oxides (iridates) open a further dimension
to this problem by introducing strong spin-orbit interactions, such that the Mott physics has a
strong orbital character. In the layered honeycomb iridates this is thought to generate highly
spin-anisotropic interactions, coupling the spin orientation to a given spatial direction of
exchange and leading to strongly frustrated magnetism. The potential for new physics emerging
from such interactions has driven much scientific excitement, most recently in the search for a
new quantum spin liquid, first discussed by Kitaev \cite{kitaev_anyons_2006}. Here we report
a new iridate structure that has the same local connectivity as the layered honeycomb, but in a three-dimensional
framework. The temperature dependence of the magnetic susceptibility exhibits a striking reordering
of the magnetic anisotropy, giving evidence for highly spin-anisotropic exchange interactions.
Furthermore, the basic structural units of this material suggest the possibility of a new family
of structures, the `harmonic honeycomb' iridates. This compound thus provides a unique and exciting
glimpse into the physics of a new class of strongly spin-orbit coupled Mott insulators.
