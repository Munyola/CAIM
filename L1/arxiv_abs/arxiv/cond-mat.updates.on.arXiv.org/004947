Vacancy-ordered double perovskites K2SnX6 (X = I, Br, Cl) attract significant research interest
due to their potential application as light-absorbing materials in perovskite solar cells. However,
a deep insight into their material properties at the atomic scale is yet scarce. Here we present a
systematic investigation on their structural, electronic, optical properties and phase stabilities
in cubic, tetragonal, and monoclinic phases based on density functional theory calculations.
Quantitatively reliable prediction of lattice constants, band gaps, effective masses of charge
carriers, exciton binding energies is provided in comparison with the available experimental
data, revealing the increasing tendency of band gap and exciton binding energy as lowering the crystallographic
symmetry from cubic to monoclinic and going from I to Cl. We highlight that cubic K2SnBr6 and monoclinic
K2SnI6 are suitable for the application as a light-absorber for solar cell devices due to their proper
band gaps of 1.65 and 1.16 eV and low exciton binding energies of 59.4 and 15.3 meV, respectively.
The constant-volume Helmholtz free energies are determined through phonon calculations, giving
a prediction of their phase transition temperatures as 449, 433 and 281 K for cubic-tetragonal and
345, 301 and 210 K for tetragonal-monoclinic transitions for X = I, Br and Cl. Our calculations provide
an understanding of material properties of vacancy-ordered double perovskite K2SnX6, helping
to devise a low-cost and high performance perovskite solar cell.
