Antireflection or impedance matching is a topic that has been extensively researched by the optical
and microwave communities over the past century and until today. However, due to the diverging wave
impedances of TE (s) and TM (p) polarizations with increasing incident angle, it is impossible to
achieve perfect matching simultaneously for both polarizations at an oblique incident angle with
a single conventional matching layer. In this paper, we show that simultaneous perfecting matching
of an arbitrary substrate at an arbitrary incident angle from air is possible with a single uniaxial
metamaterial matching layer (UMML) that possesses specific permittivity and permeability tensors.
We demonstrate this concept by synthesizing a physical UMML to match a high-index ({\epsilon}r=
10.2) substrate at 45{\deg}. The required permittivity and permittivity tensors of the UMML are
achieved through the judicious control of the tangential and longitudinal electric and magnetic
responses. Around -30 dB reflections are observed for both polarizations at the design angle. Building
on the UMML concept, we design a novel radome in microwave regime with a near omni-directional matching
performance. For incident angles from 0{\deg}-85{\deg}, reflections remain below -14 dB for both
polarizations. To our best knowledge, this is the widest angular range that has been achieved while
maintaining less than 5% power reflection for both polarizations. The proposed UMML concept offers
a new paradigm for designing high-performance microwave, terahertz, and optical devices.
