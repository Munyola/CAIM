Using Monte Carlo simulations, we investigate the self-assembly of model nanoparticles inside
a matrix of model equilibrium polymers (or matrix of Wormlike micelles) as a function of the polymeric
matrix density and the excluded volume parameter between polymers and nanoparticles. In this paper,
we show morphological transitions in the system architecture via synergistic self-assembly of
nanoparticles and the equilibrium polymers. In a synergistic self-assembly, the resulting morphology
of the system is a result of the interaction between both nanoparticles and the polymers, unlike
the polymer templating method. We report the morphological transition of nanoparticle aggregates
from percolating network-like structures to non-percolating clusters as a result of the change
in the excluded volume parameter between nanoparticles and polymeric chains. In parallel with
the change in the self-assembled structures of nanoparticles, the matrix of equilibrium polymers
also shows a transition from a dispersed state to a percolating network-like structure formed by
the clusters of polymeric chains. We show that the shape anisotropy of the nanoparticle clusters
formed is governed by the polymeric density resulting in rod-like, sheet-like or other anisotropic
nanoclusters. It is also shown that the pore shape and the pore size of the porous network of nanoparticles
can be changed by changing the minimum approaching distance between nanoparticles and polymers.
We provide a theoretical understanding of why various nanostructures with very different morphologies
are obtained.
