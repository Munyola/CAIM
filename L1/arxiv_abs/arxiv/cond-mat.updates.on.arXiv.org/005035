Phosphorene, a single layer of black phosphorus, is a direct-band gap two-dimensional semiconductor
with promising charge and spin transport properties. The electronic band structure of phosphorene
is strongly affected by the structural anisotropy of the underlying crystal lattice. We describe
the relevant conduction and valence bands close to the $\Gamma$ point by four- and six-band (with
spin) $k \cdot p$ models, including the previously overlooked interband spin-orbit coupling which
is essential for studying anisotropic crystals. All the $k \cdot p$ parameters are obtained by a
robust fit to {\it ab initio} data, by taking into account the nominal band structure and the $k$-dependence
of the effective mass close to $\Gamma$-point. The inclusion of interband spin-orbit coupling
allows us to determine dipole transitions along both armchair and zigzag directions. The interband
coupling is also key to determine the effective g-factors and Zeeman splittings of the Landau levels.
We predict the electron and hole g-factor of $\approx 2.03$ due to the intrinsic contributions in
phosphorene, which lies within the existing range of experimental data. Furthermore, we investigate
excitonic effects using the $k \cdot p$ models and find exciton binding energy (0.81 eV) and exciton
diameters consistent with experiments and {\it ab initio} based calculations. The proposed $k
\cdot p$ Hamiltonians should be useful for investigating magnetic, spin, transport, optical properties
and many-body effects in phosphorene.
