An ensemble of emitters can behave significantly different from its individual constituents when
interacting coherently via a common light field. After excitation, collective coupling gives
rise to an intriguing many-body quantum phenomenon, resulting in short, intense bursts of light:
so-called superfluorescence. Because it requires a fine balance of interaction between the emitters
and their decoupling from the environment, together with close identity of the individual emitters,
superfluorescence has thus far been observed only in a limited number of systems, such as atomic
and molecular gases and semiconductor crystals, and could not be harnessed for applications. For
colloidal nanocrystals, however, which are of increasing relevance in a number of opto-electronic
applications, the generation of superfluorescent light was precluded by inhomogeneous emission
broadening, low oscillator strength, and fast exciton dephasing. Using caesium lead halide (CsPbX3,
X = Cl, Br) perovskite nanocrystals that are self-organized into highly ordered three-dimensional
superlattices allows us to observe key signatures of superfluorescence: red-shifted emission
with more than ten-fold accelerated radiative decay, extension of the first-order coherence time
by more than a factor of four, photon bunching, and delayed emission pulses with Burnham-Chiao ringing
behaviour at high excitation density. These mesoscopically extended coherent states can be employed
to boost opto-electronic device performances and enable entangled multi-photon quantum light
sources.
