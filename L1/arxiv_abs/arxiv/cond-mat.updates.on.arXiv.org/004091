Even within small organs like pancreatic islets, different endocrine cell types and subtypes form
a heterogeneous collective to sense the chemical composition of the extracellular solution and
compute an adequate hormonal output. Erroneous cellular processing and hormonal output due to
challenged heterogeneity result in various disorders with diabetes mellitus as a flagship metabolic
disease. Here we attempt to address the aforementioned functional heterogeneity with comparing
pairwise cell-cell cross-correlations obtained from simultaneous measurements of cytosolic
calcium responses in hundreds of islet cells in an optical plane to statistical properties of correlations
predicted by the random matrix theory (RMT). We find that the bulk of the empirical eigenvalue spectrum
is almost completely described by RMT prediction, however, the deviating eigenvalues that exist
below and above RMT spectral edges suggest that there are local and extended modes driving the correlations.
We show that empirical nearest neighbor spacing of eigenvalues follows universal RMT properties
regardless of glucose stimulation, but that number variance displays clear separation from RMT
prediction and can differentiate between empirical spectra obtained under non-stimulated and
stimulated conditions. We suggest that RMT approach provides a sensitive tool to assess the functional
cell heterogeneity and its effects on the spatio-temporal dynamics a collective of beta cells in
pancreatic islets in physiological resting and stimulatory conditions.
