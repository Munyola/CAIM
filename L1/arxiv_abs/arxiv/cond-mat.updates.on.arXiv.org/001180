Ductile fracture through void growth and coalescence depends significantly on the plastic anisotropy
of the material and on void size, as shown by experiments and/or numerical simulations through several
studies. Macroscopic (homogenized) yield criteria aiming at modeling nanoporous materials have
been proposed only for the growth regime, i.e. non-interacting voids. The aim of this study is thus
to provide a yield criterion for nanoporous materials relevant for the coalescence regime, i.e.
when plastic flow is localized between voids. Through homogenization and limit analysis, and accounting
for interface stresses at the void-matrix interface, analytical coalescence criterion is derived
under the following conditions: axisymmetric loading, orthotropic material obeying Hill's plasticity,
cylindrical voids in cylindrical unit-cell. Incidentally, an orthotropic extension of the existing
isotropic modeling of interface stresses through limit analysis is described and used. The proposed
coalescence criterion is then extended to account for combined tension and shear loading conditions.
Numerical limit analyses have been performed under specific conditions / materials parameters
to get supposedly exact (up to numerical errors) results of coalescence stress. A good agreement
between the analytical coalescence criteria derived in this study and numerical results is found
for elongated spheroidal voids, making them usable to predict the onset of void coalescence in ductile
fracture modeling of nanoporous materials.
