Complex cementitious matrices undergo weathering with environmental exchange and can release
metallic pollutants during alteration. The molecular mechanisms responsible for metal release
are difficult to identify, though this is necessary if such processes are to be controlled. The present
study determines and models the molecular mechanisms of Pb release during Portland cement leaching.
As Pb release is strongly related to its speciation (i.e. atomic environment and the nature of bearing
phases), the first objective of the present study was to investigate the evolution of Pb retention
sites together with the evolution of the cement mineralogy during leaching. Complementary and
efficient investigation tools were used, namely X-ray diffraction, micro-X-ray fluorescence
and X-ray absorption fine structures. The second objective was to reproduce our results with a reactive
transport code (CHESS/HYTEC) in order to test the proposed speciation model of Pb. Combined results
indicate that in both the unaltered core and the altered layer of the leached cement, Pb(II) would
be retained through C-S-H 'nano-structure', probably linked to a Q1 or Q2P silicate tetrahedra.
Moreover in the altered layer, the presence of Fe atoms in the atomic environment of Pb is highly probable.
Unfortunately little is known about Fe phases in cement, which makes the interpretation difficult.
Can Fe- substituted hydrogranet (C3AH6) be responsible for Pb retention? Modelling results were
consistent with Pb retention through C-S-H in layers and also in an additional, possibly Fe-containing,
Pb-retention phase in the altered layer.
