Geometric frustration emerges when local interaction energies in an ordered lattice structure
cannot be simultaneously minimized, resulting in a large number of degenerate states. The numerous
degenerate configurations may lead to practical applications in microelectronics, such as data
storage, memory and logic. However, it is difficult to achieve extensive degeneracy, especially
in a two-dimensional system. Here, we showcase in-situ controllable geometric frustration with
massive degeneracy in a two-dimensional flux quantum system. We create this in a superconducting
thin film placed underneath a reconfigurable artificial-spin-ice structure. The tunable magnetic
charges in the artificial-spin-ice strongly interact with the flux quanta in the superconductor,
enabling the switching between frustrated and crystallized flux quanta states. The different
states have measurable effects on the superconducting critical current profile, which can be reconfigured
by precise selection of the spin ice magnetic state through application of an external magnetic
field. We demonstrate the applicability of these effects by realizing a reprogrammable flux quanta
diode. The tailoring of the energy landscape of interacting 'particles' using artificial-spin-ices
provides a new paradigm for the design of geometric frustration, which allows us to control new functionalities
in other material systems, such as magnetic skyrmions, electrons/holes in two-dimensional materials
and topological insulators, as well as colloids in soft materials.
