Layered metal chalcogenide materials provide a versatile platform to investigate emergent phenomena
and two-dimensional (2D) superconductivity at/near the atomically thin limit. In particular,
gate-induced interfacial superconductivity realized by the use of an electric-double-layer
transistor (EDLT) has greatly extended the capability to electrically induce superconductivity
in oxides, nitrides and transition metal chalcogenides and enable one to explore new physics, such
as the Ising pairing mechanism. Exploiting gate-induced superconductivity in various materials
can provide us with additional platforms to understand emergent interfacial superconductivity.
Here, we report the discovery of gate-induced 2D superconductivity in layered 1T-SnSe2, a typical
member of the main-group metal dichalcogenide (MDC) family, using an EDLT gating geometry. A superconducting
transition temperature Tc around 3.9 K was demonstrated at the EDL interface. The 2D nature of the
superconductivity therein was further confirmed based on 1) a 2D Tinkham description of the angle-dependent
upper critical field, 2) the existence of a quantum creep state as well as a large ratio of the coherence
length to the thickness of superconductivity. Interestingly, the in-plane approaching zero temperature
was found to be 2-3 times higher than the Pauli limit, which might be related to an electric field-modulated
spin-orbit interaction. Such results provide a new perspective to expand the material matrix available
for gate-induced 2D superconductivity and the fundamental understanding of interfacial superconductivity.
