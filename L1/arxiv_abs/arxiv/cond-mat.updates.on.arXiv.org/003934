In this paper, we develop a non-singular continuum theory of point defects based on a second strain
gradient elasticity theory, the so-called gradient elasticity of bi-Helmholtz type. Such a generalized
continuum theory possesses a weak nonlocal character with two internal material lengths and provides
a mechanics of defects without singularities. Gradient elasticity of bi-Helmholtz type gives
a natural and physical regularization of the classical singularities of defects, based on higher
order partial differential equations. Point defects embedded in an isotropic solid are considered
as eigenstrain problem in gradient elasticity of bi-Helmholtz type. Singularity-free fields
of point defects are presented. The displacement field as well as the first, the second and the third
gradients of the displacement are derived and it is shown that the classical singularities are regularized
in this framework. This model delivers non-singular expressions for the displacement field, the
first displacement gradient and the second displacement gradient. Moreover, the plastic distortion
(eigendistortion) and the gradient of the plastic distortion of a dilatation centre are also non-singular
and are given in terms of a form factor (shape function) of a point defect. Singularity-free expressions
for the interaction energy and the interaction force between two dilatation centres and for the
interaction energy and the interaction force of a dilatation centre in the stress field of an edge
dislocation are given. The results are applied to calculate the finite self-energy of a dilatation
centre.
