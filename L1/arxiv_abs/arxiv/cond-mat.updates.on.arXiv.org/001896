Here we report a density functional theory study of strain effects on lithium diffusion pathways
for (Li,Al)-co-doped magnesium spinel, for $x_\mathrm{Li} = 0.25$ and $x_\mathrm{Li} = 0.5$.
We have calculated diffusion profiles for the unstrained materials, and for isotropic and biaxial
tensile strains of up to 6%, corresponding to {100} epitaxial interfaces with Li$_y$Mn$_2$O$_4$
and Li$_{4+3z}$Ti$_5$O$_{12}$. We find that isotropic tensile strain reduces lithium diffusion
barriers from ~ 0.4 eV by as much as 0.28 eV, with typical barriers reduced by ~ 0.15 eV. This effect
is associated with increased volumes of transitional octahedral sites, and broadly follows qualitative
changes in local electrostatic potentials. For biaxial (epitaxial) strain, which more closely
approximates strain at a lattice-matched electrolyte-electrode interface, changes in octahedral
site volumes and in lithium diffusion barriers are much smaller than under isotropic strain. These
results predict that isotropic strain strongly affects ionic conductivities in (Li,Al)-co-doped
magnesium spinel electrolytes, and that tensile strain is a potential route to enhanced lithium
transport. For a lattice-matched interface with candidate spinel-structured electrodes, however,
epitaxial strain has only a small effect on lithium diffusion barriers. From the perspective of
local diffusion barriers, therefore, epitaxial strain at coherent lattice-matched electrolyte-electrode
interfaces is therefore not expected to strongly affect lithium transport rates or overall cell
performance.
