With the recent successes of neural networks (NN) to perform machine-learning tasks, photonic-based
NN designs may enable high throughput and low power neuromorphic compute paradigms since they bypass
the parasitic charging of capacitive wires. Thus, engineering data-information processors capable
of executing NN algorithms with high efficiency is of major importance for applications ranging
from pattern recognition to classification. Our hypothesis is therefore, that if the time-limiting
electro-optic conversion of current photonic NN designs could be postponed until the very end of
the network, then the execution time of the photonic algorithm is simple the delay of the time-of-flight
of photons through the NN, which is on the order of picoseconds for integrated photonics. Exploring
such all-optical NN, in this work we discuss two independent approaches of implementing the optical
perceptrons nonlinear activation function based on nanophotonic structures exhibiting i) induced
transparency and ii) reverse saturated absorption. Our results show that the all-optical nonlinearity
provides about 3 and 7 dB extinction ratio for the two systems considered, respectively, and classification
accuracies of an exemplary MNIST task of 97% and near 100% are found, which rivals that of software
based trained NNs, yet with ignored noise in the network. Together with a developed concept for an
all-optical perceptron, these findings point to the possibility of realizing pure photonic NNs
with potentially unmatched throughput and even energy consumption for next generation information
processing hardware.
