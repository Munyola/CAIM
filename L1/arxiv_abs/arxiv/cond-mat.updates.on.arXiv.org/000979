The mechanical, thermal and vibrational properties of defective crystals are important in many
different contexts, from metallurgy and solid-state physics to, more recently, soft matter and
colloidal physics. Here we study two different models of disordered fcc crystal lattices, with
randomly-removed bonds and with vacancies, respectively, within the framework of non-affine
lattice dynamics. We find that both systems feature the same scaling of the shear modulus with the
newly defined inversion-symmetry breaking (ISB) parameter, which shows that local inversion-symmetry
breaking around defects is the universal root source of the non-affine softening of the shear modulus.
This finding allows us to derive analytical relations for the non-affine (zero-frequency) shear
modulus as a function of vacancy concentration in excellent agreement with numerical simulations.
Nevertheless, due to the different microstructural disorder, the spatial fluctuations of the
local ISB parameter are different in the vacancy and bond-depleted case. The vacancy fcc exhibits
comparatively a more heterogenous microstructural disorder (due to the broader distribution
of coordination number $Z$), which is reflected in a different scaling relation between boson peak
frequency in the DOS and the average $\bar{Z}$. These differences are less important at low vacancy
concentrations, where the numerical DOS of the vacancy fcc can be well described theoretically
by coherent-potential approximation, presented here for the bond-depleted fcc lattice in 3d.
