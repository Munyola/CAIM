As the simplest non-Fermi liquids, orthogonal metals have gapped single-particle excitations
but show normal metallic behaviors in thermodynamic and transport quantities. Such an exotic metallic
state could be realized in a Hubbard model with pair-hopping term. However, it is difficult to solve
this model in higher dimension, here we focus on its one-dimension version, in which a powerful U(1)
abelian bosonization technique is available to capture \textit{analytically} its universal
low-energy physics. It is found that the one-dimensional system is unable to provide an appropriate
precursor for the desirable orthogonal metals in higher dimension and the occurrence of the featureless
orthogonal metallic phase needs \textit{at least} a quasi-one-dimensional multi-leg ladder
model. Nevertheless, two interesting quantum liquid phases are identified for the present one-dimensional
model, namely, pair-density wave (PDW) state and pair-superconducting (PSC) state. The former
describes the charge-density-wave order of cooper pairs while the latter shows the superfluidity
of two cooper pairs. Needing not any explicit calculation, these two phases could have further implications
in the two-dimensional case, namely, the PDW state may give rise to quantum electron liquid crystal
states, which is believed to be responsible for the complex pseudogap phase in cuprate, and the PSC
state with charge 4e can be related to certain nematic superconducting state. These predications
call for further investigation on this model in higher dimension by available analytical methods
and/or numerical calculations.
