The breaking of inversion symmetry combined with polar discontinuity and the presence of strong
electronic correlations due to partially filled 3d electronic shell of Ti ions at the LaAlO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$
(LAO/STO) and LaTiO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ (LTO/STO) interfaces conspire to produce exotic electronic
phases. These include macroscopic superconducting and ferromagnetic orders and electronic transport
renormalized by strong spin-orbit (S-O) interaction originating to the built-in electrostatic
fields at the interface and scattering by localized moments. An important ingredient in this exotic
soup of causes and effects is also the quantum paraelectric nature of STO. In order to separate out
the contributions of these phenomena from electronic behavior of oxide interfaces, new approaches
need to be developed. Here, we present a study of delta doping at LTO/STO interface with iso-structural
perovskite of LaCrO$_3$ (LCO) that dramatically alters the properties of the two dimensional electron
gas (2DEG) at the interface. The effects include a reduction in sheet-carrier density, prominence
of the low temperature resistivity minimum in LAO/STO and LTO/STO 2DEG, enhancement of weak antilocalization
below 10 K and observation of a strong anisotropic magnetoresistance (MR). The positive and negative
MR for out-of-plane and in-plane field respectively and the field and temperature dependencies
of MR suggest Kondo scattering by localized Ti$^{3+}$ moments renormalized by S-O at T < 10 K,
with the increase of Cr$^{3+}$ concentration at the interface.
