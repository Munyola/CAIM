MV$_2$Ga$_4$ (M = Sc, Zr, Hf) compounds belong to an emerging class of materials showing a unique
combination of unusual superconducting behavior with extended linear chains in the crystal structure.
In order to gain insights {into} its mechanical and thermal properties, we have performed first-principles
electronic-structure calculations in the framework of the Density Functional Theory (DFT). From
the calculated second-order elastic constants, we have systematically shown that the extended
linear vanadium chain substructures indeed give rise to an anisotropic regime in the elastic and
mechanical moduli. The high density of valence and conduction electrons along the linear vanadium
chains leads to a directional dependence of the reciprocal linear compressibility, Young's modulus
and shear modulus. Poisson's ratio for several elongation directions is also drastically affected
by the presence of extended V chains. If the elongation is along the V chains, all compounds exhibit
{practically} the same Poisson ratio in directions perpendicular to it, further highlighting
the importance of the V chains to the mechanical properties. Moreover, based on our results, we have
discussed the possible consequences of the elastic anisotropy on the superconducting properties
of the compounds. Finally, using the Debye-Gr\"uneisen approximation, our calculations of thermal
properties show {a good agreement with the available experimental low temperature heat capacity
data above the superconducting critical temperature.
