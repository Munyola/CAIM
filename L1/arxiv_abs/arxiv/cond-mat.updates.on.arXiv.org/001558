We experimentally realize a sophisticated structure geometry for reliable magnetic domain wall-based
multi-turn-counting sensor devices, which we term closed-loop devices that can sense millions
of turns. The concept relies on the reliable propagation of domain walls through a cross-shaped
intersection of magnetic conduits, to allow the intertwining of loops of the sensor device. As a
key step to reach the necessary reliability of the operation, we develop a combination of tilted
wires called the syphon structure at the entrances of the cross. We measure the control and reliability
of the domain wall propagation individually for cross-shaped intersections, the syphon geometries
and finally combinations of the two for various field configurations (strengths and angles). The
various measured syphon geometries yield a dependence of the domain wall propagation on the shape
that we explain by the effectively acting transverse and longitudinal external applied magnetic
fields. The combination of both elements yields a behaviour that cannot be explained by a simple
superposition of the individual different maximum field operation values. We identify as an additional
process the nucleation of domain walls in the cross, which then allows us to fully gauge the operational
parameters. Finally, we demonstrate that by tuning the central dimensions of the cross and choosing
the optimum angle for the syphon structure reliable sensor operation is achieved, which paves the
way for disruptive multi-turn sensor devices.
