The spin-1/2 Ising-Heisenberg branched chain composed of regularly alternating Ising spins and
Heisenberg dimers involving an additional side branching is rigorously solved in a magnetic field
by the transfer-matrix approach. The ground-state phase diagram, the magnetization process and
the concurrence measuring a degree of bipartite entanglement within the Heisenberg dimers are
examined in detail. Three different ground states were found depending on a mutual interplay between
the magnetic field and two different coupling constants: the modulated quantum antiferromagnetic
phase, the quantum ferrimagnetic phase and the classical ferromagnetic phase. Two former quantum
ground states are manifested in zero-temperature magnetization curves as intermediate plateaus
at zero and one-half of the saturation magnetization, whereas the one-half plateau disappears
at a triple point induced by a strong enough ferromagnetic Ising coupling. The ground-state phase
diagram and zero-temperature magnetization curves of the analogous spin-1/2 Heisenberg branched
chain were investigated using DMRG calculations. The latter fully quantum Heisenberg model involves,
besides two gapful phases manifested as zero and one-half magnetization plateaus, gapless quantum
spin-liquid phase. The intermediate one-half plateau of the spin-1/2 Heisenberg branched chain
vanishes at Kosterlitz-Thouless quantum critical point between gapful and gapless quantum ground
states unlike the triple point of the spin-1/2 Ising-Heisenberg branched chain.
