To develop next-generation electronics and high efficiency energy-harvesting devices, it is
crucial to understand how charge and heat are transported at the nanoscale. Metallic atomic-size
contacts are ideal systems to probe the quantum limits of transport. The thermal and electrical
conductance of gold atomic contacts has been recently proven to be quantized at room temperature.
However, a big experimental challenge in such measurements is represented by the fast breaking
dynamics of metallic junctions at room temperature, which can exceed the typical response time
of the thermal measurement. Here we use a break-junction setup that combines Scanning Tunneling
Microscopy with suspended micro electro-mechanical systems with a gold-covered membrane and
an integrated heater acting also as thermometer. By using other metals as tip materials, namely
Pt, PtIr and W, we show heat transport measurements through single gold atomic contacts. The dependence
of the thermal conductance is analysed as function of contact size and material used. We find that
by using Pt and Pt-Ir tips we can maximize the mechanical stability and probability of forming single
Au atomic contacts. We then show the quantization of the electrical and thermal conductance with
the verification of the Wiedemann-Franz law at the atomic scale. We expect these findings to increase
the flexibility of experimental techniques probing heat transport in metallic quantum point contacts
and to enable the investigation of thermal properties of molecular junctions.
