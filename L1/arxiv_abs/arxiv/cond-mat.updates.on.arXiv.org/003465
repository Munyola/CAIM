Despite almost a century worth of study, it is still unclear how general relativity (GR) and quantum
theory (QT) should be unified into a consistent theory. The conventional approach is to retain the
foundational principles of QT, such as the superposition principle, and modify GR. This is referred
to as 'quantizing gravity', resulting in a theory of 'quantum gravity'. The opposite approach is
'gravitizing QT' where we attempt to keep the principles of GR, such as the equivalence principle,
and consider how this leads to modifications of QT. What we are most lacking in understanding which
route to take, if either, is experimental guidance. Here we consider using a Bose-Einstein condensate
(BEC) to search for clues. In particular, we study how a single BEC in a superposition of two locations
could test a gravitizing QT proposal where wavefunction collapse emerges from a unified theory
as an objective process, resolving the measurement problem of QT. Such a modification to QT due to
general relativistic principles is testable at the Planck mass scale, which is much closer to experiments
than the Planck length scale where quantum, general relativistic effects are traditionally anticipated
in quantum gravity theories. Furthermore, experimental tests of this proposal should be simpler
to perform than recently suggested experiments that would test the quantizing gravity approach
in the Newtonian gravity limit by searching for entanglement between two massive systems that are
both in a superposition of two locations.
