The CuO$_2$ antiferromagnetic insulator is transformed by hole-doping into an exotic quantum
fluid usually referred to as the pseudogap (PG) phase. Its defining characteristic is a strong suppression
of the electronic density-of-states D(E) for energies |E|<$\Delta^*$, where $\Delta^*$ is the
pseudogap energy. Unanticipated broken-symmetry phases have been detected by a wide variety of
techniques in the PG regime, most significantly a finite Q density-wave (DW) state and a Q=0 nematic
(NE) state. Sublattice-phase-resolved imaging of electronic structure allows the doping and
energy dependence of these distinct broken symmetry states to be visualized simultaneously. Using
this approach, we show that, even though their reported ordering temperatures T$_{DW}$ and T$_{NE}$
are unrelated to each other, both the DW and NE states always exhibit their maximum spectral intensity
at the same energy, and using independent measurements that this is the pseudogap energy $\Delta^*$.
Moreover, no new energy-gap opening coincides with the appearance of the DW state (which should
theoretically open an energy gap on the Fermi-surface), while the observed pseudogap opening coincides
with the appearance of the NE state (which should theoretically be incapable of opening a Fermi-surface
gap). We demonstrate how this perplexing phenomenology of thermal transitions and energy-gap
opening at the breaking of two highly distinct symmetries can be understood as the natural consequence
of a vestigial nematic state , within the pseudogap phase of Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_8$.
