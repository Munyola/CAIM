We present a quantum mechanical theory of optically induced dynamic nuclear polarization applicable
to quantum dots and other interacting spin systems. The exact steady state of the optically driven
coupled electron-nuclear system is calculated under the assumption of uniform hyperfine coupling
strengths (box model) for an arbitrary number of nuclear spins. This steady state is given by a tractable
expression that allows for an intuitive interpretation in terms of spin-flip rates. Based on this
result, we investigate the nuclear spin behaviour for different experimental parameter regimes
and find that our model reproduces the flat-top and triangular absorption line shapes seen in various
experiments (line dragging) under the assumption of fast electron spin dephasing due to phonons
and co-tunneling. The mechanism responsible for line dragging has been a matter of controversy
so far; in contrast with previous works, we show that the effect can be explained solely in terms of
the contact hyperfine interaction, without the need to introduce non-collinear terms or other
types of electron-nuclear interactions. Furthermore we predict a novel nuclear spin polarization
effect: under particular, experimentally realistic conditions, the nuclear spin system tends
to become sharply polarized in such a way as to cancel the effect of the external magnetic field. This
effect can therefore suppress electron spin dephasing due to inhomogeneous broadening, which
could have important repercussions for quantum technological applications.
