It is well known that conventional harmonic lattice dynamics cannot be applied to energetically
unstable crystals at 0 K, such as high temperature body centered cubic (BCC) phase of crystalline
Zr. Predicting phonon spectra at finite temperature requires the calculation of force constants
to the third, fourth and even higher orders, however, it remains challenging to determine to which
order the Taylor expansion of the potential energy surface for different materials should be cut
off. Molecular dynamics, on the other hand, intrinsically includes arbitrary orders of phonon
anharmonicity, however, its accuracy is severely limited by the empirical potential field used.
Using machine learning method, we developed an inter-atomic potential for Zirconium crystals
for both the hexagonal closed-packed (HCP) phase and the body centered cubic phase. The developed
potential field accurately captures energy-volume relationship, elastic constants and phonon
dispersions. The instability of BCC structure is found to originate from the double-well shape
of the potential energy surface where the local maxima is located in an unstable equilibrium position.
The stabilization of the BCC phase at high temperature is due to the dynamical average of the low-symmetry
minima of the double well due to atomic vibrations. Molecular dynamics simulations are then performed
to stochastically sample the potential energy surface and to calculate the phonon dispersion at
elevated temperature. The phonon renormalization in BCC-Zr is successfully captured by the molecular
dynamics simulation at 1188 K.
