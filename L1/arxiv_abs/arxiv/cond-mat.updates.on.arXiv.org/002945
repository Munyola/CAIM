Employing electron spin instead of charge to develop spintronic devices holds the merits of low-power
consumption in information technologies. Meanwhile, the demand for increasing speed in spintronics
beyond current CMOS technology has further triggered intensive researches for ultrafast control
of spin even up to unprecedent terahertz regime. The femtosecond laser pulse has been emerging as
a potential way to generate an ultrafast spin-current burst for magnetization manipulation. However,
there is still a great challenge to all-optical control and monitor the femtosecond transient spin
current, and thus a deep insight into the mechanism is extremely essential. Here, we demonstrate
coherently nonthermal excitation of femtosecond spin-charge current conversion parallel to
the external magnetization in W/CoFeB/Pt heterostructures driven by linearly polarized femtosecond
laser pulses. Through systematically investigating the induced terahertz emission property,
we observe the terahertz emission polarity depends on both the magnetization direction and symmetry
breaking directionality, but it is insensitive to the femtosecond laser helicity and polarization.
We attribute the phenomenon that the linearly polarized femtosecond laser pulses induced terahertz
generation parallel to the magnetization to inverse spin-orbit torque titling. Our work not only
benefits for the deep understanding of spin-charge conversion and spin transportation, but also
helps to develop novel on-chip terahertz opto-spintronic devices.
