Charge carrier scattering is critical to the electrical properties of two-dimensional materials
such as graphene, transition metal dichalcogenide monolayers, black phosphorene, and tellurene.
Beyond pristine two-dimensional materials, further tailored properties can be achieved by nanoporous
patterns such as nano- or atomic-scale pores (antidots) across the material. As one example, structure-dependent
electrical/optical properties for graphene antidot lattices (GALs) have been studied in recent
years. However, detailed charge carrier scattering mechanism is still not fully understood, which
hinders the future improvement and potential applications of such metamaterials. In this paper,
the energy sensitivity of charge-carrier scattering and thus the dominant scattering mechanisms
are revealed for GALs by analyzing the maximum Seebeck coefficient with a tuned gate voltage and
thus shifted Fermi levels. It shows that the scattering from pore-edge-trapped charges is dominant,
especially at elevated temperatures. For thermoelectric interests, the gate-voltage-dependent
power factor of different GAL samples are measured as high as 509 at 400 K for a GAL with the square pattern.
Such a high power factor is improved by more than one order of magnitude from the values for the state-of-the-art
bulk thermoelectric materials. With their high thermal conductivities and power factors, these
GALs can be well suitable for "active coolers" within electronic devices, where heat generated
at the hot spot can be removed with both passive heat conduction and active Peltier cooling.
