An anyon exclusion statistics, which generalizes the Bose-Einstein and Fermi-Dirac statistics
of bosons and fermions, was proposed by Haldane[1]. The relevant past studies had considered only
anyon systems without any physical boundary but boundaries often appear in real-life materials.
When fusion of anyons is involved, certain `pseudo-species' anyons appear in the exotic statistical
weights of non-Abelian anyon systems; however, the meaning and significance of pseudo-species
remains an open problem. In this paper, we propose an extended anyon exclusion statistics on surfaces
with gapped boundaries, introducing mutual exclusion statistics between anyons as well as the
boundary components. Motivated by Refs. [2, 3], we present a formula for the statistical weight
of many-anyon states obeying the proposed statistics. We develop a systematic basis construction
for non-Abelian anyons on any Riemann surfaces with gapped boundaries. From the basis construction,
we have a standard way to read off a canonical set of statistics parameters and hence write down the
extended statistical weight of the anyon system being studied. The basis construction reveals
the meaning of pseudo-species. A pseudo-species has different `excitation' modes, each corresponding
to an anyon species. The `excitation' modes of pseudo-species corresponds to good quantum numbers
of subsystems of a non-Abelian anyon system. This is important because often (e.g., in topological
quantum computing) we may be concerned about only the entanglement between such subsystems.
