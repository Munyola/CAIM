Bimetallic nanoparticles (often known as nanoalloys) with core-shell arrangement are of special
interest in several applications, such as in optics, catalysis, magnetism and biomedicine. Despite
wide interest in applications, the physical factors stabilizing the structures of these nanoparticles
are still unclear to a great extent, especially for what concerns the relationship between geometric
structure and chemical ordering pattern. Here global-optimization searches are performed in
order to single out the most stable chemical ordering patterns corresponding to the most important
geometric structures, for a series of weakly miscible systems, including AgCu, AgNi, AgCo and AuCo.
The calculations show that (i) the overall geometric structure of the nanoalloy and the shape and
placement of its inner core are strictly correlated; (ii) centered cores can be obtained in icosahedral
nanoparticles but not in crystalline or decahedral ones, in which asym- metric quasi-Janus morphologies
form; (iii) in icosahedral nanoparticles, when the core exceeds a critical size, a new type of morphological
instability develops, making the core asymmetric and extending it to- wards the nanoparticle surface;
(iv) multi-center patterns can be obtained in polyicosahedral nanoalloys. Analogies and differences
between the instability of the core in icosahedral nanoalloys and the Stranski- Krastanov instability
occurring in thin-film growth are discussed. All these issues are crucial for designing strategies
to achieve effective coatings of the cores.
