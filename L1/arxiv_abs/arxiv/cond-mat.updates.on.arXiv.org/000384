Individual electrons in graphene behave as massless quasiparticles. In surprising twist, it is
inferred from plasmonic investigations that collectively excited graphene electrons must exhibit
non-zero mass and its inertial acceleration is essential for graphene plasmonics. Despite such
importance, this collective mass has defied direct unequivocal measurement. It may be directly
measured by accelerating it with a time-varying voltage and quantifying the phase delay of the resulting
current; this voltage-current phase relation would manifest as kinetic inductance, representing
the collective inertia's reluctance to accelerate. However, at optical (infrared) frequencies
phase measurement of current is generally difficult and at microwave frequencies the inertial
phase delay has been buried under electron scattering. Here we directly, precisely measure the
kinetic inductance, thus, collective mass, by combining innovative device engineering that reduces
electron scattering and delicate microwave phase measurements. Particularly, encapsulation
of graphene between hexagonal-boron-nitride layers, one-dimensional edge contacts, and a proximate
top gate configured as microwave ground together enable resolving the inertial phase delay from
the electron scattering. Beside the fundamental importance, the kinetic inductance demonstrated
here to be orders-of-magnitude larger than magnetic inductance can dramatically miniaturize
radio-frequency integrated circuits. Moreover, its bias-dependency heralds a solid-state voltage-controlled
inductor to complement the prevalent voltage-controlled capacitor.
