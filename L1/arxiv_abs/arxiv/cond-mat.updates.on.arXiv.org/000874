We demonstrate a new method to detect ferroelectric domains in inside and surface regions of organic
ferroelectrics by mapping out two orthogonally polarized terahertz waves radiated from the crystal
upon the irradiation of near-infrared femtosecond laser pulses. We used polarization dependence
of the effective depths radiating the terahertz waves, which originate from the optical anisotropy
in the terahertz frequency region. This allows us to distinguish ferroelectric domains in the inside
and surface regions of the crystals. We applied this method to a room-temperature organic supramolecular
ferroelectric crystal, 1:1 salt of 5,5'-dimethyl-2,2'-bipyridine and deuterated iodanilic
acid. A single domain covering almost all the area of an as-grown crystal ($\sim$600 $\mu$m $\times$
800 $\mu$m) is discerned in the inside region, while complicated multi-domain in size of $\sim$
200 $\mu$m is observed in the surface region. By applying external electric field along the 2c-b
axis (ferroelectric polarization direction), the polarization switching proceeds with successive
propagations of uncharged (neutral) and quasi-one-dimensional 180$^\circ$ domain walls (DWs)
along the b-axis ($\perp$ 2c-b axis). This results in the formation of another uncharged and two-dimensional
180$\circ$ DW parallel to the (100) plane, which covers all the area of the crystal. We discuss the
usefulness of the present terahertz radiation imaging technique and ferroelectric DW dynamics
in terms of anisotropic stacking of hydrogen-bonded chains.
