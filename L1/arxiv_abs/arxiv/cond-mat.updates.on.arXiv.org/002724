Cerium, in which the 4$f$ valence electrons live at the brink between localized and itinerant characters,
exhibits varying crystal structures and therefore anomalous physical properties with respect
to temperature and pressure. Understanding its electronic structure and related lattice properties
is one of the central topics in condensed matter theory. In the present work, we employed the state-of-the-art
first-principles many-body approach (i.e., the density functional theory in combination with
the single-site dynamical mean-field theory) to study its electronic structure thoroughly. The
momentum-resolved spectral functions, total and $4f$ partial density of states, optical conductivities,
self-energy functions, and atomic eigenstate histograms for cerium's four allotropes under ambient
pressure were calculated and analyzed carefully. The calculated results demonstrate that the
4$f$ electrons in the $\alpha$, $\beta$, $\gamma$, and $\delta$ phases are all correlated with
heavily remormalized electron masses. In the $\alpha$ phase, the 4$f$ electrons tend to be itinerant,
which cause strong hybridization between the 4$f$ and $spd$ bands and remarkable 4$f$ valence state
fluctuation. While for the other phases, the 4$f$ electrons are close to be localized. Our calculated
results support the Kondo volume collapse scenario for the cerium $\alpha-\gamma$ transition.
Finally, we examined the site dependence of $4f$ electronic structure in the $\beta$ phase. The
calculated results suggest that it doesn't exhibit a site selective 4$f$ localized state, contrary
to previous prediction.
