The transport properties of a conduction junction model characterized by two mutually coupled
channels that strongly differ in their couplings to the leads are investigated. Models of this type
describe molecular redox junctions (where a level that is weakly coupled to the leads controls the
molecular charge, while a strongly coupled one dominates the molecular conduction), and electron
counting devices in which the current in a point contact is sensitive to the charging state of a nearby
quantum dot. Here we consider the case where transport in the strongly coupled channel has to be described
quantum mechanically (covering the full range between sequential tunneling and co-tunneling),
while conduction through the weakly coupled channel is a sequential process that could by itself
be described by a simple master equation. We compare the result of a full quantum calculation based
on the pseudoparticle non-equilibrium Green function method to that obtained from an approximate
mixed quantum-classical calculation, where correlations between the channels are taken into
account through either the averaged rates or the averaged energy. We find, for the steady state current,
that the approximation based on the averaged rates works well in most of the voltage regime, with
marked deviations from the full quantum results only at the threshold for charging the weekly coupled
level. These deviations are important for accurate description of the negative differential conduction
behavior that often characterizes redox molecular junctions in the neighborhood of this threshold.
