The Stokes-Einstein relation for the self-diffusion coefficient of a spherical particle suspended
in an incompressible fluid is an asymptotic result in the limit of large Schmidt number, that is,
when momentum diffuses much faster than the particle. When the Schmidt number is moderate, which
happens in most particle methods for hydrodynamics, deviations from the Stokes-Einstein prediction
are expected. We study these corrections computationally using a recently-developed minimally-resolved
method for coupling particles to an incompressible fluctuating fluid in both two and three dimensions.
We find that for moderate Schmidt numbers the diffusion coefficient is reduced relative to the Stokes-Einstein
prediction by an amount inversely proportional to the Schmidt number in both two and three dimensions.
We find, however, that the Einstein formula is obeyed at all Schmidt numbers, consistent with linear
response theory. The numerical data is in good agreement with an approximate self-consistent theory,
which can be used to estimate finite-Schmidt number corrections in a variety of methods. Our results
indicate that the corrections to the Stokes-Einstein formula come primarily from the fact that
the particle itself diffuses together with the momentum. Our study separates effects coming from
corrections to no-slip hydrodynamics from those of finite separation of time scales, allowing
for a better understanding of widely observed deviations from the Stokes-Einstein prediction
in particle methods such as molecular dynamics.
