The Dicke model describes the coherent interaction of a laser-driven ensemble of two level atoms
with a quantized light field. It is realized within cavity QED experiments, which in addition to
the coherent Dicke dynamics feature dissipation due to e.g. atomic spontaneous emission and cavity
photon loss. Spontaneous emission supports the uncorrelated decay of individual atomic excitations
as well as the enhanced, collective decay of an excitation that is shared by $N$ atoms and whose strength
is determined by the cavity geometry. We derive a many-body master equation for the dissipative
Dicke model including both spontaneous emission channels and analyze its dynamics on the basis
of Heisenberg-Langevin and stochastic Bloch equations. We find that the collective loss channel
leads to a region of bistability between the empty and the superradiant state. Transitions between
these states are driven by non-thermal, markovian noise. The interplay between dissipative and
coherent elements leads to a genuine non-equilibrium dynamics in the bistable regime, which is
expressed via a non-conservative force and a multiplicative noise kernel appearing in the stochastic
Bloch equations. We present a semiclassical approach, based on stochastic nonlinear optical Bloch
equations, which for the infinite-range Dicke Model become exact in the large-$N$-limit. The absence
of an effective free energy functional, however, necessitates to include fluctuation corrections
with $\mathcal{O}(1/N)$ for finite $N<\infty$ to locate the non-thermal first-order phase transition
between the superradiant and the empty cavity.
