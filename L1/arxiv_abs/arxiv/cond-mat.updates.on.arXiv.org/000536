In this paper we propose a novel theoretical framework for interpreting long-range dynamical correlations
unveiled in proteins through NMR measurements. The theoretical rationale relies on the hypothesis
that correlated motions in proteins may be reconstructed as large-scale, collective modes sustained
by long-lived nonlinear vibrations known as discrete breathers (DB) localized at key, hot-spot
sites. DBs are spatially localized modes, whose nonlinear nature hinders resonant coupling with
the normal modes, thus conferring them long lifetimes as compared to normal modes. DBs have been
predicted to exist in proteins, localized at few $hotspot$ residues typically within the stiffest
portions of the structure. We compute DB modes analytically in the framework of the nonlinear network
model, showing that the displacement patterns of many DBs localized at key sites match to a remarkable
extent the experimentally uncovered correlation blueprint. The computed dispersion relations
prove that it is physically possible for some of these DBs to be excited out of thermal fluctuations
at room temperature. Based on our calculations, we speculate that transient energy redistribution
among the vibrational modes in a protein might favor the emergence of DB-like bursts of long-lived
energy at hot-spot sites with lifetimes in the ns range, able to sustain critical, function-encoding
correlated motions. More generally, our calculations provide a novel quantitative tool to predict
fold-spanning dynamical pathways of correlated residues that may be central to allosteric cross-talk
in proteins.
