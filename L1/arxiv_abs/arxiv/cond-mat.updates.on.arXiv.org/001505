In the field of rehabilitation and neuroscience shape memory alloys play a crucial role as lightweight
actuators. Devices are exploiting the shape memory effect by transforming heat into mechanical
work. In rehabilitation applications, dynamic loading of the respective device occurs, which
in turn influences the mechanical consequences of the phase transforming alloy. Hence in this work,
dynamic thermomechanical material behavior of temperature triggered phase transforming NiTi
shape memory alloy wires with different chemical compositions and geometries is experimentally
investigated. Storage modulus and mechanical loss factor of NiTi alloys at different temperatures
and loading frequencies are analyzed under force controlled conditions. Counterintuitive storage
modulus and loss factor dependent trends regarding the loading frequency dependency of the mechanical
properties on the materials composition and geometry are hence obtained. It could be revealed that
loss factors show a pronounced loading frequency dependency, whereas the storage modulus was not
affected. It is shown that force controlled conditions lead to a lower storage modulus than expected.
Further it turned out that a simple empirical relation can capture the characteristic temperature
dependency of the storage modulus, which is an important input relation for modeling the rehabilitation
device behavior under different dynamic and temperature loading conditions, taking directly
into account the material behavior of the shape memory alloy.
