We study the phase diagram of an elastic interaction model for spin crossover (SC) materials with
antiferromagnetic-like short-range interactions. In this model, the interplay between the short-range
interaction and the long-range interaction of elastic origin causes complex phase transitions.
For relatively weak elastic interactions, the phase diagram is characterized by tricritical points,
at which antiferromagnetic (AF) -like and ferromagnetic (F) -like spinodal lines and a critical
line merge. On the other hand, for relatively strong elastic interactions, unusual "horn structures,"
which are surrounded by the F-like spinodal lines, disorder (D) spinodal lines, and the critical
line, are realized at higher temperatures. These structures are similar to those obtained in our
previous study [Phys. Rev. B {\bf 93}, 064109 (2016)] of an Ising antiferromagnet with infinite-range
ferromagnetic interactions, and we find universal features caused by the interplay between the
competing short-range and long-range interactions. The long-range interaction of elastic origin
is irrelevant (inessential) for the critical line. In contrast, the AF-like, F-like, and D spinodal
lines result from the long-range interaction of elastic origin. This difference causes qualitatively
different features of domain formation or nucleation of the new phase: clustering occurs in the
former case, while clustering is absent in the latter. Based on the phase diagrams, we discuss the
patterns and clustering features of two-step SC transitions, in which the AF-like phase is realized
in the intermediate temperature region.
