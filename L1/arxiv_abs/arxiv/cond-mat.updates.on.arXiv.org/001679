The symmetry of a material's crystal structure has a significant effect on the energy states of its
electrons. Inversion symmetry, for example, results in energetically degenerate electron energy
bands for electrons with wave vectors $\textit{k}$ and -$\textit{k}$, but, when spatial inversion
symmetry is absent, this equivalence is no longer possible. In a non-centrosymmetric superconductor,
such inequivalence has an important effect: the standard superconducting state, where electrons
with opposite momenta form pairs on the Fermi surface, is not possible. A handful of such materials
is known; they display different degrees of influence of this lack of inversion symmetry on their
superconducting properties. The effect of crystal structure chirality on the properties and applications
of superconductors, on the other hand, is little discussed. Here we report the new isostructural
non-centrosymmetric superconductors TaRh$_2$B$_2$ and NbRh$_2$B$_2$, which have a previously
unreported crystal structure type. Not only do these materials lack inversion symmetry, but their
crystal structure is also chiral; in other words, they can exist in right-handed or left-handed
forms. Unlike most superconductors, their upper critical magnetic fields extrapolated to 0 K exceed
the Pauli limit, which is often taken as the first indication that a superconducting material is
anomalous. We propose that these materials represent a new kind of platform on which the effects
of handedness on superconductors and their devices can be tested.
