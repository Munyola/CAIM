The Bose glass (BG) phase is the Griffiths region of the disordered Bose Hubbard model (BHM), characterized
by finite, quasi-superfluid clusters within a Mott insulating background. We propose to utilize
this characterization to identify the complete zero-temperature phase diagram of the disordered
BHM in $d\ge2$ dimensions by analyzing the geometric properties of what we call superfluid (SF)
clusters, which are defined to be clusters of sites with non-integer expectation values for the
local boson occupation number. The Mott insulator (MI) phase then is the region in the phase diagram
where no SF clusters exist, and the SF phase the region, where SF clusters percolate - the BG phase
is in between: SF clusters exist, but do not percolate. This definition is particularly useful in
the context of local mean field (LMF, or Gutzwiller-Ansatz) calculations, where we show that an
identification of the phases on the basis of global quantities like the averaged SF order parameter
and the compressibility are misleading. We apply the SF cluster analysis to the LMF ground states
of the two dimensional disordered BHM to produce its phase diagram and find a) an excellent agreement
with the phase diagram predicted on the basis of quantum Monte Carlo simulations for the commensurate
density $n=1$, and b) large differences to stochastic mean field and other mean field predictions
for fixed disorder strength. The relation of the percolation transition of the SF clusters with
the onset of non-vanishing SF stiffness indicating the BG to SF transition is discussed.
