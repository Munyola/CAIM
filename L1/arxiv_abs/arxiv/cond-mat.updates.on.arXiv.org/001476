Motivated by the close analogy with the fractional quantum Hall states (FQHSs), fractional Chern
insulators (FCIs) are envisioned as strongly correlated, incompressible states emerging in a
fractionally filled, (nearly) flat band with non-trivial Chern number. Built upon this vision,
fractional topological insulators (FTIs) have been proposed as being composed of two independent
copies of the FCI with opposite Chern numbers for different spins, preserving the time-reversal
symmetry as a whole. An important question is if the correlation between electrons with different
spins can be really ignored. To address this question, we investigate the effects of correlation
in the presence of spin-dependent holomorphicity, i.e., electrons of one spin species reside in
the holomorphic lowest Landau level, while those of the other in the antiholomorphic counterpart.
By constructing and performing exact diagonalization of an appropriate model Hamiltonian, here,
we show that generic, strongly correlated, fractionally filled states with spin-dependent holomorphicity
cannot be described as two independent copies of the FQHS, suggesting that FTIs in the lattice cannot
be described as those of the FCI either. Fractionally filled states in this system are generally
compressible except at half filling, where an insulating state called the half-filled spin-holomorphic
FTI occurs. It is predicted that the half-filled spin-holomorphic FTI is susceptible to an inherent
spontaneous symmetry breaking, leading to the spatial separation of spins.
