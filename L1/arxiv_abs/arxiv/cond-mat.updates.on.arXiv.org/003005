Grusdt et al. [New J. Phys. 19, 103035 (2017)] recently made a renormalization group study of a one-dimensional
Bose polaron in cold atoms. Their study went beyond the usual Frohlich description, which includes
only single-phonon processes, by including two-phonon processes in which two phonons are simultaneously
absorbed or emitted during impurity scattering [Shchadilova et al. Phys. Rev. Lett. 117, 113002
(2016)]. We study this same beyond-Frohlich model, but in the static impurity limit where the ground
state is described by a multimode squeezed state instead of the multimode coherent state in the static
Frohlich model. We solve the system exactly by applying the generalized Bogoliubov transformation,
an approach that can be straightforwardly adapted to higher dimensions. Using our exact solution,
we obtain a polaron energy free of infrared divergences and construct analytically the polaron
phase diagram. We find that the repulsive polaron is stable on the positive side of the impurity-boson
interaction but is always thermodynamically unstable on the negative side of the impurity-boson
interaction, featuring a bound state, whose binding energy we obtain analytically. We find that
the attractive polaron is always dynamically unstable, featuring a pair of imaginary energies
which we obtain analytically. We expect the multimode squeezed state to help with studies that go
not only beyond the Frohlich paradigm but also beyond Bogoliubov theory, just as the multimode coherent
state has helped with the study of Frohlich polarons.
