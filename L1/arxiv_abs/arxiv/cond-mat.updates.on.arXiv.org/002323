The t-J model is a paradigmatic model for the study of strongly correlated electron systems. In particular,
it has been argued that it is an appropriate model to describe the cuprate high-Tc superconductors.
It turns out that a comprehensive understanding of the gamut of physics encoded by the t-J model is
still an open problem. In recent years some remarkable experiments on the cuprates, for example,
discovery of nodeless superconductivity in underdoped samples (PNAS 109, 18332 (2012)), discovery
of s-wave like gap in the pseudogap phase (Phys. Rev. Lett. 111, 107001 (2013)), and observation
of polar Kerr effect (PKE) (Phys. Rev. Lett. 112, 047003 (2014)), have thrown up new challenges for
this model. Here, we present results demonstrating that, within the slave-particle formulation
of the t-J model, the d-wave superconductor is unstable at low doping to its own anti-symmetric phase
mode fluctuations when the effect of fluctuations is treated self-consistently. We then show that
this instability gives way to a time reversal symmetry broken d + is-SC in the underdoped region which
has superfluid stiffness consistent with Uemura relation, even with a large pair amplitude. We
show that our results are consistent with existing experiments on cuprates and suggest that Josephson
(SQUID interferometry) experiments can clearly distinguish the d+is-SC from a host of other possibilities
alluded to be contributing to the physics of underdoped cuprates. We also comment on other theoretical
studies vis-a-vis ours.
