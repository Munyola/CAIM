A feed-forward loop (FFL) is a common gene-regulatory motif in which usually the upstream regulator
is a protein, a transcription factor, that regulates the expression of the target protein in two
parallel pathways. Here, we study a distinct sRNA-driven FFL (sFFL) discovered recently in Salmonella
enterica. Unlike previously studied transcriptional FFLs (tFFL) and sRNA-mediated FFLs (smFFL),
here the upstream regulator is an sRNA that activates the target protein and its transcriptional
activator. Such sFFL has not been subjected to rigorous analysis. We, therefore, set out to understand
two aspects. First is a quantitative comparison of the regulatory response of sFFL with tFFL and
smFFL using a differential equation framework. Since the process of gene expression is inherently
stochastic, the second objective is to find how the noise affects the functionality of sFFL. We find
the response of sFFLto be stronger, faster, and more sensitive to the initial concentration of the
upstream regulator than tFFL and smFFL. Further, a generating function based analysis and stochastic
simulations lead to a non-trivial prediction that an optimal noise filtration can be attained depending
on the synthesis rate of the sRNA and the degradation rate of the transcriptional activator. We conclude
that in sFFL, sRNA plays a critical role not only in driving a rapid and strong response, but also a
reliable response that depends critically on its concentration. Given the advantages of sFFL brought
out in this work, it should not be surprising if future work reveals their employment in different
biological contexts.
