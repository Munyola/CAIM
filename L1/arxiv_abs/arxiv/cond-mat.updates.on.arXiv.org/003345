Reports published in the last 25 years on the synthesis of carbon-based materials significantly
superior to diamond in hardness and elastic properties have been critically examined, and three
groups of recently appearing myths have been analyzed. The first group concerns the possibility
of producing materials with bulk moduli much higher than that of diamond. The second group regards
to "experimentally measured" hardness significantly higher than that of diamond. Myths of the
third group state that quantum confinement effects supposedly provide "theoretical" foundations
for a several-fold (!) increase in the hardness of covalent materials. The fundamental impossibility
of synthesizing materials with elastic moduli noticeably exceeding the diamond value under normal
conditions has been demonstrated. The problems of hardness measuring have been discussed; it was
shown that the formation of obstacles for motion of dislocations can allow increasing the measured
hardness of superhard materials by 20-40%. It was demonstrated that other hypothetical ways for
hardness increase, e.g. owing to quantum confinement have no any real physical grounds. The superior
mechanical properties of diamond are due to reliably established physical laws. Accordingly,
any statements on the possibility of obtaining materials with elastic characteristics and/or
hardness several times higher than the corresponding values for diamond cannot be considered as
scientifically reliable. "Pseudoscientific" reasons for publications of unreliable sensational
statements have been discussed.
