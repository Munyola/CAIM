Fermionization is what happens to the state of strongly interacting repulsive bosons interacting
with contact interactions in one spatial dimension. Crystallization is what happens for strongly
interacting repulsive bosons with dipolar interactions in one spatial dimension. Crystallization
and fermionization resemble each other: in both cases -- due to their strong repulsion -- the bosons
try to minimize their spatial overlap. We trace these two hallmark phases of strongly correlated
one-dimensional bosonic systems by exploring their ground state properties using the one- and
two-body density matrix. We solve the $N$-body Schr\"odinger equation accurately and from first
principles using the multiconfigurational time-dependent Hartree for bosons (MCTDHB) method.
Using the one- and two-body density, fermionization can be distinguished from crystallization
in position space. For $N$ interacting bosons, a splitting into an $N$-fold pattern in the one-body
and two-body density is a unique feature of both, fermionization and crystallization. We demonstrate
that the splitting is incomplete for fermionized bosons and restricted by the confinement potential.
This incomplete splitting is a consequence of the convergence of the energy in the limit of infinite
repulsion. For crystalline bosons, in contrast, the splitting is complete: the interaction energy
is capable of overcoming the confinement potential. We describe how to distinguish fermionization
from crystallization experimentally from measurements of the one- and two-body density.
