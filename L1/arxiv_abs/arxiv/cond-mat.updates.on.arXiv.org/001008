Understanding the origin of unintentional doping in Ga2O3 is key to increasing breakdown voltages
of Ga2O3 based power devices. Therefore, transport and capacitance spectroscopy studies have
been performed to better understand the origin of unintentional doping in Ga2O3. Previously unobserved
unintentional donors in commercially available (-201) Ga2O3 substrates have been electrically
characterized via temperature dependent Hall effect measurements up to 1000 K and found to have
a donor energy of 110 meV. The existence of the unintentional donor is confirmed by temperature dependent
admittance spectroscopy, with an activation energy of 131 meV determined via that technique, in
agreement with Hall effect measurements. With the concentration of this donor determined to be
in the mid to high 10^16 cm^-3 range, elimination of this donor from the drift layer of Ga2O3 power
electronics devices will be key to pushing the limits of device performance. Indeed, analytical
assessment of the specific on-resistance (Ronsp) and breakdown voltage of Schottky diodes containing
the 110 meV donor indicates that incomplete ionization increases Ronsp and decreases breakdown
voltage as compared to Ga2O3 Schottky diodes containing only the shallow donor. The reduced performance
due to incomplete ionization occurs in addition to the usual tradeoff between Ronsp and breakdown
voltage. To achieve 10 kV operation in Ga2O3 Schottky diode devices, analysis indicates that the
concentration of 110 meV donors must be reduced below 5x10^14 cm^-3 to limit the increase in Ronsp
to one percent.
