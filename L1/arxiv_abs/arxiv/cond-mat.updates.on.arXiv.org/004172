We study the liquid-gas phase separation observed in a system of repulsive particles dressed with
ferromagnetically aligning spins, a so-called `spin fluid'. Microcanonical ensemble numerical
simulations of finite-size systems reveal that magnetization sets in and induces a liquid-gas
phase separation between a disordered gas and a ferromagnetic dense phase at low enough energies
and large enough densities. The dynamics after a quench into the coexistence region show that the
order parameter associated to the liquid-vapour phase separation follows an algebraic law with
an unusual exponent, as it is forced to synchronize with the growth of the magnetization: this suggests
that for finite size systems the magnetization sets in along a Curie line, which is also the gas-side
spinodal line, and that the coexistence region ends at a tricritical point. This picture is confirmed
at the mean-field level with different approximation schemes, namely a Bethe lattice resolution
and a virial expansion complemented by the introduction of a self-consistent Weiss-like molecular
field. However, a detailed finite-size scaling analysis shows that in two dimensions the ferromagnetic
phase escapes the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless scenario, and that the long-range order is
not destroyed by the unbinding of topological defects. The Curie line becomes thus a magnetic crossover
in the thermodynamic limit. Finally, the effects of the magnetic interaction range and those of
the interaction softness are characterized within a mean-field semi-analytic low-density approach.
