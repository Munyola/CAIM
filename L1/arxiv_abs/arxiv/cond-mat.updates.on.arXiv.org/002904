Skyrmions, topologically-protected, nano-scale objects that exist in a variety of chiral magnets
[1-11], have seen a surge of research interest due to their prospective applications in future data-processing
architectures. The skyrmion lattice (SkL) is typically only at thermodynamic equilibrium in a
limited range of applied magnetic field, just below the Curie Temperature, $\mathbf{\it{T}}_{\rm{c}}$.
Recently, metastable skyrmions have been identified with a greatly expanded range of existence
[12-21], achieved by field-cooling through the equilibrium SkL phase. However, close to $\bf{\it{T}}_{\rm{c}}$
the metastable SkL state has a short lifetime, and therefore a rapid cooling rate is required to ensure
the survival of a significant skyrmion population. Here, we report that the lifetime of metastable
skyrmions in Cu$_2$OSeO$_3$ is extended by a factor of 50 with only 2.5% zinc doping, up to 300 days
at 10 K below $\bf{\it{T}}_{\rm{c}}$. We demonstrate that this enhanced lifetime allows over 50%
of the population to survive when field-cooling at a rate of just 1 K/min. Our systematic study reveals
that the lifetime enhancement primarily originates from a slowing down of the phase transition
kinetics due to pinning sites introduced by the non-magnetic dopant, and not from changes to the
nucleation energy barrier. The results indicate that doping can be exploited to control the lifetime
of the metastable SkL state in all chiral systems, offering a method of engineering skyrmion materials
towards application in future memory devices.
