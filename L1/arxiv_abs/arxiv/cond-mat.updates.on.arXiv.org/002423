Certain two-dimensional (2D) materials exhibit intriguing properties such as valley polarization,
ferroelectricity, superconductivity and charge-density waves. Many of these materials can be
manually assembled into atomic-scale multilayer devices under ambient conditions, owing to their
exceptional chemical stability. Efforts have been made to add a magnetic degree of freedom to these
2D materials via defects, but only local magnetism has been achieved. Only with the recent discoveries
of 2D materials supporting intrinsic ferromagnetism have stacked spintronic devices become realistic.
Assembling 2D multilayer devices with these ferromagnets under ambient conditions remains challenging
due to their sensitivity to environmental degradation, and magnetic order at room temperature
is rare in van der Waals materials. Here, we report the growth of air-stable ultra-thin epsilon-phase
iron oxide crystals that exhibit magnetic order at room temperature. These crystals require no
passivation and can be prepared in large quantity by cost-effective chemical vapor deposition
(CVD). We find that the epsilon phase, which is energetically unfavorable and does not form in bulk,
can be easily made in 2D down to a seven unit-cell thickness. Magneto-optical Kerr effect (MOKE)
magnetometry of individual crystals shows that even at this ultrathin limit the epsilon phase exhibits
robust magnetism with coercive fields of hundreds of mT. These measurements highlight the advantages
of ultrathin iron oxide as a promising candidate towards air-stable 2D magnetism and integration
into 2D spintronic devices.
