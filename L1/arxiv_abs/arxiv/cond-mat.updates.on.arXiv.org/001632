Despite the fact that 1111-type iron arsenides hold the record transition temperature of iron-based
superconductors, their electronic structures have not been studied much because of the lack of
high-quality single crystals. In this study, we completely determine the Fermi surface in the antiferromagnetic
state of CaFeAsF, a 1111 iron-arsenide parent compound, by performing quantum oscillation measurements
and band-structure calculations. The determined Fermi surface consists of a symmetry-related
pair of Dirac electron cylinders and a normal hole cylinder. From analyses of quantum-oscillation
phases, we demonstrate that the electron cylinders carry a nontrivial Berry phase $\pi$. The carrier
density is of the order of 10$^{-3}$ per Fe. This unusual metallic state with the extremely small
carrier density is a consequence of the previously discussed topological feature of the band structure
which prevents the antiferromagnetic gap from being a full gap. We also report a nearly linear-in-$B$
magnetoresistance and an anomalous resistivity increase above about 30 T for $B \parallel c$, the
latter of which is likely related to the quantum limit of the electron orbit. Intriguingly, the electrical
resistivity exhibits a nonmetallic temperature dependence in the paramagnetic tetragonal phase
($T >$ 118 K), which may suggest an incoherent state. Our study provides a detailed knowledge of the
Fermi surface in the antiferromagnetic state of 1111 parent compounds and moreover opens up a new
possibility to explore Dirac-fermion physics in those compounds.
