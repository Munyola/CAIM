Recent theoretical and experimental progress on studying one-dimensional systems of bosonic,
fermionic, and bose-fermi mixtures of a few ultracold atoms confined in traps is reviewed in the
broad context of mesoscopic quantum physics. We pay special attention to limiting cases of very
strong or very weak interactions and transitions between them. For bosonic mixtures, we describe
the developments in systems of three and four atoms as well as different extensions to larger numbers
of particles. We also briefly review progress in the case of spinor Bose gases of a few atoms. For fermionic
mixtures, we discuss a special role of spin and present a detailed discussion of the two- and three-atom
cases. We discuss the advantages and disadvantages of different computation methods applied to
systems with intermediate interactions. In the case of very strong repulsion, close to the infinite
limit, we discuss approaches based on effective spin chain descriptions. We also report on recent
studies on higher-spin mixtures and inter-component attractive forces. For both statistics,
we pay particular attention to impurity problems and mass imbalance cases. Finally, we describe
the recent advances on trapped Bose-Fermi mixtures, which allow for a theoretical combination
of previous concepts, well illustrating the importance of quantum statistics and inter-particle
interactions. Lastly, we report on fundamental questions related to the subject which we believe
will inspire further theoretical developments and experimental verification.
