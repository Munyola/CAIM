There are two modes by which clusters of aggregating particles can coalesce: The clusters can merge
either (i) by the Ostwald ripening process in which particles diffuse from one cluster to the other
whilst the cluster centres remain stationary, or (ii) by means of a cluster translation mode, in
which the clusters move towards each other and join. To understand in detail the interplay between
these different modes, we study a model system of hard particles with an additional attraction between
them. The particles diffuse along narrow channels with smooth or periodically corrugated walls,
so that the system may be treated as one-dimensional. When the attraction between the particles
is strong enough, they aggregate to form clusters. The channel potential influences whether clusters
can move easily or not through the system and can prevent cluster motion. We use Dynamical Density
Functional theory to study the dynamics of the aggregation process, focusing in particular on the
coalescence of two equal size clusters. As long as the particle hard-core diameter is non-zero,
we find that the coalescence process can be halted by a sufficiently strong corrugation potential.
The period of the potential determines the size of the final stable clusters. For the case of smooth
channel walls, we demonstrate that there is a cross-over in the dominance of the two different coarsening
modes, that depends on the strength of the attraction between particles, the cluster sizes and the
separation distance between clusters.
