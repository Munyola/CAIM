We explore the influence of a circularly polarized cavity photon field on the transport properties
of a finite-width ring, in which the electrons are subject to spin-orbit and Coulomb interaction.
The quantum ring is embedded in an electromagnetic cavity with a linearly or circularly polarized
photon field and described by ''exact'' numerical diagonalization. The quantum device is moreover
coupled to external, electrically biased leads. The time propagation in the transient regime is
described by a non-Markovian generalized master equation. We find that the spin polarization and
spin photocurrents of the quantum ring are largest for circularly polarized photon field and destructive
Aharonov-Casher (AC) phase interference. The charge current suppression dip due to the destructive
AC phase becomes threefold under the circularly polarized photon field as the interaction of the
electrons' angular momentum and spin angular momentum of light causes many-body level splitting
leading to three many-body level crossing locations instead of one. The circular charge current
inside the ring, which is induced by the circularly polarized photon field, is found to be suppressed
in a much wider range around the destructive AC phase than the lead-device-lead charge current.
The charge current can be directed through one of the two ring arms with the help of the circularly
polarized photon field, but is superimposed by vortices of smaller scale. Unlike the charge photocurrent,
the flow direction of the spin photocurrent is found to be independent of the handedness of the circularly
polarized photon field.
