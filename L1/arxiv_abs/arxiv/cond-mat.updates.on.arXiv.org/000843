A predicting model for soft Dielectric Elastomer Generators (DEGs) must consider a realistic model
of the electromechanical behaviour of the elastomer filling, the variable capacitor and of the
electrical circuit connecting all elements of the device. In this paper such an objective is achieved
by proposing a complete framework for reliable simulations of soft energy harvesters. In particular,
a simple electrical circuit is realised by connecting the capacitor, stretched periodically by
a source of mechanical work, in parallel with a battery through a diode and with an electrical load
consuming the energy produced. The electrical model comprises resistances simulating the effect
of the electrodes and of the conductivity current invariably present through the dielectric film.
As these devices undergo a high number of electro-mechanical loading cycles at large deformation,
the time-dependent response of the material must be taken into account as it strongly affects the
generator outcome. To this end, the viscoelastic behaviour of the polymer and the possible change
of permittivity with strains are analysed carefully by means of a proposed coupled electro-viscoelastic
constitutive model, calibrated on experimental data available in the literature for an incompressible
polyacrilate elastomer (3M VHB4910). Numerical results showing the importance of time-dependent
behaviour on the evaluation of performance of DEGs for different loading conditions, namely equi-biaxial
and uniaxial, are reported in the final section.
