This chapter provides a pedagogical introduction and overview of spatial and temporal correlation
and fluctuation effects resulting from the fundamentally stochastic kinetics underlying chemical
reactions and the dynamics of populations or epidemics. After reviewing the assumptions and mean-field
type approximations involved in the construction of chemical rate equations for uniform reactant
densities, we first discuss spatial clustering in birth-death systems, where non-linearities
are introduced through either density-limiting pair reactions, or equivalently via local imposition
of finite carrying capacities. The competition of offspring production, death, and non-linear
inhibition induces a population extinction threshold, which represents a non-equilibrium phase
transition that separates active from absorbing states. This continuous transition is characterized
by the universal scaling exponents of critical directed percolation clusters. Next we focus on
the emergence of depletion zones in single-species annihilation processes and spatial population
segregation with the associated reaction fronts in two-species pair annihilation. These strong
(anti-)correlation effects are dynamically generated by the underlying stochastic kinetics.
Finally, we address noise-induced and fluctuation-stabilized spatio-temporal patterns in basic
predator-prey systems, exemplified by spreading activity fronts in the two-species Lotka-Volterra
model as well as spiral structures in the May-Leonard variant of cyclically competing three-species
systems akin to rock-paper-scissors games.
