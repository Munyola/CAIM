The current understanding of high-Tc superconductivity in cuprates assumes a crucial role of strong
electron correlations. There is a popular view that a single-band $t-t'$ Hubbard model is the minimal
model to catch the main relevant physics but even this oversimplified model is too complicated to
be treated accurately and convincingly. It has been thoroughly studied numerically, and a number
of valuable results have been obtained. On the other hand, a considerable success in phenomenological
description of high-Tc superconductors has been achieved within the paradigm of Quantum Critical
Point (QCP) - a parental state of a variety of exotic phases that is characterized by dense entanglement
and absence of well-defined quasiparticles. However, the microscopic origin of the critical regime
in real materials remains an open question. Here, we suggest that emergence of the QCP is tightly
connected with entanglement in real space and identify its location on the phase diagram of the hole-doped
$t-t'$ Hubbard model. To detect the QCP we study a weighted graph of inter-site quantum mutual information
within a four-by-four plaquette that is solved by exact diagonalization. We demonstrate that certain
characteristics of such a graph, viewed as a complex network, exhibit peculiar behavior around
a point on the phase diagram corresponding to the onset of pseudogap in YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_7$. This
method allows us to overcome difficulties caused by finite size effects and to identify the transition
point even on a small lattice, where long-range asymptotics of correlation functions cannot be
accessed.
