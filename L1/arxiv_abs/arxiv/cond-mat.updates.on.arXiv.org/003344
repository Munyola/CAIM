A hallmark of wave-matter duality is the emergence of quantum-interference phenomena when an electronic
transition follows different trajectories. Such interference results in asymmetric absorption
lines such as Fano resonances, and gives rise to secondary effects like electromagnetically induced
transparency (EIT) when multiple optical transitions are pumped. Few solid-state systems show
quantum interference and EIT, with quantum-well intersubband transitions in the IR offering the
most promising avenue to date to devices exploiting optical gain without inversion. Quantum interference
is usually hampered by inhomogeneous broadening of electronic transitions, making it challenging
to achieve in solids at visible wavelengths and elevated temperatures. However, disorder effects
can be mitigated by raising the oscillator strength of atom-like electronic transitions - excitons
- which arise in monolayers of transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs). Quantum interference,
probed by second-harmonic generation (SHG), emerges in monolayer WSe2, without a cavity, splitting
the SHG spectrum. The splitting exhibits spectral anticrossing behaviour, and is related to the
number of Rabi flops the strongly driven system undergoes. The SHG power-law exponent deviates
strongly from the canonical value of 2, showing a Fano-like wavelength dependence which is retained
at room temperature. The work opens opportunities in solid-state quantum-nonlinear optics for
optical mixing, gain without inversion and quantum-information processing.
