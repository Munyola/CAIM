We study the statistical properties of stationary, isotropic and homogeneous turbulence in two-dimensional
(2D) flows, focusing on the direct cascade, that is on wave-numbers large compared to the integral
scale, where both energy and enstrophy are provided to the fluid. Our starting point is the 2D Navier-Stokes
equation in the presence of a stochastic forcing, or more precisely the associated field theory.
We unveil two extended symmetries of the Navier-Stokes action which were not identified yet, one
related to time-dependent (or time-gauged) shifts of the response fields and existing in both 2D
and 3D, and the other to time-gauged rotations and specific to 2D flows. We derive the corresponding
Ward identities, and exploit them within the non-perturbative renormalization group formalism,
and the large wave-number expansion scheme developed in [Phys. Fluids {\bf 30}, 055102 (2018)].
We consider the flow equation for a generalized $n$-point correlation function, and calculate
its leading order term in the large wave-number expansion. At this order, the resulting flow equation
can be closed exactly. We solve the fixed point equation for the 2-point function, which yields its
explicit time dependence, for both small and large time delays in the stationary turbulent state.
On the other hand, at equal times, the leading order term vanishes, so we compute the next-to-leading
order term. We find that the flow equations for simultaneous $n$-point correlation functions are
not fully constrained by the set of extended symmetries, and discuss the consequences.
