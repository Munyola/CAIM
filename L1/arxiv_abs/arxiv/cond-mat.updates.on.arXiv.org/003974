Superconductivity in the type-II Weyl semimetal candidate MoTe$_2$ has attracted much attention
due to the possible realization of topological superconductivity. Under applied pressure, the
superconducting transition temperature is significantly enhanced, while the structural transition
from the high-temperature 1$T'$ phase to the low-temperature $T_d$ phase is suppressed. Hence,
applying pressure allows us to investigate the dimensionality of superconductivity in 1$T'$-MoTe$_2$.
We have performed a detailed study of the magnetotransport properties and upper critical field
$H_{c2}$ of MoTe$_2$ under pressure. The magnetoresistance (MR) and Hall coefficient of MoTe$_2$
are found to be decreasing with increasing pressure. In addition, the Kohler's scalings for the
MR data above $\sim$11 kbar show a change of exponent whereas the data at lower pressure can be well
scaled with a single exponent. These results are suggestive of a Fermi surface reconstruction when
the structure changes from the $T_d$ to 1$T'$ phase. The $H_{c2}$-temperature phase diagram constructed
at 15 kbar, with $H\parallel ab$ and $H\perp ab$, can be satisfactorily described by the Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg
model with the Maki parameters $\alpha \sim$ 0.77 and 0.45, respectively. The relatively large
$\alpha$ may stem from a small Fermi surface and a large effective mass of semimetallic MoTe$_2$.
The angular dependence of $H_{c2}$ at 15 kbar can be well fitted by the Tinkham model, suggesting
the two-dimensional nature of superconductivity in the high-pressure 1$T'$ phase.
