Electrophoresis has been shown as a novel methodology to enhance heat conduction capabilities
of nanocolloidal dispersions. A thoroughly designed experimental system has been envisaged to
solely probe heat conduction across nanofluids by specifically eliminating the buoyancy driven
convective component. Electric field is applied across the test specimen in order to induce electrophoresis
in conjunction with the existing thermal gradient. It is observed that the electrophoretic drift
of the nanoparticles acts as an additional thermal transport drift mechanism over and above the
already existent Brownian diffusion and thermophoresis dominated thermal conduction. A scaling
analysis of the thermophoretic and electrophoretic velocities from classical Huckel-Smoluchowski
formalism is able to mathematically predict the thermal performance enhancement due to electrophoresis.
It is also inferred that the dielectric characteristics of the particle material is the major determining
component of the electrophoretic amplification of heat transfer. Influence of surfactants has
also been probed into and it is observed that enhancing the stability via surface charge modulation
can in fact enhance the electrophoretic drift, thereby enhancing heat transfer calibre. Also,
surfactants ensure colloidal stability as well as chemical gradient induced recirculation, thus
ensuring colloidal phase equilibrium and low hysteresis in spite of the directional drift in presence
of electric field forcing. The findings may have potential implications in enhanced and tunable
thermal management of micro nanoscale devices.
