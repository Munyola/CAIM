Intrinsic multiphase nature in K2-xFe4+ySe5 superconductors, the exact superconducting phase
was not yet conclusively decided thus far. To analyze the complexity phases, we investigated the
temperature evolution crystalline structural phase transition by in-situ synchrotron radiation
X-ray powder diffraction up to sintering temperature. In this study, we have observed the parent
compound K2Fe4Se5 shows a marked change in lattice constant on heating but that superconducting
K2-xFe4+ySe5 does not. Implying that superconducting K2-xFe4+ySe5 occurs no structural phase
transition undergoes from I4/m (contains two iron sites; 4d site is ideally empty and 16i site is
fully occupied) to compressed I4/mmm (only 4d site) symmetry. The superconducting K2-xFe4+ySe5
remains I4/m symmetry without superlattice of Fe vacancies when above phase transition temperature
(TS). We expected this should be true K2Fe4Se5 tetragonal I4/m symmetry disordered phase. In the
cooling process, a second phase in superconducting K2-xFe4+ySe5 arise coincides with the presence
of the iron vacancy ordered phase. Suggesting that the extra-Fe (dopants) and vacancy simultaneously
ordered in 4d-site which lead to structure presence of two phases. In conclusion, we demonstrated
the extra-Fe in 4d-site primary constructed the high temperature disordered phase. In a way, prevent
the Fe-vacancy (antiferromagnetic) long range ordered. We suggest that high temperature disorder
phase is the superconducting parent phase which hidden in the multiphase.
