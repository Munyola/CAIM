In a quantum dot hybrid superconducting junction, the behavior of the supercurrent is dominated
by Coulomb blockade physics, which determines the magnetic state of the dot. In particular, in a
single level quantum dot singly occupied, the sign of the supercurrent can be reversed, giving rise
to a pi-junction. This 0-pi transition, corresponding to a singlet-doublet transition, is then
driven by the gate voltage or by the superconducting phase in the case of strong competition between
the superconducting proximity effect and Kondo correlations. In a two-level quantum dot, such
as a clean carbon nanotube, 0-pi transitions exist as well but, because more cotunneling processes
are allowed, are not necessarily associated to a magnetic state transition of the dot. In this proceeding,
after a review of 0-pi transitions in Josephson junctions, we present measurements of current-phase
relation in a clean carbon nanotube quantum dot, in the single and two-level regimes. In the single
level regime, close to orbital degeneracy and in a regime of strong competition between local electronic
correlations and superconducting proximity effect, we find that the phase diagram of the phase-dependent
transition is a universal characteristic of a discontinuous level-crossing quantum transition
at zero temperature. In the case where the two levels are involved, the nanotube Josephson current
exhibits a continuous 0-pi transition, independent of the superconducting phase, revealing a
different physical mechanism of the transition.
