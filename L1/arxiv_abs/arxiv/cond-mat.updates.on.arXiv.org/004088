Essentials of the scientific discovery process have remained largely unchanged for centuries:
systematic human observation of natural phenomena is used to form hypotheses that, when validated
through experimentation, are generalized into established scientific theory. Today, however,
we face major challenges because automated instrumentation and large-scale data acquisition
are generating data sets of such volume and complexity as to defy human analysis. Radically different
scientific approaches are needed, with machine learning (ML) showing great promise, not least
for materials science research. Hence, given recent advances in ML analysis of synthetic data representing
electronic quantum matter (EQM), the next challenge is for ML to engage equivalently with experimental
data. For example, atomic-scale visualization of EQM yields arrays of complex electronic structure
images, that frequently elude effective analyses. Here we report development and training of an
array of artificial neural networks (ANN) designed to recognize different types of hypothesized
order hidden in EQM image-arrays. These ANNs are used to analyze an experimentally-derived EQM
image archive from carrier-doped cuprate Mott insulators. Throughout these noisy and complex
data, the ANNs discover the existence of a lattice-commensurate, four-unit-cell periodic, translational-symmetry-breaking
EQM state. Further, the ANNs find these phenomena to be unidirectional, revealing a coincident
nematic EQM state. Strong-coupling theories of electronic liquid crystals are congruent with
all these observations.
