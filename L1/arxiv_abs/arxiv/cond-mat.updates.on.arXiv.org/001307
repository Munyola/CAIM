Artificial atomic systems in solids are becoming increasingly important building blocks in quantum
information processing and scalable quantum nanophotonic networks. Yet, synthesis of color centers
that act as single photon emitters which are suitable for on-chip applications is still beyond reach.
Here, we report a number of plasma and thermal annealing methods for the fabrication of emitters
in tape-exfoliated hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) crystals. A two-step process comprised of Ar
plasma etching and subsequent annealing in Ar is highly robust, and yields a seven-fold increase
in the concentration of emitters in hBN. The initial plasma etching step generates emitters that
suffer from blinking and bleaching, whereas the two-step process yields emitters that are photostable
at room temperature and have an emission energy distribution that is red-shifted relative to that
of pristine hBN. An analysis of emitters fabricated by a range of plasma and annealing treatments,
combined with a theoretical investigation of point defects in hBN indicates that single photon
emitters characterized by a high degree of photostability and emission wavelengths greater than
~700 nm are associated with defect complexes that contain oxygen. This is further confirmed by generating
the emitters by annealing hBN in an oxidative atmosphere. Our findings advance present understanding
of the structure of quantum emitter in hBN and enhance the nanofabrication toolkit that is needed
to realize integrated quantum nanophotonics based on 2D materials.
