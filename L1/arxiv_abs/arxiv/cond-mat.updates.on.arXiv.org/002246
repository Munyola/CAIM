Clustering instabilities are often presumed to lead to enhanced agglomeration between cohesive
grains due to the reduced relative velocities of particles within a cluster. Our discrete-particle
simulations exhibit the opposite trend, revealing a new mechanism we coin "cluster-induced deagglomeration".
We examine relatively dilute gas-solid flows, and isolate agglomerates of cohesive origin from
overall heterogeneities in the system - i.e., those arising from clusters of hydrodynamic origin
as well as cohesive agglomerates. We observe enhanced clustering with increasing system size (as
is the norm for non-cohesive systems) as well as reduced agglomeration. The reduced agglomeration
is traced to the increased collisional impact velocities of particles at the surface of a cluster
- i.e., higher levels of clustering lead to larger relative velocities between the clustered and
non-clustered regions, thereby serving as an additional source of granular temperature. This
physical picture is further evidenced by a theoretical model based on a balance between the generation
and breakage rates of agglomerates. Finally, cluster-induced deagglomeration also provides
an explanation for a surprising saturation of agglomeration levels in gas-solids systems with
increasing levels of cohesion, as opposed to the monotonic behavior seen in granular flows of cohesive
grains. Namely, higher cohesion leads to more energy dissipation, which is associated with competing
effects: enhanced agglomeration and enhanced clustering, the latter of which results in more cluster-induced
deagglomeration.
