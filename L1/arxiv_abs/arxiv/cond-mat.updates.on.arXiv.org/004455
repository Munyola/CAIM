Nitrides feature many interesting properties, such as a wide range of bandgaps suitable for optoelectronic
devices including light-emitting diodes (LEDs), and piezoelectric response used in microelectromechanical
systems (MEMS). Nitrides are also significantly underexplored compared to oxides and other chemistries,
with many being thermochemically metastable, sparking interest from a basic science point of view.
This paper reports on experimental and computational exploration of the Mg-Sb-N material system,
featuring both metastable materials and interesting semiconducting properties. Using sputter
deposition, we discovered a new Mg2SbN3 nitride with a wurtzite-derived crystal structure and
synthesized the antimonide-nitride Mg3SbN with an antiperovskite crystal structure for the first
time in thin film form. Theoretical calculations indicate that Mg2SbN3 is metastable and has properties
relevant to LEDs and MEMS, whereas Mg3SbN has a large dielectric constant (28\epsilon_0) and low
hole effective masses (0.9m_0), of interest for photovoltaic solar cell absorbers. The experimental
solar-matched 1.3 eV optical absorption onset of the Mg3SbN antiperovskite agrees with the theoretical
prediction (1.3 eV direct, 1.1 eV indirect), and with the measurements of room-temperature near-bandgap
photoluminescence. These results make an important contribution towards understanding semiconductor
properties and chemical trends in the Mg-Sb-N materials system, paving the way to future practical
applications of these novel materials.
