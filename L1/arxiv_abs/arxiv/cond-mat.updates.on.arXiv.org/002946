Without attempting to control their sizes, we grew exceptionally uniform, vertically aligned,
InN nanorods on c-plane sapphire. Our investigation of the symmetric two-phase structure of the
rods led us to propose a previously unconsidered self-assembly mechanism that may cause fibrous
crystal growth of InN on sapphire and unisotropic growth of similar polar semiconductors on insulators
in general. We show a similar structure observed in ZnO grown on SiO2 and discuss similar structures
in GaN grown on sapphire. The model explains the unique structure observed in the InN rods and describes
a mechanism based on the electric fields exerted by polar charges that affects the charge balance
within the rod during its growth, causing the formation of symmetric domains of inverted polarity.
Six inverted domains form at the six corners of the hexagonal monolayer at the start of the growth.
Initially, they limit the lateral expansion of the nucleus causing the growth of rods rather than
continuous layers. During the upward growth that follows, the inverted domains gradually extend
inward at the expense of the central non-inverted domain. Rod growth continues until the center
becomes completely occupied by the inverted polarity domains. The width at which the inverted domains
are formed and the height at which they take over from the central phase are predictable, and this
explains the observation of narrow width and height distributions. The proposed mechanism is limited
to polar semiconductor nanowires that grow along their polar axis on an insulating substrate.
