We present a surface stacking fault (SSF) energy approach to predicting defect nucleation from
the surfaces of surface-dominated nanostructure such as FCC metal nanowires. The approach leads
to a criteria that predicts the initial yield mechanism via either slip or twinning depending on
whether the unstable twinning energy or unstable slip energy is smaller as determined from the resulting
SSF energy curve. The approach is validated through a comparison between the SSF energy calculation
and low-temperature classical molecular dynamics simulations of copper nanowires with different
axial and transverse surface orientations, and cross sectional geometries. We focus on the effects
of the geometric cross section by studying the transition from slip to twinning previously predicted
in moving from a square to rectangular cross section for $\ <100\ > /\{100\}$ nanowires, and
also for moving from a rhombic to truncated rhombic cross sectional geometry for $\ <110\ >$
nanowires. \hsp{We also provide the important demonstration that the criteria is able to predict
the correct deformation mechanism when full dislocation slip is considered concurrently with
partial dislocation slip and twinning. This is done in the context of rhombic aluminum nanowires
which do not show a tensile reorientation due to full dislocation slip.} We show that the SSF energy
criteria successfully predicts the initial mode of surface-nucleated plasticity at low temperature,
while also discussing the effects of strain and temperature on the applicability of the criterion.
