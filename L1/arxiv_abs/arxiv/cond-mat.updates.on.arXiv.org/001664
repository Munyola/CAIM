Accurate estimation of surface wettability for various degrees of hydrophobicity becomes increasingly
important in the molecular design of membrane. In this paper, we develop simple yet physically realistic
model for estimating contact angle via hybridizing molecular dynamics and pseudocontinuum theory.
Molecular dynamics simulations were carried out to compute the macro-scale contact angle between
a water droplet and smooth walls from the nanoscale calculations. A macro-level droplet including
countless degrees of freedom due to an infinite number of molecules is impossible to be studied directly
via atomistic simulations. To resolve this issue, we employed two approaches consisting of the
pseudocontinuum approximation and the modified Young-Laplace equation. The former involves
the 9-3 Lennard-Jones (L-J) potential and can drastically reduce the degrees of freedom in molecular
simulations, while the latter relates the mesoscale contact angle to the realistic one. We altered
different parameters including the liquid-surface potential characteristics and the temperature,
and calculated the water contact angle by leveraging the mass density profile fitting method to
predict the broad spectrum of hydrophobic and hydrophilic substrates. The computational results
were compared with the experimental data for various materials including graphite, silicon, and
metals. This study suggests that pseudocontinuum modeling is an accurate approach to probe surface
wettability for various processes at a low computational cost.
