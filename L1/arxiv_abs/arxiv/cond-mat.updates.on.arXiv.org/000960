Advances of condensed matter physics in exploiting the spin degree of freedom of electrons led to
the emergence of the field of spintronics, which envisions new and more efficient approaches to
data transfer, computing, and storage [1-3]. These ideas have been inspiring analogous approaches
in photonics, where the manipulation of an artificially engineered pseudo-spin degrees of freedom
is enabled by synthetic gauge fields acting on light [4,5,6]. The ability to control these additional
degrees of freedom can significantly expand the landscape of available optical responses, which
may revolutionize optical computing and the basic means of controlling light in photonic devices
across the entire electromagnetic spectrum. Here we demonstrate a new class of photonic systems,
described by effective Hamiltonians in which competing synthetic gauge fields engineered in pseudo-spin,
chirality/sublattice and valley subspaces result in band gap opening at one of the valleys, while
the other valley exhibits Dirac-like conical dispersion. It is shown that such effective response
has dramatic implications on photon transport, among which: (i) spin-polarized and valley-polarized
one-way Klein tunneling and (ii) topological edge states that coexist within the Dirac continuum
for opposite valley and spin polarizations. These phenomena offer new ways to control light in photonics,
in particular for on-chip optical isolation, filtering and wave-division multiplexing by selective
action on their pseudo-spin and valley degrees of freedom.
