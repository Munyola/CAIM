The ability to predict the likelihood of impurity incorporation and their electronic energy levels
in semiconductors is crucial for controlling its conductivity, and thus the semiconductor's performance
in solar cells, photodiodes, and optoelectronics. The difficulty and expense of experimental
and computational determination of impurity levels makes a data-driven machine learning approach
appropriate. In this work, we show that a density functional theory-generated dataset of impurities
in Cd-based chalcogenides CdTe, CdSe, and CdS can lead to accurate and generalizable predictive
models of defect properties. By converting any semiconductor + impurity system into a set of numerical
descriptors, regression models are developed for the impurity formation enthalpy and charge transition
levels. These regression models can subsequently predict impurity properties in mixed anion CdX
compounds (where X is a combination of Te, Se and S) fairly accurately, proving that although trained
only on the end points, they are applicable to intermediate compositions. We make machine-learned
predictions of the Fermi-level dependent formation energies of hundreds of possible impurities
in 5 chalcogenide compounds, and suggest a list of impurities which can shift the equilibrium Fermi
level in the semiconductor as determined by the dominant intrinsic defects. These dominating impurities
as predicted by machine learning compare well with DFT predictions, revealing the power of machine-learned
models in the quick screening of impurities likely to affect the optoelectronic behavior of semiconductors.
