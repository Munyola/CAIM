An increasing number of two-dimensional (2D) materials have already been achieved experimentally
or predicted theoretically, which have potential applications in nano- and opto-electronics.
Various applications for electronic devices are closely related to their thermal transport properties.
In this work, the strain dependence of phonon transport in monolayer SiC with a perfect planar hexagonal
honeycomb structure is investigated by solving the linearized phonon Boltzmann equation. It is
found that room-temperature lattice thermal conductivity ($\kappa_L$) of monolayer SiC is two
orders of magnitude lower than that of graphene. The low $\kappa_L$ is due to small group velocities
and short phonon lifetimes, which can also be explained by polarized covalent bond due to large charge
transfer from Si to C atoms. In considered strain range, it is proved that the SiC monolayer is mechanically
and dynamically stable. With increased tensile strain, the $\kappa_L$ of SiC monolayer shows an
unusual nonmonotonic up-and-down behavior, which is due to the competition between the change
of phonon group velocities and phonon lifetimes of low frequency phonon modes. At low strains ($<$8\%),
the phonon lifetimes enhancement induces the increased $\kappa_L$, while at high strains ($>$8\%)
the reduction of group velocities as well as the decrease of the phonon lifetimes are the major mechanism
responsible for decreased $\kappa_L$. Our works further enrich studies on phonon transports of
2D materials with a perfect planar hexagonal honeycomb structure, and motivate farther experimental
studies.
