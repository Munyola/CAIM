Brownian dynamics (BD) simulations are used to study the translocation dynamics of a coarse-grained
polymer through a cylindrical nanopore. The rate of translocation is controlled by a tunable friction
coefficient, gamma_{0p}, for monomers inside the nanopore. In the case of unforced translocation,
the mean translocation time scales with polymer length N as <tau_1>~ (N-N_p)^alpha, where
N_p is the average number of monomers in the nanopore. The exponent approaches the value alpha=2
when the pore friction is sufficiently high, in accord with the prediction for the case of the quasi-static
regime where pore friction dominates. In the case of forced translocation, the polymer chain is
stretched and compressed on the cis and trans sides, respectively, for low gamma_{0p}. However,
the chain approaches conformational quasi-equilibrium for sufficiently large gamma_{0p}. In
this limit the observed scaling of <tau_1> with driving force and chain length supports the
FP prediction that <tau> is proportional to N/f_d for sufficiently strong driving force.
Monte Carlo simulations are used to calculate translocation free energy functions for the system.
The free energies are used with the Fokker-Planck equation to calculate translocation time distributions.
At sufficiently high gamma_{0p}, the predicted distributions are in excellent agreement with
those calculated from the BD simulations. We conclude that the FP equation provides a valid description
of translocation dynamics in the limit of high pore friction.
