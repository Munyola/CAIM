In the Widom-Rowlinson lattice gas, two particle species (A, B) diffuse freely via particle-hole
exchange, subject to both on-site exclusion and prohibition of A-B nearest-neighbor pairs. As
an athermal system, the overall densities are the only control parameters. As the densities increase,
an entropically driven phase transition occurs, leading to ordered states with A- and B-rich domains
separated by hole-rich interfaces. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we analyze the effect of imposing
a drive on this system, biasing particle moves along one direction. Our study parallels that for
a driven Ising lattice gas -- the Katz-Lebowitz-Spohn (KLS) model, which displays atypical collective
behavior, e.g., structure factors with discontinuity singularities and ordered states with domains
only parallel to the drive. Here, other novel features emerge, including structure factors with
kink singularities (best fitted to |q|), maxima at non-vanishing wavevector values, oscillating
correlation functions, and ordering into multiple striped domains perpendicular to the drive,
with a preferred wavelength depending on density and drive intensity. Moreover, the (hole-rich)
interfaces between the domains are statistically rough (whether driven or not), in sharp contrast
with those in the KLS model, in which the drive suppresses interfacial roughness. Defining a novel
order parameter (to account for the emergence of multistripe states), we map out the phase diagram
in the density-drive plane and present preliminary evidence for a critical phase in this driven
lattice gas.
