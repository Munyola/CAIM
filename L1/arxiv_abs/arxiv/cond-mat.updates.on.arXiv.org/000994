The second-order Matsubara Green's function method (GF2) is a robust temperature dependent quantum
chemistry approach, extending beyond the random-phase approximation. However, till now the scope
of GF2 applications was quite limited as they require computer resources which rise steeply with
system size. In each step of the self-consistent GF2 calculation there are two parts: the estimation
of the self-energy from the previous step's Green's function, and updating the Green's function
from the self-energy. The first part formally scales as the fifth power of the system size while the
second has a much gentler cubic scaling. Here, we develop a stochastic approach to GF2 (sGF2) which
reduces the fifth power scaling of the first step to merely quadratic, leaving the overall sGF2 scaling
as cubic. We apply the method to linear hydrogen chains containing up to 1000 electrons, showing
that the approach is numerically stable, efficient and accurate. The stochastic errors are very
small, of the order of 0.1% or less of the correlation energy for large systems, with only a moderate
computational effort. The first iteration of GF2 is an MP2 calculation that is done in linear scaling,
hence we obtain an extremely fast stochastic MP2 (sMP2) method as a by-product. While here we consider
finite systems with large band gaps where at low temperatures effects are negligible, the sGF2 formalism
is temperature dependent and general and can be applied to finite or periodic systems with small
gaps at finite temperatures.
