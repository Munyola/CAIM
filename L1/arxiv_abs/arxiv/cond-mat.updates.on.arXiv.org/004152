Nitride has been drawing much attention due to its wide range of applications in optoelectronics
and remains plenty of room for materials design and discovery. Here, a large set of nitrides have
been designed, with their band gap and alignment being studied by first-principles calculations
combined with machine learning. Band gap and band offset against wurtzite GaN accurately calculated
by the combination of screened hybrid functional of HSE and DFT-PBE were used to train and test machine
learning models. After comparison among different techniques of machine learning, when elemental
properties are taken as features, support vector regression (SVR) with radial kernel performs
best for predicting both band gap and band offset with prediction root mean square error (RMSE) of
0.298 eV and 0.183 eV, respectively. The former is within HSE calculation uncertainty and the latter
is small enough to provide reliable predictions. Additionally, when band gap calculated by DFT-PBE
was added into the feature space, band gap prediction RMSE decreases to 0.099 eV. Through a feature
engineering algorithm, elemental feature space based band gap prediction RMSE further drops by
around 0.005 eV and the relative importance of elemental properties for band gap prediction was
revealed. Finally, band gap and band offset of all designed nitrides were predicted and two trends
were noticed that as the number of cation types increases, band gap tends to narrow down while band
offset tends to go up. The predicted results will be a useful guidance for precise investigation
on nitride engineering.
