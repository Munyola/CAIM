We demonstrate with experiments that wrinkling in stretched latex sheets occur over finite strains,
and that their amplitudes grow and then decay to zero over a greater range of applied strains compared
with linear elastic materials. The wrinkles occur provided the sheet is sufficiently thin compared
to its width, and only over a finite range of length-to-width ratios. We show with simulations that
the Mooney-Rivlin hyperelastic model describes the observed growth and decay of the wrinkles in
our experiments. The decrease of wavelength with applied tension is found to be consistent with
a far-from-threshold scenario proposed by Cerda and Mahadevan in 2003. However, the amplitude
is observed to decrease with increasing tensile load, in contrast with the prediction of their original
model. We address the crucial assumption of {\it collapse of compressive stress}, as opposed to
collapse of compressive strain, underlying the far-from-threshold analysis, and test it by measuring
the actual arc-length of the stretched sheet in the transverse direction and its difference from
the width of a planar projection of the wrinkled shape. Our experiments and numerical simulations
indicate a complete {\it collapse of the compressive stress}, and reveal that a proper implementation
of the far-from-threshold analysis is consistent with the non-monotonic dependence of the amplitude
on applied tensile load observed in experiments and simulations. Thus, our work support and extend
far-from-threshold analysis to the stretching problem of rectangular hyperelastic sheets.
