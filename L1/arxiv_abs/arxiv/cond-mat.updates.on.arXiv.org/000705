The functionality of logic and memory elements in current electronics is based on multi-stability,
driven either by manipulating local concentrations of electrons in transistors, or by switching
between equivalent states of a material with a degener- ate ground state in magnetic or ferroelectric
materials. Another possibility is offered by phase transitions with switching between metallic
and insulating phases, but classical phase transitions are limited in speed by slow nucleation,
proliferation of domains and hysteresis. We can in principle avoid these problems by using quantum
states for switching, but microscopic systems suffer from decoherence which prohibits their use
in everyday devices. Macroscopic quantum states, such as the superconducting ground state have
the advantage that on a fundamental level they do not suffer from decoherence plaguing microscopic
systems. Here we demonstrate for the first time ultrafast non-thermal switching between different
metastable electronically ordered states by pulsed electrical charge injection. The macroscopic
nature of the many-body quantum states(1-4) - which are not part of the equilibrium phase diagram
- gives rise to unprecedented stability and remarka- bly sharp switching thresholds. Fast sub-50
ps switching, large associated re- sistance changes, 2-terminal operation and demonstrable high
fidelity of bi-stability control suggest new opportunities for the use of macroscopic quantum
states in electronics, particularly for an ultrafast non-volatile quantum charge-order resistive
random access memory (QCOR-RAM).
