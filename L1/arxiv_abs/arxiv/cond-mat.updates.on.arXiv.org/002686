Rare earth nickelates, $R$NiO$_3$, exhibit a metal-insulator transition (MIT) accompanied by
a breathing mode distortion of the octahedral network which breaks the symmetry between formerly
equivalent Ni sites. The quantitative theoretical description of this coupled electronic-structural
instability, driven by electronic correlation effects, is extremely challenging. Here, we address
this issue by simultaneously taking into account both structural and electronic degrees of freedom
using a self-consistent combination of density functional theory and dynamical mean-field theory
(DFT+DMFT), together with interaction parameters obtained from the constrained random phase
approximation. Our total energy calculations allow to obtain accurate values for the breathing
mode distortion across the series and elucidate the coupling between the structural distortion
and the electronic instability towards a charge disproportionated insulating state. Our analysis
shows that the MIT is crucial to stabilize the structural distortion, leading to a clear first order
character of the coupled transition. Decreasing octahedral rotations across the series suppress
the electronic instability and simultaneously increase the screening of the effective Coulomb
interaction, thus weakening the correlation effects responsible for the MIT. Our results enable
a comprehensive understanding, both qualitatively and quantitatively, of the complex interplay
between structural properties and electronic correlation effects across the nickelate series,
and pave the way for future studies of similar materials systems.
