Recent research has led to the discovery of fundamental new phenomena in network synchronization,
including chimera states, explosive synchronization, and asymmetry-induced synchronization.
Each of these phenomena has thus far been observed only in systems designed to exhibit that one phenomenon,
which raises the questions of whether they are mutually compatible and, if so, under what conditions
they co-occur. Here, we introduce a class of remarkably simple oscillator networks that concurrently
exhibit all of these phenomena. The dynamical units consist of pairs of nonidentical phase oscillators,
which we refer to as Janus oscillators by analogy with Janus particles and the mythological figure
from which their name is derived. In contrast to previous studies, these networks exhibit (i) explosive
synchronization with identical oscillators; (ii) extreme multistability of chimera states,
including traveling, intermittent, and bouncing chimeras; and (iii) asymmetry-induced synchronization
in which synchronization is promoted by random oscillator heterogeneity. These networks also
exhibit the previously unobserved possibility of inverted synchronization transitions, in which
a transition to a more synchronous state is induced by a reduction rather than an increase in the coupling
strength. These various phenomena are shown to emerge under rather parsimonious conditions, and
even in locally connected ring topologies, which has the potential to facilitate their use to control
and manipulate synchronization in experiments.
