A vortex in an s-wave superconductor with a surface Dirac cone can trap a Majorana bound state with
zero energy leading to a zero-bias peak (ZBP) of tunneling conductance. The iron-based superconductor
FeTe$_x$Se$_{1-x}$ is one of the material candidates hosting these Majorana vortex modes. It has
been observed by recent scanning tunneling spectroscopy measurement that the fraction of vortex
cores possessing ZBPs decreases with increasing magnetic field on the surface of this iron-based
superconductor. We construct a three-dimensional tight-binding model simulating the physics
of over a hundred Majorana vortex modes in FeTe$_x$Se$_{1-x}$ with realistic physical parameters.
Our simulation shows that the Majorana hybridization and disordered vortex distribution can explain
the decreasing fraction of the ZBPs observed in the experiment. Furthermore, we find the statistics
of the energy peaks off zero energy in our simulation with the Majorana physics in agreement with
the analyzed peak statistics in the vortex cores from the experiment. This agreement and the explanation
of the decreasing ZBP fraction lead to an important indication of scalable Majorana vortex modes
in the iron-based superconductor. Thus, FeTe$_x$Se$_{1-x}$ can be one promising platform possessing
scalable Majorana qubits for quantum computing. In addition, we further show the interplay of the
ZBP presence and the vortex locations qualitatively agrees with our additional experimental observation
and predict the universal spin signature of the hybridized multiple Majorana vortex modes.
