We investigate an intermittent stochastic process, in which the diffusive motion with time-dependent
diffusion coefficient $D(t)\sim t^{\alpha-1}$, $\alpha>0$ (scaled Brownian motion), is stochastically
reset to its initial position and starts anew. The resetting follows a renewal process with either
exponential or power-law distribution of the waiting times between successive renewals. The resetting
events, however, do not affect the time dependence of the diffusion coefficient, so that the whole
process appears to be a non-renewal one. We discuss the mean squared displacement of a particle and
probability density function of its positions in such a process. We show that scaled Brownian motion
with resetting demonstrates a rich behavior whose properties essentially depend on the interplay
of the parameters of the resetting process and the particle's displacement in a free motion. The
motion of particles can remain either almost unaffected by resetting, but can also get slowed down
or even be completely suppressed. Especially interesting are the nonstationary situations in
which the mean squared displacement stagnates but the distribution of positions does not tend to
any steady state. \color{black} This behavior is compared to the situation (discussed in the other
paper of this series) in which the memory on the value of the diffusion coefficient at a resetting
time is erased, so that the whole process is a fully renewal one. We show that the properties of the
probability densities in such processes (erazing or retaining the memory on the diffusion coefficient)
are vastly different. \color{black}
