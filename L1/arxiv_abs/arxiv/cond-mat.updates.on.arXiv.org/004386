Studies on two-dimensional electron systems in a strong magnetic field first revealed the quantum
Hall (QH) effect, a topological state of matter featuring a finite Chern number (C) and chiral edge
states. Haldane later theorized that Chern insulators with integer QH effects could appear in lattice
models with complex hopping parameters even at zero magnetic field. The ABC-trilayer graphene/hexagonal
boron nitride (TLG/hBN) moir\'e superlattice provides an attractive platform to explore Chern
insulators because it features nearly flat moir\'e minibands with a valley-dependent electrically
tunable Chern number. Here we report the experimental observation of a correlated Chern insulator
in a TLG/hBN moir\'e superlattice. We show that reversing the direction of the applied vertical
electric field switches TLG/hBN's moir\'e minibands between zero and finite Chern numbers, as
revealed by dramatic changes in magneto-transport behavior. For topological hole minibands tuned
to have a finite Chern number, we focus on 1/4 filling, corresponding to one hole per moir\'e unit
cell. The Hall resistance is well quantized at h/2e2, i.e. C = 2, for |B| > 0.4 T. The correlated Chern
insulator is ferromagnetic, exhibiting significant magnetic hysteresis and a large anomalous
Hall signal at zero magnetic field. Our discovery of a C = 2 Chern insulator at zero magnetic field
should open up exciting opportunities for discovering novel correlated topological states, possibly
with novel topological excitations, in nearly flat and topologically nontrivial moir\'e minibands.
