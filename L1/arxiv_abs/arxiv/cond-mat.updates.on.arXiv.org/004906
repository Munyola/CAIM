Understanding the interplay between the structural, chemical and physical properties of nanomaterials
is crucial for designing new devices with enhanced performance. In this regards, doping of metal
oxides is a general strategy to tune size, morphology, charge, lattice, orbital and spin degrees
of freedoms and has been shown to affect nanomaterials properties for photoelectrochemical water
splitting, batteries, catalysis, magnetic applications and optics. Here we report the role of
lattice small polaron in driving the morphological transition from nearly isotropic to nanowire
crystals in Si doped hematite ($\alpha-Fe_2O_3$). Lattice small polaron formation is well evidenced
by the increase of hexagonal strain and degree of distortion of $FeO_6$ showing a hyperbolic trend
with increasing Si content. Local analysis via pair distribution function highlights an unreported
crossover from small to large polarons, which affects the correlation length of the polaronic distortion
from short to average scales. Ferromagnetic double exchange interactions between $Fe^{2+}/Fe^{3+}$
species is found to be the driving force of the crossover, constraining the chaining of chemical
bonds along the [110] crystallographic direction. This promotes the increase in the reticular
density of Fe atoms along the hematite basal plane only, which boosts the anisotropic growth of nanocrystals
with more extended [110] facets. Our results show that magnetic and electronic interactions drive
preferential crystallographic growth in doped metal oxides, thus providing a new route to design
their functional properties.
