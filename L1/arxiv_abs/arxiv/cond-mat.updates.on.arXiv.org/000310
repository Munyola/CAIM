The efficiency of solution-processed colloidal quantum dot (QD) based solar cells is limited by
poor charge transport in the active layer of the device, which originates from multiple trapping
sites provided by QD surface defects. We apply a recently developed ultrafast electro-optical
technique, pump-push photocurrent spectroscopy, to elucidate the charge trapping dynamics in
PbS colloidal-QD photovoltaic devices at working conditions. We show that IR photo-induced absorption
of QD in the 0.2-0.5 eV region is partly associated with immobile charges, which can be optically
de-trapped in our experiment. Using this absorption as a probe, we observe that the early trapping
dynamics strongly depend on the nature of the ligands used for QD passivation while it depends only
slightly on the nature of the electron-accepting layer. We find that weakly bound states, with a
photon-activation energy of 0.2 eV, are populated instantaneously upon photoexcitation. This
indicates that the photogenerated states show an intrinsically bound-state character, arguably
similar to charge-transfer states formation in organic photovoltaic materials. Sequential population
of deeper traps (activation energy 0.3-0.5 eV) is observed on the ~0.1-10 ns time scales, indicating
that most of carrier trapping occurs only after substantial charge relaxation/transport. The
reported study disentangles fundamentally different contributions to charge trapping dynamics
in the nanocrystal-based optoelectronic devices and can serve as a useful tool for QD solar cell
development.
