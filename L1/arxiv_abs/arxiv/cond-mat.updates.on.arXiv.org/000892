We study the charge transfer dynamics following the formation of a phase or voltage biased su- perconducting
nano-junction using a full counting statistics analysis. We demonstrate that the evolution of
the zeros of the generating function allows one to identify the population of different many body
states much in the same way as the accumulation of Yang-Lee zeros of the partition function in equilibrium
statistical mechanics is connected to phase transitions. We give an exact expression connecting
the dynamical zeros to the charge transfer cumulants and discuss when an approximation based on
"dominant" zeros is valid. We show that, for generic values of the parameters, the system gets trapped
into a metastable state characterized by a non-equilibrium population of the many body states which
is dependent on the initial conditions. We study in particular the effect of the switching rates
in the dynamics showing that, in contrast to intuition, the deviation from thermal equilibrium
increases for the slower rates. In the voltage biased case the steady state is reached independently
of the initial conditions. Our method allows us to obtain accurate results for the steady state current
and noise in quantitative agreement with steady state methods developed to describe the multiple
Andreev reflections regime. Finally, we discuss the system dynamics after a sudden voltage drop
showing the possibility of tuning the many body states population by an appropriate choice of the
initial voltage, providing a feasible experimental way to access the quench dynamics and control
the state of the system.
