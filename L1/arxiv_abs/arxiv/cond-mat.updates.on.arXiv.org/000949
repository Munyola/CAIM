The symmetries that dictate the existence of relativistic Dirac quasiparticles in condensed-matter
systems have been exploited in the realization of a plethora of artificial Dirac materials. In these
artificial systems, the ability to design and manipulate the lattice structure has enabled the
exploration of Dirac physics in new regimes. However, little attention has been paid to the effect
of the surrounding environment on the nature of the Dirac quasiparticles. Here we theoretically
investigate honeycomb arrays of meta-atoms embedded inside a planar photonic cavity. Massless
Dirac polaritons emerge near the conventional Dirac points located at the corners of the Brillouin
zone, in analogy with graphene. However, this analogy breaks down as the interaction with the photonic
environment generates additional satellite Dirac points with $\mp\pi$ Berry flux. Reducing the
cavity height induces the merging of the satellite Dirac points with the conventional ones, forming
a quadratic band-degeneracy with combined $\mp2\pi$ Berry flux. As a result, the massless Dirac
polaritons with a linear spectrum morph into massive ones with a parabolic spectrum. Remarkably,
this merging is not followed by Dirac point annihilation, but instead, massless Dirac polaritons
re-emerge with an unprecedented inversion of chirality which has no analog in real or artificial
graphene systems. This novel tunability could open up a new realm of unexplored Dirac-related physics,
such as unconventional tunnelling and pseudo-magnetic related phenomena, in readily realizable
experimental set-ups.
