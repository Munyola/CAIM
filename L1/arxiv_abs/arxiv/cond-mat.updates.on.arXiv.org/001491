Bose-Einstein condensation in a Bose gas is studied analytically, in any positive dimensionality
($d>0$) for identical bosons with any energy-momentum positive-exponent ($s>0$) plus an energy
gap $\Delta$ between the ground state energy $\varepsilon_0$ and the first excited state, i.e.,
$\varepsilon=\varepsilon_0$ for $k=0$ and $\varepsilon=\varepsilon_0 +\Delta+ c_sk^s$, for
$k>0$, where $\hbar k$ is the particle momentum and $c_s$ a constant with dimensions of energy multiplied
by a length to the power $s > 0$. Explicit formulae with arbitrary $d/s$ and $\Delta$ are obtained
and discussed for the critical temperature, and the condensed fraction, as well as for the thermodynamic
properties: equation of state from where we deduce a generalized $\Delta$ independent thermal
de Broglie wavelength, internal energy, specific heats as well as their jumps at $T_c$, the gamma
coefficient $C_P/C_V$, entropy, Helmholtz free energy, entalpy and Gibbs free energy. When $\Delta
> 0$, a Bose-Einstein critical temperature $T_c \neq 0$ exists for any $d > 0$ at which the internal
energy shows a peak and the specific heat shows a jump. Both the critical temperature and the specific
heat jump increase as functions of the gap but they decrease as functions of $d/s$. At sufficiently
high temperatures $\Delta$- independent classical results are recovered. However, for temperatures
below the critical one the gap effects are predominant. For $\Delta = 0$ we recover previous reported
results. As expected, thermodynamic properties are $\varepsilon_0$ independent since this is
just a reference energy.
