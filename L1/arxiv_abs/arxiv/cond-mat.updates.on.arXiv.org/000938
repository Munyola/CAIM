The influence of zealots on the noisy voter model is studied theoretically and numerically at the
mean--field level. The noisy voter model is a modification of the voter model that includes a second
mechanism for transitions between states: apart from the original herding processes, voters may
change their states because of an intrinsic, noisy in origin source. By increasing the importance
of the noise with respect to the herding, the system exhibits a finite--size phase transition from
a quasi-consensus state, where most of the voters share the same opinion, to a one with coexistence.
Upon introducing some zealots, or voters with fixed opinion, the latter scenario may change significantly.
We unveil the new situations by carrying out a systematic numerical and analytical study of a fully
connected network for voters, but allowing different voters to be directly influenced by different
zealots. We show that this general system is equivalent to a system of voters without zealots, but
with heterogeneous values of their parameters characterizing herding and noisy dynamics. In general,
the zealotry enhances the effective noise of the system, which may destroy the original quasi--consensus
state, and can introduce a bias towards the opinion of the majority of zealots, hence breaking the
symmetry of the system and giving rise to new phases. In the most general case we find two different
transitions: a discontinuous transition form an asymmetric bimodal phase to an extreme asymmetric
phase and a second continuous transition from the extreme asymmetric phase to an asymmetric unimodal
phase.
