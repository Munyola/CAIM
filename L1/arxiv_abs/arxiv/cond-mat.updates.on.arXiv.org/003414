InAs/InP quantum dots are excellent sources of telecom single-photon emission and are among the
most promising candidates for scalable quantum photonic circuits. However, geometric differences
in each quantum dot leads to slightly different emission wavelengths and hinders the possibility
of generating multiple identical quantum emitters on the same chip. Stark tuning is an efficient
technique to overcome this issue as it can control the emission energy of individual quantum dots
through the quantum-confined Stark effect. Realizing this technique in InAs/InP quantum dots
has previously been limited to shifts of less than 0.8 meV due to jumps in the emission energy because
of additional charges at high electric field intensities. We demonstrate up to 5.1 meV of Stark tuning
in the emission wavelength of InAs/InP quantum dots. To eliminate undesirable jumps to charged
state, we use a thin oxide insulator to prevent carrier injection from the contacts, thereby significantly
improves the tuning range of the Stark effect. Moreover, the single-photon nature and narrow linewidth
of the quantum dot emission is preserved under a wide range of applied electric fields. Using photoluminescence
intensity measurements and time-resolved lifetime spectroscopy we confirmed that this Stark
tuning range is limited by carrier tunneling at high electric fields. This result is an important
step toward integrating multiple identical quantum emitters at telecom wavelengths on-a-chip,
which is crucial for realizing complex quantum photonic circuits for quantum information processing.
