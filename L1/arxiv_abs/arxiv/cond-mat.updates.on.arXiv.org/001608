Ultracold quantum gases provide a unique setting to study the dynamics of interacting quantum systems,
which is highly relevant for the understanding of the next generation of quantum devices. We study
this scenario by investigating a multi-component system of $^{87}$Rb-$^{39}$K Bose-Einstein
condensates (BECs) both theoretically and experimentally. Such multi-component systems can
be characterized by their miscibility, where miscible components lead to a mixed ground state and
immiscible components form a phase-separated state. Here we perform the first full simulation
of the dynamical expansion of this system including both BECs and thermal clouds, which allows for
a detailed comparison with experimental results. In particular we show that striking features
emerge in time-of-flight for BECs with strong interspecies repulsion, even for systems which were
separated in situ by a large gravitational sag. An analysis of the center of mass positions of the
BECs after expansion yields qualitative agreement with the homogeneous criterion for phase-separation,
but reveals no clear transition point between the mixed and the separated phases. Instead one can
identify a transition region, for which the presence of a gravitational sag is found to be advantageous.
Moreover we analyze the situation where only one component is condensed and show that the density
distribution of the thermal component also show some distinct features. Our work sheds new light
on the analysis of multi-component systems after time-of-flight and will guide future experiments
on the detection of miscibility in these systems.
