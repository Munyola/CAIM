A Markovian process of a system is defined classically as a process in which the future state of the
system is fully determined by only its present state, not by its previous history. There have been
several measures of non-Markovianity to quantify the degrees of non-Markovian effect in a process
of an open quantum system based on information backflow from the environment to the system. However,
the condition for the witness of the system information backflow does not coincide with the classical
definition of a Markovian process. Recently, a new measure with a condition that coincides with
the classical definition in the relevant limit has been proposed. Here, we focus on the new definition
(measure) for quantum non-Markovian processes, and characterize the Markovian condition as a
quantum process that has no information backflow through the reduced environment state (IBTRES)
and no system-environment correlation effect (SECE). The action of IBTRES produces non-Markovian
effects by flowing the information of quantum operations performed by an experimenter at earlier
times back to the system through the environment, while the SECE can produce non-Markovian effect
without carrying any earlier quantum operation information. We give the necessary and sufficient
conditions for no IBTRES and no SECE, respectively, and show that a process is Markovian if and only
if it has no IBTRES and no SECE. The quantitative measures and algorithms for calculating non-Markovianity,
IBTRES and soly-SECE are explicitly presented.
