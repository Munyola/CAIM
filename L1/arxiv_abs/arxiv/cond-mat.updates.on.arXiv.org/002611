Gate-defined quantum point contacts (QPC's) are widely used on semiconductor heterostructures
to control electronic transport at the nanoscale in two-dimensional electron gases. In graphene,
however, tailoring gate-defined QPC's remains challenging due to the Dirac band structure that
inevitably induces gapless, conductive npn junctions beneath gate electrodes. For narrow split-gate
geometry, conductance quantization can only develop in the graphene quantum Hall regime when the
broken symmetry states open a gap between electron and hole states. Yet, the transition between
the low-field and high-field quantum Hall regimes in the split-gate geometry remains unexplored.
Here, we report on the evolution of the coherent electronic transport through a gate-defined QPC
in a high-mobility graphene device from ballistic transport to quantum Hall regime upon increasing
the magnetic field. At low field, the conductance exhibits Fabry-P\'{e}rot resonances resulting
from the npn cavities formed beneath the top-gated regions, with evidence of the graphene's Berry
phase by magnetic steering of electron trajectories. Our findings show that, above a critical field
$B^*$ corresponding to the cyclotron radius equal to the npn cavity length, Fabry-P\'{e}rot resonances
vanish and snake trajectories are guided through the constriction, marking the emergence of the
QPC contribution to the conductance. At higher field, transport is done by quantum Hall edge channels,
with the characteristic signature of current equilibration in a QPC geometry.
