Animal swarms displaying a variety of typical flocking patterns would not exist without underlying
safe, optimal and stable dynamics of the individuals. The emergence of these universal patterns
can be efficiently reconstructed with agent-based models. If we want to reproduce these patterns
with artificial systems, such as autonomous aerial robots, agent-based models can also be used
in the control algorithm of the robots. However, finding the proper algorithms and thus understanding
the essential characteristics of the emergent collective behaviour of robots requires the thorough
and realistic modeling of the robot and the environment as well. In this paper, first, we present
an abstract mathematical model of an autonomous flying robot. The model takes into account several
realistic features, such as time delay and locality of the communication, inaccuracy of the on-board
sensors and inertial effects. We present two decentralized control algorithms. One is based on
a simple self-propelled flocking model of animal collective motion, the other is a collective target
tracking algorithm. Both algorithms contain a viscous friction-like term, which aligns the velocities
of neighbouring agents parallel to each other. We show that this term can be essential for reducing
the inherent instabilities of such a noisy and delayed realistic system. We discuss simulation
results about the stability of the control algorithms, and perform real experiments to show the
applicability of the algorithms on a group of autonomous quadcopters.
