Crystal symmetry of two-dimensional (2D) materials plays an important role in their electronic
and optical properties. Engineering symmetry in 2D materials has recently emerged as a promising
way to achieve novel properties and functions. The noncentrosymmetric structure of monolayer
transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs), such as molybdenum disulfide (MoS2), has allowed for
valley control via circularly polarized optical excitation. In bilayer TMDCs, inversion symmetry
can be controlled by varying the stacking sequence, thus providing a pathway to engineer valley
selectivity. Here, we report the in situ integration of AA' and AB stacked bilayer MoS2 with different
inversion symmetries by creating atomically sharp stacking boundaries between the differently
stacked domains, via thermal stimulation and electron irradiation, inside an atomic-resolution
scanning transmission electron microscopy. The setup enables us to track the formation and atomic
motion of the stacking boundaries in real time and with ultrahigh resolution which enables in-depth
analysis on the atomic structure at the boundaries. In conjunction with density functional theory
calculations, we establish the dynamics of the boundary nucleation and expansion and further identify
metallic boundary states. Our approach provides a means to synthesize domain boundaries with intriguing
transport properties and opens up a new avenue for controlling valleytronics in nanoscale domains
via real-time patterning of domains with different symmetry properties.
