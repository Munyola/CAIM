The quantum Hall effect (QHE) originates from discrete Landau levels forming in a two-dimensional
(2D) electron system in a magnetic field. In three dimensions (3D), the QHE is forbidden because
the third dimension spreads Landau levels into multiple overlapping bands, destroying the quantisation.
Here we report the QHE in graphite crystals that are up to hundreds of atomic layers thick - thickness
at which graphite was believed to behave as a 3D bulk semimetal. We attribute the observation to a
dimensional reduction of electron dynamics in high magnetic fields, such that the electron spectrum
remains continuous only in the direction of the magnetic field, and only the last two quasi-one-dimensional
(1D) Landau bands cross the Fermi level. In sufficiently thin graphite films, the formation of standing
waves breaks these 1D bands into a discrete spectrum, giving rise to a multitude of quantum Hall plateaux.
Despite a large number of layers, we observe a profound difference between films with even and odd
numbers of graphene layers. For odd numbers, the absence of inversion symmetry causes valley polarisation
of the standing-wave states within 1D Landau bands. This reduces QHE gaps, as compared to films of
similar thicknesses but with even layer numbers because the latter retain the inversion symmetry
characteristic of bilayer graphene. High-quality graphite films present a novel QHE system with
a parity-controlled valley polarisation and intricate interplay between orbital, spin and valley
states, and clear signatures of electron-electron interactions including the fractional QHE
below 0.5 K.
