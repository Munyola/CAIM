Double perovskite (DP) oxide material receive extensive research interest due to exciting physical
properties with potential technological application. 3$d$ based DP oxides are promising for exciting
physics like magnetodielectric, ferroelectric, Griffith phase etc., specially Co/Mn DPs are
gaining much research interest. In this paper we present the study of magnetic phase and transport
properties in nano-crystalline Pr$_2$CoMnO$_6$ a 3$d$ based double perovskite compound. This
material shows a paramagnetic (PM) to ferromagnetic (FM) phase transition below 173 K marked by
a rapid increase in magnetic moment due to spin ordering. We found divergence in inverse magnetic
susceptibility ($\chi$$^{-1}$) from Curie weiss behavior around 206 K which indicates the evolution
of Griffiths phase before actual PM-FM transition. We found that the Griffiths phase suppressed
with increasing applied magnetic filed. For the understanding of charge transport in this material
we have measured temperature dependent electrical resistivity. Pr$_2$CoMnO$_6$ is a strong insulator
where resistivity increase abruptly below magnetic phase transition. To understand the effect
of magnetic field on transport behavior we have also measured the magnetoresistance (MR) at different
temperatures. Sample shows the negative MR with maximum value $\sim$22 $\%$ under applied magnetic
field of 50 kOe at 125 K. MR follows quadratic field dependency above $T_c$ however below $T_c$ the
MR shows deviation from this field dependency at low field.
