The identification and use of reversible Martensitic transformations, typically described as
shape memory transformations, as a new class of solid-solid phase change material is experimentally
demonstrated here for the first time. To prove this claim, time-domain thermoreflectance, frequency-domain
thermoreflectance, and differential scanning calorimetry studies were conducted on commercial
NiTi alloys to quantify thermal conductivity and latent heat. Additional Joule-heating experiments
demonstrate successful temperature leveling during transient heating and cooling in a simulated
environment. Compared to standard solid-solid materials and solid-liquid paraffin, these experimental
results show that shape memory alloys provide up to a two order of magnitude higher Figure of Merit.
Beyond these novel experimental results, a comprehensive review of >75 binary NiTi and NiTi-based
ternary and quaternary alloys in the literature shows that shape memory alloys can be tuned in a wide
range of transformation temperatures (from -50 to 330{deg}C), latent heats (from 9.1 to 35.1 J/g),
and thermal conductivities (from 15.6 to 28 W/mK). This can be accomplished by changing the Ni and
Ti balance, introducing trace elements, and/or by thermomechanical processing. Combining excellent
corrosion resistance, formability, high strength and ductility, high thermal performance, and
tunability, SMAs represent an exceptional phase change material that circumvents many of the scientific
and engineering challenges hindering progress in this field.
