Spintronic neurons which emit sharp voltage spikes are required for the realization of hardware
neural networks enabling fast data processing with low-power consumption. In many neuroscience
and computer science models, neurons are abstracted as non-linear oscillators. Magnetic nano-oscillators
called spin-torque nano-oscillators are interesting candidates for imitating neurons at nanoscale.
These oscillators, however, emit sinusoidal waveforms without spiking while biological neurons
are relaxation oscillators that emit sharp voltage spikes. Here we propose a simple way to imitate
neuron spiking in high-magnetoresistance nanoscale spin valves where both magnetic layers are
free and thin enough to be switched by spin torque. Our numerical-simulation results show that the
windmill motion induced by spin torque in the proposed spintronic neurons gives rise to spikes whose
shape and frequency, set by the charging and discharging times, can be tuned through the amplitude
of injected dc current. We also found that these devices can exhibit chaotic oscillations. Chaotic-like
neuron dynamics has been observed in the brain, and it is desirable in some neuromorphic computing
applications whereas it should be avoided in others. We demonstrate that the degree of chaos can
be tuned in a wide range by engineering the magnetic stack and anisotropies and by changing the dc
current. The proposed spintronic neuron is a promising building block for hardware neuromorphic
chips leveraging non-linear dynamics for computing.
