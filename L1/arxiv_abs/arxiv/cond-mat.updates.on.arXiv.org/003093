Strongly optical irradiation on graphene or graphene-like 2D materials induces Floquet insulators
with topological edge states. We study the Floquet states of two graphene-like models, which are
valley-polarized metal in the absence of the optical irradiation. The first model is the graphene
with staggered sublattice intrinsic spin-orbital coupling, and the second model is the Silicene-model
with uniform intrinsic spin-orbital coupling as well as staggered sublattice on-site potential
and magnetic exchange field. In the zigzag nanoribbons, the localized sublattice polarized edge
states carry one-way spin or charge conductivity at the intrinsic Fermi level for the first or second
model, respectively. In the presence of the optical irradiation with appropriate optical frequency,
the first order electron-photon coupling induces dynamical gaps at the intrinsic Fermi level.
At the zigzag edge of the semi-infinite plane, the valley-centered edge states appear within each
Floquet gap. At the narrow zigzag nanoribbons, the sublattice polarized edge states at the zigzag
edges remain gapless, while the valley-centered edge states are gapped out by the finite size effect
at the intrinsic Fermi level. The sublattice polarized edge states at the zigzag edges become the
dominating or only conducting states around the intrinsic Fermi level. Thus, the narrow zigzag
nanoribbons exhibit one-way spin or change conductivity for the first and second models, respectively,
which are confirmed by the quantum transportation calculations.
