The effect of He+ ion irradiation on a distribution of Cr atoms in model (EFDA) Fe(100-x)Cr(x) (x=5.8,
10.75, 15.15) was studied by means of conversion electrons Mossbauer spectroscopy. The alloys
were irradiated to the dose of 1.2E16 ions per cm2 (7.5 dpa) with He+ of 0.25 and 2.0 MeV. The distribution
of Cr atoms within the first two coordination shells around the probe Fe atoms was expressed in terms
of the Warren-Cowley short-range order parameters alpha1 (first-neighbour shell, 1NN), alpha2
(second-neighbour shell, 2NN) and alpha12 (1NN+2NN. In non-irradiated alloys alpha1 was positive
and alpha2 was negative for all three samples which indicates an ordering of Cr atoms. Yet, the value
of alpha12 were close to zero, i.e. the distribution of Cr atoms averaged over the first two coordination
shells around the probe Fe atoms, was random. The effect of the irradiation of the Fe5Cr sample is
similar for the two energies of the He+ projectiles viz. increase of number of Cr atoms in the 1NN and
decrease in the 2NN shell. Consequently, the degree of the ordering increased. For the other two
samples, the effect of the irradiation depends on the composition, and it is stronger for the less
energetic ions where, in the case of Fe10Cr, the disordering disappeared and some traces of Cr clustering
(alpha12 weakly positive) can be seen. In the Fe15Cr sample the clustering is clear. In the samples
irradiated with 2.0 MeV ions the ordering also survived in the samples with x=10.75 and 15.15, although
its degree became smaller than in the Fe5Cr sample. Small changes in the magnetic texture were revealed.
