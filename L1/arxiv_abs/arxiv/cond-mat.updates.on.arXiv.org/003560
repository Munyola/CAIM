The electron states of gapped pseudospin-1 fermions of the $\alpha-{\cal T}_3$ lattice in the Coulomb
field of a charged impurity are studied. The free $\alpha-{\cal T}_3$ model has three dispersive
bands with two energy gaps between them depending on the parameter $\Theta$ which controls the coupling
of atoms of honeycomb lattice with atoms in the center of each hexagon, thus, interpolating between
graphene $\Theta=0$ and the dice model $\Theta=\pi/4$. The middle band becomes flat one with zero
energy in the dice model. The bound electron states are found in the two cases: the centrally symmetric
potential well and a regularized Coulomb potential of the charged impurity. As the charge of impurity
increases, bound state energy levels descend from the upper and central continua and dive at certain
critical charges into the central and lower continuum, respectively. In the dice model, it is found
that the flat band survives in the presence of a potential well, however, is absent in the case of the
Coulomb potential. The analytical results are presented for the energy levels near continuum boundaries
in the potential well. For the genuine Coulomb potential, we present the recursion relations that
determine the coefficients of the series expansion of wave functions of bound states. It is shown
that the condition for the termination of the series expansion gives two equations relating energy
and charge values. Hence, analytical solutions can exist for a countably infinite set of values
of impurity charge at fixed $\Theta$.
