We review the use of continuum quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods for the calculation of energy gaps
from first principles, and present a broad set of excited-state calculations carried out with the
variational and fixed-node diffusion QMC methods on atoms, molecules, and solids. We propose a
finite-size-error correction scheme for bulk energy gaps calculated in finite cells subject to
periodic boundary conditions. We show that finite-size effects are qualitatively different in
two-dimensional materials, demonstrating the effect in a QMC calculation of the band gap and exciton
binding energy of monolayer phosphorene. We investigate the fixed-node errors in diffusion Monte
Carlo gaps evaluated with Slater-Jastrow trial wave functions by examining the effects of backflow
transformations, and also by considering the formation of restricted multideterminant expansions
for excited-state wave functions. For several molecules, we examine the importance of structural
relaxation in the excited state in determining excited-state energies. We study the feasibility
of using variational Monte Carlo with backflow correlations to obtain accurate excited-state
energies at reduced computational cost, finding that this approach can be valid. We find that diffusion
Monte Carlo gap calculations can be performed with much larger time steps than are typically required
to converge the total energy, at significantly diminished computational expense, but that in order
to alleviate fixed-node errors in calculations on solids the inclusion of backflow correlations
is sometimes necessary.
