We study the spontaneous crystallization of an assembly of highly monodisperse steel spheres under
shaking, as it evolves from localized icosahedral ordering towards a packing reaching crystalline
ordering. Towards this end, real space neutron tomography measurements on the granular assembly
are carried out, as it is systematically subjected to a variation of frequency and amplitude. As
expected, we see a presence of localized icosahedral ordering in the disordered initial state (packing
fraction around 0.62). As the frequency is increased for both the shaking amplitudes (0.2 and 0.6
mm) studied here, there is a rise in packing fraction, accompanied by an evolution to crystallinity.
The extent of crystallinity is found to depend on both the amplitude and frequency of shaking. We
find that the icosahedral ordering remains localized and its extent does not grow significantly,
while the crystalline ordering grows rapidly as an ordering transition point is approached. In
the ordered state, crystalline clusters of both face centered cubic (FCC) and hexagonal close packed
(HCP) types are identified, the latter of which grows from stacking faults. Our study shows that
an earlier domination of FCC gives way to HCP ordering at higher shaking frequencies, suggesting
that despite their coexistence, there is a subtle dynamical competition at play. This competition
depends on both shaking amplitude and frequency, as our results as well as those of earlier theoretical
simulations demonstrate. It is likely that this involves the very small free energy difference
between the two structures.
