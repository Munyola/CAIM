The three dimensional (3D) Dirac semimetal, which has been predicted theoretically, is a new electronic
state of matter. It can be viewed as 3D generalization of graphene, with a unique electronic structure
in which conduction and valence band energies touch each other only at isolated points in momentum
space (i.e. the 3D Dirac points), and thus it cannot be classified either as a metal or a semiconductor.
In contrast to graphene, the Dirac points of such a semimetal are not gapped by the spin-orbit interaction
and the crossing of the linear dispersions is protected by crystal symmetry. In combination with
broken time-reversal or inversion symmetries, 3D Dirac points may result in a variety of topologically
non-trivial phases with unique physical properties. They have, however, escaped detection in
real solids so far. Here we report the direct observation of such an exotic electronic structure
in cadmium arsenide (Cd3As2) by means of angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES).
We identify two momentum regions where electronic states that strongly disperse in all directions
form narrow cone-like structures, and thus prove the existence of the long sought 3D Dirac points.
This electronic structure naturally explains why Cd3As2 has one of the highest known bulk electron
mobilities. This realization of a 3D Dirac semimetal in Cd3As2 not only opens a direct path to a wide
spectrum of applications, but also offers a robust platform for engineering topologically-nontrivial
phases including Weyl semimetals and Quantum Spin Hall systems.
