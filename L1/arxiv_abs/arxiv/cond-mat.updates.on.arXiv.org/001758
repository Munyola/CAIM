A lamellar lepidocrocite-type titanate structure with ~25% $\text{Ti}^{4+}$vacancies was recently
synthesized, and it showed potential for use as an electrode in rechargeable lithium-ion batteries.
In addition to lithium, we explore this material's ability to accommodate other monovalent ions
with greater natural abundance (e.g. sodium and potassium) in order to develop lower-cost alternatives
to lithium-ion batteries constructed from more widely available elements. Galvanostatic discharge/charge
curves for the lepidocrocite material indicate that increasing the ionic radius of the monovalent
ion results in a deteriorating performance of the electrode. Using first-principles electronic
structure calculations, we identify the relaxed geometries of the structure for various positions
of the ion in the structure. We then use these geometries to compute the energy of formations. Additionally,
we determine that all ions are favorable in the structure, but interlayer positions are preferred
compared to vacancy positions. We also conclude that the exchange between the interlayer and vacancy
positions is a process which involves the interaction between interlayer water and surface hydroxyl
groups next to the titanate layer. We observe a cooperative effect between structural water and
$\text{OH}$ groups to assist alkali-ions to move from the interlayer to the vacancy site. Thus,
the as-synthesized lepidocrocite serves as a prototypical structure to investigate both the migration
mechanism of ions within a confined space along with the interaction between water molecules and
the titanate framework.
