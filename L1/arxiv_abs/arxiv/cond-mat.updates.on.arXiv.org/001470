Starting with a simple counting argument, we construct a statistical and thermodynamic model of
free Majorana fermions. Originally defined as a fermion identical to its own antiparticle state,
Majorana particles often appear in the contemporary many-body literature as non-Abelian zero
energy modes in topological superconductors. We deviate from the usual anyonic description and
instead consider a gas of non-interacting, spin-1/2 Majorana fermions as Ettore Majorana first
envisioned them. The existence of a fermionic ground state in such a system is heavily implied by
standard quantum mechanical arguments and current theoretical insights from cold dark matter
physics. This allows us to build a quantum statistical theory of the Majorana system in the low temperature,
low density limit without the need to account for strong fluctuations in the particle number. A combinatorical
analysis of the many-body Majorana ensemble leads to a configurational entropy which deviates
from the fermionic result with an increasing number of available microstates. A Majorana distribution
function is then derived which shows signatures of a sharply-defined Fermi surface at finite temperatures.
The thermodynamics of such a system is shown to be nearly identical to that of a free Fermi gas, except
now distinguished by a two-fold ground state degeneracy and, subsequently, a residual entropy
at zero temperature. Experimental realization of the Majorana thermodynamics is then discussed
in the context of superconductors, topological matter, and dense neutrino gases from supernovae
emissions and relics from the Big Bang.
